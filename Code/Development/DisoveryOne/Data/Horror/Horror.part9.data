              A pleasing land of drowsy head it was,
              of dreams that wave before the half shut eye...










     EXT.  GNARLED FOREST -- NIGHT

     An UGLY MAN charges through on a horse, holding a lantern
     forward on a long pole. He looks back, terrified.

     INSERT TITLE:  1799 Sleepy Hollow, New York

     THUNDEROUS HOOFBEATS are HEARD behind.

     The ugly man glances back again.  His lantern swings wild...
     SHATTERS against a tree.  The jammed-up pole SLAMS the ugly
     man off his horse...

     He hits the ground.  He runs, trips, falls and scrambles up.

     DEEP IN THE FOREST, we glimpse the source of the HOOFBEATS: a
     HUGE FORM on a HUGE BLACK HORSE, already gone.

     The ugly man pushes through thorny bushes.  Jagged branches
     slit his hands and cheeks.

     He bursts from the briar patch and tumbles to a trail.  He
     lifts his bloodied face.  He runs.

     IN THE FOREST BEHIND: the hooves of the black horse rip
     underbrush.  HOOFBEATS DEAFENING.  A spur digs into the
     snorting steed's already bleeding flank.

     The pursuer's gloved hand draws a SWORD, blade RINGING.

     ON THE TRAIL, the ugly man runs on.  The shrill WHISTLE of a
     SWORD SWING is HEARD as the pursuer blurs past.

     The ugly man is still running when his head lolls back, at an
     impossible angle... tumbles off his shoulders... His headless
     body hits the dirt.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS -- NIGHT

     Empty cobblestone streets.  Crooked buildings.  A RAPIDLY
     CLANGING BELL breaks the silence from afar.

     INSERT TITLE:  New York City

     TWO CONSTABLES clamor round a corner, lanterns held high,
     listening.  They rush into an alleyway.

     ELSEWHERE, piers border the Hudson River.  The BELL is
     LOUDER. The two constables arrive, searching.  No one around.
     Constable One hefts his pistol, scared.

                             CONSTABLE ONE
               Where are you?!

                             MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
               Here!  Over here!

     They hurry to the river's edge.  Down a hill, the MAN,
     another constable, stands with his back to us.  He's waist
     deep in water, tossing away his ALARM BELL.

                             MAN
               I need your help with this.

     Constable Two crosses on the peir above.  Constable One moves
     forward, wary.  The MAN grunts, lifting something.

                             CONSTABLE ONE
               Constable Crane?  Ichabod Crane...
               is that you?

     The MAN turns.  Meet ICHABOD CRANE, handsome, eyes piercing.

                             ICHABOD
               Yes, it is me.  But, not only me...
                     (lifting, struggling)
               I found someone here...

     He drags a bloated MALE CORPSE up from the murky water.

                             ICHABOD
               Someone quite dead.


     EXT.  WATCHHOUSE/JAIL -- NIGHT

     The elderly HIGH CONSTABLE lifts a blanket off the corpse on
     a wheelbarrow manned by Constable Two.  A snobby MAGISTRATE
     looks, disgusted.  Constable One and Ichabod wait.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Burn it.

                             CONSTABLE ONE
               Yes, sir.

     Constable Two wheels the corpse inside.  Ichabod's dismayed.

                             ICHABOD
               Just a moment... if I may.  It is
               possible this man was murdered.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               He drowned.  Anyone could see.

                             ICHABOD
               There are surgical ways of telling
               how he died... by the water in his
               lungs...

     Ichabod follows the High Constable and Magistrate in.

     INT.  WATCHHOUSE, NIGHT WATCH QUARTERS -- NIGHT

     Constable Two wheels the body ahead past many "booking"
     tables.  A JAILER moves to unlock a massive door.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               He will be burned pursuant to
               statutes of health.

                             ICHABOD
               I could determine if he were dead
               before he went into the Hudson.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Must we again hear these heretical
               rantings?

                             MAGISTRATE
               Yes, must we?

                             ICHABOD
               There is nothing heretical about
               science, sir.  The Chinese have
               written on it for hundreds of
               years... procedural study used to
               solve seemingly unsolvable crimes.

     The door is opened.  The corpse again leads the way.

     INT.  WATCHHOUSE, JAIL -- NIGHT

     A two-tiered prison, alive with MOANS of AGONY and CRIES of
     INSANITY.  Cells are full of wretched men in chains and iron
     gags.  Many are against the bars, watching.

                             ICHABOD
               Our first night watch is adequate
               against fire and some violence,
               but if we were more often able to
               ensure justice, after the fact,
               then criminals would truly have
               something to fear from law
               enforcement.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Have they nothing to fear presently?

                             ICHABOD
               Without disrespect, look around you.
                     (motioning to cells)
               We overflow.  As do our courts.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               And, with disrespect, Constable,
               if jails and courts overflow, it is
               testimony to success, not failure.

                             ICHABOD
               But, how many innocents rot here?
               And, how many victims are buried
               without reprisal while guilty men
               roam our streets?

     The High Constable reaches a desk, taking a seat.  Guards
     wait to process beaten, bloody prisoners.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Very few, if any.

                             ICHABOD
               Even though I have seen confessions
               pried from the lips of the accused,
               often quite literally?

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               For one who calls himself a
               Federalist, your mouth reeks of
               Republican liberalism.

                             ICHABOD
               Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.

                             MAGISTRATE
                     (to High Constable)
               Um, sir... might I suggest...

     The Magistrate WHISPERS in the High Constable's ear.  Ichabod
     notices with worry that Constables One and Two wheel the
     corpse onwards into another room.

     The Magistrate finishes.  The High Constable smiles faintly.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
                     (to Ichabod)
               There is a farming community
               upstate, Constable... ten days
               journey north in the Hudson
               Highlands.  It is named Sleepy
               Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three
               persons have been murdered there.
               Each with their head lopped cleanly
               off.
                     (holds up papers)
               The elders of the Hollow have sent
               dispatches to me, requesting
               assistance, and now, just this very
               moment, I have chosen you.

                             ICHABOD
               Chosen me?

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               These "methods" of yours... there
               has been no practical application.

                             ICHABOD
               Not for lack of trying.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Just so.  Granted.  And so you take
               your experimentations to Sleepy
               Hollow and catch the murderer who
               has tainted the place.  Bring him
               here to face our good justice.
               Will you do this for me?

                             ICHABOD
                     (swallowing doubt)
               I shall, gladly.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Excellent.  Then, you are excused
               till morning.

     Ichabod moves away, heading to where the corpse was taken.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Oh, and, Constable...
                     (off Ichabod's look)
               Do make certain that you meet with
               success.  Otherwise... perhaps you
               should not come back at all.

     The High Constable smiles a sardonic smile.

     INT.  WATCHHOUSE, INCINERATION ROOM -- NIGHT

     The corpse burns in a raging furnace.  Flesh sizzles.

     Constable One pumps bellows which fan the flames.  Ichabod
     steps from darkness nearby.  He watches with bitter regret as
     the corpse is consumed.


     EXT.  CITY -- DAY

     Market town streets bustle.  Filthy.  Pigs roam free.

     INT.  ICHABOD'S HOME, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY

     Decorated in Early-American Mad Scientist: books, papers and
     jars of chemicals.  Charts of anatomy above a small bed.

                             ICHABOD (o.s.)
               Such a day for such a sad farewell.
               But, this is goodbye, my sweet.

     At the window, Ichabod holds a bird cage with a red CARDINAL
     inside.  He opens the cage.  The bird flies free.

     Ichabod watches it go, then looks down.  A COACH halts in the
     street below.  The forlorn DRIVER looks up.


     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- DAY

     In motion.  Ichabod absently studies his hands, touching the
     strange SCARS on both palms: evenly dispersed, tiny dots of
     tissue.  Many scars.

     Ichabod lifts a LEATHER SATCHEL, checking its contents.

     EXT.  UPSTATE FORESTS -- DAY

     TWO FAMILIES of MIGRANT WORKERS travel a path, leading over-
     burdened horses.  Ichabod's coach approaches from the other
     direction.  Ichabod looks out, unnerved.

     One GAUNT MAN watches Ichabod pass.  There is a dead, worried
     look in the man's eyes.  Others stare at Ichabod.


     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY

     Ichabod faces two massive, vine-covered PILLARS, unsure.  He
     turns to watch the driver lead the coach away.

     Ichabod walks between the pillars to a long straight road.
     He does not notice, above: THREE DEAD RAVENS hang from a tree
     limb, twine wrapped round their necks.

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, TOWN SQUARE -- DAY

     Ichabod walks on with baggage.  The square is empty, a CHURCH
     and GRAVEYARD at one end.  The road ahead is bordered by
     businesses and homes.

     CONVERSATION DRIFTS from a tavern.  A criminal sits in
     stocks.  A quiet CRYING is HEARD.  Ichabod hears...

     He looks for its source.  It's from a window above, LOUDER.
     SOUNDS like the SOBBING of an OLD WOMAN.


     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- DAY

     ICHABOD'S P.O.V.: a BELLTOWER stands tall, like a mast pole
     with a crow's nest basket atop.  There's a man in the basket
     and a huge BELL.

     Ichabod ponders this as he continues.  Ahead on a hill: the
     grand Van Tassel Manor House.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL MANOR HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- DAY

     MANY CHILDREN, in a circle, taunt a BLINDFOLDED YOUNG WOMAN
     spun round by the handsome, barrel-chested man, BROM VAN
     BRUNT.  A few YOUNG MEN and LADIES watch.  Brom releases the
     woman.  Everyone quiets and avoids her searching hands.

                             BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
               This is such a silly game.

                             BROM
               Be a sport and stop complaining.

     The woman moves to Brom's voice.  He backs away, flanked by
     peers GLENN and THEODORE.  Children laugh.

     Ichabod enters, clearing his throat.  No one notices.  The
     blindfolded woman keeps grasping.  One LITTLE GIRL sees
     Ichabod and goes to him, finger to her lips.

                             LITTLE GIRL
               Play along.  You must.

     She tugs him.  Before Ichabod can protest, he is placed in
     the blindfolded woman's grip.

                             BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
               There, I have someone.  Am I
               finished?

                             LITTLE GIRL
               You have to tell who it is.

     The woman touches Ichabod's face.  He is uncomfortable,
     affected by this caress.  Brom watches jealously.

                             LITTLE GIRL
               At least make a guess.

                             BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
               I don't know.  Is it Brom Bones?

                             BROM
               Certainly not.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me, Miss...
                     (takes her hands)
               They have a laugh at your expense.

     She takes the kerchief off to reveal a stunning beauty:
     KATRINA VAN TASSEL.  Ichabod tries to compose himself.

                             KATRINA
               Forgive me, I didn't know.

                             ICHABOD
               I... I am looking for Baltus Van
               Tassel.

                             BROM
               We haven't heard your name yet,
               friend.

                             ICHABOD
               Well, unless your name is Baltus,
               you should not worry over mine.

     Brom grabs Ichabod's collar, pissed.  Ichabod's baffled.

                             BROM
               You need some manners.

                             KATRINA
               Brom!

     Brom looks at her, then reluctantly releases Ichabod.

                             MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
               What is this, then... ?

     BALTUS VAN TASSEL, 45, has entered, a working-class
     aristocrat.  LADY VAN TASSEL, 40, stands behind, a mix of
     home-spun wife and well-kept lady.

                             BALTUS
               Can I help you, sir?

     Ichabod's relieved to have a proper focal point.  Children
     gather around Katrina and hide behind her.

                             ICHABOD
               I have been sent from the city
               with a letter of introduction.
               I am told you offer me room and
               board.

     Ichabod hands over papers.  Baltus reads, furrows his brow.

                             ICHABOD
               If we could speak alone.

                             BALTUS
                     (nods, looks to Katrina)
               This is not a time for frivolity,
               Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?

                             KATRINA
               They're only children, father.

     Baltus snorts, then exits with Ichabod.  The others huddle to
     gossip, except Katrina, who moves beside Lady Van Tassel to
     watch Ichabod and Baltus walk down the hall.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- DAY

     DOCTOR LANCASTER, 50, dour and always sweaty, takes a seat by
     the fire, joining Baltus and three other elders.  A pretty
     servant, SARAH, brings a pipe cradle while Lady Van Tassel
     sets down food.  Ichabod is standing.

                             BALTUS
               That will be all, ladies.
                     (waits as they exit)
               We are joined by Doctor Thomas
               Lancaster, Constable.  And to his
               left are, Clergyman Steenwyck and
               our able magistrate, Samuel Philipse,
               both keeping order in their own ways.

     PHILIPSE is youngest, eyes bloodshot, mug in hand and pipe in
     mouth.  CLERGYMAN STEENWYCK is formidably built, wearing a
     constant look of disapproval.

                             BALTUS
               I myself am in charge of financial
               matters and the regulation of
               currency in our commonwealth.  And,
               lastly, this fine fellow is James
               Hardenbrook, our Notary.

     HARDENBROOK is oldest, ancient, with one eye pale and blind.

                             ICHABOD
               An honor, gentlemen.  In time I
               will need every detail of the
               three murderings you've had, but,
               for now, I ask only if you have
               any theory at all as to who the
               killer might be?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               Excuse me?

                             ICHABOD
               I say, is there any one person
               suspect in these acts?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               I was afraid of this.

     Philipse shoots a look to Baltus.  Angst amongst the elders.

                             PHILIPSE
               Well, Constable... are you aware...
               to be honest, you are not what we
               expected.  We sent for the militia.

                             ICHABOD
               The militia?

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               Why not tell us what you have heard?
               Hmm?  How much have your superiors
               bothered to tell you?

                             ICHABOD
               All I know is three are slain, their
               heads found severed from their
               bodies...

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               The heads were not found severed.
               The heads were not found at all.

     Withered Hardenbrook leans forward, his voice cragged.

                             HARDENBROOK
               Taken.  Taken by the Headless
               Horseman.  Taken back to hell.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon me?

                             BALTUS
               You have not been well informed of
               our troubles, sir.  If you would...

     Baltus gestures for Ichabod to sit.  Baltus lights his pipe.

                             BALTUS
               The Horseman... he was a Hessian
               mercenary, sent to our shores by
               German princes to help keep
               Americans under the thumb of
               England.  However, unlike his
               compatriots who came as muscle in
               trade for currency, he came
               willingly.  For love of carnage.

     FLASHBACK -- AMERICAN BATTLEFIELD -- DAY

     The HESSIAN HORSEMAN rides his black steed into a gory,
     close-quarters clash, his cloaked uniform adorned with edged
     weapons.  He cuts down Americans left and right.

                             BALTUS (v.o.)
               He was infamous for taking his
               horse, Daredevil, hard into
               battle... chopping off heads at
               full gallop.

     He dismounts, hoisting a battle axe.  With sword and axe, he
     annihilates.  Blood gushes.  Bones crack.

                             BALTUS (v.o.)
               Just to look on him made your
               blood run cold, for he had filed
               down his teeth to rapiers... to
               add to the ferocity of his
               appearance.

     The Horseman lets out a war cry.  Jagged teeth.  Grotesque.

     FOREST BATTLEFIELD -- DAY

     Winter.  CANNONS can be HEARD BOOMING from afar.  Daredevil
     lies dead in red snow.  FOLLOW FOOTPRINTS away...

                             BALTUS (v.o.)
               He would not finally meet his end
               till the winter of seventy-nine,
               when New York City was held by
               Henry Clinton and Washington
               occupied West Point.  It was
               between those two places, not far
               from here...

     The Horseman flees, cloak flowing, chased by FIVE rag-tag
     REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS.  Ahead, a steep, rocky area prevents
     escape.  Soldier one aims a rifle and FIRES...

     Blood explodes from the Horseman's arm as he runs.  His sword
     falls from his now functionless hand.

     Soldier Two grabs the sword.

     At the rocks, the Horseman faces the men.  Another Rifleman
     raises his rifle.  The Horseman reaches over his shoulder to
     grasp a sheathed knife, THROWS --

     THOCK!  The Rifleman jerks back, knife in his eye socket.

     The Horseman readies an axe.  The Revolutionaries move in
     with swords.  They battle, STEEL AGAINST STEEL.  The Horseman
     fends off blows from all sides.

     Soldier Three lunges, stabs his blade deep into the
     Horseman's side.  The Horseman roars, brings his axe DOWN...
     BREAKS the sword at the hilt...

     An UPWARDS stroke sends Soldier Three head over heels in a
     fountain of blood.

     The Horseman staggers, howling, trying to pull the blade from
     his ribs.  The remaining soldiers close in.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Pipe smoke wafts from Philipse's mouth.

                             PHILIPSE
               Cut off his head with his own sword.
               It's a legend told for twenty years.

                             BALTUS
               But, only recently has the Headless
               Hessian been seen prowling the
               Hollow, in search of a head to suit
               his shoulders.

                             ICHABOD
               Just a moment...
                     (sits back, incredulous)
               Are you saying it is he?

                             HARDENBROOK
                     (aggravated, loud)
               When a goblin leaps from the nether
               world, others follow.  Poltergeists
               of the air, water and earth follow
               and cheer his desecrations!

     Hardenbrook BANGS his cane on a table.  Baltus puts a calming
     hand on senile Hardenbrook's shoulder.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               No one knows why he chose to now to
               climb out from his grave.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               It is very clear why.  Citizens
               here have long tried to hide sins
               behind closed doors.  Their failed
               faith has saturated the soil and
               called forth one of Satan's own.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who
               has seen this Horseman?

                             BALTUS
               Many have.

                             ICHABOD
               Then, name one person who has seen
               him with their own eyes.

     A long wait.  No reply from the elders.  Ichabod rises.

                             ICHABOD
               While I will do everything I can
               to find your assassin, I will look
               for a man of flesh and blood.  Not
               some goblin-demon from hell.


     EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- EARLY EVENING

     The Belltower is covered in defensive spikes.  A man climbs
     down a rope ladder.  Below, many ARMED MEN gather.  Everyone
     grim.  Philipse moves to the center, on horseback.

                             PHILIPSE
               Gather round!  Gather and quiet!
               The hour has come to choose for
               this night.  Each man's name is
               in this box and has been checked.

     A box is handed up.  Ichabod and Baltus arrive on foot at the
     back of the mob.  Ichabod looks...

     At a nearby forest, men light TORCH POSTS in a line bordering
     the forest edge for at least a half mile.

     Philipse draws a folded paper from the box, holds it up.

                             PHILIPSE
               May the Lord watch over him...
                     (unfolds paper)
               "Jonathan Masbath."  Are you here?

                             JONATHAN (o.s.)
               I am.  I take my responsibility.

     The crowd parts as JONATHAN MASBATH, a dirt-poor farmer with
     a bow and quiver of arrows, moves forward.  His son, YOUNG
     MASBATH, 14, grips his arm.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               No, father.  Wait...
                     (up to Philipse)
               He's already been up once.  Why
               does he go again?

                             JONATHAN
               It is a lottery, son.  It just as
               easily might have been one of them.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Then... I go with you.

                             JONATHAN
               No.  You obey my wishes.
                     (looks to crowd)
               Brom.  Look after him, will you?

     Brom steps up, nodding.  Jonathan kisses his son's cheek,
     then heads to the rope ladder.  Men pat him on the back.

                             PHILIPSE
               Someone leave him a horse.

     Young Masbath watches his father go.  Brom coaxes him away.
     At the back of the crowd, Ichabod watches skeptically, looks
     to Young Masbath as he and Brom pass.

                             ICHABOD
               You worry for naught, little man.
               Nothing will harm him there.
                     (looks up, sotto)
               It is problems here on the ground
               you people need begin to worry
               about.

     Ichabod watches Jonathan climb, very high above.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod makes notations in a LEDGER BOOK.

                             KATRINA (v.o.)
               You will dream.

     Katrina strolls in, sits on the bed.  Ichabod is nervous.

                             KATRINA
               Did they tell?  It is something in
               the air so that dreams come to
               everyone.  According to the elders,
               an Indian prophet held powwows here
               before the land was taken, and
               spells cast then still linger to
               this day.

                             ICHABOD
               Do you often make a habit of
               sitting on strange men's beds?

                             KATRINA
               You are horribly old-fashioned,
               aren't you?

                             ICHABOD
               Feel free to form your own opinion.
                     (facing his ledger)
               Though it appears you already have.

                             KATRINA
               Well, I intended to apologize for
               the behavior of my friend Brom Van
               Brunt, but it seems I've made
               matters worse.
                     (getting up to go)
               I'll leave you to your business.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me... I should apologize.  I,
               um... I... have no great love of...

                             KATRINA
               Other people?

                             ICHABOD
               Small talk.

                             KATRINA
               It might have been more.  Might have
               been positively grand talk.

     Ichabod offers his chair, backing away.  Seeing it is the
     only one, he remains standing.  Katrina sits.

                             KATRINA
               Is it me, or are you this nervous
               around all women?

                             ICHABOD
               Perhaps it is because your suitor's
               hands were recently very nearly
               wrapped around my throat.

                             KATRINA
               My suitor?

                             ICHABOD
               The massive fellow... Brom.  For
               someone you call "friend," he
               misplaces a good portion of jealousy.

                             KATRINA
               He has proposed to me twice.

                             ICHABOD
               Which may explain his temperament.
               To have asked twice means the answer
               was "no" at least once.

     Katrina looks down, discards this with a smile.

                             KATRINA
               I've read a great deal about your
               New York City.  Do be a dear and tell
               me all about it.  Sounds like an
               extraordinary place to live a life.

                             ICHABOD
               Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you
               tell me about the Headless Horseman.


     EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT

     The torches burn bright.  ABOVE, in the Belltower, Jonathan
     Masbath loads a rifle.  THUNDER BOOMS.

     Jonathan stands, looking to a sky that is all stars and moon.
     A HORSE is HEARD SHRIEKING.  Below, the horse tied at the
     base of the tower is spooked.

     A COMMOTION is HEARD, ground rumbling.  Jonathan grips a
     rifle, cocks it and moves to look...

     At the forest edge, a herd of deer stampedes out.  They
     sprint past the tower and across the field.

     Jonathan crosses to watch the herd scatter.  He crosses back
     to peer at the forest.  Bad news...

     A thick FOG creeps from the woods.

     As the fog overtakes the base of each torch, a tentacle of
     mist snakes up to the flame, killing it.  All along the
     forest, arms of vapor snuff torches... one by one by one...

     Above, Jonathan sights the rifle along the trees.

                             JONATHAN
               Come out, devil... come....


     INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod leans on a dresser.  Katrina's still seated.

                             KATRINA
               Not all think it is the Horseman.
               Many say witches come from the
               Western Woods to steal skulls for
               their cauldrons.  Some believe a
               person in this very town kneels
               before Lucifer, offering death as
               tribute.  And, still others believe
               none of it.

                             ICHABOD
               Are you so superstitious?

                             KATRINA
               To call a person superstitious is to
               imply they fear magic, but not all
               magic is black.

                             ICHABOD
               There is no such thing as magic.

                             KATRINA
               Really?  Then... what is your
               rebuttal to those romantic poets
               claiming proof of magic in a rose at
               full bloom, or even in a teardrop?

                             ICHABOD
               Poets have silly notions about
               plants and bodily secretions.

                             KATRINA
                     (laughs)
               You are funny.

     Ichabod doesn't get what's so funny about that.  The DISTANT
     TOLL of a BELL is HEARD.  Katrina looks fearful.

     She goes to open a window.  The BELL TOLLS...

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, OVERVIEW -- NIGHT

     ... TOLLS mournfully over farms and forests...

     EXT.  FARM -- NIGHT

     ... TOLLS as a MAN comes from his barn, listening, then
     sprinting towards his home.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

     ... TOLLS across the deserted square.  Windows go dark.
     Shutters are slammed shut.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     ... TOLLS.  Ichabod bounds out to the lawn, halting to
     listen.  Katrina and Baltus come out on the porch.

                             BALTUS
               Constable, where are you going!?

     ... TOLLS... TOLLS... then, SILENCE.  Ichabod chases away.

                             BALTUS
               Come back, sir...
                     (watches him go)
               Madness.

     Baltus ushers Katrina back in.  The door slams.


     EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod charges across the rocky field.  He slows, awed...

     The Belltower is down, its mast is splintered.  The horse is
     gone.  Ichabod moves to where the crow's nest lies smashed.
     No sign of Jonathan.

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FOREST -- NIGHT

     Jonathan runs past, gripping his bow.  It's QUIET... till
     HOOFBEATS are HEARD in pursuit.

     Trees are silhouetted against the sky.  As HOOFBEATS get
     LOUDER, branches bend like arms and fingers yearning to
     touch.  As HOOFBEATS ROAR PAST, the trees relax.

     FURTHER ON, Jonathan runs.  WIND begins to BLOW.

     BEHIND, in motion, WE SEE Daredevil's snorting visage; eyes
     lizard-like, with vertical slits literally aglow.

     The Horseman's hand yanks a wooden WAR HAMMER from a saddle
     mount.  (No clear view of the Horseman.)

     HORSEMAN'S P.O.V.: closing in on Jonathan.

     Jonathan is overtaken.  The Horseman swings the hammer WHOOMP
     -- sends Jonathan sprawling.

     HOOFBEATS FADE.  Jonathan tries to get up, but pain shoots
     through him.  He crawls to retrieve his bow.

     Against a tree, he takes an arrow from his shoulder quiver
     and readies it.  Waiting.  A metal TAPPING is HEARD O.S.
     CLINK... CLINK... CLINK.  A HORSE SNORTS.

     Jonathan pulls the bow taut, pained, lips bloody.

     Elsewhere, Daredevil approaches slow.  The Horseman taps his
     sword on his spur, CLINK... CLINK... CLINK...

     Foliage moves as the Horseman's form pushes through.

     Jonathan releases -- the arrow WHISTLES...

     THWACK! -- imbeds in the Horseman's chest.

     CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... continues -- Jonathan readies a
     second arrow.  Pulls and releases -- O.S. THWACK!

     CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan cries out, crawling away
     desperately.  Crawling through underbrush, over roots and
     rocks.  CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan gives up, spent,
     face to the dirt.  He closes his eyes.

     CLINKING STOPS.  Daredevil halts astride Jonathan; two legs
     on each side of Jonathan's body.


     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FARMLAND -- MORNING

     Baltus and a large, DULLARDLY MAN ride.  Behind, Ichabod
     rides with Magistrate Philipse.

     Ichabod is not adept at riding his old nag, Gunpowder.

                             ICHABOD
               The Van Garretts died first; a man
               and his son, survived by a wife and
               two infants.  And the Widow Windsor
               was next...

                             PHILIPSE
               And now Jonathan Masbath.

                             ICHABOD
                     (looks back, ponders)
               Why would he flee this direction,
               with so much open ground to cross
               before he reached cover?

                             PHILIPSE
               He would not have gone into the
               Western Woods.  No sane man would.

     Philipse drinks from a whiskey flask, sees Ichabod watching
     and offers some.  Ichabod declines.

                             PHILIPSE
               Van Ripper there...

     Ahead, the dullard, VAN RIPPER, sloppily spits tobacco.

                             PHILIPSE
               ... found the body this morning.
                     (pause) 
               You do believe now, don't you?

                             ICHABOD 
               Believe?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               You said yourself.  What mere man
               could have downed the Belltower?

                             ICHABOD 
               It is a prime tenet of science,
               Philipse, that because one thing
               appears improbable does not mean
               you embrace the utterly fantastical.

                             PHILIPSE 
               You need less big words, and more
               common sense.

     Philipse fingers an IRON KEY talisman he wears on a cord.

                             ICHABOD 
               What is that you wear?

                             PHILIPSE 
               My talisman.  It will, protect
               against the Horseman if I show a
               brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If
               I run in fear, it is worthless.

                             ICHABOD 
               Well... so much for common sense.


     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS, FURTHER ON -- MORNING

     Brom and Baltus stand at a HORSE'S CORPSE amongst jagged
     boulders.  The flesh has been stripped, guts exposed.
     Philipse and Ichabod arrive and dismount.

                             BALTUS 
               Was this Jonathan's?

                             BROM 
               Yes.  Seems he panicked across here
               and broke two legs.

                             ICHABOD 
               Who took the meat?

                             BALTUS 
               Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape
               Indian lives in the Western Woods.

                             ICHABOD 
               These woods of yours sound a bit
               crowded, what with all the witches,
               ghouls and Indians living there.

     Brom climbs up onto his own horse, a black beauty.

                             BROM 
               There's only one Lenape.  He eats
               small animals and lost children...
               and the occasional constable when he
               can get it.

     Brom rides.  Ichabod goes to the dead horse, digs in his
     satchel for a thin iron tool, which he uses it to pry off one
     HORSESHOE.  A WHISTLE is HEARD O.S.

     Everyone looks far ahead to where Van Ripper has ridden.  The
     doctor and others are there.  Van Ripper waves.


     INT. FOREST, MASBATH MURDER SITE -- MORNING

     Doctor Lancaster stands with SEVERAL ARMED MEN.  A coffin on
     a cart is covered by a blanket. Ichabod is crouched nearby.

                             ICHABOD 
               Why did you move the body, Doctor?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               To place it inside its coffin.

     Ichabod, nods, vaguely annoyed.  He puts the horseshoe into a
     hoofprint in the dirt.  It fits.

     Ichabod rises, walks, studying the ground, kicking up leaves.
     Brom, Van Ripper, Baltus and Philipse watch.

     Ichabod finds a deep hoofprint.  Huge.  He compares the
     horseshoe.  The hoofprint is much larger.

     Ichabod pulls his satchel off his shoulder, takes out a bowl,
     bottle of water and bag of brown powder; begins mixing water
     and powder with a fork to make plaster.

     The others watch, finding this bizarre, whispering.  Brom
     comes up to stand over Ichabod, irritated.

                             BROM 
               What the hell are you doing?

                             ICHABOD
                     (ignoring pause) 
               You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod
               a horse with a hoof this large?

                             BROM 
               Never.  A shoe that size I would
               have remembered.

     Ichabod starts to fill the print with plaster.

                             ICHABOD 
               Van Ripper.  Can you show where the
               body lay?

                             VAN RIPPER 
               I can show exactly.

     Van Ripper dismounts, wiping tobacco drool.  Ichabod rises to
     follow with his satchel.

                             VAN RIPPER 
               Here... in front of this oak, facing
               north.  Horrible...

                             ICHABOD 
               To the best of your recollection,
               where did the open wound fall?

     Van Ripper points.  Ichabod takes a BOTTLE of WHITE POWDER
     from his pocket.

     He uncorks the bottle, cautiously pouring powder in an x on
     the dirt there, then waiting.

     A chemical reaction causes the powder to bubble a bit.

                             ICHABOD 
               There was not much blood, was there?

                             VAN RIPPER 
               I didn't see none.

     Ichabod stands, puzzled.  He walks to the coffin cart,
     rolling up his sleeves.  Others come to watch, but keep
     distance.  Ichabod removes the blanket...

     Reveals Jonathan's headless corpse.

     Philipse can't look.  Ichabod takes strange spectacles from
     his satchel; wire-framed with many lenses.  MAGNIFICATION
     SPECTACLES.  He examines the gross neck wound, sniffs it.

     He pokes the flesh and severed spinal cord.

                             ICHABOD 
               No bleeding.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               What is that?

                             ICHABOD 
               This should have bled by the pint.
               Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh.
               How... ?  Whatever weapon was used...
               it cauterized somehow....

     Ichabod straightens, eyes weirdly big in the spectacles.

                             ICHABOD 
               It instantly burnt the wound shut.


     EXT.  CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAY

     A coffin in a grave.  Headstone reads "MASBATH, 1799."  A
     CROWD gathered.  Young Masbath broods.  Clergyman Steenwyck
     steps forward to take a handful of newly dug dirt.

     Men with guns stand at the outskirts, like on guard.

     Steenwyck sprinkles dirt into the grave with prayerful words.
     In the crowd people whisper.  They steal glances at Ichabod,
     who stands with the Van Tassels.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING/VARIOUS ROOMS -- DAY

     Dining room.  Sarah and two other servants collect plates.  A
     few people still sup, including Van Ripper, his warty WIFE
     and two kids.  Van Ripper guzzles ale, laughs at something
     his also-drunk wife says.

     IN the HALL and FOYER, funeral goers socialize quietly.

     FURTHER ON, in the SITTING ROOM, men smoke.  Young Masbath
     is confronting Ichabod, who is leaving...

                             ICHABOD 
               I am not here for revenge.  I am
               here to bring justice.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Whatever.  You still need a second
               to tend to your things.

                             ICHABOD 
               I manage fine alone.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               I deserve to help you.  Don't you see
               how much this means?  My father...
               he... he was a good man...

                             ICHABOD
                     (faces Masbath) 
               Young Masbath, I am sorry for your
               loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy.
               However... I cannot be the one to
               look after you now.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
                     (angry) 
               I did not ask you to, did I?

     Young Masbath exits.  Ichabod remains impassive.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- DAY

     Ichabod comes out.  KILLIAN, a dashingly rustic man, carries
     his son, THOMAS, 5, and chats with Baltus.  Doctor Lancaster
     peers off at something through a SPYGLASS.

                             BALTUS 
               Hail, Constable.  How are you?

                             ICHABOD 
               Well enough.  Your gathering does
               honor to the deceased.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
                     (still using spyglass) 
               We must be a curious sight to him.

                             ICHABOD 
               What are you spying on?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
                     (offers the spyglass)
               The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at
               civilization from time to time.

     ICHABOD'S POINT OF VIEW -- THROUGH SPYGLASS

     Searching a line of trees and foliage far away...

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER (o.s.)
               Do you see the Redskinned bastard?

     There he is -- the LENAPE.  A towering savage with misshapen
     features covered in tumors.  He ducks away.

     BACK TO SCENE ON PORCH

     Ichabod lowers the spyglass, a little awed.

                             ICHABOD 
               He is a behemoth.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               A diseased monster.

                             BALTUS 
               If you gentlemen will excuse the
               doctor and I... we have financial
               matters to discuss.

     Ichabod and Killian nod as Baltus and Lancaster head in.

                             KILLIAN 
               Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have
               time alone.  You've been told plenty
               about the Horseman, I'm certain.

                             ICHABOD 
               More than enough, actually. 
                     (tired laugh) 
               I beg you, no more, please.

                             KILLIAN 
               No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say
               you just laid eyes on our murderer
               through that glass.

     Ichabod ponders, folding the spyglass.

                             ICHABOD 
               Tell me something. 
                     (pause) 
               What becomes of Young Masbath?

                             KILLIAN 
               Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take
               him.  They have children and a good
               home and good land.

     Ichabod nods.  He turns to look THROUGH THE WINDOW.  In the
     DINING ROOM, Van Ripper rises, ill.  His wife questions his
     health, but he holds her off and vomits.

     Ichabod notes this with a deep sigh.


     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ORCHARD -- EARLY EVENING

     Ocher dusk.  Ichabod rides to Young Masbath, seated on the
     ground, miserable.  Young Masbath does not look up.

                             ICHABOD 
               Find yourself a place in the servants'
               residence and wake me before dawn.
               Our first task will be an unsavory one.

     Ichabod rides.  Young Masbath runs to his horse and follows.


     EXT. CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAWN

     Steenwyck is on horseback, looking down at Ichabod, furious.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               It is sacrilege!

                             ICHABOD 
               I cannot proceed without examining
               the previous victims.

     Steenwyck looks to men with shovels.  Killian's there.
     Philipse, hung-over, stands beside Young Masbath.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               Magistrate Philipse, surely you can
               stop this.

     Philipse just looks up with a helpless expression.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               I will not allow it.  I will not!

                             ICHABOD 
               Protest to my superiors if you like.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               Your superiors are two days away!

                             ICHABOD 
               Then, you should have left two days
               ago, because I have men willing to
               help me today.

     Ichabod motions.  Killian leads the men to the graveyard.
     Steenwyck watches, enraged.  He kicks his horse and rides.
     Philipse looks worried.

     EXT.  CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- LATER MORNING (TIME CUT)

     A PSALM is HEARD READ by STEENWYCK O.S. while a coffin is
     exhumed.  Ichabod guides the lifting.  The coffin is put near
     the headstone "WINDSOR."  Ichabod looks...

     At the church, Steenwyck faces about fifty people who now
     take up the PRAYER.

     Across the cemetery, two coffins, one small, one large, are
     pried open.  "VAN GARRETT, 1799."  Killian leads the effort
     with Young Masbath's aid...

     The lids come off, revealing the HEADLESS BODIES of a MAN and
     a little BOY.  Young Masbath backs away.

     At the "WINDSOR" coffin, nails creak as Ichabod opens the
     lid.  WE DO NOT SEE inside, but when Ichabod does, he is
     aghast.  He looks to the men, angry.

                             ICHABOD
               Why was I not told of this?

     No answer.  Killian arrives, nods solemnly.

                             KILLIAN 
               The Widow Windsor.

                             ICHABOD 
               Is that all you say?  Look at her.

                             KILLIAN 
               It's not something people speak of
               openly.  She did not remarry.

     Ichabod kneels, studying.  Now, WE SEE: the belly of the
     headless corpse is bulbous, because the Widow Windsor was
     very far along in a pregnancy.

     Ichabod notices: a tear in the cloth of widow's blouse.  He
     reaches through the tear, feeling the stomach.

     He straightens, greatly troubled.


     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- MORNING

     Scissors cut open the widow's blouse.  There's an inch-long
     WOUND on the moldering belly; a sword puncture.

     Ichabod examines the corpse on a table.  Lancaster watches,
     anxiously mopping his face.  Young Masbath's in a corner.
     Ichabod goes to write in his ledger full of notes.

                             ICHABOD 
               What is the common thread between
               these victims?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               I'm sure I don't know.

                             ICHABOD 
               We must discover it.  The reason the
               murderer chose these persons.

     Ichabod goes to look at the widow's corpse, pondering.

                             ICHABOD 
               The wounds are the same.  Cauterized.
               No chopping or half-measures either.
               One stroke took the head.  Have you
               seen, doctor... ?
                     (pointing to it) 
               Even the spinal bone... sliced as
               smooth as butter.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               I do not care.  You are welcome to
               use my work area, but I beg you...
               return her to her resting place.

                             ICHABOD 
               In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.

     Ichabod picks up an iron knife.  He looks to Young Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               You should step outside.


     EXT.  CHURCHYARD CEMETERY -- EARLY EVENING

     Ichabod and others restore graves.  Ichabod looks to the
     church, where Clergyman Steenwyck stands in the door.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane.
               The Lord will not forgive your sins.

     Steenwyck shuts the creaky doors.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod sleeps, dreaming...

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FARMLAND -- DAY

     A young BOY, 10, stands in a wheat field with his back to us.
     A FEMALE VOICE is HEARD FAINTLY, getting LOUDER.

                             FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
               Ichabod!  Ichabod... come along.

     The boy, YOUNG ICHABOD, turns, smiling.  He runs.  We FOLLOW
     to a clearing behind a frontier home.  MOTHER waits.  Lovely
     woman.  She kisses him.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Dark.  Young Ichabod, in bed, has one eye open.  Across the
     room, Mother has her back to him.  She's WHISPERING something
     to no one.  She turns...

     Young Ichabod pretends he is asleep.

     A DRAWER is HEARD SHUTTING.  Mother exits.  Ichabod gets up,
     curious, opens a drawer... finds something behind clothing.

     It's a piece of reed grass, woven into an elaborate pattern
     with shafts of wheat twisted into the center.  Young Ichabod
     replaces it, closes the drawer.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- MARKET SQUARE -- DAY

     A busy, muddy street lined by wares and produce.  Young
     Ichabod walks with FATHER, an emotionless man.  Father stops
     to examine tools.  Young Ichabod stays by him, but something
     captures his attention...

     Across the way, Mother is involved in a argument with a
     FREAKISH-LOOKING WOMAN.  They shout.  People stop to watch.
     Can't make out words, but Freakish Woman is furious.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- STORM SKY -- NIGHT

     LIGHTNING flashes over tree tops.  THUNDER BOOMS.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod jerks awake in his bed.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Ichabod enters with a lantern and his ledger.  He sits,
     studies notes, then notices there's a light down the hall.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Opposite an elaborate loom, Katrina reads by candlelight.
     She looks up, seeing Ichabod enter.

                             ICHABOD 
               Sorry for disturbing you.  I thought
               a forgotten candle was burning.

     Katrina self-consciously closes her shabby book, puts it with
     another on her lap and covers them.

                             KATRINA 
               You do not disturb me.  Please stay.
               Having trouble sleeping?

                             ICHABOD 
               May I ask... why do you cover your
               book that way?

                             KATRINA 
               You pay great attention to small
               things.  I hide these as I hide all
               my books.  Father would not approve,
               lest it were the Bible.

                             ICHABOD 
               I, um... I have something to show you,
               if you have a moment.

     Ichabod sits, looking through his ledger.

                             KATRINA
               These are strange... may I?

     She takes his hand, spreads the fingers to the palm.  She
     touches the many evenly spaced scars.

                             KATRINA 
               These scars.  How did you get them?

                             ICHABOD 
               I have had them since childhood.  I
               cannot remember what from.

                             KATRINA 
               It would be interesting to find out.

     Their eyes meet.  Ichabod gets back to the ledger.  Katrina
     seems to relish the effect she has.  Ichabod finds a paper
     disk on string, illustrated thusly:

                             ICHABOD 
               Here it is.  A bird on one side.
               His cage on the other.  Now,
               stare at it. 
                     (spinning it) 
               The bird seems to be in his cage.

                             KATRINA 
               Yes, he does.  May I try?

     Ichabod gives it.  She spins it, smiling.

                             ICHABOD 
               He only appears to be inside the
               cage.  The point being...

                             KATRINA
               You made this, and the drawings?

                             ICHABOD 
               Yes, but listen.  The illusion is
               easily explained.  The eye retains
               each image, till they combine.  And
               yet, some would call this toy magic.

                             KATRINA 
               Don't you see why?  Look closely a
               moment.  Put your intellect aside. 
                     (spinning it) 
               Can't you see what is inexplicable?

     Ichabod watches it spin.  He shakes his head, unimpressed.

                             KATRINA 
               Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep
               it at least?

                             ICHABOD
               If you want.  But...

                             KATRINA 
               Then, I also have a gift for you.
               True magic which even you will not
               be able to deny.

     She hands him a book.  "ROMEO AND JULIET."  Ichabod stands,
     offering it back, but she will not take it.

                             ICHABOD 
               Thank you.  No.  Here...

                             KATRINA 
               I insist that you have it.

                             ICHABOD
                     (resigned, leaving) 
               Very well.  But, it will only sit
               gathering dust.

                             KATRINA 
               That would be a pity.  Those words
               might show you something you've never
               seen before.

     Ichabod stops at the door, looks back.  He exits.


     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     A light glows in Ichabod's window.  LOOKING IN: Ichabod's in
     bed, fully dressed.  He sits up.  Pause.  He crosses to pick
     up "Romeo and Juliet."  He begins to read.


     EXT.  PHILIPSE'S FARM -- DUSK

     Ichabod walks with Philipse.  Young Masbath follows with the
     horses.  CICADAS CHATTER from a vast corn field.

                             PHILIPSE 
               Not more than a year ago, a mob hung
               a man for stealing a horse.  For
               stealing a horse!  And, you dig up
               our dead.

                             ICHABOD 
               Are you saying I should be frightened?
               Is this a message passed on from
               Clergyman Steenwyck?

     The CICADAS SUDDENLY go SILENT.  Young Masbath notices.

                             PHILIPSE 
               We are farmers here, not lawyers or
               bankers, or even constables.  Every
               penny we earn comes from what we
               send down the Hudson.

                             ICHABOD 
               I know it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Um.... excuse me, sirs...

                             PHILIPSE
                     (still to Ichabod) 
               Because of the Horseman, our migrant
               workers flee for their lives.  There
               is a danger that our crops will rot.
               So, if you are going to help us, you
               stop the Horseman.  That is your
               task... to kill an undead thing.

     Young Masbath looks to a fenced grazing area, worried.  The
     sheep there are agitated, all running one direction away.

                             ICHABOD
               Listen to what you say....

                             PHILIPSE 
               No, you listen!  You may think we are
               a pack of superstitious dullards...

                             ICHABOD 
               At times I do.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Sirs... please!

                             PHILIPSE 
               What will it take for you to realize
               this is no laughing matter?

     The horses go crazy, braying and rearing.  The reins yank
     Young Masbath off his feet as the horses flee.

     Ichabod and Philipse look to Masbath.  A SOUND is HEARD,
     distant: THUNDERING HOOFBEATS.  Wind kicks up.  HOOFBEATS
     seem to come FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.

     Philipse looks to the corn field.  A flock of birds alights;
     a great sheet of black against the sky.

                             PHILIPSE
               Oh my... oh my oh my oh my...

     Philipse runs towards his house, past Masbath.  HOOFBEATS are
     LOUDER, CLOSER.  Ichabod faces the corn field.

     The field explodes open, stalks bending to make way as the
     Headless Horseman gallops into view atop Daredevil.

     Young Masbath runs, following Philipse.

     Ichabod's stunned.  He looks down to draw his flintlock
     pistol, but the Horseman blows by before he can raise it.  A
     blast of air knocks Ichabod off his feet.

     The Horseman chases Masbath and Philipse.

     Ichabod follows.

     The Horseman draws his sword.

     Young Masbath falls in the grass...

     Daredevil's pounding hooves will certainly crush him.

     Daredevil leaps over Young Masbath, continuing the charge.

     Philipse has a long way to go before home.  He looks over his
     shoulder.  No way he'll make it.

     Ichabod, running, watches Philipse slow.

     Philipse gathers all his courage and stops, turning.  The
     Horseman is closing, sword held high.

     Philipse raises his talisman.

                             ICHABOD 
               Philipse!

     Philipse holds the talisman up, trying to be fearless.  The
     Horseman swings -- WE HEAR the CLANK of sword on talisman...

     Philipse's severed head spins.  His body falls and folds.

     Ichabod runs past Young Masbath.

     The Horseman halts just as Ichabod reaches a point in front
     of dead Philipse, aiming his pistol.  Daredevil lets out a
     SCREECHY CRY.  The Horseman rides toward Ichabod.

     Ichabod gets on one knee, trying to steady his pistol.  The
     Horseman closes.  Ichabod sweats bullets.  FIRES...

     The slug SLAMS the Horseman dead center -- bursts through and
     rends his uniform without slowing him.

     The Horseman is almost on Ichabod.  Ichabod cringes, arms
     up... as the Horseman passes.

     The Horseman leans to skewer Philipse's head with his sword.

     With the head as his prize, the Horseman races away.

     Ichabod gets up, watches the Horseman head to the forest.
     Ichabod looks to Young Masbath, finds his legs will not
     support him, falls, trembling.  THUNDER BELLOWS.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT

     Lady Van Tassel comes to a door, knocks.  Sarah stands behind
     with a tray of food.  Young Masbath is seated near.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
                     (to Young Masbath)
               Has he not come out at all?

     Young Masbath shakes his head.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     KNOCKING is HEARD.  Ichabod sleeps restlessly.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     THUNDER BOOMS.  WIND and POUNDING RAIN blast open a window.
     Mother comes to it, then moves to comfort fearful Young
     Ichabod in bed.

                             MOTHER'S VOICE (v.o.)
               Don't be afraid... don't be afraid.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY

     A keyhole.  Young Ichabod's eye peers in...

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- P.O.V. THROUGH KEYHOLE

     Mother is kneeled before flour on the floor.  She draws
     patterns in it, whispering.  She blows the flour away.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY

     The Freakish Woman (who argued with Mother) walks towards the
     home, supported by a SAD MAN.  She weeps, carrying something
     in a blanket.

     Young Ichabod comes a window, watching, scared.

     The Freakish Woman is so weak that she falls.  The blanket
     opens... the corpse of an infant tumbles to the dirt.  The
     Freakish Woman's WAILING GROWS LOUDER.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FRONT OF YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT

     TWO MEN in black drag Mother to a coach.  She looks back,
     fearful, pulled along.  A THIRD MAN in black follows.

     Young Ichabod struggles as Father restrains him.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               No... mother... no... !

     The Third Man peers back, a gray-haired, Cotton Mather-ish
     man with a villainous face.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)
               The night of the great storm, I saw
               her cross my windows.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY

     Many people in the gallery.  The Third Man stands in front of
     the tearful Freakish Woman in the witness box.

                             THIRD MAN
               You are certain it was she?

                             FREAKISH WOMAN
               In the lighting, I did see her.
                     (points)
               Her.  Lady Crane...

     Mother sits in shackles.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN
               I will never forget.  The next moment,
               I found my infant dead... with the
               blood welt on his breast.

     Those in attendance cry out at this.  Ichabod is seated
     beside Father, eyes filled with tears.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     As before, a STORM RAGES.  Ichabod is in Mother's arms.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)
               The night of the great storm, I saw
               her cross my windows.

                             MOTHER
               Don't be afraid...

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- DAY

     KNOCKING is HEARD.  Ichabod gasps awake.

                             KATRINA (o.s.)
               Constable Crane?

     Ichabod looks at his hands balled into fists.  He opens them
     -- has ONE HALF of PHILIPSE'S TALISMAN in each palm.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Katrina holds a tray of food.  The DOOR is HEARD UNLOCKING.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Katrina enters.  Ichabod sits at his work table.

                             KATRINA
               Are you hungry?

     Ichabod shakes his head, won't look up.  Katrina crosses.

     She begins picking up pieces of the PLASTER HOOFPRINT CAST
     which lies shattered on the floor.

                             KATRINA
               You promised justice.

                             ICHABOD
               If these are the random stalkings of
               a monster, what good am I?

                             KATRINA
               People have put their trust in you.

                             ICHABOD 
               They have done nothing of the sort.

                             KATRINA
               Won't they still have that justice?
                     (patience waning)
               Or, was it a vain promise?

     Ichabod stews, head in his hands.  Someone is HEARD
     RUNNING... Young Masbath enters, frightened.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Constable Crane... something has
               happened.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     The Lenape Indian hangs dead in a tree, lynched.  TOWNSFOLK
     are gathered.  Ichabod makes his way through, followed by
     Young Masbath, looking up.

                             BROM (o.s.)
               We do not need you, Constable...

     Brom strides towards Ichabod from a group of men spreading a
     sheet under the tree.  Van Ripper's there.

                             BROM
               The men who did this have been taken.
               We do not need you here.

     Brom points to where TWO FILTHY MEN in chains sit in a
     horse-drawn cart.  An armed man guards them.

                             ONE FILTHY MAN 
               You should thank us.  The killings
               will end.  We saved you all!

     The armed man shoves the filthy man to shut him up.

                             BROM 
               They spend two days in chains.

                             ICHABOD 
               Two days... ?  For murder?

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               For poaching.  Or, would you remake
               our laws now that Magistrate Philipse
               has given up the ghost?

                             ICHABOD 
               Does that look like an animal hanging?

                             BROM 
               Looks like an Indian.

     Van Ripper cuts the noose rope at the trunk.  The Lenape
     corpse free falls, landing hard.

     The Lenape lies in a heap on the sheet.  Van Ripper and
     others come to lift the sheet with the Lenape in the middle.
     Ichabod watches, noticing...

     The Lenape wears a WOVEN PIECE of REED GRASS a cord on his
     loin cloth, twisted in a pattern.

                             ICHABOD 
               Wait.  Give me a moment...

     Ichabod kneels.  He removes the woven piece, looking across
     the diseased Lenape's body.  Something else...

     The Lenape's mouth is agape; teeth rotting.  Ichabod looks
     around, finds a twig.  He uses it to pull the Lenape's mouth
     open... gets close to peer inside the Lenape's mouth.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY

     A DRAWING of the Lenape's WOVEN PIECE in Ichabod's ledger.
     The piece lies near.

     Ichabod sits staring at it, trance-like.  Masbath waits.
     Long silence.

                             ICHABOD
               The Lenape Indian had much to tell
               once I opened his mouth.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               How could he?

                             ICHABOD
               His teeth.  Someone had cut them and
               chipped off rotten pieces far back
               in his mouth.  The Lenape could not
               have done that for himself.
                     (closes his journal)
               Someone out there cared for him.

     Ichabod rises, deciding.  He picks up his satchel and exits.
     Young Masbath is surprised.  He follows.


     EXT.  WINDMILL -- DAY

     A massive, wooden WINDMILL, raised off the ground on a 7'
     center post.  Ichabod and Masbath walk to it.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath enter via a ladder from the
     underbelly.  Gears and counter wheels turn millstones.  A few
     men work in the grain powder filled air.

     Ichabod leads the way to a staircase, up twists and turns.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Where are we going?

                             ICHABOD 
               Up.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath climb out a door to the roof.  The
     rotors spin nearby.  Ichabod searches the countryside.

     Below, MANY MEN are ride up the long straight road.

                             ICHABOD 
               What is it?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               It's payment day.  Loan monies are
               given to Baltus the last day each
               month.  Almost everyone borrows...
               for tools or to hire workers.

     Ichabod sits, takes a bowl from his bag and gives it to
     Masbath, then produces a bottle of water... fills the bowl.

                             ICHABOD
                     (points) 
               Out there.  What do you see?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               The Western Woods.

                             ICHABOD 
               Look again.

     A plume of smoke rises from woods, far.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Smoke.  Chimney smoke.

     Ichabod holds a piece of straw in his mouth, rubs the point
     of a sewing needle against a small BLACK ROCK.

                             ICHABOD 
               Are you familiar with magnets?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What kind of nuts?

                             ICHABOD 
               Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch
               here.

     Ichabod shows the magnet grab the needle.  Young Masbath is
     amazed, reaching for it.  Ichabod watches him play with it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               It's spectacular.

                             ICHABOD
                     (smiles, pause) 
               Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               No, I couldn't...

                             ICHABOD 
               I have others.  All I need is this.

     Ichabod takes the needle, poking its butt end into the tip of
     the straw.  Young Masbath studies the rock, pockets it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Thank you.

                             ICHABOD
                     (nods, almost shy) 
               Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to
               business.

     Young Masbath lifts the bowl.  Ichabod drops in the
     needle/straw which floats and turns compass-like.

                             ICHABOD 
               If the Western Woods are truly the
               Devil's Glen, we will see for
               ourselves.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
                     (uneasy) 
               Father said witches live there.

                             ICHABOD 
               Witches do not exist.  However...

     Ichabod uses a knife to notch the bowl lip where the needle
     points, then surveys the smoke, making a second notch.

                             ICHABOD 
               Not long ago, I would have said the
               same for Headless Horseman.

                             KATRINA (o.s.)
               Constable... !

     Katrina's on horseback below, unhappy.

                             KATRINA 
               I need to speak with you.  Alone.


     EXT.  VAN TASSEL GREAT LAWN -- DAY

     Ichabod and Katrina lead their horses.  A heated argument.

                             KATRINA
               Why would you do such a thing?

                             ICHABOD 
               No stone may be left unturned.  It
               may appear harsh...

                             KATRINA 
               I have misjudged you I think.  I did
               not imagine you were so cruel.

                             ICHABOD 
               You are not regarding it in full.
               The Widow Windsor had been run
               through by a sword.  I followed the
               bloodless wound, a wound whose path
               I could not comprehend till I had
               seen the Horseman with my own eyes.

                             KATRINA 
               What are you on about?

                             ICHABOD 
               The child she carried was eight
               months grown at least... near to
               birthing.  The sword had pierced its
               tiny heart exactly.

                             KATRINA 
               Must I hear this?

                             ICHABOD 
               There was no blind stabbing.  This
               singular thrust found its target
               omnipotently, as if the Horseman made
               certain the unborn child died with
               its mother.

                             KATRINA 
               And this gives worth to butchery?

                             ICHABOD 
               It was not butchery.

                             KATRINA 
               What is it then?  Scientific method?
               How can any of this matter in the
               slightest?

                             ICHABOD 
               I have no solution for its meaning
               yet, but I could not just ignore it.

                             KATRINA 
               Take a lesson from Young Masbath's
               desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows
               with you to avenge his father's death.
               That I understand.  But, what do you
               want?

                             ICHABOD 
               To avenge his father, and the others.

                             KATRINA 
               But, why?  Tell me why.

     Ichabod struggles for a reply.

                             KATRINA 
               You falter with your answer because
               you strive without putting the whole
               of your heart into it.  Can't you see?
               You'll bring dignity to the dead even
               if you have to chop them into little
               pieces to do it.

                             ICHABOD
                     (fed up, growing anger) 
               If it had been surgery on a living
               person, done to save that person's
               life, you would not question it.  Not
               for a moment.  So, let me be the first
               to tell you, dear girl... on the other
               side of these sheltering mountains, a
               whole world has advanced beyond such
               plebeian thinking as yours.  And
               someday, no matter how much you fear
               it, that world will come to roust
               Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.

     Katrina storms away.  Ichabod's already regretting.


     EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath ride to the Western Woods, horses
     loaded for expedition.  At the Belltower remnants, Ichabod
     slows, looking to the wreckage.

     At forest's edge, Young Masbath waits.

     Ichabod circles the tower.  With a sigh, he rides to join
     Young Masbath. They head into the woods.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     Dark, dense and creepy.  Ichabod and Young Masbath move
     through.  Young Masbath halts his horse and looks around.

                             ICHABOD 
               What is it?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Listen.

                             ICHABOD
                     (listens, looks)
               I hear nothing.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               No crickets or cicadas calling.  No
               bird songs.

     Stark quiet.  Ichabod notes this unhappily.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- LATER DAY

     Ichabod's hand drops the needle/straw in the water bowl.  The
     needle spins.  The bowl is turned to match notches.

     Ichabod points the way to Young Masbath.

     ELSEWHERE, SOMEONE WATCHES:  A MOVING P.O.V. WATCHES them as
     they ride, FOLLOWS.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- LATER DAY

     Ichabod and Masbath reach a hill crest.  They stop, uneasy.
     Below: a CAVE with a rock archway.  An ill-fitting door
     covers the mouth.  The chimney spews smoke.

                             ICHABOD
               We have apparently arrived.

     EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     The horses are tied to a tree.  Ichabod walks to the cave
     door.  Unsure, he hesitantly knocks.

     INT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath step in.

     Walls are hung with skins and skeletons, dry flowers and reed
     grass in patterns.  An OLD CRONE sits facing away.

     The old Crone, a mountain woman with matted hair and grey
     features, sits disinterested.  Ichabod edges closer.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon.  You did not answer when I
               knocked.  Are we intruding?

                             OLD CRONE
               You are from the Hollow?

                             ICHABOD
               In a way, yes.

     Ichabod looks at tables of gourd bowls of dead insects and
     acorns.  Knifes, scissors, yellow bones.  He takes the
     Lenape's piece of reed grass from his pocket.

                             ICHABOD
               The Lenape who lived in these woods...
               do you know him?  The Redman?
                     (uncomfortable wait)
               I should tell you... he has been
               murdered.

                             OLD CRONE
               Leave me.  You are not welcome here.

     The old Crone places something on a table beside her -- a
     dead cardinal, bright red.

     Ichabod is afraid, backing away, but Young Masbath takes the
     woven piece and steps to the Crone.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Were you a friend to the Indian?
                     (waits)
               You should have this... if you were
               his friend.

     Young Masbath puts the woven piece beside the cardinal.  He
     walks to join Ichabod in leaving.

                             OLD CRONE
               You seek remedy against the Horseman?

     The Old Crone reaches to pick up the weaving.  She stands,
     faces them.  Tall.  Ichabod nods.

                             OLD CRONE
                     (to Young Masbath)
               Go out and keep away, child.
                     (to Ichabod)
               You stay.  Follow with me.

     The Old Crone takes a candle and walks, deep into the cave.

     INT.  CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY

     The Old Crone comes through a passage in the wet walls.
     Ichabod enters, scared, bent under low ceiling.

                             OLD CRONE
               I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow
               and back.

                             ICHABOD
               The Horseman.  Yes.

                             OLD CRONE
               Sit.

     Ichabod sits on crooked stool.  The old Crone kneels with her
     back to him, gathers straw in a pile on the floor.

                             ICHABOD 
               Can you help?

                             OLD CRONE 
               You want to see into the nether world...
               I can show you.  Whatever you see, do
               not move or speak.  I will hold him.

     She gathers bowls, putting grass and powder on the pile.

                             ICHABOD
               What... what are you doing?

                             OLD CRONE
                     (turns, furious) 
               Close your mouth!  Keep silent.

     She takes two jars from a table, pours ashes on the pile from
     one.  She shakes the other roughly, takes the lid off and
     upends it.  A baby bat squirms on the floor, dazed.

     The Old Crone holds the bat, using a knife to cut off its
     head.  She soaks the straw with blood, SPEAKING IN TONGUES,
     guttural.  Using a wick, she lights the straw.

     She grasps two METAL CUFFS with chains attached, slides these
     onto her bony wrists, then bends to inhale smoke.

                             OLD CRONE 
               He comes now.

     Ichabod would like to leave now.

     EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     Young Masbath, waiting by the horses, looks up.  Through the
     trees, black clouds billow and block the sun.

     INT.  CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY

     The old Crone slumps, still with her back to Ichabod.  She
     does not move.  Wind howls through a hole/window.  Rain.

     Candles blow out.  Ichabod stands, worried.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me... um...

     She remains motionless.  The STORM outside intensifies.

     WE SEE the skin of the Crone's wrists transform; swelling in
     the cuffs, hardening, cracking and bleeding.

     Some thing Ichabod cannot see.  He inches closer.

                             ICHABOD 
               Are you alright... ?

     The Crone turns, hideous, leaping erect -- a half-human,
     half-demon CREATURE.  Its black clawed hands reaching.

     Ichabod recoils, crying out.

     Chains on restraining cuffs yank the creature back.

     Ichabod hits the floor, knocking over a table of bones.  The
     creature is chained, but still wants Ichabod.  It SCREECHES.

     The Old Crone's face seethes from transformation, eyes blood
     red, nostrils dripping, teeth now jagged.

                             CREATURE/OLD CRONE 
               You seek the warrior bathed in
               blood... the Headless Horseman.

     Ichabod slides back as far as possible while the creature
     claws the rock floor, yearning.

                             CREATURE/OLD CRONE 
               Follow the Indian trail to where the
               sun dies.  Follow to the tree of the
               dead.

     The creature pulls, testing the chains.  Behind, the BOLT
     holding the chains to the wall slips.  The wall cracks.

                             CREATURE/OLD CRONE 
               Climb down to the Horseman's soulless
               place and let loose his silent
               shrieking.  Do you hear?  Do you hear?!

     Ichabod nods, quaking, aghast.  He glances to the exit.

     The chain bolt gives more... coming loose...

                             CREATURE/OLD CRONE 
               He who holds fast the Horseman's
               desire will guide his reaping hand.
               Catch hold of his desire.

     Ichabod bolts for the door.  The creature HOWLS, leaping...

     The chain bolt breaks...

     Ichabod cries out, tackled to the floor...

     It is the Old Crone who landed on him.  She has returned to
     human form, semi-conscious.  Ichabod shoves her off.

     EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     Ichabod runs out into the howling storm, past Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               We are leaving.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What happened?

     Ichabod scrambles onto Gunpowder, heading further into the
     woods, glancing back.  Young Masbath follows.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- EARLY EVENING

     No rain.  Dark.  A lantern's glow creates shifting shadows as
     Ichabod and Young Masbath ride.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Follow the Indian trail to where the
               sun dies.  To the tree of the dead. 
                     (looking back) 
               Maybe we passed it by.

                             ICHABOD 
               How could something named "the tree
               of the dead" fail to draw attention?

     A BIRD CRIES OUT.  Ichabod's startled, looking up.  The BIRD
     is HEARD ALIGHTING.  Leaves float downwards.

                             ICHABOD 
               We should not go much further in
               this murk.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Should we go back?

                             ICHABOD 
               We are far from the Hollow. 
                     (dismounts, troubled) 
               Loath to say it... better to get our
               backs against a tree and stay till
               morning.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS (TIME CUT) -- NIGHT

     Horses are tied.  Ichabod is seated against a tree.  A
     campfire burns.  Young Masbath lies on a blanket, rifle cross
     his chest, staring to treetops.

     Leaves and branches shift in the wind.  Bats fly wildly.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What does it mean... climb down to
               the Horseman's soulless place?

                             ICHABOD 
               "Let loose his silent shrieking."
               Who knows, till we work at it?  I
               admit not being anxious to find out.
                     (pause) 
               "He who holds the Horseman's desire
               will guide his reaping hand."
               Whatever the Horseman's desire is,
               other than extinguishing lives.

     A SNAPPING BRANCH.  Ichabod raises his pistol.

                             ICHABOD
                     (to Young Masbath) 
               Do not move.

     Ichabod rises.  He creeps forward, pistol and lantern
     forward.  Foliage is thick.  CRUNCHING LEAVES are HEARD.

     Ichabod crouches, puts down the lantern and picks up a
     branch.  He tosses the branch to the foliage...

     SOME ANIMAL darts away, a running blur.

     Ichabod rises, following with his pistol.

     ANOTHER ANGLE, MOVING P.O.V.: low to the ground,
     moving swiftly at Ichabod...

     Ichabod spins, blindsided.

     Young Masbath fires his rifle -- CRACK!!

     The ANIMAL is KNOCKED DOWN mid-leap, yelping...

     The beast lands, a mass of grey fur.

     Ichabod comes to stare down.  Young Masbath arrives.  They
     both look to the beast, horrified.

     The creature lies helplessly spastic; a TWO-HEADED WOLF, with
     one head blown open to brain and gore.  Its living head
     lifts, MEWING sadly, eyes pleading.

     Ichabod step up with pistol.  FIRES.  MEWING STOPS.

                             ICHABOD
               What God-forsaken hell is this?

     Ichabod swallows back sickness, looking away.  Something
     catches his eye.

                             ICHABOD
               Christ...

     Through the forest: the SKY'S LIT UP.  Distant fire.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, CAVE HOME -- EARLY EVENING

     Ichabod and Masbath ride up, confronted by the Crone's cave
     vomiting flame out all orifices.

     Ichabod approaches.  Embers swirl everywhere.  The Old
     Crone's body lies amongst bloodied leaves.  Headless.


     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

     Much commotion.  A MOB in front of the home marked
     "LANCASTER, PHYSICIAN."  Steenwyck addresses the rabble.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               You all stand idle, while this man
               goes about with a book of secrets and
               a bag filled with magic.  You all
               stand idle, while the shadow of the
               Devil falls over our town.

     Baltus, Lady Van Tassel and Katrina watch at safe distance.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               I say, if you do nothing, you share
               in the blasphemy of Ichabod Crane!

     Killian, on horseback beside his wife, BETH, and son, Thomas,
     rides to one side of the shouting crowd.

                             KILLIAN 
               Listen to me!  Do you want to save
               your crops?  Or would you rather see
               your farms go to ruin?

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               How is he saving our farms?  How?
               Ichabod Crane has brought into our
               midst the soulless, moldering corpse
               of a heretic!

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod examines the Crone's neck wound with magnification
     spectacles.  Young Masbath is seated, ledger in his lap.

                             ICHABOD
               The wound is neither smooth nor
               cauterized, but jagged.  She bleeds
               like a fountain.

     Ichabod lifts her dead hand to show bruises and cuts.

                             ICHABOD
               She did not go quietly.

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT

     Doctor Lancaster wrings his hands.  His WIFE rocks nervously
     in a rocking chair.  The CROWD outside ROARS as a bonfire
     lights up the curtained windows.

     The front door is POUNDED open.  ANGRY MEN enter.  Lancaster
     stands, lips quivering.  He points insistently to a door.

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Angry men break in.  Ichabod looks up.

                             ANGRY MAN
               Step aside, Constable.  Step aside...

     Ichabod is shoved aside, spectacles knocked off.

     The group grasps the Crone.  Masbath stands on his chair,
     clutching the ledger.  Ichabod grabs one man.

                             ICHABOD
               What are you doing?

     The man slams Ichabod back.

     Magnification spectacles are crushed under foot.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

     Angry men carry the corpse to a raging bonfire.  The mob
     makes way.  Steenwyck cheers them.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               Let her burn!  Let her burn!

     Ichabod comes out, followed by Young Masbath.  The Crone's
     corpse is thrown in the fire.  Cheers all around.

     At Ichabod's side, a man tries to grab the ledger Young
     Masbath holds.  Young Masbath cries out, hanging on to the
     book.  Ichabod joins the struggle.

     Katrina watches, emotions conflicting.

     Other men grab Ichabod.  One punches Ichabod in the face.

     Katrina rides forward as Baltus calls for her to stop.

     Katrina leaps down, into the crowd, pulls men off Ichabod.

                             KATRINA
               Stop this!  Leave them alone!

     A SHOT RINGS OUT.  Chaos halts.  Everyone turns, quieting.

     The men around Masbath and Ichabod turn to face Brom Bones.
     Brom holds a smoking pistol, flanked by Theodore and Glenn.

                             BROM 
               Let them go
                     (pointing) 
               Are you going to beat an orphaned
               child, imbecile?

     Masbath is released, along with the ledger.  Steenwyck moves
     forward, pushing people aside.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               Are you Ichabod Crane's protector,
               Brom Bones?

                             BROM 
               Only for the moment.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               You side with him in this?

                             BROM 
               No.  I agree he has only made matters
               worse.  But, that will change, if you
               listen.

     He trades with Theodore, pistol for a long rifle.  Brom hefts
     the rifle, taking a round slug from his pocket.

                             BROM 
               Theodore, Glenn and I offer to ride
               each day and night to watch over the
               Hollow.  We will stalk the border of
               the Western Woods and haunt the
               Horseman for a change, with rifles
               like this... and slugs like this...

     Brom brings the slug to his lips, blows.  It WHISTLES.

                             BROM 
               Hollowed out and filled with powder.

     Brom smiles at Katrina, who watches unimpressed.

                             BROM 
               Constable Crane is not the only one
               who fights with science on his side.

                             ICHABOD 
               I fired upon the Horseman and the
               bullet did nothing.

                             BROM 
               You must have missed your mark.

                             ICHABOD 
               I hit him square.

                             BROM
                     (to the crowd) 
               I say... if the Horseman is solid
               enough to take the lives of our
               people, he's solid enough to feel
               this...

     Brom aims the rifle at a BARREL down the road.  FIRES.

     PLUNK -- the barrel is hit -- EXPLODES.  Smoke wafts.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     In bed, Ichabod is having unpleasant dreams once more.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.) 
               The night of the great storm, I saw
               her cross my windows.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY

     Young Ichabod is seated beside Father, eyes tearful.  We are
     back in the court where Mother stands trial.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN 
               In the lightning, I did see her.
                     (points to Mother) 
               Her. Lady Crane... I will never
               forget it.  The next moment, I found
               my infant son was dead, with the
               blood welt on his breast.

     The evil Third Man turns to a jury of TWELVE MEN.

                             THIRD MAN 
               You have heard it.  The blood welt
               is the mark of Satan's touch.

     As the crowd murmurs in fear, Young Ichabod looks to Father,
     who sits with hands clenched, emotionless.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT

     In the quiet kitchen, Young Ichabod looks across the table.
     Father stares into his food.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               She was with me, father.

                             FATHER
               Nothing can be done against them.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               She was with me that night.

     Father doesn't even look up.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Empty church.  Young Ichabod carries a lantern past pews.  A
     soldier is seated near the altar with a rifle.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               May I see her?

     The soldier exits through a white door.  Young Ichabod waits,
     looking up at the vast church.  The white door opens and the
     Third Man steps out.

                             THIRD MAN
               Go home.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               May I see my mother?

                             THIRD MAN
               You do not want to be here.  Go home
               to your father.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               She did not do it... please listen...

                             THIRD MAN
               She is guilty.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               No, sir, please... she is innocent...

                             THIRD MAN
               She has confessed.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               No.

                             THIRD MAN 
               She has admitted to her evil and
               signed a written confession.  Do
               you know what confession is?
                     (off Ichabod's nod) 
               All that is left for you now is to
               pray for her soul.

     The Third Man leaves through the white door.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod buttons his shirt.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S YARD -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod comes out, looks to the lawn, not
     understanding.  Father loads a wagon full of belongings.

                             FATHER 
               We are leaving.
                     (long pause)
               She has gone away.

     Realization comes to Young Ichabod.  He runs, away across the
     lawn as Father calls after him.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FOREST TRAIL -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod runs, weeping.

                             THIRD MAN (v.o.) 
               She has confessed.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- MORNING

     Empty.  Doors are thrown open and Young Ichabod enters.  He
     goes down the aisle, towards the white door.

                             THIRD MAN (v.o.) 
               She has admitted to her evil and
               signed a written confession.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD 
               Mother.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH, BEYOND WHITE DOOR -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod enters, halting.  The room contains TORTURE
     DEVICES: iron cuffs, thumb screws, knifes and needles.

                             THIRD MAN (v.o.)
               Do you know what confession is?

     He walks, numb, eyes locked forward...

     In the corner is a SPIKED CHAIR, adorned with sharp iron
     spikes.  Hundreds of spikes.  It is fitted with straps for
     holding down the "accused."

     Tears stream down Young Ichabod's face.  He kneels, hands on
     the spikes of the chair, pressing hard.

     As he sobs, blood runs down from his hands.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     In bed, Ichabod opens tear filled eyes.  He sits up, bringing
     his trembling hands to wipe his cheeks.  His hands trail
     blood. He looks to them...

     The old scars are bleeding.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Katrina comes to the door.  Ichabod is seated by the fire,
     eyes bleary, palms wrapped with bloodied cloth.

                             KATRINA 
               Constable Crane?

     Katrina comes beside Ichabod's chair.

                             ICHABOD
               Allow me some time.  I have spent
               every hour in the company of others.
               I need to be alone.

                             KATRINA 
               What troubles you?

     She moves in front.  Ichabod gets up and crosses to sit
     facing away.  Katrina takes the chair he deserted.

                             KATRINA
               The things I said to you before...
               I was wrong to say them.

                             ICHABOD
               No, actually, you were not.  Every
               word you spoke had truth in it.

                             KATRINA 
               What has happened?

     Ichabod sits silent, puts his head back, eyes closed.

                             ICHABOD 
               Lady Van Tassel... she is your
               stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so
               little resemblance.

                             KATRINA 
               What?

                             ICHABOD 
               She is not your birth mother, is she?

                             KATRINA 
               No, but... why do you ask that?

                             ICHABOD 
               What happened to your mother?  Is she
               still alive?

                             KATRINA 
               She died.  Her lungs were diseased...
               two years ago.  What is this about?

                             ICHABOD 
               Memories have come back.  I had them
               forgotten, and wish I could forget
               them again... but they are here now. 
                     (pause) 
               Lord, how I hate this place.

                             KATRINA 
               If you want me to go, I will.  Do you
               want me to leave?

                             ICHABOD 
               I... I do not know.  I no longer know
               what I think or what I feel.

     Katrina walks to him.  She touches his back.

                             KATRINA 
               Why are you so afraid of that?  Is
               there truly such harm in uncertainty?

     She kneels, smiles a little for him.  She reaches to touch
     his face, holds his head in her hands.  Leans to kiss him.

     He rests his head against hers, weary, putting his arms
     around her.  They kiss passionately.


     EXT.  THE HOLLOW -- EARLY MORNING

     Dawn light, is visible over forests pounded by rain.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- MORNING

     Ichabod exits his room, satchel in hand.  He looks down the
     hall, then steps back in to take a white rose from a vase.

     AROUND A CORNER, Ichabod comes to the last door.  He bends,
     slipping the white rose under the crack of the door.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- MORNING

     Rain.  Ichabod comes out.  Across the lawn, Young Masbath is
     bringing the horses.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL (o.s.) 
               Good morrow, Constable.

     Ichabod turns to see Lady Van Tassel in a chair, sewing.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Returning to the Western Woods?

                             ICHABOD 
               Yes, actually.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Use caution.

                             ICHABOD
                     (nods, studies her) 
               Do you know... I think those are the
               first words I have heard from you my
               entire time here.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               As my husband says, a wife should be
               always like an echo, and at the same
               time, quite unlike an echo.
                     (off Ichabod's confusion) 
               Like an echo, she should speak only
               when spoken to, and unlike an echo,
               should never try to have the last
               word, or, at least that is what he
               believes.

     Baltus comes out the door, irritable, skillet in hand.

                             BALTUS 
               Constable... did you notice anything
               out of the ordinary during the night?

     Ichabod eyes the skillet, ill at ease, trying not to be.

                             ICHABOD 
               Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?

                             BALTUS 
               Sarah has gone missing... my servant
               girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it.
               She has joined the migration out of
               town.
                     (to Lady Van Tassel) 
               What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am
               I to starve to death?

     Lady Van Tassel gets up and goes in, taking the skillet.

                             ICHABOD 
               I should be going... good day to you.

     Ichabod heads towards Young Masbath.  Baltus watches from the
     porch, disgruntled.  He goes in.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     Heavy rain.  Ichabod and Young Masbath ride side by side.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               If the Crone's wound bled hard, that
               means she was not killed by the
               Hessian.  Someone only tried to make
               it look that way.

                             ICHABOD 
               You grow sharper by the minute, little
               man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin
               to prefer your company over all others.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Well... I'm one of the few people who
               likes you.

                             ICHABOD
                     (laughs) 
               True enough.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And
               why?

                             ICHABOD 
               Good questions, deserving answers, of
               which we are in short supply.

     A SOUND is HEARD.  Ichabod looks back, then to Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               Quicken pace.

     Ichabod rides faster.  Young Masbath keeps up.

     FURTHER ON, they charge over a hill.  Ichabod halts Gunpowder
     and climbs clumsily off.

                             ICHABOD 
               Ride on.

     Young Masbath obeys.  Ichabod takes out his pistol and wades
     into forest growth, backtracking.

     INSIDE THE FOREST, Ichabod bounds through underbrush, low.  A
     HORSE is HEARD SNORTING.  He pushes through branches...

     Moving behind a FIGURE IN A GREY CLOAK on horseback.

                             ICHABOD 
               Halt and turn.  I have a pistol aimed
               at your head.

     The figure stops, pushes off the cloak hood.  Katrina.

                             KATRINA 
               It is only me.

                             ICHABOD
               Katrina.  Why do you follow?

                             KATRINA
               I apologize if I worried you.

                             ICHABOD 
               A woman should not be out alone in
               these woods.

                             KATRINA 
               But, I am not alone, am I?  I only
               wished to see what you were up to,
               and...
                     (takes out WHITE ROSE) 
               To thank you.

     Ichabod softens, but doesn't want to.

                             ICHABOD
               Come along.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY

     Raining still.  Ichabod, Masbath and Katrina come into a
     clearing, mouths falling open at the sight of...

     A monstrously huge TREE OF THE DEAD, at the clearing's
     center, with branches reaching far and wide, knotted and
     gross, like agony captured in wood sculpture.

     Ichabod dismounts, crossing a line beyond which grass and
     weeds will not grow.  Young Masbath and Katrina dismount.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               You were right... it does draw
               attention to itself.

     Ichabod stares up into the endless, dead canopy of branches.
     He circles the incredibly wide trunk.

     There's a VERTICAL WOUND in the bark, as if the tree once had
     a terrible vertical in it, now partially healed and
     disgustingly scarred.  Ichabod approaches.

     He feels the mushy scar, picking at its scabs till much sap
     begins to trickle. It is red and Ichabod fingers it.

                             ICHABOD
               Blood.

                             KATRINA
               What did you say?

     Ichabod goes to where Katrina and Masbath wait with the
     horses, digs in a saddle bag for a hand axe.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               What is it?

                             ICHABOD
               Stay back.

     At the trunk, Ichabod thumps the flat end of the axe against
     the suture.  It sounds hollow.  Ichabod begins to chop.

     He pulls away loose bark.  The tree drips more blood and a
     clear goo.  Ichabod uses both hands on the axe to hack at the
     festering suture.

                             KATRINA
               What are you doing?

                             ICHABOD
               Just... keep where you are.

     Ignoring, Young Masbath moves closer.  Ichabod keeps
     chopping, then grips a large, loose flap of wood, trying to
     bend it.  It's not easy.  Ichabod struggles.

     Katrina follows Masbath's slow advance.

     Ichabod's pulling... the flap suddenly gives, revealing a
     blood-soaked, wide-eyed, gap-mouthed HUMAN HEAD.

     Ichabod recoils.  Behind him, Katrina stifles a scream,
     taking Young Masbath in her arms to keep him from looking.

     It is Philipse's head, hanging off the trunk flap, held by
     roots grown around and into the flesh.

     Ichabod reapproaches, back of his hand to his mouth.

     FOUR other SEVERED, DECAYING HEADS are held by ingrown roots
     within the dewy innards.

                             KATRINA 
               My God... what has happened?

                             ICHABOD 
               He... he tries to take the heads...
               they will not pass.

     He looks to the branches towering above.

                             ICHABOD 
               Must be some sort of gateway.  But,
               why this place... ?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               We should go.

                             ICHABOD 
               Why this tree?

     Ichabod begins looking at the ground, moving around the tree.
     He gets to his knees, pushing mud away.

     Uncovering a flush HEADSTONE carved with "666."

                             ICHABOD
                     (to himself) 
               "Climb down to the Horseman's
               soulless place."
                     (to Masbath) 
               Bring the shovel.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- LATER DAY

     Rain.  Young Masbath's crouched, muddy, rifle across his
     knees.  He's watching the tree.

     Behind him, Katrina climbs out of the shallow grave near a
     pile of mud.  Ichabod hands up the shovel.

                             KATRINA 
               Masbath, we've found it.

     Young Masbath goes to the grave.  Ichabod pulls at thick
     burlap cloth, straining as it comes away.

     Ichabod looks down, disbelieving.

                             ICHABOD 
               It cannot be true.

     WE SEE: roots have gripped the Horseman's bones and tattered
     uniform.  The skeleton is all there -- except the skull.

                             ICHABOD 
               Why is it every grave I open holds
               a new mystery inside?

                             KATRINA 
               The skull is gone.

                             ICHABOD 
               Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.

     Ichabod climbs out, weary in body and spirit.  LIGHTNING.
     THUNDER.  He stares at the bones.

                             ICHABOD 
               This is his silent shrieking... and
               his desire, to reclaim his head.

     Ichabod turns, looking to the bordering forest.

                             ICHABOD 
               "He who holds fast the Horseman's
               desire will guide his reaping hand." 
                     (pause) 
               Someone controls the Horseman.

                             KATRINA (o.s.) 
               Ichabod!

     Ichabod turns, looks...

     Katrina and Young Masbath back away, because the ROOTS in the
     grave are ALIVE, further entwining around remains.

     Ichabod spins to the twisted tree...

     The vertical SUTURE SEETHES, pulling inwards... sucking
     Philipse's head back in and closing, bubbling.

     Ichabod bounds over grave dirt pile, hastening Katrina and
     Young Masbath along as he flees.

     At the tree, the suture swells.

     Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath pass where their freaking
     horses are tied to a fallen trunk, heading for cover.

     A RUMBLING is HEARD from the twisted tree, which suddenly
     BURSTS wide, spitting smoldering cinders.

     At the tree line, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath cower,
     looking back.

     From the tree wound, a glow brightens, till the Headless
     Horseman and Daredevil EXPLODE into existence...

     They hit the ground running.

     Ichabod watches the Horseman ride away with bolts of
     LIGHTNING STRIKING the GROUND BEHIND.

     The Horseman disappears in the forest.

                             ICHABOD
               His next victim is chosen!
                     (to Masbath)
               Give me distance, then guide her
               back to the Hollow.

     Ichabod runs towards the horses.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Constable!

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     The Horseman rips past on Daredevil.

     EXT.  BEHIND IN WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     Ichabod rides as fast as Gunpowder is able.


     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Small home.  Killian, Thomas and Beth have finished supper.
     Beth clears plates as Killian picks his teeth with a knife.

                             THOMAS
               May I be excused, father?

                             KILLIAN
               Do you deserve to be?

                             THIRD MAN
                     (shyly)
               I think so.

                             KILLIAN
                     (smiles)
               Then, go.

     Thomas gets down from his chair.  He goes to the fireplace to
     light a tallow wick, which he takes to the next room.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Thomas plops on the floor and lights his MAGIC LANTERN: a
     lantern with an outer sleeve of glass painted with
     silhouettes of lions and monsters.

     Thomas turns the lantern and looks to the walls where the
     creatures, shadows are thrown.  He roars for them, imagining
     them real and having a grand time.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Beth comes for more dishes.

                             BETH 
               Don't pick teeth.  You teach Thomas
               bad habits.

     Killian pulls her to him, playful.

                             KILLIAN 
               I am a bad habit.  There's nothing
               for it.

                             BETH
                     (kisses him) 
               No one knows better than I.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Thomas continues his fun, shadow animals circling him.

     In the shifting light, a baby spider comes from a crack in
     the wall.  Then, another spider skitters out.  More follow.

     EXT.  FORESTS -- DAY

     A black horse runs, hooves pounding the ground.  THUNDER is
     HEARD.  The horse slows and stops... it is Brom's horse, with
     Brom aboard.  Brom looks skyward.

     The storm harshens, roaring through the trees.  Distant
     HOOFBEATS can be HEARD.  POUNDING.

     Brom takes his rifle off his shoulder.  The HOOFBEATS grow
     LOUDER and PASS, far away.  Brom turns in the saddle and
     WHISTLES.  He kicks his horse and rides.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Thomas still watches shadow beasts, but sees something else.
     He goes to the crack where hundreds of spiders flee all
     directions. Thomas is amused.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Behind Killian, mantelpiece stones pulse, breathing almost
     imperceptibly.  Demonic faces form, then disappear and reform
     again, shifting.  WIND HOWLS.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth enters, looking at Thomas.

                             BETH
               What are you doing there?

     The magic lantern stops spinning.  Shadow creatures freeze.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     The ENTIRE HOUSE CREAKS.  Killian looks up.  CREAKING STOPS.
     The HOWLING WIND is LOUD.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth comes to Thomas' side as he points.

                             THOMAS
               Spiders.

     Beth bends to see the swarming spiders.  She looks up,
     noticing the FEROCITY of the WIND.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Killian stands, looking up.  The HOUSE CREAKS again, then
     suddenly the WIND CEASES.  Silence.

                             KILLIAN
               Beth...

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth picks up Thomas.  The magic lantern creatures begin
     spinning anew, all around.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     With a ROAR, the fire flares.  Killian looks.

     WHHOOOSH the fire shoots up the fireplace.  Gone.

     Behind Killian, the DOOR SPLINTERS INWARDS.  The Horseman
     steps in, a battle axe in each hand.  WIND BLASTS...

     The DOOR to the other room SLAMS.

     Killian grabs a kitchen chair and hurls it at the Horseman.
     The Horseman swings, smashing it aside.

                             KILLIAN
               Beth... run!

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth hugs Thomas to her as she backs away.

                             KILLIAN (o.s.)
                     (from kitchen)
               Get out!

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Killian grabs an iron skewer from the fireplace, swings it to
     fend off a blow from the Horseman.

     The Horseman swings the other axe.  Killian ducks.  The axe
     cracks fireplace stone, throwing sparks.

     Killian lunges, jamming the skewer into the Horseman.

     The skewer comes through the Horseman's back.  The Horseman
     swipes with the flat of one axe -- pounding Killian aside.

     Killian hits the wall, bashing his head.  Hits the floor.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth kicks a carpet to reveal a trap door.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     The Horseman pulls the skewer out of his body, throws it.  He
     goes to lift Killian by the hair with one hand, brings back
     the axe in the other...

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     At the trap door, Beth lowers Thomas to stairs leading to the
     cellar.  Thomas is crying.

                             BETH
               Don't let him get you.

                             THOMAS
               Mommy...

                             BETH
               You hide now... go...

     Beth closes the trap door, frantically replacing the carpet.
     The room's door flies open and the Horseman strides in,
     carrying Killian's severed head.  Beth shrieks.

     The Horseman steps forward, knocks over the magic lantern.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY

     Beth's SCREAMS are abruptly CUT OFF.  Her BODY is HEARD
     HITTING the floor above.  Thomas crosses the cellar,
     stumbles.  He scurries into the shelter of a wheelbarrow
     propped against the wall.  FOOTSTEPS are HEARD.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     The Horseman's hands place Killian's and Beth's heads in a
     sack, cinching the sack shut.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     The Headless Horseman enters, bends to retrieve the battle
     axe he left.  He stands.  Pause.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY

     Thomas' trembling hands pull the wheelbarrow closer.  QUIET.
     He tries to control his sobbing.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     The Horseman turns, falls to his knees.  He starts to chop at
     the floor with both axes.  CHOPping,  CHOPping,  CHOPping...
     making quick work of it...

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY

     A hole appears in the ceiling as debris falls.

     Thomas looks up, terrified.  He gets up to run away...

     The Horseman's arm shoves through above, grasping Thomas and
     yanking him up.

     EXT.  KILLIAN'S FARM -- DAY

     Brom rides from the forest, charging across Killian's field.

     At Killian's house, Daredevil rides up as the Headless
     Horseman walks out with his sack of heads.  The Horseman ties
     the sack to the saddle and leaps up.

     Brom puts his reins in his mouth, raising his rifle.

     The Horseman heads away, past the barn, as Brom gains.

     Brom aims... FIRES!

     BOOM -- the slug EXPLODES, blowing the Horseman off
     Daredevil.  Daredevil keeps going.  The Horseman's smoldering
     body is left "face down."

     Brom halts his horse.  He climbs down, pleased.

     The Horseman moves.

     Brom backs away, satisfaction diminishing.

     The Horseman gets on his knees.

     Brom falls to one knee, begins reloading.  He fills the gun
     from his powder horn.

     The Horseman stands, unsheathes his sword and turns.  The
     blast has blown apart his uniform at the chest and shoulder,
     exposing rotten flesh and maggot-infested muscle.

     Brom readies his ramrod, jamming powder in the barrel.

     The Horseman charges.

     Brom stands, pulling out the ramrod.  The Horseman is on him.
     Brom swings the rifle, blocking.  Sparks fly.

     The battle is on, with Brom fending off the Horseman's sword
     with the gun -- CLANK -- CLANK -- CLANK.

     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod and Gunpowder break into the open.

     UP THE FIELD, the Horseman makes a backhanded swing.  Brom
     goes down, his rifle sent flying.

     Brom rolls to avoid as the Horseman slashes.

     Brom flees.  The Horseman pulls and throws a knife...

     THWAP -- the knife imbeds in Brom's thigh.

     The Horseman runs towards Brom.

     Ichabod closes in, pulling an unlit lantern off his saddle.

     Brom tries to get up, bends to extract the knife.

     The Horseman, mid-run, changes his sword grip, blade down.

     He plants one foot on Brom's back, raising his sword, about
     to skewer...

     Ichabod arrives full gallop, SMASHES the lantern into the
     Horseman -- knocking the Horseman off Brom.

     AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST, Theodore and Glen arrive on
     horseback.  They hold a moment, watching.

     Brom runs, limping, to the barn, goal in sight: farm
     implements propped there.  Brom grabs SCYTHES with long
     curved blades, one in per hand.

     The Horseman rises.

     Ichabod turns Gunpowder and leaps off, runs to Brom.

     The Horseman moves towards them, hefting a battle axe in his
     free hand.  Ichabod steps up, pistol aimed, furious.

                             ICHABOD
               For what it's worth...

     FIRES -- the bullet rips through the Horseman's stomach to
     reveal putrid innards as he keeps advancing.

     At the forest, Theodore looks to Glenn, turns and flees.

     Brom steps up, scythes ready.  He and the Horseman go at it.
     Brom blocks axe and sword, catching and deflecting blows.

     At the forest, Glenn follows Theodore away.

     Ichabod grabs a long handled SICKLE.

     Brom swings the scythes.  The Horseman avoids.

     Ichabod moves to the side, looking for an opening.  He swings
     the sickle. The Horseman blocks.

     The Horseman battles both at once, catching blows...
     countering every strike, METAL RINGING.

     Brom catches the Horseman's sword in one scythe, holding it
     off.  Catches the axe handle in the other scythe.

     The Horseman flatfoot KICKS Brom's chest, sending him down.

     Ichabod swings the sickle blade...

     Hits the Horseman, the blade embedding to the hilt.

     The Horseman drops his axe and grasps the sickle, jerking...

     The sickle handle SLAMS Ichabod's, knocking him away.

     Ichabod crawls, tries to shake off the blow.

     He looks up.  The Horseman staggers, spastically trying to
     pull the blade from his body.

     Brom limps to Ichabod, yanks him to his feet.

                             BROM
               We cannot win this.

     They head towards the forest.

     Behind, the Horseman extracts the sickle, throws it.  He
     strides after them, picks up his axe on the way.

     EXT.  RIVERBANK -- DAY

     Ichabod and Brom stumble down a hillside.  Brom points.

                             BROM
               There...

     They run to a DOCK at the edge of a wide, rapid river.  They
     jump into a FLAT BOAT barge.

                             BROM
               Go to the front and guide it.

     Ichabod goes.  Brom uses a scythe to slash the ropes.

     Ichabod picks up a GUIDE POLE.  The barge lurches, set free.

     Ichabod struggles to push the boat out.  it moves swiftly,
     caught in rain swollen current.

     Brom looks back.  No Horseman.  He leaves the scythe and
     moves to the front, hefting another pole to help guide.

                             BROM
               Let's see him catch us now.

     Ichabod looks to the shore.  Horror.

                             ICHABOD
               Look.

     LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES -- ahead, the Horseman stands on the
     bank with Axe and sword.  Daredevil near.

                             BROM 
               We'll pass right by the son of a bitch.

     Ichabod and Brom push with the poles, trying for speed.

     At the bank, the Horseman walks directly to the water...

     Just as he takes a step onto the water, the rain churned
     surface TRANSFORMS -- instantly BECOMING a SHEET of ICE...

     SPREADING and supporting the Horseman as he advances.

     ICE SHOOTS OUT ahead of him, towards a point in the river
     where it will intercept the barge.

                             BROM
               My Christ...

     The Horseman's ICE BRIDGE engulfs the barge, HALTING IT.

     Ichabod and Brom are thrown.  The barge is trapped.

     The Horseman nears.

     Brom runs to the rear to retrieve his scythe.  Ichabod holds
     up the only weapon he has, his guide pole.

     The Horseman steps on board.  Ichabod swings.  The Horseman's
     axe cracks the pole in half...

     The Horseman thrusts with sword -- into Ichabod's chest --
     clean through.  It SIZZLES as Ichabod screams.

     The Horseman lifts Ichabod up, flips him, pulling the sword
     out as Ichabod goes...

     SMASHING through the ice and under.

     UNDERWATER: water carries Ichabod, slams him against ice
     above. He's pulled down by undertow.

     ABOVE WATER, beyond the edge of the ice bridge: Ichabod comes
     up, gasping, choking on rain.

     He treads water, looking to the barge.

     ICHABOD'S P.O.V. -- FROM THE WATER

     Aboard the barge, the Horseman cuts Brom down... stands over
     him, chopping with sword.  Our VIEW grows BLURRY, and...

     FADES OUT/IN

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Candlelight.  Ichabod, shirtless, feverish, opens his eyes.
     The wound at the top of his chest is raw.  Katrina inserts a
     needle in the skin around it.

                             KATRINA
               Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Doctor, he is awake.

     Ichabod tries to sit.  Pain stops him.  Lady Van Tassel helps
     bleed the wound with the needle and a tube leading to a
     SUCTION JAR of blood.

                             ICHABOD
                     (barely a voice)
               What... what are you doing... ?

                             KATRINA
               I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.

     Doctor Lancaster comes to the bed.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               Keep still, Constable.  You were
               half-drowned when they found you.

                             ICHABOD
               ... Brom Bones...

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               He is dead.  You would be also, if
               your wound had not somehow shut.

                             ICHABOD
               Bring Young Masbath here.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               You need to sleep.

                             ICHABOD
               Bring him.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               You need rest.

     Ichabod gives up, closes his eyes.  Katrina, needle in one
     hand, brings her other hand to hold Ichabod's.

     Blood drips into the suction jar.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Ichabod is soundly asleep.  Across the room, Katrina is at
     his work table.  Ichabod stirs.  Katrina looks to him.

     Once she is satisfied he will not wake, she returns to what
     she was doing, turning a page.  She is reading his ledger.

     EXT.  SERVANT'S QUARTER'S, MASBATH'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath lies awake.  A glint of light crosses the
     window.  Masbath looks to it, gets up, peers out.

     THROUGH THE WINDOW, he can see the Van Tassel Manor House in
     the distance.  Lantern LIGHT crosses the lawn.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE, ORCHARD -- NIGHT

     The lantern light moves through the orchard, away from the
     house.  We cannot make out the person.

     Elsewhere, Young Masbath runs in pursuit.  He hides against
     one tree, leans to look...

     The light enters forest.  Young Masbath follows.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- MORNING

     Ichabod's hurting.  Masbath helps with a shirt.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Someone left last night.  Looked
               like they headed to the square, but
               I lost them in the forest.

                             ICHABOD 
               Man or woman?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               All I saw was their lantern.

                             ICHABOD 
               Business, best hidden is hidden best
               at night.

     Ichabod goes to his work table, organizing his satchel.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               If someone has the Horseman's skull...
               if they control the Horseman, then why
               haven't they sent him for your head
               yet?

                             ICHABOD 
               Because, I serve a fine purpose alive.
               It is perfection for our murderer if I
               return to New York City with nothing
               more than tales of a galloping ghoul. 
                     (pause) 
               We must uncover the reason these
               victims were targeted.  What was taken
               from them... other than their lives?
               Who benefits by their deaths?

     Ichabod fumbles the bottle of white powder.

     It bounces, cork popping out... rolls under the bed.

                             ICHABOD 
               Damn it.

     Ichabod kneels, pained.  A trail of the blood-detecting
     powder has spilled.  The bottle is out of reach.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               I'll get it.

     Young Masbath gets down, ready to crawl for it, but Ichabod
     stops him, peering under.

                             ICHABOD
               Wait...

     Far under, near the bottle, some powder is bubbling.

     Ichabod moves to the end of the bed and lifts, in pain. 
     Young Masbath helps. They drag the bed to one side.

     Under the bed: a Satanic PENTAGRAM has been DRAWN IN BLOOD.

     Ichabod stares, trying to grasp the implication.  Masbath is
     about to speak, but Ichabod puts a finger to his lips.

     Ichabod moves to lock the door.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
                     (whispers) 
               Who did this?

     Ichabod does not answer.  He picks up a wash basin and dumps
     the water to wash the Pentagram away.


     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- DAY

     WAGONS, HORSES and TOWNSPEOPLE swarm.  A CROWD loots the
     town's general store.  Provisions are passed along man to man
     and loaded on wheelbarrows.

     All up and down the long straight road, home owners board up
     windows with lumber.

     Ichabod and Young Masbath ride, passing many angry faces.

                             ICHABOD
               Panic has set in.

     They stop, tying their horses and climbing stairs to the door
     of the "NOTARY."  Ichabod looks off...

     DOWN THE ROAD, at the far end, people head to the church.
     Much activity there as well.

                             ICHABOD
               Sanctuary.  Or, so they hope.

     Families put up tents all around the church within the
     bordering wrought-iron fence.  Supplies abound.

     People work to build and erect massive wooden crosses.


     INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY

     Tidy room.  Young Masbath watches Ichabod hand a slip of
     paper to the elderly Notary, Hardenbrook.

                             ICHABOD
               Do you have these persons' wills?

                             HARDENBROOK
               I have everything... last testaments...
               birth certificates, death certificates...
               deeds.

                             ICHABOD
               Yes, sir... but, do you have these?

     Hardenbrook studies the paper with his one good eye.

                             HARDENBROOK
               Certainly... certainly.

     Hardenbrook nods, handing the list back, grinning.  Ichabod
     stands waiting.  Hardenbrook is still nodding.

                             ICHABOD
               May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?

                             HARDENBROOK
               Hmm?  See them?

                             ICHABOD
               May we look at them now?

                             HARDENBROOK 
               Of course.  You want them... it shall
               not take long.  Wait here.

     Hardenbrook heads across the room.  Ichabod offers the list.

                             ICHABOD
               Maybe you should take this.

                             HARDENBROOK 
               A fine idea.

     Hardenbrook takes it and exits.  Young Masbath sits.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What good is this?

                             ICHABOD 
               To discover what might have been taken
               from those who died, it will help to
               know what was there that could be
               taken in the first place.

     Ichabod waits.  After a moment, he looks uncertain.  He
     crosses to the half-open door...

     INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM -- DAY

     Ichabod sticks his head in, not liking what he sees.

     Hardenbrook's amidst unbelievable disarray.  Tables, shelves,
     and baskets of unevenly piled documents.

     Hardenbrook looks on a shelf, confused, then goes to a table,
     lifting papers, mumbling.

                             HARDENBROOK 
               Damn... damn... damn...

                             ICHABOD
               Master Hardenbrook...

     Hardenbrook turns, a bit startled.

                             ICHABOD 
               Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?

                             HARDENBROOK
               Well... that might be... helpful.

     INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM (TIME CUT) -- DAY

     Hardenbrook is asleep in a chair, snoring, blind eye open.
     Ichabod and Young Masbath face official-looking documents,
     with Ichabod focused on one will in hand.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               My father had farm land.  It was the
               only thing we owned of any value.

                             ICHABOD
                     (still reading) 
               And it now belongs to you, according
               to Baltus.  I heard him say it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Yes.

     Ichabod turns the will in his hand to Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               Then look here at your father's will,
               and tell me why you are not listed.

     Young Masbath takes it, boggled.  Ichabod grabs another.

                             ICHABOD 
               Van Garrett had denoted his elder son
               in his last wishes; the same son
               murdered along with him.  But Van
               Garrett's wife and two infant children
               are not written... and they were spared.
                     (picks up another will)
               Do you see?  Philipse had no family to
               bestow his farm to.  But, here...
                     (picks up another) 
               The Widow Windsor was listed on her
               late husband's will.  After her
               inheritance, she amended the document
               to include her bastard child.  This is
               why the Horseman made absolutely
               certain to impale the unborn descendant.

     Ichabod sits back.

                             ICHABOD 
               Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that
               the Horseman slaughters by assignment.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               But, if the farm is not mine, who stole
               it away?

                             ICHABOD 
               No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has
               gone intestate.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               In test... what?

                             ICHABOD 
               Intestate.  Your farm... all the
               farms... they belong to no one.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What does it mean?

     Ichabod stares off.

                             ICHABOD 
               Often in such cases, property which
               has gone intestate legally passes to
               whomever the deceased was indebted to.
               And, who in this town is owed a great
               many debts?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
                     (realization) 
               Baltus Van Tassel.

                             ICHABOD 
               Did your father take a loan?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.

     Ichabod stands, grim, gathering wills and his ledger.

                             ICHABOD 
               Tonight, we answer questions.  And, to
               discover who moves about the Van Tassel
               house after dark... all we need is a
               candle.

     A LOUD NOISE is HEARD from the other room.  Ichabod looks.

     INT.  HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY

     Ichabod bursts in.  No one there.  A chair has been knocked
     over and the front door is ajar.  Ichabod moves...

     EXT.  NOTARY -- DAY

     Ichabod exits.  All around is the commotion in the square as
     before.  No telling who it was who just fled.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY

     Young Masbath is seated, bored.  Ichabod writes in his
     ledger.  A KNOCK on the door.  They both look up.

                             KATRINA (o.s.)
                     (from outside door)
               Constable... are you there?
                     (long pause)
               Ichabod?

     The knob is tried and found locked.  Pause.  At the bottom of
     the door, a red rose is passed under.

     This saddens Ichabod.


     EXT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Quiet night.  The church is a sight, with a yard resembling
     an empty squatter's tent city, surrounded by crosses.
     Boarded over windows leak shafts of light.

     MOVING PAST THE WINDOWS: many eyes peer out from the slats.

     UP IN THE BELFRY, TWO RIFLEMEN are on watch.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Masbath are in darkness, still waiting.  Ichabod
     takes the cover off a lantern, looks at a clock.  Midnight,
     straight up.  Ichabod stands, picks up an unlit candle.

                             ICHABOD
               Midnight seems an appropriate time.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Young Masbath look out, cautious.  They move to
     the nearest door.

     Ichabod crouches, using the candle to mark the seam of the
     door and door frame.  He's making a low, wax seal.  If the
     door opens, the seal will break.

     They move to a second door, quietly.  Ichabod makes another
     low wax mark.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, MAIN ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs to a hall.  Ichabod
     continues his wax marking at each door.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, BALTUS' OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Young Masbath enter, shutting the door.  Ichabod
     walks to shelves at Baltus' desk, looks through ribbon bound
     DOCUMENTS and hands some to Masbath.

     Young Masbath pulls off the ribbon, pages through these "LOAN
     AGREEMENT" parchments.  Ichabod brings another pile.

                             ICHABOD
                     (whispering)
               They are alphabetical.

     Young Masbath has the M's.  "MARYIE," "MEGAPOLENISIS," AND
     "MELYN..." Not finding what he wants.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               There is no Masbath here.  My father's
               loan papers are missing.

                             ICHABOD
                     (regarding his documents) 
               There are none for Magistrate Philipse
               either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter,
               Thomas" "Pos, William."

     A FLOORBOARD CREAKS.  Ichabod looks, blows out the lantern.
     He and Young Masbath stand frozen.

     Across the room, light comes under the door, stops, then
     continues.  A DOOR is HEARD OPENING and SHUTTING.  Ichabod
     crosses to follow, pointing back.

                             ICHABOD 
               Keep looking.  Then, hide in my room
               and bolt the door till I return.


     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Lantern light moves, far ahead.  Ichabod follows.

     EXT.  FOREST, FURTHER ON -- NIGHT

     Ichabod stops, hidden.  He can see the light ahead, but it is
     no longer in motion.  He advances.

     EXT.  FOREST CLEARING -- NIGHT

     A lantern sits on a rock.  On a blanket, a semi-naked MAN and
     semi-naked WOMAN are in the midst of rough SEX.

     Ichabod crawls to peer from underbrush.

     The couple keeps coupling, with the man on top.  His grunts
     and gasps are particularly desperate.  He's all over the
     woman, who lays back... it is Lady van Tassel.

     Ichabod swallows, inches closer.

     Lady van Tassel pulls the man's shirt, exposes his flesh.
     She raises a small, sharp KNIFE behind his back.

     Ichabod's eyes widen.

     Lady Van Tassel brings the blade to her own hand, slicing
     deep in her palm.  Blood flows.  She rubs her cut hand over
     her partner's arching back, smearing blood.

     Lady van Tassel caresses the man's chest, neck, face...
     trailing blood.  The man lifts his head, in ecstasy, sucks
     the woman's bloody fingers... it's Clergyman Steenwyck.

     Ichabod backs away, having seen more than plenty.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath unlocks the door.  Ichabod enters.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               I was getting worried.  Who was it?

                             ICHABOD 
               Lady Van Tassel.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What was she doing?

                             ICHABOD 
               Something I really wish I had not seen.
               Never mind it.  Did you find the
               victims' loan agreements?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               No.  They are all missing.

     This troubles Ichabod.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               There is more, though.  While you were
               gone, I could hear someone else
               walking through the house.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Young Masbath creep round a corner.  Going to the
     LAST DOOR, Ichabod crouches, eyes narrowing...

                             ICHABOD
                     (whispers, to himself) 
               Katrina.

     The wax seal is broken, flecks of wax on the floor.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER AND HALL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs, checking all the wax
     marks.  Young Masbath finds one broken.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Here.

     Ichabod comes over, pushes the door...

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     They enter.  The kitchen is empty.  Ichabod crosses to
     another door, crouches.  Another broken wax mark.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT

     They enter... the room with the elaborate loom.  Ichabod
     moves his lantern to make a quick search, goes to table.

     He touches the top of a candle.  His finger comes away with a
     bit of still wet wax.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               There are no other doors.  This is as
               far as she could have gone.

                             ICHABOD 
               It is nothing.  She comes to read books,
               so her father will not find her.
                     (to convince himself) 
               It is absolutely nothing.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What books?

                             ICHABOD 
               Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does
               not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be
               long before Lady Van Tassel returns.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               But, sir... what books?  Where are they?

     Ichabod stops, looking around.  No books anywhere.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               If there is a secret place for books...
               it could be just as good for the
               missing loan agreements.

     Ichabod ponders this without saying anything.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     SEARCH MONTAGE:

     - Drawers are opened and searched, quietly.
     - Young Masbath uses a candle to look up the fireplace.
     - Ichabod opens a linen cabinet, unfolding blankets.
     - Young Masbath looks in a closet filled with big spools of
     sewing thread, on his knees, pulls a wooden box forward.
     Inside it, he finds only old cups and silverware.

     Ichabod pulls up a rug, feeling along the floorboards.

     Young Masbath crawls, doing the same.  He climbs under the
     loom, tapping on the floor.  TAP... TAP... TAP...

     He crawls further under the loom.  TAP... TAP... PLONK.  A
     hollow sound.  He taps again... PLONK... PLONK.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Constable.

     Ichabod comes over as Young Masbath lifts a loose board.
     Under the floor, there are piles of books.  Masbath brings
     them up, handing them to Ichabod, who studies the spines.

     Young Masbath reaches in up to his shoulder.  He comes up
     with "LOAN AGREEMENTS."

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Fie!  Here they are.

     Ichabod takes them.  Names are near the top: "Masbath," "Van
     Garret," "Philipse," and "Killian."

     Ichabod sits back, numb, his heart bitterly broken.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING

     Lady Van Tassel prepares food with two servants at the open
     fireplace/oven.  Ichabod enters, rushed.

                             ICHABOD 
               Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina
               is not in her room.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               No.  She has gone out.

                             ICHABOD 
               Where?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               She has taken the last of our grain
               to be milled.
                     (crossing to him) 
               You do have a background in the
               medical arts, don't you, Constable?

                             ICHABOD
               Very little.  I must be going...

     Lady Van Tassel holds out her cut palm, the gash sewn shut.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Will you look at this?  I cut my hand
               this morning: I sewed it myself, but
               I am afraid it will go bad.

     Ichabod takes her hand, distracted and nervous.

                             ICHABOD
               It appears well.  It has already
               clotted.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Look closer.  Do you have anything to
               clean it with?

                             ICHABOD
               It is fine.  Now, I must...

     Lady Van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the wrist, tight.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
                     (whispering, close) 
               I know you saw me.

                             ICHABOD
               What... ?

     Lady Van Tassel glances to servants, keeps her voice low.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               I know you followed last night.  You
               must promise not to tell Baltus...

     Ichabod tries to pull away, but she grips tighter.  The FRONT
     DOOR is HEARD SLAMMING.  Ichabod is panicky.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Have mercy on me.  Please... have mercy.

     Ichabod pulls away just as Baltus enters.  Lady Van Tassel
     goes back to work as if nothing happened.

                             BALTUS 
               Constable, it is urgent that we speak.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE FRONT PORCH -- MORNING

     Baltus leads Ichabod to the porch.

                             BALTUS 
               Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a
               meeting.  This time he is determined
               to have you forced out, or worse.

                             ICHABOD 
               How did you hear this?

                             BALTUS
               He came to me.  He promised great
               violence.  Said I should cast you out
               for my own protection.
                     (troubled pause)
               I must speak honestly.  There is no
               reason to think he will not meet with
               success.

     Ichabod looks to barn, sees Masbath bringing the horses.  The
     CHURCH BELL is HEARD TOLLING far away.

                             BALTUS 
               That is the meeting bell already
               calling.  With the murder of Killian
               and Brom, no one sees any good from
               you.  If... if you were to leave...
               you might be saving your own life.

     Ichabod studies Baltus, then offers his hand.  They shake.

                             ICHABOD 
               I appreciate your concern.  I thank
               you, sir.

     Ichabod hurries off, across the lawn, exasperated.  He runs.
     Masbath runs to him.  Ichabod takes Gunpowder and climbs up.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
                     (mounting his horse) 
               What now?  Where is she?

                             ICHABOD 
               Things have become complicated.
               Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead,
               find her and bring her to meet me
               outside the church.  Find her at all
               costs.  Quickly.

     They ride, fast.


     EXT.  FOREST -- DAY

     A conjuring pile of straw burns.  Gloved hands unfold a paper
     filled with clippings of human hair.  The hair is sprinkled
     on the fire.

     A cloaked FIGURE is kneeled at the pile.  The figure turns to
     remove A human SKULL from a cloth bag.

     The skull is placed at center in the flames.  It's teeth are
     sharp, cut to points.  The HORSEMAN'S SKULL.


     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     In the church yard refugee camp, food is prepared over fire.
     People inhabit the tents.

     INT.  CHURCH, STEENWYCK'S QUARTERS -- MORNING

     IN THE CHURCH: it's crowded with families.  Pews filled with
     bedding and belongings.  Steenwyck comes to CLOSE the DOUBLE
     DOORS of his quarters, turning, angry.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               You are astonishing, Constable.  Do
               you truly think your ridiculous
               accusations frighten me?

     Ichabod is doing nothing to hide his disdain.

                             ICHABOD 
               Only if I repeat them outside this
               room.  And, I will if I must...
                     (points to doors) 
               Out there, for all to hear.  Or...
               you may speak, as planned.  But, you
               tell them you feel compelled to move
               on to greener pastures.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               No.  You will not run me out.  No one
               will believe a word of what you say.

                             ICHABOD 
               Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does
               not travel alone for long here.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free
               thinker who does not believe in
               divinity.

                             ICHABOD 
               It is only important what you are.
               An adulterer...

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               I am the Lord's voice in this town.

                             ICHABOD
               Wallowing in sin and lust...

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               They need guidance.

                             ICHABOD 
               Wallowing quite literally in blood.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
                     (snapping, quaking) 
               Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!

                             ICHABOD 
               He may.  But, not soon enough for
               you, and not on your behalf.

     Ichabod walks.  Steenwyck is humiliated.

                             ICHABOD 
               You are so upset now... and yet, you
               seemed in such good spirits last night.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!

                             ICHABOD 
               Climb to the top of the tallest ladder
               you can find, Father.  That is the
               closest you ever come to God.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Pews are packed.  Steenwyck enters, walks to the altar.
     EVERYONE QUIETS.  Steenwyck has composed himself, barely.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               My friends... dear friends.  Those of
               you still on your farms, I thank you
               for coming.

     He sees Ichabod near the back.  THUNDER is HEARD OUTSIDE.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               I... I address unfortunate business. 
                     (pause) 
               I am forced to take my leave from
               Sleepy Hollow.  I will be moving on to
               do the Lord's work elsewhere.

     The GATHERERS MURMUR shock.  Ichabod walks out.


     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY

     Raining hard.  Baltus and Lady Van Tassel ride.

                             BALTUS 
               Hurry along.  The meeting has most
               certainly already begun.  We do not
               want Steenwyck as our enemy.

     Lady Van Tassel trails.  WOOD is HEARD SPLINTERING...

     Just off the road, a tree falls...

     The trunk catches Lady Van Tassel's horse on its rear flank.

     The horse falls.  Lady Van Tassel hits the dirt.

     Baltus looks back, halting.

     Lady Van Tassel looks up to Baltus in fear, then turns.

     Behind her, the Headless Horseman trots from, the forest on
     Daredevil, stops.  Calm.  He takes his axe in hand.


     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Storming.  The meeting is letting out.  Near the churchyard
     gate, Young Masbath rides with Katrina following on a horse
     cart.  Ichabod walks up as Katrina dismounts.

                             KATRINA 
               What is so urgent?

                             ICHABOD 
               Come with me.

     Ichabod leads her to where they can talk away from others.

                             KATRINA 
               Why have I not seen your face for so
               long?  You look much better.

     She touches his face, but he takes her hand, places the loan
     agreements there.

                             ICHABOD 
               Explain these.  I found them secreted
               away in the sewing room.

     Katrina's expression changes just so slightly to guilt.

                             ICHABOD 
               Why... why have I scrambled and run
               and clawed in all directions, only to
               find you against me?

     He stares at her.  Katrina stares back, in a small way
     defeated.  She looks for an out, but there is none.

                             KATRINA
               I have been reading your journal.
               I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating
               to resist. 
                     (pause, ashamed) 
               I rode to catch up with you at the
               Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I
               found you though, I overheard what you
               were said.

                             ICHABOD 
               It was you there?

                             KATRINA 
               When... when you spoke father's name
               along with accusations, I could not
               believe it.  I had to hide these... at
               least till I could confront him myself.

                             ICHABOD 
               And, what did he say?

                             KATRINA 
               He did not do these things.  If you
               knew him, you would realize...

                             ICHABOD 
               What did he say, Katrina?

                             KATRINA 
               I have not been able to face him yet.

                             ICHABOD 
               The loans give the land to your father.
               It does not matter survivors are still
               on their farms.  They could be thrown
               off... tomorrow... a year from now.

                             KATRINA 
               Yes, I have seen that, and I told you
               why I hid them.

                             ICHABOD 
               What would you have me believe?

                             KATRINA
                     (tiring, angry) 
               If you think I am behind this, say it.

                             ICHABOD 
               The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You
               share that name.

                             KATRINA 
               Call me a liar, then, and a murderess.
               Say it, out and out.

     Many people are starting to notice the confrontation.

                             ICHABOD 
               Katrina...

                             KATRINA 
               Speak the words, Constable.  What is
               stopping you?  What has happened to your
               ability to transcend sentimentality?

     Emotions tear at him.  Rain seems to pound down harder.

                             KATRINA 
               Oh, no.  No.  Please... don't dare stand
               looking as if you still care for me,
               after all that you have said.  If I were
               to confess, would that ease your
               suffering?  Would that make it easier
               for you to hate me?!

     A TORTURED CRY is HEARD O.S.

     Baltus comes charging through the square on his horse.

                             BALTUS
               The Horseman is coming!

     He's barely hanging on.  He stops, practically falling off,
     running towards Katrina and Ichabod.

                             BALTUS
               Save me...

                             KATRINA
               Father?

                             BALTUS
               He killed her...

     Baltus grasps Katrina, fearful.  HOOFBEATS are HEARD.

                             BALTUS
               The Horseman has killed her.

     Far behind, the Horseman rides to follow, axe held up.
     Instant mayhem -- people scatter all directions, screaming.

     Baltus runs headlong to the church.

                             KATRINA
               Father!

     Katrina runs after Baltus.  Ichabod backs away, watching the
     Horseman come, then heads to the church with Masbath.

     Baltus pushes through the iron gate, into tent city, joining
     the swarm of townsfolk pouring into the church.

     The Horseman rides behind, closing the gap.  Men, women and
     children run for cover all along the square.

     Amidst the churchyard panic, Ichabod looks back...

     The Horseman reaches the open gate and Daredevil suddenly
     rears up, snorting, unwilling to enter.

     The Horseman grabs Daredevil's reins, tries to move forward
     again.  Same result.  Daredevil freaks out.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Baltus makes his way in, shoving.  People are still clamoring
     in through the doors.

     Men pass rifles from stockpiles and climb onto pews at
     boarded windows.  Women herd children into a cellar.

     Baltus searches for a hiding place.  He looks across the
     church to see Steenwyck closing the doors of his living
     quarters.  Baltus moves...

                             BALTUS 
               Steenwyck!

     At the front doors, Katrina squeezes in with Ichabod and
     Young Masbath just as people are forcing the doors closed.
     It's madness.  People outside begin pounding.

     Katrina searches.

                             KATRINA 
               Father!

     Ichabod goes to a window, looking out between boards.

     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Across the yard, the Horseman gives his axe an underhand toss
     to the ground inside the gate.

     The AXE instantly BEGINS TO DEGRADE TO DUST in the rain.

     The Horseman rides, keeping outside the fence.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Ichabod comes away from the window, looking to panicked
     citizens.  He sees Katrina moving up the aisle...

     She's heading towards Baltus, who slams against the door to
     Steenwyck's room.

                             BALTUS 
               Damn you, Steenwyck!  Help me!
               Let me in!

     RIFLES BOOM LOUDLY as men at the windows begin firing.

     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     The Horseman circles, under fire.

     Great clouds of gun smoke shoot from the church.

     Men fire down from the belfry.

     Parts of the Horseman and Daredevil splatter red into the
     rain as slugs hit without effect.

     AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHURCH, the Horseman comes around,
     heading to the town square.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Rifleman shout to each other, running to the opposite windows
     to follow the Horseman.

     Young Masbath grabs a rifle and leaps to join the brigade.

     Baltus is still beating Steenwyck's door when a HUGE FARMER
     grips Baltus angrily and throws him...

                             HUGE FARMER 
               You'll kill us all!

     Baltus falls, knocking over pews.  Katrina's nearby.

                             HUGE FARMER 
               You're the one the Horseman wants.
               Why should we die for you!?

                             KATRINA
               NO!

     The huge farmer picks Baltus up, dragging him and shoving
     Katrina aside as she approaches.

     Ichabod's pushing past people, trying to reach them.

     EXT.  CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- DAY

     The Horseman brings Daredevil to a halt, yanking a large coil
     of ROPE off a hitching post.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     The huge farmer shoves Baltus to the floor again.

                             HUGE FARMER
               Get out!

     Others join the rage, pulling Baltus towards the front of the
     church, shouting.  Ichabod struggles to push them off.

                             ICHABOD 
               Stop this!

     Ichabod gets to Baltus' side, trying to protect.

                             ICHABOD 
               The Horseman cannot enter!  It does
               not matter who he wants, he cannot
               cross the gate!

     At the windows, ONE RIFLEMAN turns, crying out.

                             ONE RIFLEMAN 
               He's coming back!

     More panic.  The huge farmer moves towards Baltus.

                             HUGE FARMER 
               We have to save ourselves!

     Baltus pulls the pistol from Ichabod's holster, brandishing.

                             BALTUS 
               No!  Get away from me!

     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     The Horseman rides past the front, fired upon.

     He halts at the wrought iron gate, reaching to yank off one
     POST which is pointed on top, like an arrow head.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Baltus holds everyone's back with the pistol.

                             BALTUS 
               The next person to lay hands on me
               will have a bullet.  Stand off!

                             KATRINA
               Father...

                             BALTUS 
               No!  We're safe here.
                     (points at Ichabod) 
               You said it.  The Horseman will not
               have me.

     CRASH, the harpoon-like post SPEARS through a window,
     trailing rope tied to it...

     CRACK -- SKEWERS Baltus from behind, the bloodied point
     bursting out his breast bone.

     Baltus looks down, drops the gun... clutching the post with
     both hands.  Blood streams out his mouth.  Katrina screams.

     The rope yanks Baltus back.  He SLAMS into the WINDOW...

     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Baltus CRASHES out, hits the ground, dragged...

     Outside the fence, Daredevil runs with the rope tied around
     his saddle pommel.  The Horseman strides forward, sword out.

     Baltus SLAMS the fence and the rope snaps.  He is held there
     awkwardly, gurgling blood.

     The Horseman reaches Baltus... chops off his head.


     INT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS -- DAY

     The storm has passed.  Empty forest.  Long, peaceful pause,
     till Ichabod makes his way through, searching the ground.

     Ichabod comes to look down a small hill.  The corpse of Lady
     Van Tassel lies headless, in a dirty, torn dress.

     Ichabod walks to the body.  Lady Van Tassel's arm is twisted
     behind.  The sewn cut on the palm of her hand faces up.

                             ICHABOD
                     (shouting back)
               Here!  I have found her...
                     (looking at corpse,
                      quiet and miserable)
               Here she is.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL -- EARLY EVENING

     Doctor Lancaster comes out from where Katrina is asleep.  He
     closes the door, wipes his sweaty face.  Ichabod waits.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               It has been a terrible jolt to her
               nerves.

                             ICHABOD 
               You will stay at her side?

     Doctor Lancaster nods.  Ichabod walks.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- EARLY EVENING

     It's getting dark.  Ichabod comes out and crosses the porch.
     A few of the Hollow's residents are here.  Young Masbath gets
     up and follows Ichabod onto the lawn.

     Ichabod walks without waiting.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               She's the one who controlled the
               Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
                     (no answer)

                             ICHABOD 
               I need time for thinking.  Without you
               hanging on my coattails for a change.

     Ichabod keeps walking.  Young Masbath stops, wounded.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod stands holding a torch, looking up.  The whole area
     is bright from the light off a giant fire.

     There are broken lanterns and barrels around the agonized,
     twisted tree.  The tree is aflame, fire dancing up the trunk,
     and through every branch to lick the sky.


     EXT.  FOREST -- DAY

     Dawn.  Ichabod is seated overlooking the Hudson.  He stares
     at the beauty around him, brooding through bleary eyes.
     Gunpowder is tied to a tree.  BIRDS SING.

     The ledger is open in Ichabod's lap.  He thumbs pages
     absently, just keeps staring off.

     EXT.  FOREST -- DAY (TIME CUT)

     A fire burns in a circle of rocks.  Ichabod's ledger is
     thrown in.  The pages catch quickly.

     Ichabod watches, then walks away.  He's about to climb onto
     Gunpowder, but on second thought he opens his satchel and
     digs out a BOOK.  He walks back to the fire, throws it on...

     "Romeo and Juliet."  Flames devour it.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY

     The clearing is silent.  The twisted tree still stands,
     smoldering, impressive as ever, or perhaps even more so with
     the alien appearance its blackened skin now affords it.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod packs up baggage.  Young Masbath is miserable.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Won't you change your mind, sir?
               What can I say to convince you?

                             ICHABOD 
               Nothing.  To hell with this place
               and all the people here.

     Ichabod closes a bag, throws it with others.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Why... why are you like this?

                             ICHABOD
                     (pause, softening) 
               You do not know all that has happened.
                     (pause) 
               You cannot understand.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT

     A coach, with Gunpowder as one of its team, waits in the
     orchard.  Van Ripper comes to meet Ichabod and Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               Half now.  Half when we reach the
               city.

     Ichabod hands Van Ripper money.  Van Ripper takes the
     baggage.  Ichabod looks to the Manor House.  Only one light
     shines, in a second floor window.

     Katrina can be seen there a moment as she closes curtains.

     Ichabod turns to Young Masbath, who is beginning to cry.

                             ICHABOD 
               This is farewell.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Take me with you.  There's nothing
               left for me here.

                             ICHABOD 
               I cannot.
                     (bends to Masbath) 
               You should not worry.
                     (pause, sorrow) 
               Van Ripper and his wife will look
               after you.  They will.  You will be
               well cared for.

     Young Masbath hugs.  Ichabod hugs back, swallowing.

                             ICHABOD
               I am sorry.
                     (quietly) 
               Forgive me.  I failed you.

     Ichabod releases and goes quickly away, finding this misery
     unbearable.  He climbs in the coach.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Do not go, Constable.  How can you
               leave?

     INSIDE THE COACH, Ichabod slumps back in darkness and closes
     his eyes.  He pounds twice on the coach wall.

     OUTSIDE, Van Ripper whips the reins.  The coach starts.
     Young Masbath follows.  The coach picks up speed on the long
     straight road.

     Young Masbath stops, wiping tears.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Ichabod's coach moves through the town square.  A few people
     in the churchyard's tent city come out to watch it pass.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     The door is pushed open.  Young Masbath enters, looks around
     the empty room.  He goes to sit in a chair at the work table,
     crossing his arms and resting his head.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

     A plate of food sits untouched.  Katrina is slumped down in a
     chair, heartbroken, staring into the fireplace.

     Behind her, a shadow moves across the room.


     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT

     Van Ripper leads the coach through the stone pillars marking
     the entrance of Sleepy Hollow.

     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT

     Ichabod takes off his hat, sets it on the seat.  The window
     between him and the driver slides open.

                             VAN RIPPER 
               Sir... this is yours.
                     (offering something) 
               The Van Tassel girl said to give it
               to you after you were gone.

     Ichabod takes it.  It is the bird/cage spinning toy.  He
     studies it.  What melancholy.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Katrina sits with her eyes closed.  A BOARD is HEARD
     CREAKING.  She sits up. Suddenly, a FIGURE in black is behind
     her as she turns.  WHACK! -- a gloved fist strikes.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     A dull THUD is HEARD downstairs, like a body falling.  Young
     Masbath takes notice.  He moves to the door...


     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT

     Ichabod turns the strings on the bird/cage toy, ponders it.

     The paper disk spins, images flickering until the bird
     appears to be inside the cage.

     Ichabod keeps spinning it, looks out the window.

     A tear rolls down his cheek.

     The bird cage toy's rotation slows... stops.

     Ichabod looks at it a long moment, then pockets it and leans
     forward to the window at front.

     OUTSIDE THE COACH

     Ichabod's face appears behind Van Ripper.

                             ICHABOD
               Van Ripper, turn the coach about!

                             VAN RIPPER
               What did you say?

                             ICHABOD
               Turn around.  Now!


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER -- NIGHT

     Young	Masbath comes down the stairs, looking around meekly.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Hello?  Katrina?

     Masbath starts down a hall.  He does not see, in another
     room, Katrina's body is dragged across the floor.


     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

     The coach comes to Lancaster's.  Ichabod climbs out before it
     even stops fully, satchel in hand.  He hurries...

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT

     Doctor Lancaster, half asleep, comes to answer BANGING on his
     door.  Ichabod pushes past, taking Lancaster's lantern.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon the intrusion...

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod enters.  There are two coffins on the floor.

                             ICHABOD
               I never examined these bodies.

     Ichabod removes the lid from one coffin.  Lancaster is about
     to say something indignant, but then just looks disgusted.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               ... help yourself, you pompous ass.
               I will be in bed.

                             ICHABOD
               Would you stay, doctor?  I may need
               assistance.

     Lancaster reluctantly remains.  Ichabod stares at the dead
     Lady Van Tassel.  The neck wound is covered by a stained
     brown cloth, which Ichabod unwraps.

                             ICHABOD
               Stains of blood.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               What of it?

     Ichabod takes out one of the lenses that survived the
     magnification spectacles, bends to examine the neck.

                             ICHABOD
               Jagged flesh. 
                     (pause)
               The Horseman did not do this.

     Ichabod moves to the side of the coffin, lifting the hand
     with the stitched gash on its palm.

                             ICHABOD
               Here, Doctor.  Hold this just so...

     Lancaster holds the lens so that Ichabod can study the cut
     through it.  Ichabod takes a scalpel-like knife from his
     satchel, lifts the hand and cuts stitches.

     THROUGH THE LENS: the gash spreads easily, soft, bloodless.

                             ICHABOD 
               No clotting or gathering of pus.  No
               healing at all.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               What?

                             ICHABOD 
               When this cut was made, this person
               was already dead.
                     (stands straight)
               This is not Lady Van Tassel.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath enters.  The door swings shut.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Katrina.
                     (steps forward) 
               Is anyone here?

     Behind him, the door SLAMS open -- Lady Van Tassel reaches to
     grab Young Masbath by the throat.


     EXT.  CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod charges up to the church doors, pounding.

                             ICHABOD
               Open the door.  Open up, damn it!
                     (pounds, shouting)
               Lady van Tassel is alive.  The Horseman
               is her puppet.  Please... 

     The door opens and Huge Farmer points a rifle at Ichabod.
     Frightened people peer out from behind.

                             HUGE FARMER 
               Aren't we rid of you?

                             ICHABOD 
               Listen to me.  Lady Van Tassel has
               faked her death.  I need able men...

                             HUGE FARMER
               She's dead, and you have gone mad.

                             ICHABOD
               No...

                             HUGE FARMER 
                     (steps forward) 
               Get out!  Isn't it enough that you have
               ruined this town?  Go!

     Ichabod backs away from the gun, frustrated, runs...

     At the DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, Van Ripper is still on the coach.
     Ichabod sprints over, breathless, taking out his pistol.

                             ICHABOD
               Van Ripper... do you have a gun?

                             VAN RIPPER
               Yes.  Here...

     Van Ripper hold up a rifle.  Ichabod holds out his hand.

                             ICHABOD 
               May I see it?

     Van Ripper's confused, but hands the rifle over.  Ichabod
     immediately points his pistol at Van Ripper.

                             ICHABOD
               Get down.  Hurry!

     Van Ripper climbs off.  Ichabod climbs up, whips the horses.

                             ICHABOD 
               Sorry.

     Van Ripper watches the coach leave, still with his hands up.


     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     In a wooded area, Katrina lies unconscious.  Gloved hands
     reach to her hair and cut off a clump with SCISSORS.

     A conjuring pile has been made, containing a small animal's
     heart with an iron nail through it.  Katrina's hair is added
     and the pile is lit to burn.

     Nearby, Young Masbath watches, on his belly with his hands
     tied behind his back.

     Lady Van Tassel whispers over the fire, her white horse tied
     nearby.  She looks to Katrina, who stirs.

     Lady Van Tassel takes the Horseman's skull from a bag over
     her shoulder, places the skull in the flames.  THUNDER is
     HEARD.  Lady Van Tassel looks up, smiles.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT

     The wind tosses leaves in swirls.  The twisted tree opens
     wide, with a RUMBLE -- shafts of light shooting out.

     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod drives the coach hard ahead.

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Katrina sits up, groggy.  Lady Van Tassel looks down at her.

                             KATRINA 
               You... you are alive.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath
               dead along with me?

     Katrina sees Young Masbath, and beyond him, the dying fire.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               She commands the Horseman.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               And, quite beautifully done, wouldn't
               you say?  It is almost over.

     THUNDER again.  Wind starts to pick up.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
                     (of the wind) 
               He rides tonight.

                             KATRINA 
               Father saw you die.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman
               looming over me as I fled.  Things I
               wanted him to see.  But, as long as
               I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm
               me.  Baltus did not stay enough to
               see that.  He ran as a coward,
               unfettered by my fate.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Then, whose body was it... ?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               The precious servant girl Sarah.  I
               killed her and kept her body hidden,
               till I needed it.  And, when I
               return to the Hollow tomorrow, my
               version of the truth will come to
               pass. 
                     (faking meekness) 
               I mean, there I was that fateful day,
               following Baltus into the woods.  I
               did not know what he was up to...
               where he was going.  I worried for
               his safety.

     Katrina cautiously moves the hand she's supporting herself
     with, feels a rock and clutches it.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Imagine my surprise, finding him on a
               liason with a common servant.  A girl
               who had apparently become his secret
               love.

                             KATRINA 
               No one will believe your lies, whore.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               This whore will see your mouth shut
               forever very soon.  But... I am not
               going to kill you.  Not me...

     She picks up the Horseman's skull in her gloved hand.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               He will have that honor.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- NIGHT

     The Horseman rides Daredevil, a freight train of moldering
     flesh, heading towards a chasm with no bridge.

     They reach it, galloping in mid-air to the other side.

     EXT.  LONG STRAIGHT ROAD/VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod guides the coach into the Van Tassel orchard.

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Lady Van Tassel admires the skull.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL  
                     (mock sorrow) 
               Woe is me... that spying on my husband
               in his filthy indiscretion, I saw he
               and Sarah attacked by the Horseman.
               Oh pity me... so overcome was I that
               I wandered in the Western Woods...
               dazed... nearly blind from terror.

     Lady Van Tassel crouches, rubbing dirt on her face.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               And, tomorrow is my grand performance,
               having barely survived the elements...
                     (more emoting) 
               By sheer luck I found my way back to
               the Hollow.  But... what do I find
               here... ?  My dear, sweet step-daughter
               Katrina is dead.  Why has God forsaken
               her?

     Seeing that Lady Van Tassel lavish attention on Katrina,
     Masbath takes this opportunity to ease onto his knees.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
                     (of herself, pleased) 
               No one will suspect this sad woman who
               has been through such an ordeal.  With
               only the empty solace of her money and
               land to comfort her.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod leaps from the coach, bounds up the porch.

                             ICHABOD
               Katrina!

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     ICHABOD is HEARD.  Lady Van Tassel turns, astonished.

                             KATRINA
               Murderer!

     Katrina slings the rock -- strikes Lady Van Tassel in the
     head, a glancing blow that knocks her down.  Katrina runs.

     Katrina grips Young Masbath, helping him up...

     But, Lady Van Tassel scrambles up, grabs Katrina and throws
     her back to the ground.

     Lady Van Tassel steps hard on Katrina's ankle, touches her
     forehead, bleeding, pissed.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               You've been a naughty girl.

     Young Masbath leaps to action, charging head first -- slams
     into Lady Van Tassel, sends her backwards.

     Katrina runs and pulls Masbath up.  They flee.

                             KATRINA 
               Ichabod!

     Lady Van Tassel rolls, recovering, not very concerned.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Little bitch.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod comes out the open front doors... hearing...

                             KATRINA (o.s.) 
                     (far away) 
               Ichabod!

     Ichabod climbs back on the coach, taking off.

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Katrina and Young Masbath run out from a line of trees.

                             KATRINA 
               Ichabod!

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Here we are!

     BEHIND IN THE FOREST, Lady Van Tassel rides her white horse,
     in no hurry.  Wind kicks hard.  HOOFBEATS are HEARD.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Run, Katrina!  Fast as your pretty
               legs will carry you.  It makes no
               difference.

     ON THE LAWN, Ichabod drives towards Katrina and Masbath.

     Behind, at the tree line, Lady Van Tassel holds up the
     Horseman's skull, wind tossing her dress and hair.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Nothing will stop him now!

     At mid-field, Ichabod reaches Katrina and Masbath.

                             ICHABOD
               Climb up!

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Lady Van Tassel...

                             ICHABOD
               I know.  Hold on.

     With Katrina and Masbath on board, Ichabod turns the coach.
     Katrina unties Masbath's hands.  HOOFBEATS GET LOUDER.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Olly-olly oxen-free!

     Ichabod looks back towards Lady Van Tassel.

     At the treeline, the Horseman breaks into the open, hell on
     horseback.  Full speed ahead.

                             ICHABOD
               Christ.


     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT

     The coach hits the long straight road, away from the house.

     Katrina and Masbath hold on as the coach shakes violently.

                             KATRINA
               Where are we going?

                             ICHABOD
               I do not know.  Away.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Here he comes!

     Behind, the Horseman can be seen on the forest bordered road.
     Closing fast.  Breakneck pace.

                             ICHABOD
               We might make it to the church.

     Masbath takes a lantern, crawls back to the roof.

                             KATRINA
               Masbath... !

     He ignores, reaching the rear of the coach and throwing the
     lantern at the Horseman.  It smashes on the trail.

                             ICHABOD
               Damn it, boy, get back here!

     Young Masbath slides back.  Katrina helps him.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               What can we do?

                             ICHABOD
               Take the reins.

     Young Masbath takes them.  Ichabod slings Van Ripper's rifle
     over his shoulder and starts back.  Katrina grips him.

                             ICHABOD
               Masbath is right.  We must do something.

     She releases.  Ichabod gets to the luggage area at the rear,
     struggling to open a storage box.

     Behind, the Horseman draws his sword, closer.

     Ichabod opens the box, hefting out a long, jagged SAW.

                             KATRINA
               Ichabod!

     Ichabod looks.  The Horseman rides up, swinging...

     Ichabod recoils -- THWACK -- just missed by sword.

     The Horseman lets the coach get ahead, shifting to the
     other side of the trail... coming along side.

     Ichabod backpedals, looking to Masbath.

                             ICHABOD
               Keep him off!  Block him!

     Masbath guides the horses over.  The Horseman must fall
     behind to avoid the wheels.

     The coach hits a large, fallen tree trunk.

     Ichabod bounces, falling...

     He hangs off the side of the coach.

     Katrina climbs to offer her hand.  Ichabod offers the saw.

                             ICHABOD
               Take it!

     Katrina takes the saw.  Now with both hands, Ichabod tries
     for better purchase.  He grips the coach door.  It opens...

     Ichabod clings to the open door as branches slam him.

     He's reaching to the coach threshold, reaching...

     Ichabod pulls himself inside.

     BOOM -- the door hits a tree trunk, bashed to pieces.

     Ichabod looks out from the coach, dazed.  He climbs.

     Katrina looks back as Young Masbath guides the coach to block
     the Horseman again.

     The Horseman sheaths his sword, riding... reaching to grip
     the back corner of the coach.

     The Horseman dismounts, clinging, climbing...

     Ichabod takes the rifle off his shoulder, aiming...

     BANG! -- splattering the Horseman's hand point blank.  The
     Horseman hangs on with his other hand.

     The Horseman re-grips with the blasted hand, amazing since
     it's now all mush and bone.

     Ichabod throws the rifle on his way to the driver's perch,
     taking the saw from Katrina.

                             ICHABOD 
               Move forward!

     Katrina looks to the horses, then at Ichabod.

                             ICHABOD
               Go!

     Ichabod takes the reins from Young Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               Help her.

     Reins in one hand and saw in the other, Ichabod waits.  The
     Horseman rises up and moves in, taking out his sword.

     Young Masbath climbs down to the wooden pole connecting the
     coach to the bridles, puts out his hand.  Katrina takes it.

     Behind, the Horseman swings.  Ichabod blocks with the saw.

     Young Masbath guides Katrina as she leaps onto one horse.
     Bareback.  Young Masbath straddles the horse beside her.

     The Horseman swings, backhanded knocks the sword from
     Ichabod's hand as Ichabod falls back...

     Ichabod hits the bridle post, hanging onto straps for dear
     life.  His feet drag on the trail.

     Above, the Horseman comes to the driver's perch, close enough
     to kill Katrina.  He raises his sword...

     Katrina screams, ducking, helpless...

     Below, Ichabod pulls a bolt from the coach's hitching-rod.

     He shoves off with his feet.

     The Horseman swings.... missing.

     The horses detach from the coach, dragging Ichabod along.

     The coach careens out of control.

     It flies off the trail, hits an incline and sails off,
     throwing the Horseman.

     The coach hits a tree trunk and SMASHES.

     FURTHER DOWN THE TRAIL, the coach horses stop.  Young Masbath
     and Katrina climb off as Ichabod gets to his feet, hurting,
     clutching his previously wounded shoulder.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               What now?

                             ICHABOD
               I doubt that's the end.

                             KATRINA
               The church.

                             ICHABOD
               He moves too fast.

     Ichabod unhooks a lantern off the bridle rail.  The trail
     behind is silent, till a bone chilling SCREECH is HEARD.

                             KATRINA
               What was that?

                             ICHABOD
               His horse.

     They start moving.  Ichabod looks around.  He sees...

                             ICHABOD
               There...

     Through the tree line, the Hollow's massive windmill can be
     seen against the sky.  Katrina and Young Masbath run.


     EXT. WINDMILL FIELD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath book into this open area,
     heading to the windmill.  Another HORRIBLE SQUEAL echoes.

     Ichabod looks over his shoulder.

     Heavy, low hanging BRANCHES and VINES at the forest edge
     creep to life, parting... forming a sort of black tunnel.

                             ICHABOD 
               He's coming!

     The Horseman gallops out, throwing leaves in his wake.

                             ICHABOD 
               Hurry!

     The Horseman readies a battle axe.

     Ichabod gets under the windmill, helping Young Masbath up the
     ladder and in.  Katrina next.

     The Horseman is almost there.

     Ichabod follows Katrina.  He gets in, feet dangling.  The
     Horseman dismounts...

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod leaps up and struggles with the heavy trap door...
     slams it.  He closes the latch just as the Horseman hits.
     The door buckles.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               It won't hold.

     Ichabod goes to a large GRINDSTONE against a wall.  He
     struggles to roll it.

     Young Masbath helps him roll it to the trap door.  It falls
     on top with a thud.  The Horseman's sword jabs up through the
     grindstone's center hole.

     The sword withdraws.  A POUNDING begins.

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The Horseman chops at the door with his axe.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     POUNDING CONTINUES.  The grindstone shifts.  Katrina and
     Young Masbath back away.  Ichabod holds his lantern up,
     desperate for ideas, searching.

     Above, to the right, is the milling platform, where grain is
     ground and bagged.  To the left is the crooked staircase.

     Ichabod picks up a bailing hook, a plan forming.  He gives
     his lantern to Katrina and points.

                             ICHABOD 
               Get up those stairs.  Open the door to
               the roof and wait.

     Katrina and Young Masbath obey.  Ichabod crosses and climbs
     the ladder to the milling platform.  He grasps a wooden
     lever, pulling it.  Gears above begin to turn.

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The windmill's rotors CREAK to life, spinning.

     UNDER THE WINDMILL, the Horseman keeps chopping.  His axe
     exposes grindstone, throwing sparks.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Katrina looks down from the stairs.

     The Horseman's axe pries at the seam of the trap door.

                             KATRINA
               Ichabod...

                             ICHABOD
               Keep climbing.  I will follow...

     Ichabod pulls bags of grain, lining them up at the edge of
     the milling platform.

                             ICHABOD
                     (under his breath) 
               Hopefully.

     ABOVE, Young Masbath reaches the ceiling, throws open the
     door to the roof.

     BELOW, Ichabod cuts holes into the grain bags, so milled
     grain spills out and falls to the floor, creating dust.

     He grabs one open bag and dumps it.  More grain dust.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

     Masbath and Katrina come out.  Rotors spin behind them.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod sees below... the Horseman sticks a hand through,
     trying to push the grindstone aside, then withdrawing.  The
     RACKING axe continues.  Won't be long.

     Ichabod grabs one half-full bag of grain, swings it with
     effort, throws...

     The bag smashes on the grindstone, busting the door...

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The grindstone falls through, SLAMMING the Horseman down...

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod slices into a sack hanging from a pulley system.
     More and more dust rises.

     Below, the Horseman enters.  Katrina shouts from above.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Look out!

     The Horseman moves toward the ladder milling platform ladder,
     but Ichabod grabs it, pulling it up...

     The Horseman just misses the final rung.

     Ichabod throws the ladder aside as the Horseman backs off.

     Ichabod looks to the staircase.  No way to climb down from
     the milling platform and get there.

     The Horseman runs and leaps, grabbing a hanging chain...

     The Horseman climbs the chain, swinging...

     Ichabod runs across the platform, jumps...

     Ichabod grasps the frail rail of the staircase, barely.

     The rail creaks, about to break.  Behind, the Horseman lands
     on the milling platform.

     Ichabod is losing grip.  Young Masbath races down the stairs,
     grabs his hand.  He pulls Ichabod up.

     Ichabod's pistol slips from its holster and falls.

     Ichabod and Young Masbath look...

     The Horseman, following Ichabod's lead, runs across the
     milling platform and leaps...

     Grabs the staircase rail, only a few feet from Ichabod and
     Masbath.  Ichabod kicks the rail, breaking it...

     The Horseman falls in billowing dust, crashing below.

     Ichabod pushes Masbath up the stairs.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

     Katrina helps them onto the roof.

                             KATRINA
               Quickly, close it.

                             ICHABOD 
               No.
                     (takes lantern, points) 
               Get to the crest of the roof and be
               ready to jump.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Jump?  Jump where?

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The Horseman runs, agile, up stairs.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

     Ichabod shepherds Katrina and Young Masbath to the edge where
     the rotors spin close.

                             ICHABOD 
               The blades will carry us to the ground.
               Face front and wait for me.

                             KATRINA 
               I... I can't do this.

                             ICHABOD 
               We have no choice.

     Ichabod moves back to the trap door.

     Katrina and Young Masbath look at the rotors, and down at the
     long distance between them and the ground.

                             ICHABOD 
               Be ready...

     Ichabod throws the lantern into the windmill and runs.

                             ICHABOD
               Now!

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The Horseman continues up.  The lantern falls past.

     EXT.  WINDMILL, ROOF -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath jumps.  Ichabod grips Katrina and jumps...

     They hit one rotor and cling to the frame and cloth.  The
     rotor begins its downwards swing.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The lantern hits the ground and shatters.  FLAMES EXPLODE!

     Grain dust is consumed instantaneously -- FLAMES ROAR
     upwards, filling the windmill...

     Engulfing the Horseman.

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The rotor is halfway to its lowest point.  Masbath, Katrina
     and Ichabod hang on as the entire structure trembles.

     BOOM -- flames shoot out the windows, doors and seams,
     lighting up the night.

     On the rattling rotor, Ichabod struggles to hold the frame
     with one hand and keep a grip on Katrina.

     Masbath drops.  Ichabod releases Katrina, then drops.

     They hit the ground.  Ichabod rolls, gasping, holding his
     shoulder.  They all look at each other in disbelief a moment.
     Ichabod lets out a sort of rasping laugh, standing.

                             ICHABOD 
               Okay... come on...

     Ichabod ushers them across the field, uphill.  Running.
     Lightning flashes across the sky.  THUNDER RUMBLES.

     A bolt strikes the windmill, and it EXPLODES...

     SHOCKWAVE DEAFENING.  The rotors bust apart.  Splinters of
     burning wood spin all directions.

     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath keep
     running.  There is a WOODEN CART parked ahead.

     IN THE WINDMILL RUBBLE, the Horseman rises, shoving off
     burning debris.  His flame-ravaged uniform smolders.

     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod stumbles onwards, but notices
     something horrible...

     In the distance, Lady Van Tassel's white horse roams free.

                             ICHABOD
                     (as this registers)
               Oh, no...

     Young Masbath and Katrina are just past the cart when Lady
     Van Tassel rises from behind it, swings a plank...

     SLAMS Ichabod in the chest and sends him down.

     Lady Van Tassel grabs Katrina's hair, drags her.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Should have stayed away, Constable.

     Ichabod gets up slow, furious, reaches to his holster, only
     to find it empty.  He moves forward.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Keep back, or I kill her.

     She takes out scissors, holds them to Katrina's neck.
     Katrina ceases struggling.

     Ichabod keeps Masbath behind him, keeps his distance.  Lady
     Van Tassel shoots a glance...

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               See him...

     Par off, the Horseman strides from the wreckage.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               You cannot kill what is already dead.

                             ICHABOD
               Let her go!

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Yes... yes.  I think I will...

     Lady Van Tassel spins and throws Katrina in the cart, shoving
     against it.

                             ICHABOD
               No!

     The cart rolls downhill.  Ichabod moves forward.

     Lady Van Tassel turns, brandishing the scissors, slashing and
     missing.  Ichabod backs off.

     DOWNHILL, the cart picks up speed, headed for the Horseman.

     The Horseman starts running to meet it.

     UPHILL, Lady Van Tassel grins.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Say goodbye to her.

     Lady Van Tassel lunges, stabbing.  Ichabod avoids, puts all
     his fury behind his fist -- punches her in the face.

     Lady Van Tassel hits the ground and her bag falls open,
     sending the Horseman's skull rolling out...

     The skull rolls... rolls... landing far away.

     DOWNHILL, Katrina leaps out from the cart...

     She lands hard...

     The Horseman shoves the empty cart aside, still on the move.

     UPHILL, Ichabod sees the skull.  He runs towards it.

     Lady van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the ankle.  He falls.

     DOWNHILL, Katrina runs back.  The Horseman is catching up.

     UPHILL, Ichabod tries to pull f ree from Lady Van Tassel.

     Young Masbath comes behind her - BAM - hits her in the head
     with the wooden plank.  She's out.

     Ichabod scrambles to his feet.

     DOWNHILL, the Horseman catches Katrina, taking her by the
     hair as she falls to her knees and screams.

     UPHILL, Ichabod runs... grasps the Horseman's skull.

     He runs towards the Horseman and Katrina.

     DOWNHILL, Katrina struggles, but the Horseman holds her ready
     by her hair... raises his sword...

     UPHILL, Ichabod throws the skull...

                             ICHABOD 
               Horseman!

     The skull spins through the air...

     The Horseman drops Katrina, reaches up...

     Catches the skull.

     Katrina runs.

     Ichabod runs to meet her, grabs her as she falls, exhausted.
     Together, they back away from the Horseman.

     The Horseman holds the skull out, then brings it to his
     shoulders, to its rightful place.  THUNDER POUNDS.

     TRANSFORMATION begins -- blood and flesh rise up from the
     Horseman's throat and grip the skull.

     Young Masbath drops the plank, watching in awe.

     The Horseman's reformation continues.  Muscle forms.  Liquids
     become solids.  He is made whole once more, the same evil,
     human face we saw in Baltus' stories.

     He looks to Ichabod and Katrina, touches his restored face.

     Daredevil rides up, SCREECHING.  The Horseman replaces his
     sward and climbs into the saddle.

     He rides towards Katrina and Ichabod, but passes them by.
     They are so exhausted they fall down.

     Young Masbath backs up as the Horseman comes, but the
     Horseman does not want him either.

     The Horseman leans to grab Lady Van Tassel's unconscious
     form, pulls her up across Daredevil's back.

     He rides away with her.

     Ichabod and Katrina watch him go.  They look at each other,
     then kiss gratefully.

     Ichabod looks to Young Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               How are you?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Tired.

     Ichabod smiles and holds out his arm.  Masbath comes over.
     Group hug.  Lightning brightens the farmland around them.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, BURIAL GROUND -- NIGHT

     HOOFBEATS.  The Horseman enters the clearing, keeping a hand
     on Lady Van Tassel.  Ahead, the twisted tree awaits.

     Lady Van Tassel is awakening, face bloody.  She turns her
     head and looks forward.  She screams.

     The twisted tree's wound opens, wide and glowing.

     Daredevil picks up speed...

     Daredevil leaps just as a lightning bolt blasts down,
     striking the Horseman.

     For an instant, Horseman and horse are transformed, SKELETONS
     OF LIGHT, entering the tree.

     Silence and smoke.  At the tree, Lady Van Tassel's hand
     sticks out from the tight-shut suture.

     The sewn wound on her palm seeps blood.


     EXT.  NEW YORK CITY STREET, ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY

     A bright, busy day in New York.  A coach pulls up to
     Ichabod's home.  Ichabod is the driver.  He gets off, goes
     and opens the coach door.  He helps Katrina down.  Next,
     Young Masbath sticks his head out.

     Ichabod goes about unloading bags.  Katrina holds Young
     Masbath's hand, and they look down the street in wonder.

     THE END

              A pleasing land of drowsy head it was,
              of dreams that wave before the half shut eye...










     EXT.  GNARLED FOREST -- NIGHT

     An UGLY MAN charges through on a horse, holding a lantern
     forward on a long pole. He looks back, terrified.

     INSERT TITLE:  1799 Sleepy Hollow, New York

     THUNDEROUS HOOFBEATS are HEARD behind.

     The ugly man glances back again.  His lantern swings wild...
     SHATTERS against a tree.  The jammed-up pole SLAMS the ugly
     man off his horse...

     He hits the ground.  He runs, trips, falls and scrambles up.

     DEEP IN THE FOREST, we glimpse the source of the HOOFBEATS: a
     HUGE FORM on a HUGE BLACK HORSE, already gone.

     The ugly man pushes through thorny bushes.  Jagged branches
     slit his hands and cheeks.

     He bursts from the briar patch and tumbles to a trail.  He
     lifts his bloodied face.  He runs.

     IN THE FOREST BEHIND: the hooves of the black horse rip
     underbrush.  HOOFBEATS DEAFENING.  A spur digs into the
     snorting steed's already bleeding flank.

     The pursuer's gloved hand draws a SWORD, blade RINGING.

     ON THE TRAIL, the ugly man runs on.  The shrill WHISTLE of a
     SWORD SWING is HEARD as the pursuer blurs past.

     The ugly man is still running when his head lolls back, at an
     impossible angle... tumbles off his shoulders... His headless
     body hits the dirt.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS -- NIGHT

     Empty cobblestone streets.  Crooked buildings.  A RAPIDLY
     CLANGING BELL breaks the silence from afar.

     INSERT TITLE:  New York City

     TWO CONSTABLES clamor round a corner, lanterns held high,
     listening.  They rush into an alleyway.

     ELSEWHERE, piers border the Hudson River.  The BELL is
     LOUDER. The two constables arrive, searching.  No one around.
     Constable One hefts his pistol, scared.

                             CONSTABLE ONE
               Where are you?!

                             MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
               Here!  Over here!

     They hurry to the river's edge.  Down a hill, the MAN,
     another constable, stands with his back to us.  He's waist
     deep in water, tossing away his ALARM BELL.

                             MAN
               I need your help with this.

     Constable Two crosses on the peir above.  Constable One moves
     forward, wary.  The MAN grunts, lifting something.

                             CONSTABLE ONE
               Constable Crane?  Ichabod Crane...
               is that you?

     The MAN turns.  Meet ICHABOD CRANE, handsome, eyes piercing.

                             ICHABOD
               Yes, it is me.  But, not only me...
                     (lifting, struggling)
               I found someone here...

     He drags a bloated MALE CORPSE up from the murky water.

                             ICHABOD
               Someone quite dead.


     EXT.  WATCHHOUSE/JAIL -- NIGHT

     The elderly HIGH CONSTABLE lifts a blanket off the corpse on
     a wheelbarrow manned by Constable Two.  A snobby MAGISTRATE
     looks, disgusted.  Constable One and Ichabod wait.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Burn it.

                             CONSTABLE ONE
               Yes, sir.

     Constable Two wheels the corpse inside.  Ichabod's dismayed.

                             ICHABOD
               Just a moment... if I may.  It is
               possible this man was murdered.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               He drowned.  Anyone could see.

                             ICHABOD
               There are surgical ways of telling
               how he died... by the water in his
               lungs...

     Ichabod follows the High Constable and Magistrate in.

     INT.  WATCHHOUSE, NIGHT WATCH QUARTERS -- NIGHT

     Constable Two wheels the body ahead past many "booking"
     tables.  A JAILER moves to unlock a massive door.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               He will be burned pursuant to
               statutes of health.

                             ICHABOD
               I could determine if he were dead
               before he went into the Hudson.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Must we again hear these heretical
               rantings?

                             MAGISTRATE
               Yes, must we?

                             ICHABOD
               There is nothing heretical about
               science, sir.  The Chinese have
               written on it for hundreds of
               years... procedural study used to
               solve seemingly unsolvable crimes.

     The door is opened.  The corpse again leads the way.

     INT.  WATCHHOUSE, JAIL -- NIGHT

     A two-tiered prison, alive with MOANS of AGONY and CRIES of
     INSANITY.  Cells are full of wretched men in chains and iron
     gags.  Many are against the bars, watching.

                             ICHABOD
               Our first night watch is adequate
               against fire and some violence,
               but if we were more often able to
               ensure justice, after the fact,
               then criminals would truly have
               something to fear from law
               enforcement.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Have they nothing to fear presently?

                             ICHABOD
               Without disrespect, look around you.
                     (motioning to cells)
               We overflow.  As do our courts.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               And, with disrespect, Constable,
               if jails and courts overflow, it is
               testimony to success, not failure.

                             ICHABOD
               But, how many innocents rot here?
               And, how many victims are buried
               without reprisal while guilty men
               roam our streets?

     The High Constable reaches a desk, taking a seat.  Guards
     wait to process beaten, bloody prisoners.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Very few, if any.

                             ICHABOD
               Even though I have seen confessions
               pried from the lips of the accused,
               often quite literally?

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               For one who calls himself a
               Federalist, your mouth reeks of
               Republican liberalism.

                             ICHABOD
               Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.

                             MAGISTRATE
                     (to High Constable)
               Um, sir... might I suggest...

     The Magistrate WHISPERS in the High Constable's ear.  Ichabod
     notices with worry that Constables One and Two wheel the
     corpse onwards into another room.

     The Magistrate finishes.  The High Constable smiles faintly.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
                     (to Ichabod)
               There is a farming community
               upstate, Constable... ten days
               journey north in the Hudson
               Highlands.  It is named Sleepy
               Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three
               persons have been murdered there.
               Each with their head lopped cleanly
               off.
                     (holds up papers)
               The elders of the Hollow have sent
               dispatches to me, requesting
               assistance, and now, just this very
               moment, I have chosen you.

                             ICHABOD
               Chosen me?

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               These "methods" of yours... there
               has been no practical application.

                             ICHABOD
               Not for lack of trying.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Just so.  Granted.  And so you take
               your experimentations to Sleepy
               Hollow and catch the murderer who
               has tainted the place.  Bring him
               here to face our good justice.
               Will you do this for me?

                             ICHABOD
                     (swallowing doubt)
               I shall, gladly.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Excellent.  Then, you are excused
               till morning.

     Ichabod moves away, heading to where the corpse was taken.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Oh, and, Constable...
                     (off Ichabod's look)
               Do make certain that you meet with
               success.  Otherwise... perhaps you
               should not come back at all.

     The High Constable smiles a sardonic smile.

     INT.  WATCHHOUSE, INCINERATION ROOM -- NIGHT

     The corpse burns in a raging furnace.  Flesh sizzles.

     Constable One pumps bellows which fan the flames.  Ichabod
     steps from darkness nearby.  He watches with bitter regret as
     the corpse is consumed.


     EXT.  CITY -- DAY

     Market town streets bustle.  Filthy.  Pigs roam free.

     INT.  ICHABOD'S HOME, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY

     Decorated in Early-American Mad Scientist: books, papers and
     jars of chemicals.  Charts of anatomy above a small bed.

                             ICHABOD (o.s.)
               Such a day for such a sad farewell.
               But, this is goodbye, my sweet.

     At the window, Ichabod holds a bird cage with a red CARDINAL
     inside.  He opens the cage.  The bird flies free.

     Ichabod watches it go, then looks down.  A COACH halts in the
     street below.  The forlorn DRIVER looks up.


     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- DAY

     In motion.  Ichabod absently studies his hands, touching the
     strange SCARS on both palms: evenly dispersed, tiny dots of
     tissue.  Many scars.

     Ichabod lifts a LEATHER SATCHEL, checking its contents.

     EXT.  UPSTATE FORESTS -- DAY

     TWO FAMILIES of MIGRANT WORKERS travel a path, leading over-
     burdened horses.  Ichabod's coach approaches from the other
     direction.  Ichabod looks out, unnerved.

     One GAUNT MAN watches Ichabod pass.  There is a dead, worried
     look in the man's eyes.  Others stare at Ichabod.


     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY

     Ichabod faces two massive, vine-covered PILLARS, unsure.  He
     turns to watch the driver lead the coach away.

     Ichabod walks between the pillars to a long straight road.
     He does not notice, above: THREE DEAD RAVENS hang from a tree
     limb, twine wrapped round their necks.

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, TOWN SQUARE -- DAY

     Ichabod walks on with baggage.  The square is empty, a CHURCH
     and GRAVEYARD at one end.  The road ahead is bordered by
     businesses and homes.

     CONVERSATION DRIFTS from a tavern.  A criminal sits in
     stocks.  A quiet CRYING is HEARD.  Ichabod hears...

     He looks for its source.  It's from a window above, LOUDER.
     SOUNDS like the SOBBING of an OLD WOMAN.


     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- DAY

     ICHABOD'S P.O.V.: a BELLTOWER stands tall, like a mast pole
     with a crow's nest basket atop.  There's a man in the basket
     and a huge BELL.

     Ichabod ponders this as he continues.  Ahead on a hill: the
     grand Van Tassel Manor House.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL MANOR HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- DAY

     MANY CHILDREN, in a circle, taunt a BLINDFOLDED YOUNG WOMAN
     spun round by the handsome, barrel-chested man, BROM VAN
     BRUNT.  A few YOUNG MEN and LADIES watch.  Brom releases the
     woman.  Everyone quiets and avoids her searching hands.

                             BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
               This is such a silly game.

                             BROM
               Be a sport and stop complaining.

     The woman moves to Brom's voice.  He backs away, flanked by
     peers GLENN and THEODORE.  Children laugh.

     Ichabod enters, clearing his throat.  No one notices.  The
     blindfolded woman keeps grasping.  One LITTLE GIRL sees
     Ichabod and goes to him, finger to her lips.

                             LITTLE GIRL
               Play along.  You must.

     She tugs him.  Before Ichabod can protest, he is placed in
     the blindfolded woman's grip.

                             BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
               There, I have someone.  Am I
               finished?

                             LITTLE GIRL
               You have to tell who it is.

     The woman touches Ichabod's face.  He is uncomfortable,
     affected by this caress.  Brom watches jealously.

                             LITTLE GIRL
               At least make a guess.

                             BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
               I don't know.  Is it Brom Bones?

                             BROM
               Certainly not.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me, Miss...
                     (takes her hands)
               They have a laugh at your expense.

     She takes the kerchief off to reveal a stunning beauty:
     KATRINA VAN TASSEL.  Ichabod tries to compose himself.

                             KATRINA
               Forgive me, I didn't know.

                             ICHABOD
               I... I am looking for Baltus Van
               Tassel.

                             BROM
               We haven't heard your name yet,
               friend.

                             ICHABOD
               Well, unless your name is Baltus,
               you should not worry over mine.

     Brom grabs Ichabod's collar, pissed.  Ichabod's baffled.

                             BROM
               You need some manners.

                             KATRINA
               Brom!

     Brom looks at her, then reluctantly releases Ichabod.

                             MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
               What is this, then... ?

     BALTUS VAN TASSEL, 45, has entered, a working-class
     aristocrat.  LADY VAN TASSEL, 40, stands behind, a mix of
     home-spun wife and well-kept lady.

                             BALTUS
               Can I help you, sir?

     Ichabod's relieved to have a proper focal point.  Children
     gather around Katrina and hide behind her.

                             ICHABOD
               I have been sent from the city
               with a letter of introduction.
               I am told you offer me room and
               board.

     Ichabod hands over papers.  Baltus reads, furrows his brow.

                             ICHABOD
               If we could speak alone.

                             BALTUS
                     (nods, looks to Katrina)
               This is not a time for frivolity,
               Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?

                             KATRINA
               They're only children, father.

     Baltus snorts, then exits with Ichabod.  The others huddle to
     gossip, except Katrina, who moves beside Lady Van Tassel to
     watch Ichabod and Baltus walk down the hall.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- DAY

     DOCTOR LANCASTER, 50, dour and always sweaty, takes a seat by
     the fire, joining Baltus and three other elders.  A pretty
     servant, SARAH, brings a pipe cradle while Lady Van Tassel
     sets down food.  Ichabod is standing.

                             BALTUS
               That will be all, ladies.
                     (waits as they exit)
               We are joined by Doctor Thomas
               Lancaster, Constable.  And to his
               left are, Clergyman Steenwyck and
               our able magistrate, Samuel Philipse,
               both keeping order in their own ways.

     PHILIPSE is youngest, eyes bloodshot, mug in hand and pipe in
     mouth.  CLERGYMAN STEENWYCK is formidably built, wearing a
     constant look of disapproval.

                             BALTUS
               I myself am in charge of financial
               matters and the regulation of
               currency in our commonwealth.  And,
               lastly, this fine fellow is James
               Hardenbrook, our Notary.

     HARDENBROOK is oldest, ancient, with one eye pale and blind.

                             ICHABOD
               An honor, gentlemen.  In time I
               will need every detail of the
               three murderings you've had, but,
               for now, I ask only if you have
               any theory at all as to who the
               killer might be?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               Excuse me?

                             ICHABOD
               I say, is there any one person
               suspect in these acts?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               I was afraid of this.

     Philipse shoots a look to Baltus.  Angst amongst the elders.

                             PHILIPSE
               Well, Constable... are you aware...
               to be honest, you are not what we
               expected.  We sent for the militia.

                             ICHABOD
               The militia?

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               Why not tell us what you have heard?
               Hmm?  How much have your superiors
               bothered to tell you?

                             ICHABOD
               All I know is three are slain, their
               heads found severed from their
               bodies...

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               The heads were not found severed.
               The heads were not found at all.

     Withered Hardenbrook leans forward, his voice cragged.

                             HARDENBROOK
               Taken.  Taken by the Headless
               Horseman.  Taken back to hell.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon me?

                             BALTUS
               You have not been well informed of
               our troubles, sir.  If you would...

     Baltus gestures for Ichabod to sit.  Baltus lights his pipe.

                             BALTUS
               The Horseman... he was a Hessian
               mercenary, sent to our shores by
               German princes to help keep
               Americans under the thumb of
               England.  However, unlike his
               compatriots who came as muscle in
               trade for currency, he came
               willingly.  For love of carnage.

     FLASHBACK -- AMERICAN BATTLEFIELD -- DAY

     The HESSIAN HORSEMAN rides his black steed into a gory,
     close-quarters clash, his cloaked uniform adorned with edged
     weapons.  He cuts down Americans left and right.

                             BALTUS (v.o.)
               He was infamous for taking his
               horse, Daredevil, hard into
               battle... chopping off heads at
               full gallop.

     He dismounts, hoisting a battle axe.  With sword and axe, he
     annihilates.  Blood gushes.  Bones crack.

                             BALTUS (v.o.)
               Just to look on him made your
               blood run cold, for he had filed
               down his teeth to rapiers... to
               add to the ferocity of his
               appearance.

     The Horseman lets out a war cry.  Jagged teeth.  Grotesque.

     FOREST BATTLEFIELD -- DAY

     Winter.  CANNONS can be HEARD BOOMING from afar.  Daredevil
     lies dead in red snow.  FOLLOW FOOTPRINTS away...

                             BALTUS (v.o.)
               He would not finally meet his end
               till the winter of seventy-nine,
               when New York City was held by
               Henry Clinton and Washington
               occupied West Point.  It was
               between those two places, not far
               from here...

     The Horseman flees, cloak flowing, chased by FIVE rag-tag
     REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS.  Ahead, a steep, rocky area prevents
     escape.  Soldier one aims a rifle and FIRES...

     Blood explodes from the Horseman's arm as he runs.  His sword
     falls from his now functionless hand.

     Soldier Two grabs the sword.

     At the rocks, the Horseman faces the men.  Another Rifleman
     raises his rifle.  The Horseman reaches over his shoulder to
     grasp a sheathed knife, THROWS --

     THOCK!  The Rifleman jerks back, knife in his eye socket.

     The Horseman readies an axe.  The Revolutionaries move in
     with swords.  They battle, STEEL AGAINST STEEL.  The Horseman
     fends off blows from all sides.

     Soldier Three lunges, stabs his blade deep into the
     Horseman's side.  The Horseman roars, brings his axe DOWN...
     BREAKS the sword at the hilt...

     An UPWARDS stroke sends Soldier Three head over heels in a
     fountain of blood.

     The Horseman staggers, howling, trying to pull the blade from
     his ribs.  The remaining soldiers close in.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Pipe smoke wafts from Philipse's mouth.

                             PHILIPSE
               Cut off his head with his own sword.
               It's a legend told for twenty years.

                             BALTUS
               But, only recently has the Headless
               Hessian been seen prowling the
               Hollow, in search of a head to suit
               his shoulders.

                             ICHABOD
               Just a moment...
                     (sits back, incredulous)
               Are you saying it is he?

                             HARDENBROOK
                     (aggravated, loud)
               When a goblin leaps from the nether
               world, others follow.  Poltergeists
               of the air, water and earth follow
               and cheer his desecrations!

     Hardenbrook BANGS his cane on a table.  Baltus puts a calming
     hand on senile Hardenbrook's shoulder.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               No one knows why he chose to now to
               climb out from his grave.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               It is very clear why.  Citizens
               here have long tried to hide sins
               behind closed doors.  Their failed
               faith has saturated the soil and
               called forth one of Satan's own.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who
               has seen this Horseman?

                             BALTUS
               Many have.

                             ICHABOD
               Then, name one person who has seen
               him with their own eyes.

     A long wait.  No reply from the elders.  Ichabod rises.

                             ICHABOD
               While I will do everything I can
               to find your assassin, I will look
               for a man of flesh and blood.  Not
               some goblin-demon from hell.


     EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- EARLY EVENING

     The Belltower is covered in defensive spikes.  A man climbs
     down a rope ladder.  Below, many ARMED MEN gather.  Everyone
     grim.  Philipse moves to the center, on horseback.

                             PHILIPSE
               Gather round!  Gather and quiet!
               The hour has come to choose for
               this night.  Each man's name is
               in this box and has been checked.

     A box is handed up.  Ichabod and Baltus arrive on foot at the
     back of the mob.  Ichabod looks...

     At a nearby forest, men light TORCH POSTS in a line bordering
     the forest edge for at least a half mile.

     Philipse draws a folded paper from the box, holds it up.

                             PHILIPSE
               May the Lord watch over him...
                     (unfolds paper)
               "Jonathan Masbath."  Are you here?

                             JONATHAN (o.s.)
               I am.  I take my responsibility.

     The crowd parts as JONATHAN MASBATH, a dirt-poor farmer with
     a bow and quiver of arrows, moves forward.  His son, YOUNG
     MASBATH, 14, grips his arm.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               No, father.  Wait...
                     (up to Philipse)
               He's already been up once.  Why
               does he go again?

                             JONATHAN
               It is a lottery, son.  It just as
               easily might have been one of them.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Then... I go with you.

                             JONATHAN
               No.  You obey my wishes.
                     (looks to crowd)
               Brom.  Look after him, will you?

     Brom steps up, nodding.  Jonathan kisses his son's cheek,
     then heads to the rope ladder.  Men pat him on the back.

                             PHILIPSE
               Someone leave him a horse.

     Young Masbath watches his father go.  Brom coaxes him away.
     At the back of the crowd, Ichabod watches skeptically, looks
     to Young Masbath as he and Brom pass.

                             ICHABOD
               You worry for naught, little man.
               Nothing will harm him there.
                     (looks up, sotto)
               It is problems here on the ground
               you people need begin to worry
               about.

     Ichabod watches Jonathan climb, very high above.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod makes notations in a LEDGER BOOK.

                             KATRINA (v.o.)
               You will dream.

     Katrina strolls in, sits on the bed.  Ichabod is nervous.

                             KATRINA
               Did they tell?  It is something in
               the air so that dreams come to
               everyone.  According to the elders,
               an Indian prophet held powwows here
               before the land was taken, and
               spells cast then still linger to
               this day.

                             ICHABOD
               Do you often make a habit of
               sitting on strange men's beds?

                             KATRINA
               You are horribly old-fashioned,
               aren't you?

                             ICHABOD
               Feel free to form your own opinion.
                     (facing his ledger)
               Though it appears you already have.

                             KATRINA
               Well, I intended to apologize for
               the behavior of my friend Brom Van
               Brunt, but it seems I've made
               matters worse.
                     (getting up to go)
               I'll leave you to your business.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me... I should apologize.  I,
               um... I... have no great love of...

                             KATRINA
               Other people?

                             ICHABOD
               Small talk.

                             KATRINA
               It might have been more.  Might have
               been positively grand talk.

     Ichabod offers his chair, backing away.  Seeing it is the
     only one, he remains standing.  Katrina sits.

                             KATRINA
               Is it me, or are you this nervous
               around all women?

                             ICHABOD
               Perhaps it is because your suitor's
               hands were recently very nearly
               wrapped around my throat.

                             KATRINA
               My suitor?

                             ICHABOD
               The massive fellow... Brom.  For
               someone you call "friend," he
               misplaces a good portion of jealousy.

                             KATRINA
               He has proposed to me twice.

                             ICHABOD
               Which may explain his temperament.
               To have asked twice means the answer
               was "no" at least once.

     Katrina looks down, discards this with a smile.

                             KATRINA
               I've read a great deal about your
               New York City.  Do be a dear and tell
               me all about it.  Sounds like an
               extraordinary place to live a life.

                             ICHABOD
               Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you
               tell me about the Headless Horseman.


     EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT

     The torches burn bright.  ABOVE, in the Belltower, Jonathan
     Masbath loads a rifle.  THUNDER BOOMS.

     Jonathan stands, looking to a sky that is all stars and moon.
     A HORSE is HEARD SHRIEKING.  Below, the horse tied at the
     base of the tower is spooked.

     A COMMOTION is HEARD, ground rumbling.  Jonathan grips a
     rifle, cocks it and moves to look...

     At the forest edge, a herd of deer stampedes out.  They
     sprint past the tower and across the field.

     Jonathan crosses to watch the herd scatter.  He crosses back
     to peer at the forest.  Bad news...

     A thick FOG creeps from the woods.

     As the fog overtakes the base of each torch, a tentacle of
     mist snakes up to the flame, killing it.  All along the
     forest, arms of vapor snuff torches... one by one by one...

     Above, Jonathan sights the rifle along the trees.

                             JONATHAN
               Come out, devil... come....


     INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod leans on a dresser.  Katrina's still seated.

                             KATRINA
               Not all think it is the Horseman.
               Many say witches come from the
               Western Woods to steal skulls for
               their cauldrons.  Some believe a
               person in this very town kneels
               before Lucifer, offering death as
               tribute.  And, still others believe
               none of it.

                             ICHABOD
               Are you so superstitious?

                             KATRINA
               To call a person superstitious is to
               imply they fear magic, but not all
               magic is black.

                             ICHABOD
               There is no such thing as magic.

                             KATRINA
               Really?  Then... what is your
               rebuttal to those romantic poets
               claiming proof of magic in a rose at
               full bloom, or even in a teardrop?

                             ICHABOD
               Poets have silly notions about
               plants and bodily secretions.

                             KATRINA
                     (laughs)
               You are funny.

     Ichabod doesn't get what's so funny about that.  The DISTANT
     TOLL of a BELL is HEARD.  Katrina looks fearful.

     She goes to open a window.  The BELL TOLLS...

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, OVERVIEW -- NIGHT

     ... TOLLS mournfully over farms and forests...

     EXT.  FARM -- NIGHT

     ... TOLLS as a MAN comes from his barn, listening, then
     sprinting towards his home.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

     ... TOLLS across the deserted square.  Windows go dark.
     Shutters are slammed shut.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     ... TOLLS.  Ichabod bounds out to the lawn, halting to
     listen.  Katrina and Baltus come out on the porch.

                             BALTUS
               Constable, where are you going!?

     ... TOLLS... TOLLS... then, SILENCE.  Ichabod chases away.

                             BALTUS
               Come back, sir...
                     (watches him go)
               Madness.

     Baltus ushers Katrina back in.  The door slams.


     EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod charges across the rocky field.  He slows, awed...

     The Belltower is down, its mast is splintered.  The horse is
     gone.  Ichabod moves to where the crow's nest lies smashed.
     No sign of Jonathan.

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FOREST -- NIGHT

     Jonathan runs past, gripping his bow.  It's QUIET... till
     HOOFBEATS are HEARD in pursuit.

     Trees are silhouetted against the sky.  As HOOFBEATS get
     LOUDER, branches bend like arms and fingers yearning to
     touch.  As HOOFBEATS ROAR PAST, the trees relax.

     FURTHER ON, Jonathan runs.  WIND begins to BLOW.

     BEHIND, in motion, WE SEE Daredevil's snorting visage; eyes
     lizard-like, with vertical slits literally aglow.

     The Horseman's hand yanks a wooden WAR HAMMER from a saddle
     mount.  (No clear view of the Horseman.)

     HORSEMAN'S P.O.V.: closing in on Jonathan.

     Jonathan is overtaken.  The Horseman swings the hammer WHOOMP
     -- sends Jonathan sprawling.

     HOOFBEATS FADE.  Jonathan tries to get up, but pain shoots
     through him.  He crawls to retrieve his bow.

     Against a tree, he takes an arrow from his shoulder quiver
     and readies it.  Waiting.  A metal TAPPING is HEARD O.S.
     CLINK... CLINK... CLINK.  A HORSE SNORTS.

     Jonathan pulls the bow taut, pained, lips bloody.

     Elsewhere, Daredevil approaches slow.  The Horseman taps his
     sword on his spur, CLINK... CLINK... CLINK...

     Foliage moves as the Horseman's form pushes through.

     Jonathan releases -- the arrow WHISTLES...

     THWACK! -- imbeds in the Horseman's chest.

     CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... continues -- Jonathan readies a
     second arrow.  Pulls and releases -- O.S. THWACK!

     CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan cries out, crawling away
     desperately.  Crawling through underbrush, over roots and
     rocks.  CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan gives up, spent,
     face to the dirt.  He closes his eyes.

     CLINKING STOPS.  Daredevil halts astride Jonathan; two legs
     on each side of Jonathan's body.


     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FARMLAND -- MORNING

     Baltus and a large, DULLARDLY MAN ride.  Behind, Ichabod
     rides with Magistrate Philipse.

     Ichabod is not adept at riding his old nag, Gunpowder.

                             ICHABOD
               The Van Garretts died first; a man
               and his son, survived by a wife and
               two infants.  And the Widow Windsor
               was next...

                             PHILIPSE
               And now Jonathan Masbath.

                             ICHABOD
                     (looks back, ponders)
               Why would he flee this direction,
               with so much open ground to cross
               before he reached cover?

                             PHILIPSE
               He would not have gone into the
               Western Woods.  No sane man would.

     Philipse drinks from a whiskey flask, sees Ichabod watching
     and offers some.  Ichabod declines.

                             PHILIPSE
               Van Ripper there...

     Ahead, the dullard, VAN RIPPER, sloppily spits tobacco.

                             PHILIPSE
               ... found the body this morning.
                     (pause) 
               You do believe now, don't you?

                             ICHABOD 
               Believe?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               You said yourself.  What mere man
               could have downed the Belltower?

                             ICHABOD 
               It is a prime tenet of science,
               Philipse, that because one thing
               appears improbable does not mean
               you embrace the utterly fantastical.

                             PHILIPSE 
               You need less big words, and more
               common sense.

     Philipse fingers an IRON KEY talisman he wears on a cord.

                             ICHABOD 
               What is that you wear?

                             PHILIPSE 
               My talisman.  It will, protect
               against the Horseman if I show a
               brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If
               I run in fear, it is worthless.

                             ICHABOD 
               Well... so much for common sense.


     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS, FURTHER ON -- MORNING

     Brom and Baltus stand at a HORSE'S CORPSE amongst jagged
     boulders.  The flesh has been stripped, guts exposed.
     Philipse and Ichabod arrive and dismount.

                             BALTUS 
               Was this Jonathan's?

                             BROM 
               Yes.  Seems he panicked across here
               and broke two legs.

                             ICHABOD 
               Who took the meat?

                             BALTUS 
               Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape
               Indian lives in the Western Woods.

                             ICHABOD 
               These woods of yours sound a bit
               crowded, what with all the witches,
               ghouls and Indians living there.

     Brom climbs up onto his own horse, a black beauty.

                             BROM 
               There's only one Lenape.  He eats
               small animals and lost children...
               and the occasional constable when he
               can get it.

     Brom rides.  Ichabod goes to the dead horse, digs in his
     satchel for a thin iron tool, which he uses it to pry off one
     HORSESHOE.  A WHISTLE is HEARD O.S.

     Everyone looks far ahead to where Van Ripper has ridden.  The
     doctor and others are there.  Van Ripper waves.


     INT. FOREST, MASBATH MURDER SITE -- MORNING

     Doctor Lancaster stands with SEVERAL ARMED MEN.  A coffin on
     a cart is covered by a blanket. Ichabod is crouched nearby.

                             ICHABOD 
               Why did you move the body, Doctor?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               To place it inside its coffin.

     Ichabod, nods, vaguely annoyed.  He puts the horseshoe into a
     hoofprint in the dirt.  It fits.

     Ichabod rises, walks, studying the ground, kicking up leaves.
     Brom, Van Ripper, Baltus and Philipse watch.

     Ichabod finds a deep hoofprint.  Huge.  He compares the
     horseshoe.  The hoofprint is much larger.

     Ichabod pulls his satchel off his shoulder, takes out a bowl,
     bottle of water and bag of brown powder; begins mixing water
     and powder with a fork to make plaster.

     The others watch, finding this bizarre, whispering.  Brom
     comes up to stand over Ichabod, irritated.

                             BROM 
               What the hell are you doing?

                             ICHABOD
                     (ignoring pause) 
               You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod
               a horse with a hoof this large?

                             BROM 
               Never.  A shoe that size I would
               have remembered.

     Ichabod starts to fill the print with plaster.

                             ICHABOD 
               Van Ripper.  Can you show where the
               body lay?

                             VAN RIPPER 
               I can show exactly.

     Van Ripper dismounts, wiping tobacco drool.  Ichabod rises to
     follow with his satchel.

                             VAN RIPPER 
               Here... in front of this oak, facing
               north.  Horrible...

                             ICHABOD 
               To the best of your recollection,
               where did the open wound fall?

     Van Ripper points.  Ichabod takes a BOTTLE of WHITE POWDER
     from his pocket.

     He uncorks the bottle, cautiously pouring powder in an x on
     the dirt there, then waiting.

     A chemical reaction causes the powder to bubble a bit.

                             ICHABOD 
               There was not much blood, was there?

                             VAN RIPPER 
               I didn't see none.

     Ichabod stands, puzzled.  He walks to the coffin cart,
     rolling up his sleeves.  Others come to watch, but keep
     distance.  Ichabod removes the blanket...

     Reveals Jonathan's headless corpse.

     Philipse can't look.  Ichabod takes strange spectacles from
     his satchel; wire-framed with many lenses.  MAGNIFICATION
     SPECTACLES.  He examines the gross neck wound, sniffs it.

     He pokes the flesh and severed spinal cord.

                             ICHABOD 
               No bleeding.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               What is that?

                             ICHABOD 
               This should have bled by the pint.
               Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh.
               How... ?  Whatever weapon was used...
               it cauterized somehow....

     Ichabod straightens, eyes weirdly big in the spectacles.

                             ICHABOD 
               It instantly burnt the wound shut.


     EXT.  CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAY

     A coffin in a grave.  Headstone reads "MASBATH, 1799."  A
     CROWD gathered.  Young Masbath broods.  Clergyman Steenwyck
     steps forward to take a handful of newly dug dirt.

     Men with guns stand at the outskirts, like on guard.

     Steenwyck sprinkles dirt into the grave with prayerful words.
     In the crowd people whisper.  They steal glances at Ichabod,
     who stands with the Van Tassels.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING/VARIOUS ROOMS -- DAY

     Dining room.  Sarah and two other servants collect plates.  A
     few people still sup, including Van Ripper, his warty WIFE
     and two kids.  Van Ripper guzzles ale, laughs at something
     his also-drunk wife says.

     IN the HALL and FOYER, funeral goers socialize quietly.

     FURTHER ON, in the SITTING ROOM, men smoke.  Young Masbath
     is confronting Ichabod, who is leaving...

                             ICHABOD 
               I am not here for revenge.  I am
               here to bring justice.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Whatever.  You still need a second
               to tend to your things.

                             ICHABOD 
               I manage fine alone.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               I deserve to help you.  Don't you see
               how much this means?  My father...
               he... he was a good man...

                             ICHABOD
                     (faces Masbath) 
               Young Masbath, I am sorry for your
               loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy.
               However... I cannot be the one to
               look after you now.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
                     (angry) 
               I did not ask you to, did I?

     Young Masbath exits.  Ichabod remains impassive.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- DAY

     Ichabod comes out.  KILLIAN, a dashingly rustic man, carries
     his son, THOMAS, 5, and chats with Baltus.  Doctor Lancaster
     peers off at something through a SPYGLASS.

                             BALTUS 
               Hail, Constable.  How are you?

                             ICHABOD 
               Well enough.  Your gathering does
               honor to the deceased.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
                     (still using spyglass) 
               We must be a curious sight to him.

                             ICHABOD 
               What are you spying on?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
                     (offers the spyglass)
               The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at
               civilization from time to time.

     ICHABOD'S POINT OF VIEW -- THROUGH SPYGLASS

     Searching a line of trees and foliage far away...

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER (o.s.)
               Do you see the Redskinned bastard?

     There he is -- the LENAPE.  A towering savage with misshapen
     features covered in tumors.  He ducks away.

     BACK TO SCENE ON PORCH

     Ichabod lowers the spyglass, a little awed.

                             ICHABOD 
               He is a behemoth.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               A diseased monster.

                             BALTUS 
               If you gentlemen will excuse the
               doctor and I... we have financial
               matters to discuss.

     Ichabod and Killian nod as Baltus and Lancaster head in.

                             KILLIAN 
               Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have
               time alone.  You've been told plenty
               about the Horseman, I'm certain.

                             ICHABOD 
               More than enough, actually. 
                     (tired laugh) 
               I beg you, no more, please.

                             KILLIAN 
               No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say
               you just laid eyes on our murderer
               through that glass.

     Ichabod ponders, folding the spyglass.

                             ICHABOD 
               Tell me something. 
                     (pause) 
               What becomes of Young Masbath?

                             KILLIAN 
               Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take
               him.  They have children and a good
               home and good land.

     Ichabod nods.  He turns to look THROUGH THE WINDOW.  In the
     DINING ROOM, Van Ripper rises, ill.  His wife questions his
     health, but he holds her off and vomits.

     Ichabod notes this with a deep sigh.


     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ORCHARD -- EARLY EVENING

     Ocher dusk.  Ichabod rides to Young Masbath, seated on the
     ground, miserable.  Young Masbath does not look up.

                             ICHABOD 
               Find yourself a place in the servants'
               residence and wake me before dawn.
               Our first task will be an unsavory one.

     Ichabod rides.  Young Masbath runs to his horse and follows.


     EXT. CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAWN

     Steenwyck is on horseback, looking down at Ichabod, furious.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               It is sacrilege!

                             ICHABOD 
               I cannot proceed without examining
               the previous victims.

     Steenwyck looks to men with shovels.  Killian's there.
     Philipse, hung-over, stands beside Young Masbath.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               Magistrate Philipse, surely you can
               stop this.

     Philipse just looks up with a helpless expression.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               I will not allow it.  I will not!

                             ICHABOD 
               Protest to my superiors if you like.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               Your superiors are two days away!

                             ICHABOD 
               Then, you should have left two days
               ago, because I have men willing to
               help me today.

     Ichabod motions.  Killian leads the men to the graveyard.
     Steenwyck watches, enraged.  He kicks his horse and rides.
     Philipse looks worried.

     EXT.  CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- LATER MORNING (TIME CUT)

     A PSALM is HEARD READ by STEENWYCK O.S. while a coffin is
     exhumed.  Ichabod guides the lifting.  The coffin is put near
     the headstone "WINDSOR."  Ichabod looks...

     At the church, Steenwyck faces about fifty people who now
     take up the PRAYER.

     Across the cemetery, two coffins, one small, one large, are
     pried open.  "VAN GARRETT, 1799."  Killian leads the effort
     with Young Masbath's aid...

     The lids come off, revealing the HEADLESS BODIES of a MAN and
     a little BOY.  Young Masbath backs away.

     At the "WINDSOR" coffin, nails creak as Ichabod opens the
     lid.  WE DO NOT SEE inside, but when Ichabod does, he is
     aghast.  He looks to the men, angry.

                             ICHABOD
               Why was I not told of this?

     No answer.  Killian arrives, nods solemnly.

                             KILLIAN 
               The Widow Windsor.

                             ICHABOD 
               Is that all you say?  Look at her.

                             KILLIAN 
               It's not something people speak of
               openly.  She did not remarry.

     Ichabod kneels, studying.  Now, WE SEE: the belly of the
     headless corpse is bulbous, because the Widow Windsor was
     very far along in a pregnancy.

     Ichabod notices: a tear in the cloth of widow's blouse.  He
     reaches through the tear, feeling the stomach.

     He straightens, greatly troubled.


     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- MORNING

     Scissors cut open the widow's blouse.  There's an inch-long
     WOUND on the moldering belly; a sword puncture.

     Ichabod examines the corpse on a table.  Lancaster watches,
     anxiously mopping his face.  Young Masbath's in a corner.
     Ichabod goes to write in his ledger full of notes.

                             ICHABOD 
               What is the common thread between
               these victims?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               I'm sure I don't know.

                             ICHABOD 
               We must discover it.  The reason the
               murderer chose these persons.

     Ichabod goes to look at the widow's corpse, pondering.

                             ICHABOD 
               The wounds are the same.  Cauterized.
               No chopping or half-measures either.
               One stroke took the head.  Have you
               seen, doctor... ?
                     (pointing to it) 
               Even the spinal bone... sliced as
               smooth as butter.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               I do not care.  You are welcome to
               use my work area, but I beg you...
               return her to her resting place.

                             ICHABOD 
               In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.

     Ichabod picks up an iron knife.  He looks to Young Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               You should step outside.


     EXT.  CHURCHYARD CEMETERY -- EARLY EVENING

     Ichabod and others restore graves.  Ichabod looks to the
     church, where Clergyman Steenwyck stands in the door.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane.
               The Lord will not forgive your sins.

     Steenwyck shuts the creaky doors.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod sleeps, dreaming...

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FARMLAND -- DAY

     A young BOY, 10, stands in a wheat field with his back to us.
     A FEMALE VOICE is HEARD FAINTLY, getting LOUDER.

                             FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
               Ichabod!  Ichabod... come along.

     The boy, YOUNG ICHABOD, turns, smiling.  He runs.  We FOLLOW
     to a clearing behind a frontier home.  MOTHER waits.  Lovely
     woman.  She kisses him.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Dark.  Young Ichabod, in bed, has one eye open.  Across the
     room, Mother has her back to him.  She's WHISPERING something
     to no one.  She turns...

     Young Ichabod pretends he is asleep.

     A DRAWER is HEARD SHUTTING.  Mother exits.  Ichabod gets up,
     curious, opens a drawer... finds something behind clothing.

     It's a piece of reed grass, woven into an elaborate pattern
     with shafts of wheat twisted into the center.  Young Ichabod
     replaces it, closes the drawer.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- MARKET SQUARE -- DAY

     A busy, muddy street lined by wares and produce.  Young
     Ichabod walks with FATHER, an emotionless man.  Father stops
     to examine tools.  Young Ichabod stays by him, but something
     captures his attention...

     Across the way, Mother is involved in a argument with a
     FREAKISH-LOOKING WOMAN.  They shout.  People stop to watch.
     Can't make out words, but Freakish Woman is furious.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- STORM SKY -- NIGHT

     LIGHTNING flashes over tree tops.  THUNDER BOOMS.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod jerks awake in his bed.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Ichabod enters with a lantern and his ledger.  He sits,
     studies notes, then notices there's a light down the hall.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Opposite an elaborate loom, Katrina reads by candlelight.
     She looks up, seeing Ichabod enter.

                             ICHABOD 
               Sorry for disturbing you.  I thought
               a forgotten candle was burning.

     Katrina self-consciously closes her shabby book, puts it with
     another on her lap and covers them.

                             KATRINA 
               You do not disturb me.  Please stay.
               Having trouble sleeping?

                             ICHABOD 
               May I ask... why do you cover your
               book that way?

                             KATRINA 
               You pay great attention to small
               things.  I hide these as I hide all
               my books.  Father would not approve,
               lest it were the Bible.

                             ICHABOD 
               I, um... I have something to show you,
               if you have a moment.

     Ichabod sits, looking through his ledger.

                             KATRINA
               These are strange... may I?

     She takes his hand, spreads the fingers to the palm.  She
     touches the many evenly spaced scars.

                             KATRINA 
               These scars.  How did you get them?

                             ICHABOD 
               I have had them since childhood.  I
               cannot remember what from.

                             KATRINA 
               It would be interesting to find out.

     Their eyes meet.  Ichabod gets back to the ledger.  Katrina
     seems to relish the effect she has.  Ichabod finds a paper
     disk on string, illustrated thusly:

                             ICHABOD 
               Here it is.  A bird on one side.
               His cage on the other.  Now,
               stare at it. 
                     (spinning it) 
               The bird seems to be in his cage.

                             KATRINA 
               Yes, he does.  May I try?

     Ichabod gives it.  She spins it, smiling.

                             ICHABOD 
               He only appears to be inside the
               cage.  The point being...

                             KATRINA
               You made this, and the drawings?

                             ICHABOD 
               Yes, but listen.  The illusion is
               easily explained.  The eye retains
               each image, till they combine.  And
               yet, some would call this toy magic.

                             KATRINA 
               Don't you see why?  Look closely a
               moment.  Put your intellect aside. 
                     (spinning it) 
               Can't you see what is inexplicable?

     Ichabod watches it spin.  He shakes his head, unimpressed.

                             KATRINA 
               Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep
               it at least?

                             ICHABOD
               If you want.  But...

                             KATRINA 
               Then, I also have a gift for you.
               True magic which even you will not
               be able to deny.

     She hands him a book.  "ROMEO AND JULIET."  Ichabod stands,
     offering it back, but she will not take it.

                             ICHABOD 
               Thank you.  No.  Here...

                             KATRINA 
               I insist that you have it.

                             ICHABOD
                     (resigned, leaving) 
               Very well.  But, it will only sit
               gathering dust.

                             KATRINA 
               That would be a pity.  Those words
               might show you something you've never
               seen before.

     Ichabod stops at the door, looks back.  He exits.


     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     A light glows in Ichabod's window.  LOOKING IN: Ichabod's in
     bed, fully dressed.  He sits up.  Pause.  He crosses to pick
     up "Romeo and Juliet."  He begins to read.


     EXT.  PHILIPSE'S FARM -- DUSK

     Ichabod walks with Philipse.  Young Masbath follows with the
     horses.  CICADAS CHATTER from a vast corn field.

                             PHILIPSE 
               Not more than a year ago, a mob hung
               a man for stealing a horse.  For
               stealing a horse!  And, you dig up
               our dead.

                             ICHABOD 
               Are you saying I should be frightened?
               Is this a message passed on from
               Clergyman Steenwyck?

     The CICADAS SUDDENLY go SILENT.  Young Masbath notices.

                             PHILIPSE 
               We are farmers here, not lawyers or
               bankers, or even constables.  Every
               penny we earn comes from what we
               send down the Hudson.

                             ICHABOD 
               I know it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Um.... excuse me, sirs...

                             PHILIPSE
                     (still to Ichabod) 
               Because of the Horseman, our migrant
               workers flee for their lives.  There
               is a danger that our crops will rot.
               So, if you are going to help us, you
               stop the Horseman.  That is your
               task... to kill an undead thing.

     Young Masbath looks to a fenced grazing area, worried.  The
     sheep there are agitated, all running one direction away.

                             ICHABOD
               Listen to what you say....

                             PHILIPSE 
               No, you listen!  You may think we are
               a pack of superstitious dullards...

                             ICHABOD 
               At times I do.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Sirs... please!

                             PHILIPSE 
               What will it take for you to realize
               this is no laughing matter?

     The horses go crazy, braying and rearing.  The reins yank
     Young Masbath off his feet as the horses flee.

     Ichabod and Philipse look to Masbath.  A SOUND is HEARD,
     distant: THUNDERING HOOFBEATS.  Wind kicks up.  HOOFBEATS
     seem to come FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.

     Philipse looks to the corn field.  A flock of birds alights;
     a great sheet of black against the sky.

                             PHILIPSE
               Oh my... oh my oh my oh my...

     Philipse runs towards his house, past Masbath.  HOOFBEATS are
     LOUDER, CLOSER.  Ichabod faces the corn field.

     The field explodes open, stalks bending to make way as the
     Headless Horseman gallops into view atop Daredevil.

     Young Masbath runs, following Philipse.

     Ichabod's stunned.  He looks down to draw his flintlock
     pistol, but the Horseman blows by before he can raise it.  A
     blast of air knocks Ichabod off his feet.

     The Horseman chases Masbath and Philipse.

     Ichabod follows.

     The Horseman draws his sword.

     Young Masbath falls in the grass...

     Daredevil's pounding hooves will certainly crush him.

     Daredevil leaps over Young Masbath, continuing the charge.

     Philipse has a long way to go before home.  He looks over his
     shoulder.  No way he'll make it.

     Ichabod, running, watches Philipse slow.

     Philipse gathers all his courage and stops, turning.  The
     Horseman is closing, sword held high.

     Philipse raises his talisman.

                             ICHABOD 
               Philipse!

     Philipse holds the talisman up, trying to be fearless.  The
     Horseman swings -- WE HEAR the CLANK of sword on talisman...

     Philipse's severed head spins.  His body falls and folds.

     Ichabod runs past Young Masbath.

     The Horseman halts just as Ichabod reaches a point in front
     of dead Philipse, aiming his pistol.  Daredevil lets out a
     SCREECHY CRY.  The Horseman rides toward Ichabod.

     Ichabod gets on one knee, trying to steady his pistol.  The
     Horseman closes.  Ichabod sweats bullets.  FIRES...

     The slug SLAMS the Horseman dead center -- bursts through and
     rends his uniform without slowing him.

     The Horseman is almost on Ichabod.  Ichabod cringes, arms
     up... as the Horseman passes.

     The Horseman leans to skewer Philipse's head with his sword.

     With the head as his prize, the Horseman races away.

     Ichabod gets up, watches the Horseman head to the forest.
     Ichabod looks to Young Masbath, finds his legs will not
     support him, falls, trembling.  THUNDER BELLOWS.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT

     Lady Van Tassel comes to a door, knocks.  Sarah stands behind
     with a tray of food.  Young Masbath is seated near.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
                     (to Young Masbath)
               Has he not come out at all?

     Young Masbath shakes his head.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     KNOCKING is HEARD.  Ichabod sleeps restlessly.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     THUNDER BOOMS.  WIND and POUNDING RAIN blast open a window.
     Mother comes to it, then moves to comfort fearful Young
     Ichabod in bed.

                             MOTHER'S VOICE (v.o.)
               Don't be afraid... don't be afraid.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY

     A keyhole.  Young Ichabod's eye peers in...

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- P.O.V. THROUGH KEYHOLE

     Mother is kneeled before flour on the floor.  She draws
     patterns in it, whispering.  She blows the flour away.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY

     The Freakish Woman (who argued with Mother) walks towards the
     home, supported by a SAD MAN.  She weeps, carrying something
     in a blanket.

     Young Ichabod comes a window, watching, scared.

     The Freakish Woman is so weak that she falls.  The blanket
     opens... the corpse of an infant tumbles to the dirt.  The
     Freakish Woman's WAILING GROWS LOUDER.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FRONT OF YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT

     TWO MEN in black drag Mother to a coach.  She looks back,
     fearful, pulled along.  A THIRD MAN in black follows.

     Young Ichabod struggles as Father restrains him.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               No... mother... no... !

     The Third Man peers back, a gray-haired, Cotton Mather-ish
     man with a villainous face.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)
               The night of the great storm, I saw
               her cross my windows.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY

     Many people in the gallery.  The Third Man stands in front of
     the tearful Freakish Woman in the witness box.

                             THIRD MAN
               You are certain it was she?

                             FREAKISH WOMAN
               In the lighting, I did see her.
                     (points)
               Her.  Lady Crane...

     Mother sits in shackles.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN
               I will never forget.  The next moment,
               I found my infant dead... with the
               blood welt on his breast.

     Those in attendance cry out at this.  Ichabod is seated
     beside Father, eyes filled with tears.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     As before, a STORM RAGES.  Ichabod is in Mother's arms.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)
               The night of the great storm, I saw
               her cross my windows.

                             MOTHER
               Don't be afraid...

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- DAY

     KNOCKING is HEARD.  Ichabod gasps awake.

                             KATRINA (o.s.)
               Constable Crane?

     Ichabod looks at his hands balled into fists.  He opens them
     -- has ONE HALF of PHILIPSE'S TALISMAN in each palm.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Katrina holds a tray of food.  The DOOR is HEARD UNLOCKING.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Katrina enters.  Ichabod sits at his work table.

                             KATRINA
               Are you hungry?

     Ichabod shakes his head, won't look up.  Katrina crosses.

     She begins picking up pieces of the PLASTER HOOFPRINT CAST
     which lies shattered on the floor.

                             KATRINA
               You promised justice.

                             ICHABOD
               If these are the random stalkings of
               a monster, what good am I?

                             KATRINA
               People have put their trust in you.

                             ICHABOD 
               They have done nothing of the sort.

                             KATRINA
               Won't they still have that justice?
                     (patience waning)
               Or, was it a vain promise?

     Ichabod stews, head in his hands.  Someone is HEARD
     RUNNING... Young Masbath enters, frightened.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Constable Crane... something has
               happened.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     The Lenape Indian hangs dead in a tree, lynched.  TOWNSFOLK
     are gathered.  Ichabod makes his way through, followed by
     Young Masbath, looking up.

                             BROM (o.s.)
               We do not need you, Constable...

     Brom strides towards Ichabod from a group of men spreading a
     sheet under the tree.  Van Ripper's there.

                             BROM
               The men who did this have been taken.
               We do not need you here.

     Brom points to where TWO FILTHY MEN in chains sit in a
     horse-drawn cart.  An armed man guards them.

                             ONE FILTHY MAN 
               You should thank us.  The killings
               will end.  We saved you all!

     The armed man shoves the filthy man to shut him up.

                             BROM 
               They spend two days in chains.

                             ICHABOD 
               Two days... ?  For murder?

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               For poaching.  Or, would you remake
               our laws now that Magistrate Philipse
               has given up the ghost?

                             ICHABOD 
               Does that look like an animal hanging?

                             BROM 
               Looks like an Indian.

     Van Ripper cuts the noose rope at the trunk.  The Lenape
     corpse free falls, landing hard.

     The Lenape lies in a heap on the sheet.  Van Ripper and
     others come to lift the sheet with the Lenape in the middle.
     Ichabod watches, noticing...

     The Lenape wears a WOVEN PIECE of REED GRASS a cord on his
     loin cloth, twisted in a pattern.

                             ICHABOD 
               Wait.  Give me a moment...

     Ichabod kneels.  He removes the woven piece, looking across
     the diseased Lenape's body.  Something else...

     The Lenape's mouth is agape; teeth rotting.  Ichabod looks
     around, finds a twig.  He uses it to pull the Lenape's mouth
     open... gets close to peer inside the Lenape's mouth.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY

     A DRAWING of the Lenape's WOVEN PIECE in Ichabod's ledger.
     The piece lies near.

     Ichabod sits staring at it, trance-like.  Masbath waits.
     Long silence.

                             ICHABOD
               The Lenape Indian had much to tell
               once I opened his mouth.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               How could he?

                             ICHABOD
               His teeth.  Someone had cut them and
               chipped off rotten pieces far back
               in his mouth.  The Lenape could not
               have done that for himself.
                     (closes his journal)
               Someone out there cared for him.

     Ichabod rises, deciding.  He picks up his satchel and exits.
     Young Masbath is surprised.  He follows.


     EXT.  WINDMILL -- DAY

     A massive, wooden WINDMILL, raised off the ground on a 7'
     center post.  Ichabod and Masbath walk to it.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath enter via a ladder from the
     underbelly.  Gears and counter wheels turn millstones.  A few
     men work in the grain powder filled air.

     Ichabod leads the way to a staircase, up twists and turns.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Where are we going?

                             ICHABOD 
               Up.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath climb out a door to the roof.  The
     rotors spin nearby.  Ichabod searches the countryside.

     Below, MANY MEN are ride up the long straight road.

                             ICHABOD 
               What is it?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               It's payment day.  Loan monies are
               given to Baltus the last day each
               month.  Almost everyone borrows...
               for tools or to hire workers.

     Ichabod sits, takes a bowl from his bag and gives it to
     Masbath, then produces a bottle of water... fills the bowl.

                             ICHABOD
                     (points) 
               Out there.  What do you see?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               The Western Woods.

                             ICHABOD 
               Look again.

     A plume of smoke rises from woods, far.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Smoke.  Chimney smoke.

     Ichabod holds a piece of straw in his mouth, rubs the point
     of a sewing needle against a small BLACK ROCK.

                             ICHABOD 
               Are you familiar with magnets?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What kind of nuts?

                             ICHABOD 
               Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch
               here.

     Ichabod shows the magnet grab the needle.  Young Masbath is
     amazed, reaching for it.  Ichabod watches him play with it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               It's spectacular.

                             ICHABOD
                     (smiles, pause) 
               Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               No, I couldn't...

                             ICHABOD 
               I have others.  All I need is this.

     Ichabod takes the needle, poking its butt end into the tip of
     the straw.  Young Masbath studies the rock, pockets it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Thank you.

                             ICHABOD
                     (nods, almost shy) 
               Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to
               business.

     Young Masbath lifts the bowl.  Ichabod drops in the
     needle/straw which floats and turns compass-like.

                             ICHABOD 
               If the Western Woods are truly the
               Devil's Glen, we will see for
               ourselves.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
                     (uneasy) 
               Father said witches live there.

                             ICHABOD 
               Witches do not exist.  However...

     Ichabod uses a knife to notch the bowl lip where the needle
     points, then surveys the smoke, making a second notch.

                             ICHABOD 
               Not long ago, I would have said the
               same for Headless Horseman.

                             KATRINA (o.s.)
               Constable... !

     Katrina's on horseback below, unhappy.

                             KATRINA 
               I need to speak with you.  Alone.


     EXT.  VAN TASSEL GREAT LAWN -- DAY

     Ichabod and Katrina lead their horses.  A heated argument.

                             KATRINA
               Why would you do such a thing?

                             ICHABOD 
               No stone may be left unturned.  It
               may appear harsh...

                             KATRINA 
               I have misjudged you I think.  I did
               not imagine you were so cruel.

                             ICHABOD 
               You are not regarding it in full.
               The Widow Windsor had been run
               through by a sword.  I followed the
               bloodless wound, a wound whose path
               I could not comprehend till I had
               seen the Horseman with my own eyes.

                             KATRINA 
               What are you on about?

                             ICHABOD 
               The child she carried was eight
               months grown at least... near to
               birthing.  The sword had pierced its
               tiny heart exactly.

                             KATRINA 
               Must I hear this?

                             ICHABOD 
               There was no blind stabbing.  This
               singular thrust found its target
               omnipotently, as if the Horseman made
               certain the unborn child died with
               its mother.

                             KATRINA 
               And this gives worth to butchery?

                             ICHABOD 
               It was not butchery.

                             KATRINA 
               What is it then?  Scientific method?
               How can any of this matter in the
               slightest?

                             ICHABOD 
               I have no solution for its meaning
               yet, but I could not just ignore it.

                             KATRINA 
               Take a lesson from Young Masbath's
               desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows
               with you to avenge his father's death.
               That I understand.  But, what do you
               want?

                             ICHABOD 
               To avenge his father, and the others.

                             KATRINA 
               But, why?  Tell me why.

     Ichabod struggles for a reply.

                             KATRINA 
               You falter with your answer because
               you strive without putting the whole
               of your heart into it.  Can't you see?
               You'll bring dignity to the dead even
               if you have to chop them into little
               pieces to do it.

                             ICHABOD
                     (fed up, growing anger) 
               If it had been surgery on a living
               person, done to save that person's
               life, you would not question it.  Not
               for a moment.  So, let me be the first
               to tell you, dear girl... on the other
               side of these sheltering mountains, a
               whole world has advanced beyond such
               plebeian thinking as yours.  And
               someday, no matter how much you fear
               it, that world will come to roust
               Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.

     Katrina storms away.  Ichabod's already regretting.


     EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath ride to the Western Woods, horses
     loaded for expedition.  At the Belltower remnants, Ichabod
     slows, looking to the wreckage.

     At forest's edge, Young Masbath waits.

     Ichabod circles the tower.  With a sigh, he rides to join
     Young Masbath. They head into the woods.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     Dark, dense and creepy.  Ichabod and Young Masbath move
     through.  Young Masbath halts his horse and looks around.

                             ICHABOD 
               What is it?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Listen.

                             ICHABOD
                     (listens, looks)
               I hear nothing.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               No crickets or cicadas calling.  No
               bird songs.

     Stark quiet.  Ichabod notes this unhappily.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- LATER DAY

     Ichabod's hand drops the needle/straw in the water bowl.  The
     needle spins.  The bowl is turned to match notches.

     Ichabod points the way to Young Masbath.

     ELSEWHERE, SOMEONE WATCHES:  A MOVING P.O.V. WATCHES them as
     they ride, FOLLOWS.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- LATER DAY

     Ichabod and Masbath reach a hill crest.  They stop, uneasy.
     Below: a CAVE with a rock archway.  An ill-fitting door
     covers the mouth.  The chimney spews smoke.

                             ICHABOD
               We have apparently arrived.

     EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     The horses are tied to a tree.  Ichabod walks to the cave
     door.  Unsure, he hesitantly knocks.

     INT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath step in.

     Walls are hung with skins and skeletons, dry flowers and reed
     grass in patterns.  An OLD CRONE sits facing away.

     The old Crone, a mountain woman with matted hair and grey
     features, sits disinterested.  Ichabod edges closer.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon.  You did not answer when I
               knocked.  Are we intruding?

                             OLD CRONE
               You are from the Hollow?

                             ICHABOD
               In a way, yes.

     Ichabod looks at tables of gourd bowls of dead insects and
     acorns.  Knifes, scissors, yellow bones.  He takes the
     Lenape's piece of reed grass from his pocket.

                             ICHABOD
               The Lenape who lived in these woods...
               do you know him?  The Redman?
                     (uncomfortable wait)
               I should tell you... he has been
               murdered.

                             OLD CRONE
               Leave me.  You are not welcome here.

     The old Crone places something on a table beside her -- a
     dead cardinal, bright red.

     Ichabod is afraid, backing away, but Young Masbath takes the
     woven piece and steps to the Crone.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Were you a friend to the Indian?
                     (waits)
               You should have this... if you were
               his friend.

     Young Masbath puts the woven piece beside the cardinal.  He
     walks to join Ichabod in leaving.

                             OLD CRONE
               You seek remedy against the Horseman?

     The Old Crone reaches to pick up the weaving.  She stands,
     faces them.  Tall.  Ichabod nods.

                             OLD CRONE
                     (to Young Masbath)
               Go out and keep away, child.
                     (to Ichabod)
               You stay.  Follow with me.

     The Old Crone takes a candle and walks, deep into the cave.

     INT.  CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY

     The Old Crone comes through a passage in the wet walls.
     Ichabod enters, scared, bent under low ceiling.

                             OLD CRONE
               I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow
               and back.

                             ICHABOD
               The Horseman.  Yes.

                             OLD CRONE
               Sit.

     Ichabod sits on crooked stool.  The old Crone kneels with her
     back to him, gathers straw in a pile on the floor.

                             ICHABOD 
               Can you help?

                             OLD CRONE 
               You want to see into the nether world...
               I can show you.  Whatever you see, do
               not move or speak.  I will hold him.

     She gathers bowls, putting grass and powder on the pile.

                             ICHABOD
               What... what are you doing?

                             OLD CRONE
                     (turns, furious) 
               Close your mouth!  Keep silent.

     She takes two jars from a table, pours ashes on the pile from
     one.  She shakes the other roughly, takes the lid off and
     upends it.  A baby bat squirms on the floor, dazed.

     The Old Crone holds the bat, using a knife to cut off its
     head.  She soaks the straw with blood, SPEAKING IN TONGUES,
     guttural.  Using a wick, she lights the straw.

     She grasps two METAL CUFFS with chains attached, slides these
     onto her bony wrists, then bends to inhale smoke.

                             OLD CRONE 
               He comes now.

     Ichabod would like to leave now.

     EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     Young Masbath, waiting by the horses, looks up.  Through the
     trees, black clouds billow and block the sun.

     INT.  CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY

     The old Crone slumps, still with her back to Ichabod.  She
     does not move.  Wind howls through a hole/window.  Rain.

     Candles blow out.  Ichabod stands, worried.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me... um...

     She remains motionless.  The STORM outside intensifies.

     WE SEE the skin of the Crone's wrists transform; swelling in
     the cuffs, hardening, cracking and bleeding.

     Some thing Ichabod cannot see.  He inches closer.

                             ICHABOD 
               Are you alright... ?

     The Crone turns, hideous, leaping erect -- a half-human,
     half-demon CREATURE.  Its black clawed hands reaching.

     Ichabod recoils, crying out.

     Chains on restraining cuffs yank the creature back.

     Ichabod hits the floor, knocking over a table of bones.  The
     creature is chained, but still wants Ichabod.  It SCREECHES.

     The Old Crone's face seethes from transformation, eyes blood
     red, nostrils dripping, teeth now jagged.

                             CREATURE/OLD CRONE 
               You seek the warrior bathed in
               blood... the Headless Horseman.

     Ichabod slides back as far as possible while the creature
     claws the rock floor, yearning.

                             CREATURE/OLD CRONE 
               Follow the Indian trail to where the
               sun dies.  Follow to the tree of the
               dead.

     The creature pulls, testing the chains.  Behind, the BOLT
     holding the chains to the wall slips.  The wall cracks.

                             CREATURE/OLD CRONE 
               Climb down to the Horseman's soulless
               place and let loose his silent
               shrieking.  Do you hear?  Do you hear?!

     Ichabod nods, quaking, aghast.  He glances to the exit.

     The chain bolt gives more... coming loose...

                             CREATURE/OLD CRONE 
               He who holds fast the Horseman's
               desire will guide his reaping hand.
               Catch hold of his desire.

     Ichabod bolts for the door.  The creature HOWLS, leaping...

     The chain bolt breaks...

     Ichabod cries out, tackled to the floor...

     It is the Old Crone who landed on him.  She has returned to
     human form, semi-conscious.  Ichabod shoves her off.

     EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     Ichabod runs out into the howling storm, past Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               We are leaving.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What happened?

     Ichabod scrambles onto Gunpowder, heading further into the
     woods, glancing back.  Young Masbath follows.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- EARLY EVENING

     No rain.  Dark.  A lantern's glow creates shifting shadows as
     Ichabod and Young Masbath ride.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Follow the Indian trail to where the
               sun dies.  To the tree of the dead. 
                     (looking back) 
               Maybe we passed it by.

                             ICHABOD 
               How could something named "the tree
               of the dead" fail to draw attention?

     A BIRD CRIES OUT.  Ichabod's startled, looking up.  The BIRD
     is HEARD ALIGHTING.  Leaves float downwards.

                             ICHABOD 
               We should not go much further in
               this murk.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Should we go back?

                             ICHABOD 
               We are far from the Hollow. 
                     (dismounts, troubled) 
               Loath to say it... better to get our
               backs against a tree and stay till
               morning.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS (TIME CUT) -- NIGHT

     Horses are tied.  Ichabod is seated against a tree.  A
     campfire burns.  Young Masbath lies on a blanket, rifle cross
     his chest, staring to treetops.

     Leaves and branches shift in the wind.  Bats fly wildly.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What does it mean... climb down to
               the Horseman's soulless place?

                             ICHABOD 
               "Let loose his silent shrieking."
               Who knows, till we work at it?  I
               admit not being anxious to find out.
                     (pause) 
               "He who holds the Horseman's desire
               will guide his reaping hand."
               Whatever the Horseman's desire is,
               other than extinguishing lives.

     A SNAPPING BRANCH.  Ichabod raises his pistol.

                             ICHABOD
                     (to Young Masbath) 
               Do not move.

     Ichabod rises.  He creeps forward, pistol and lantern
     forward.  Foliage is thick.  CRUNCHING LEAVES are HEARD.

     Ichabod crouches, puts down the lantern and picks up a
     branch.  He tosses the branch to the foliage...

     SOME ANIMAL darts away, a running blur.

     Ichabod rises, following with his pistol.

     ANOTHER ANGLE, MOVING P.O.V.: low to the ground,
     moving swiftly at Ichabod...

     Ichabod spins, blindsided.

     Young Masbath fires his rifle -- CRACK!!

     The ANIMAL is KNOCKED DOWN mid-leap, yelping...

     The beast lands, a mass of grey fur.

     Ichabod comes to stare down.  Young Masbath arrives.  They
     both look to the beast, horrified.

     The creature lies helplessly spastic; a TWO-HEADED WOLF, with
     one head blown open to brain and gore.  Its living head
     lifts, MEWING sadly, eyes pleading.

     Ichabod step up with pistol.  FIRES.  MEWING STOPS.

                             ICHABOD
               What God-forsaken hell is this?

     Ichabod swallows back sickness, looking away.  Something
     catches his eye.

                             ICHABOD
               Christ...

     Through the forest: the SKY'S LIT UP.  Distant fire.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, CAVE HOME -- EARLY EVENING

     Ichabod and Masbath ride up, confronted by the Crone's cave
     vomiting flame out all orifices.

     Ichabod approaches.  Embers swirl everywhere.  The Old
     Crone's body lies amongst bloodied leaves.  Headless.


     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

     Much commotion.  A MOB in front of the home marked
     "LANCASTER, PHYSICIAN."  Steenwyck addresses the rabble.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               You all stand idle, while this man
               goes about with a book of secrets and
               a bag filled with magic.  You all
               stand idle, while the shadow of the
               Devil falls over our town.

     Baltus, Lady Van Tassel and Katrina watch at safe distance.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               I say, if you do nothing, you share
               in the blasphemy of Ichabod Crane!

     Killian, on horseback beside his wife, BETH, and son, Thomas,
     rides to one side of the shouting crowd.

                             KILLIAN 
               Listen to me!  Do you want to save
               your crops?  Or would you rather see
               your farms go to ruin?

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               How is he saving our farms?  How?
               Ichabod Crane has brought into our
               midst the soulless, moldering corpse
               of a heretic!

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod examines the Crone's neck wound with magnification
     spectacles.  Young Masbath is seated, ledger in his lap.

                             ICHABOD
               The wound is neither smooth nor
               cauterized, but jagged.  She bleeds
               like a fountain.

     Ichabod lifts her dead hand to show bruises and cuts.

                             ICHABOD
               She did not go quietly.

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT

     Doctor Lancaster wrings his hands.  His WIFE rocks nervously
     in a rocking chair.  The CROWD outside ROARS as a bonfire
     lights up the curtained windows.

     The front door is POUNDED open.  ANGRY MEN enter.  Lancaster
     stands, lips quivering.  He points insistently to a door.

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Angry men break in.  Ichabod looks up.

                             ANGRY MAN
               Step aside, Constable.  Step aside...

     Ichabod is shoved aside, spectacles knocked off.

     The group grasps the Crone.  Masbath stands on his chair,
     clutching the ledger.  Ichabod grabs one man.

                             ICHABOD
               What are you doing?

     The man slams Ichabod back.

     Magnification spectacles are crushed under foot.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

     Angry men carry the corpse to a raging bonfire.  The mob
     makes way.  Steenwyck cheers them.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               Let her burn!  Let her burn!

     Ichabod comes out, followed by Young Masbath.  The Crone's
     corpse is thrown in the fire.  Cheers all around.

     At Ichabod's side, a man tries to grab the ledger Young
     Masbath holds.  Young Masbath cries out, hanging on to the
     book.  Ichabod joins the struggle.

     Katrina watches, emotions conflicting.

     Other men grab Ichabod.  One punches Ichabod in the face.

     Katrina rides forward as Baltus calls for her to stop.

     Katrina leaps down, into the crowd, pulls men off Ichabod.

                             KATRINA
               Stop this!  Leave them alone!

     A SHOT RINGS OUT.  Chaos halts.  Everyone turns, quieting.

     The men around Masbath and Ichabod turn to face Brom Bones.
     Brom holds a smoking pistol, flanked by Theodore and Glenn.

                             BROM 
               Let them go
                     (pointing) 
               Are you going to beat an orphaned
               child, imbecile?

     Masbath is released, along with the ledger.  Steenwyck moves
     forward, pushing people aside.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               Are you Ichabod Crane's protector,
               Brom Bones?

                             BROM 
               Only for the moment.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               You side with him in this?

                             BROM 
               No.  I agree he has only made matters
               worse.  But, that will change, if you
               listen.

     He trades with Theodore, pistol for a long rifle.  Brom hefts
     the rifle, taking a round slug from his pocket.

                             BROM 
               Theodore, Glenn and I offer to ride
               each day and night to watch over the
               Hollow.  We will stalk the border of
               the Western Woods and haunt the
               Horseman for a change, with rifles
               like this... and slugs like this...

     Brom brings the slug to his lips, blows.  It WHISTLES.

                             BROM 
               Hollowed out and filled with powder.

     Brom smiles at Katrina, who watches unimpressed.

                             BROM 
               Constable Crane is not the only one
               who fights with science on his side.

                             ICHABOD 
               I fired upon the Horseman and the
               bullet did nothing.

                             BROM 
               You must have missed your mark.

                             ICHABOD 
               I hit him square.

                             BROM
                     (to the crowd) 
               I say... if the Horseman is solid
               enough to take the lives of our
               people, he's solid enough to feel
               this...

     Brom aims the rifle at a BARREL down the road.  FIRES.

     PLUNK -- the barrel is hit -- EXPLODES.  Smoke wafts.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     In bed, Ichabod is having unpleasant dreams once more.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.) 
               The night of the great storm, I saw
               her cross my windows.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY

     Young Ichabod is seated beside Father, eyes tearful.  We are
     back in the court where Mother stands trial.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN 
               In the lightning, I did see her.
                     (points to Mother) 
               Her. Lady Crane... I will never
               forget it.  The next moment, I found
               my infant son was dead, with the
               blood welt on his breast.

     The evil Third Man turns to a jury of TWELVE MEN.

                             THIRD MAN 
               You have heard it.  The blood welt
               is the mark of Satan's touch.

     As the crowd murmurs in fear, Young Ichabod looks to Father,
     who sits with hands clenched, emotionless.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT

     In the quiet kitchen, Young Ichabod looks across the table.
     Father stares into his food.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               She was with me, father.

                             FATHER
               Nothing can be done against them.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               She was with me that night.

     Father doesn't even look up.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Empty church.  Young Ichabod carries a lantern past pews.  A
     soldier is seated near the altar with a rifle.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               May I see her?

     The soldier exits through a white door.  Young Ichabod waits,
     looking up at the vast church.  The white door opens and the
     Third Man steps out.

                             THIRD MAN
               Go home.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               May I see my mother?

                             THIRD MAN
               You do not want to be here.  Go home
               to your father.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               She did not do it... please listen...

                             THIRD MAN
               She is guilty.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               No, sir, please... she is innocent...

                             THIRD MAN
               She has confessed.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               No.

                             THIRD MAN 
               She has admitted to her evil and
               signed a written confession.  Do
               you know what confession is?
                     (off Ichabod's nod) 
               All that is left for you now is to
               pray for her soul.

     The Third Man leaves through the white door.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod buttons his shirt.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S YARD -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod comes out, looks to the lawn, not
     understanding.  Father loads a wagon full of belongings.

                             FATHER 
               We are leaving.
                     (long pause)
               She has gone away.

     Realization comes to Young Ichabod.  He runs, away across the
     lawn as Father calls after him.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FOREST TRAIL -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod runs, weeping.

                             THIRD MAN (v.o.) 
               She has confessed.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- MORNING

     Empty.  Doors are thrown open and Young Ichabod enters.  He
     goes down the aisle, towards the white door.

                             THIRD MAN (v.o.) 
               She has admitted to her evil and
               signed a written confession.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD 
               Mother.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH, BEYOND WHITE DOOR -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod enters, halting.  The room contains TORTURE
     DEVICES: iron cuffs, thumb screws, knifes and needles.

                             THIRD MAN (v.o.)
               Do you know what confession is?

     He walks, numb, eyes locked forward...

     In the corner is a SPIKED CHAIR, adorned with sharp iron
     spikes.  Hundreds of spikes.  It is fitted with straps for
     holding down the "accused."

     Tears stream down Young Ichabod's face.  He kneels, hands on
     the spikes of the chair, pressing hard.

     As he sobs, blood runs down from his hands.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     In bed, Ichabod opens tear filled eyes.  He sits up, bringing
     his trembling hands to wipe his cheeks.  His hands trail
     blood. He looks to them...

     The old scars are bleeding.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Katrina comes to the door.  Ichabod is seated by the fire,
     eyes bleary, palms wrapped with bloodied cloth.

                             KATRINA 
               Constable Crane?

     Katrina comes beside Ichabod's chair.

                             ICHABOD
               Allow me some time.  I have spent
               every hour in the company of others.
               I need to be alone.

                             KATRINA 
               What troubles you?

     She moves in front.  Ichabod gets up and crosses to sit
     facing away.  Katrina takes the chair he deserted.

                             KATRINA
               The things I said to you before...
               I was wrong to say them.

                             ICHABOD
               No, actually, you were not.  Every
               word you spoke had truth in it.

                             KATRINA 
               What has happened?

     Ichabod sits silent, puts his head back, eyes closed.

                             ICHABOD 
               Lady Van Tassel... she is your
               stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so
               little resemblance.

                             KATRINA 
               What?

                             ICHABOD 
               She is not your birth mother, is she?

                             KATRINA 
               No, but... why do you ask that?

                             ICHABOD 
               What happened to your mother?  Is she
               still alive?

                             KATRINA 
               She died.  Her lungs were diseased...
               two years ago.  What is this about?

                             ICHABOD 
               Memories have come back.  I had them
               forgotten, and wish I could forget
               them again... but they are here now. 
                     (pause) 
               Lord, how I hate this place.

                             KATRINA 
               If you want me to go, I will.  Do you
               want me to leave?

                             ICHABOD 
               I... I do not know.  I no longer know
               what I think or what I feel.

     Katrina walks to him.  She touches his back.

                             KATRINA 
               Why are you so afraid of that?  Is
               there truly such harm in uncertainty?

     She kneels, smiles a little for him.  She reaches to touch
     his face, holds his head in her hands.  Leans to kiss him.

     He rests his head against hers, weary, putting his arms
     around her.  They kiss passionately.


     EXT.  THE HOLLOW -- EARLY MORNING

     Dawn light, is visible over forests pounded by rain.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- MORNING

     Ichabod exits his room, satchel in hand.  He looks down the
     hall, then steps back in to take a white rose from a vase.

     AROUND A CORNER, Ichabod comes to the last door.  He bends,
     slipping the white rose under the crack of the door.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- MORNING

     Rain.  Ichabod comes out.  Across the lawn, Young Masbath is
     bringing the horses.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL (o.s.) 
               Good morrow, Constable.

     Ichabod turns to see Lady Van Tassel in a chair, sewing.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Returning to the Western Woods?

                             ICHABOD 
               Yes, actually.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Use caution.

                             ICHABOD
                     (nods, studies her) 
               Do you know... I think those are the
               first words I have heard from you my
               entire time here.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               As my husband says, a wife should be
               always like an echo, and at the same
               time, quite unlike an echo.
                     (off Ichabod's confusion) 
               Like an echo, she should speak only
               when spoken to, and unlike an echo,
               should never try to have the last
               word, or, at least that is what he
               believes.

     Baltus comes out the door, irritable, skillet in hand.

                             BALTUS 
               Constable... did you notice anything
               out of the ordinary during the night?

     Ichabod eyes the skillet, ill at ease, trying not to be.

                             ICHABOD 
               Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?

                             BALTUS 
               Sarah has gone missing... my servant
               girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it.
               She has joined the migration out of
               town.
                     (to Lady Van Tassel) 
               What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am
               I to starve to death?

     Lady Van Tassel gets up and goes in, taking the skillet.

                             ICHABOD 
               I should be going... good day to you.

     Ichabod heads towards Young Masbath.  Baltus watches from the
     porch, disgruntled.  He goes in.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     Heavy rain.  Ichabod and Young Masbath ride side by side.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               If the Crone's wound bled hard, that
               means she was not killed by the
               Hessian.  Someone only tried to make
               it look that way.

                             ICHABOD 
               You grow sharper by the minute, little
               man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin
               to prefer your company over all others.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Well... I'm one of the few people who
               likes you.

                             ICHABOD
                     (laughs) 
               True enough.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And
               why?

                             ICHABOD 
               Good questions, deserving answers, of
               which we are in short supply.

     A SOUND is HEARD.  Ichabod looks back, then to Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               Quicken pace.

     Ichabod rides faster.  Young Masbath keeps up.

     FURTHER ON, they charge over a hill.  Ichabod halts Gunpowder
     and climbs clumsily off.

                             ICHABOD 
               Ride on.

     Young Masbath obeys.  Ichabod takes out his pistol and wades
     into forest growth, backtracking.

     INSIDE THE FOREST, Ichabod bounds through underbrush, low.  A
     HORSE is HEARD SNORTING.  He pushes through branches...

     Moving behind a FIGURE IN A GREY CLOAK on horseback.

                             ICHABOD 
               Halt and turn.  I have a pistol aimed
               at your head.

     The figure stops, pushes off the cloak hood.  Katrina.

                             KATRINA 
               It is only me.

                             ICHABOD
               Katrina.  Why do you follow?

                             KATRINA
               I apologize if I worried you.

                             ICHABOD 
               A woman should not be out alone in
               these woods.

                             KATRINA 
               But, I am not alone, am I?  I only
               wished to see what you were up to,
               and...
                     (takes out WHITE ROSE) 
               To thank you.

     Ichabod softens, but doesn't want to.

                             ICHABOD
               Come along.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY

     Raining still.  Ichabod, Masbath and Katrina come into a
     clearing, mouths falling open at the sight of...

     A monstrously huge TREE OF THE DEAD, at the clearing's
     center, with branches reaching far and wide, knotted and
     gross, like agony captured in wood sculpture.

     Ichabod dismounts, crossing a line beyond which grass and
     weeds will not grow.  Young Masbath and Katrina dismount.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               You were right... it does draw
               attention to itself.

     Ichabod stares up into the endless, dead canopy of branches.
     He circles the incredibly wide trunk.

     There's a VERTICAL WOUND in the bark, as if the tree once had
     a terrible vertical in it, now partially healed and
     disgustingly scarred.  Ichabod approaches.

     He feels the mushy scar, picking at its scabs till much sap
     begins to trickle. It is red and Ichabod fingers it.

                             ICHABOD
               Blood.

                             KATRINA
               What did you say?

     Ichabod goes to where Katrina and Masbath wait with the
     horses, digs in a saddle bag for a hand axe.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               What is it?

                             ICHABOD
               Stay back.

     At the trunk, Ichabod thumps the flat end of the axe against
     the suture.  It sounds hollow.  Ichabod begins to chop.

     He pulls away loose bark.  The tree drips more blood and a
     clear goo.  Ichabod uses both hands on the axe to hack at the
     festering suture.

                             KATRINA
               What are you doing?

                             ICHABOD
               Just... keep where you are.

     Ignoring, Young Masbath moves closer.  Ichabod keeps
     chopping, then grips a large, loose flap of wood, trying to
     bend it.  It's not easy.  Ichabod struggles.

     Katrina follows Masbath's slow advance.

     Ichabod's pulling... the flap suddenly gives, revealing a
     blood-soaked, wide-eyed, gap-mouthed HUMAN HEAD.

     Ichabod recoils.  Behind him, Katrina stifles a scream,
     taking Young Masbath in her arms to keep him from looking.

     It is Philipse's head, hanging off the trunk flap, held by
     roots grown around and into the flesh.

     Ichabod reapproaches, back of his hand to his mouth.

     FOUR other SEVERED, DECAYING HEADS are held by ingrown roots
     within the dewy innards.

                             KATRINA 
               My God... what has happened?

                             ICHABOD 
               He... he tries to take the heads...
               they will not pass.

     He looks to the branches towering above.

                             ICHABOD 
               Must be some sort of gateway.  But,
               why this place... ?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               We should go.

                             ICHABOD 
               Why this tree?

     Ichabod begins looking at the ground, moving around the tree.
     He gets to his knees, pushing mud away.

     Uncovering a flush HEADSTONE carved with "666."

                             ICHABOD
                     (to himself) 
               "Climb down to the Horseman's
               soulless place."
                     (to Masbath) 
               Bring the shovel.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- LATER DAY

     Rain.  Young Masbath's crouched, muddy, rifle across his
     knees.  He's watching the tree.

     Behind him, Katrina climbs out of the shallow grave near a
     pile of mud.  Ichabod hands up the shovel.

                             KATRINA 
               Masbath, we've found it.

     Young Masbath goes to the grave.  Ichabod pulls at thick
     burlap cloth, straining as it comes away.

     Ichabod looks down, disbelieving.

                             ICHABOD 
               It cannot be true.

     WE SEE: roots have gripped the Horseman's bones and tattered
     uniform.  The skeleton is all there -- except the skull.

                             ICHABOD 
               Why is it every grave I open holds
               a new mystery inside?

                             KATRINA 
               The skull is gone.

                             ICHABOD 
               Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.

     Ichabod climbs out, weary in body and spirit.  LIGHTNING.
     THUNDER.  He stares at the bones.

                             ICHABOD 
               This is his silent shrieking... and
               his desire, to reclaim his head.

     Ichabod turns, looking to the bordering forest.

                             ICHABOD 
               "He who holds fast the Horseman's
               desire will guide his reaping hand." 
                     (pause) 
               Someone controls the Horseman.

                             KATRINA (o.s.) 
               Ichabod!

     Ichabod turns, looks...

     Katrina and Young Masbath back away, because the ROOTS in the
     grave are ALIVE, further entwining around remains.

     Ichabod spins to the twisted tree...

     The vertical SUTURE SEETHES, pulling inwards... sucking
     Philipse's head back in and closing, bubbling.

     Ichabod bounds over grave dirt pile, hastening Katrina and
     Young Masbath along as he flees.

     At the tree, the suture swells.

     Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath pass where their freaking
     horses are tied to a fallen trunk, heading for cover.

     A RUMBLING is HEARD from the twisted tree, which suddenly
     BURSTS wide, spitting smoldering cinders.

     At the tree line, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath cower,
     looking back.

     From the tree wound, a glow brightens, till the Headless
     Horseman and Daredevil EXPLODE into existence...

     They hit the ground running.

     Ichabod watches the Horseman ride away with bolts of
     LIGHTNING STRIKING the GROUND BEHIND.

     The Horseman disappears in the forest.

                             ICHABOD
               His next victim is chosen!
                     (to Masbath)
               Give me distance, then guide her
               back to the Hollow.

     Ichabod runs towards the horses.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Constable!

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     The Horseman rips past on Daredevil.

     EXT.  BEHIND IN WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     Ichabod rides as fast as Gunpowder is able.


     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Small home.  Killian, Thomas and Beth have finished supper.
     Beth clears plates as Killian picks his teeth with a knife.

                             THOMAS
               May I be excused, father?

                             KILLIAN
               Do you deserve to be?

                             THIRD MAN
                     (shyly)
               I think so.

                             KILLIAN
                     (smiles)
               Then, go.

     Thomas gets down from his chair.  He goes to the fireplace to
     light a tallow wick, which he takes to the next room.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Thomas plops on the floor and lights his MAGIC LANTERN: a
     lantern with an outer sleeve of glass painted with
     silhouettes of lions and monsters.

     Thomas turns the lantern and looks to the walls where the
     creatures, shadows are thrown.  He roars for them, imagining
     them real and having a grand time.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Beth comes for more dishes.

                             BETH 
               Don't pick teeth.  You teach Thomas
               bad habits.

     Killian pulls her to him, playful.

                             KILLIAN 
               I am a bad habit.  There's nothing
               for it.

                             BETH
                     (kisses him) 
               No one knows better than I.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Thomas continues his fun, shadow animals circling him.

     In the shifting light, a baby spider comes from a crack in
     the wall.  Then, another spider skitters out.  More follow.

     EXT.  FORESTS -- DAY

     A black horse runs, hooves pounding the ground.  THUNDER is
     HEARD.  The horse slows and stops... it is Brom's horse, with
     Brom aboard.  Brom looks skyward.

     The storm harshens, roaring through the trees.  Distant
     HOOFBEATS can be HEARD.  POUNDING.

     Brom takes his rifle off his shoulder.  The HOOFBEATS grow
     LOUDER and PASS, far away.  Brom turns in the saddle and
     WHISTLES.  He kicks his horse and rides.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Thomas still watches shadow beasts, but sees something else.
     He goes to the crack where hundreds of spiders flee all
     directions. Thomas is amused.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Behind Killian, mantelpiece stones pulse, breathing almost
     imperceptibly.  Demonic faces form, then disappear and reform
     again, shifting.  WIND HOWLS.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth enters, looking at Thomas.

                             BETH
               What are you doing there?

     The magic lantern stops spinning.  Shadow creatures freeze.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     The ENTIRE HOUSE CREAKS.  Killian looks up.  CREAKING STOPS.
     The HOWLING WIND is LOUD.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth comes to Thomas' side as he points.

                             THOMAS
               Spiders.

     Beth bends to see the swarming spiders.  She looks up,
     noticing the FEROCITY of the WIND.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Killian stands, looking up.  The HOUSE CREAKS again, then
     suddenly the WIND CEASES.  Silence.

                             KILLIAN
               Beth...

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth picks up Thomas.  The magic lantern creatures begin
     spinning anew, all around.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     With a ROAR, the fire flares.  Killian looks.

     WHHOOOSH the fire shoots up the fireplace.  Gone.

     Behind Killian, the DOOR SPLINTERS INWARDS.  The Horseman
     steps in, a battle axe in each hand.  WIND BLASTS...

     The DOOR to the other room SLAMS.

     Killian grabs a kitchen chair and hurls it at the Horseman.
     The Horseman swings, smashing it aside.

                             KILLIAN
               Beth... run!

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth hugs Thomas to her as she backs away.

                             KILLIAN (o.s.)
                     (from kitchen)
               Get out!

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Killian grabs an iron skewer from the fireplace, swings it to
     fend off a blow from the Horseman.

     The Horseman swings the other axe.  Killian ducks.  The axe
     cracks fireplace stone, throwing sparks.

     Killian lunges, jamming the skewer into the Horseman.

     The skewer comes through the Horseman's back.  The Horseman
     swipes with the flat of one axe -- pounding Killian aside.

     Killian hits the wall, bashing his head.  Hits the floor.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth kicks a carpet to reveal a trap door.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     The Horseman pulls the skewer out of his body, throws it.  He
     goes to lift Killian by the hair with one hand, brings back
     the axe in the other...

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     At the trap door, Beth lowers Thomas to stairs leading to the
     cellar.  Thomas is crying.

                             BETH
               Don't let him get you.

                             THOMAS
               Mommy...

                             BETH
               You hide now... go...

     Beth closes the trap door, frantically replacing the carpet.
     The room's door flies open and the Horseman strides in,
     carrying Killian's severed head.  Beth shrieks.

     The Horseman steps forward, knocks over the magic lantern.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY

     Beth's SCREAMS are abruptly CUT OFF.  Her BODY is HEARD
     HITTING the floor above.  Thomas crosses the cellar,
     stumbles.  He scurries into the shelter of a wheelbarrow
     propped against the wall.  FOOTSTEPS are HEARD.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     The Horseman's hands place Killian's and Beth's heads in a
     sack, cinching the sack shut.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     The Headless Horseman enters, bends to retrieve the battle
     axe he left.  He stands.  Pause.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY

     Thomas' trembling hands pull the wheelbarrow closer.  QUIET.
     He tries to control his sobbing.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     The Horseman turns, falls to his knees.  He starts to chop at
     the floor with both axes.  CHOPping,  CHOPping,  CHOPping...
     making quick work of it...

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY

     A hole appears in the ceiling as debris falls.

     Thomas looks up, terrified.  He gets up to run away...

     The Horseman's arm shoves through above, grasping Thomas and
     yanking him up.

     EXT.  KILLIAN'S FARM -- DAY

     Brom rides from the forest, charging across Killian's field.

     At Killian's house, Daredevil rides up as the Headless
     Horseman walks out with his sack of heads.  The Horseman ties
     the sack to the saddle and leaps up.

     Brom puts his reins in his mouth, raising his rifle.

     The Horseman heads away, past the barn, as Brom gains.

     Brom aims... FIRES!

     BOOM -- the slug EXPLODES, blowing the Horseman off
     Daredevil.  Daredevil keeps going.  The Horseman's smoldering
     body is left "face down."

     Brom halts his horse.  He climbs down, pleased.

     The Horseman moves.

     Brom backs away, satisfaction diminishing.

     The Horseman gets on his knees.

     Brom falls to one knee, begins reloading.  He fills the gun
     from his powder horn.

     The Horseman stands, unsheathes his sword and turns.  The
     blast has blown apart his uniform at the chest and shoulder,
     exposing rotten flesh and maggot-infested muscle.

     Brom readies his ramrod, jamming powder in the barrel.

     The Horseman charges.

     Brom stands, pulling out the ramrod.  The Horseman is on him.
     Brom swings the rifle, blocking.  Sparks fly.

     The battle is on, with Brom fending off the Horseman's sword
     with the gun -- CLANK -- CLANK -- CLANK.

     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod and Gunpowder break into the open.

     UP THE FIELD, the Horseman makes a backhanded swing.  Brom
     goes down, his rifle sent flying.

     Brom rolls to avoid as the Horseman slashes.

     Brom flees.  The Horseman pulls and throws a knife...

     THWAP -- the knife imbeds in Brom's thigh.

     The Horseman runs towards Brom.

     Ichabod closes in, pulling an unlit lantern off his saddle.

     Brom tries to get up, bends to extract the knife.

     The Horseman, mid-run, changes his sword grip, blade down.

     He plants one foot on Brom's back, raising his sword, about
     to skewer...

     Ichabod arrives full gallop, SMASHES the lantern into the
     Horseman -- knocking the Horseman off Brom.

     AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST, Theodore and Glen arrive on
     horseback.  They hold a moment, watching.

     Brom runs, limping, to the barn, goal in sight: farm
     implements propped there.  Brom grabs SCYTHES with long
     curved blades, one in per hand.

     The Horseman rises.

     Ichabod turns Gunpowder and leaps off, runs to Brom.

     The Horseman moves towards them, hefting a battle axe in his
     free hand.  Ichabod steps up, pistol aimed, furious.

                             ICHABOD
               For what it's worth...

     FIRES -- the bullet rips through the Horseman's stomach to
     reveal putrid innards as he keeps advancing.

     At the forest, Theodore looks to Glenn, turns and flees.

     Brom steps up, scythes ready.  He and the Horseman go at it.
     Brom blocks axe and sword, catching and deflecting blows.

     At the forest, Glenn follows Theodore away.

     Ichabod grabs a long handled SICKLE.

     Brom swings the scythes.  The Horseman avoids.

     Ichabod moves to the side, looking for an opening.  He swings
     the sickle. The Horseman blocks.

     The Horseman battles both at once, catching blows...
     countering every strike, METAL RINGING.

     Brom catches the Horseman's sword in one scythe, holding it
     off.  Catches the axe handle in the other scythe.

     The Horseman flatfoot KICKS Brom's chest, sending him down.

     Ichabod swings the sickle blade...

     Hits the Horseman, the blade embedding to the hilt.

     The Horseman drops his axe and grasps the sickle, jerking...

     The sickle handle SLAMS Ichabod's, knocking him away.

     Ichabod crawls, tries to shake off the blow.

     He looks up.  The Horseman staggers, spastically trying to
     pull the blade from his body.

     Brom limps to Ichabod, yanks him to his feet.

                             BROM
               We cannot win this.

     They head towards the forest.

     Behind, the Horseman extracts the sickle, throws it.  He
     strides after them, picks up his axe on the way.

     EXT.  RIVERBANK -- DAY

     Ichabod and Brom stumble down a hillside.  Brom points.

                             BROM
               There...

     They run to a DOCK at the edge of a wide, rapid river.  They
     jump into a FLAT BOAT barge.

                             BROM
               Go to the front and guide it.

     Ichabod goes.  Brom uses a scythe to slash the ropes.

     Ichabod picks up a GUIDE POLE.  The barge lurches, set free.

     Ichabod struggles to push the boat out.  it moves swiftly,
     caught in rain swollen current.

     Brom looks back.  No Horseman.  He leaves the scythe and
     moves to the front, hefting another pole to help guide.

                             BROM
               Let's see him catch us now.

     Ichabod looks to the shore.  Horror.

                             ICHABOD
               Look.

     LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES -- ahead, the Horseman stands on the
     bank with Axe and sword.  Daredevil near.

                             BROM 
               We'll pass right by the son of a bitch.

     Ichabod and Brom push with the poles, trying for speed.

     At the bank, the Horseman walks directly to the water...

     Just as he takes a step onto the water, the rain churned
     surface TRANSFORMS -- instantly BECOMING a SHEET of ICE...

     SPREADING and supporting the Horseman as he advances.

     ICE SHOOTS OUT ahead of him, towards a point in the river
     where it will intercept the barge.

                             BROM
               My Christ...

     The Horseman's ICE BRIDGE engulfs the barge, HALTING IT.

     Ichabod and Brom are thrown.  The barge is trapped.

     The Horseman nears.

     Brom runs to the rear to retrieve his scythe.  Ichabod holds
     up the only weapon he has, his guide pole.

     The Horseman steps on board.  Ichabod swings.  The Horseman's
     axe cracks the pole in half...

     The Horseman thrusts with sword -- into Ichabod's chest --
     clean through.  It SIZZLES as Ichabod screams.

     The Horseman lifts Ichabod up, flips him, pulling the sword
     out as Ichabod goes...

     SMASHING through the ice and under.

     UNDERWATER: water carries Ichabod, slams him against ice
     above. He's pulled down by undertow.

     ABOVE WATER, beyond the edge of the ice bridge: Ichabod comes
     up, gasping, choking on rain.

     He treads water, looking to the barge.

     ICHABOD'S P.O.V. -- FROM THE WATER

     Aboard the barge, the Horseman cuts Brom down... stands over
     him, chopping with sword.  Our VIEW grows BLURRY, and...

     FADES OUT/IN

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Candlelight.  Ichabod, shirtless, feverish, opens his eyes.
     The wound at the top of his chest is raw.  Katrina inserts a
     needle in the skin around it.

                             KATRINA
               Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Doctor, he is awake.

     Ichabod tries to sit.  Pain stops him.  Lady Van Tassel helps
     bleed the wound with the needle and a tube leading to a
     SUCTION JAR of blood.

                             ICHABOD
                     (barely a voice)
               What... what are you doing... ?

                             KATRINA
               I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.

     Doctor Lancaster comes to the bed.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               Keep still, Constable.  You were
               half-drowned when they found you.

                             ICHABOD
               ... Brom Bones...

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               He is dead.  You would be also, if
               your wound had not somehow shut.

                             ICHABOD
               Bring Young Masbath here.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               You need to sleep.

                             ICHABOD
               Bring him.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               You need rest.

     Ichabod gives up, closes his eyes.  Katrina, needle in one
     hand, brings her other hand to hold Ichabod's.

     Blood drips into the suction jar.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Ichabod is soundly asleep.  Across the room, Katrina is at
     his work table.  Ichabod stirs.  Katrina looks to him.

     Once she is satisfied he will not wake, she returns to what
     she was doing, turning a page.  She is reading his ledger.

     EXT.  SERVANT'S QUARTER'S, MASBATH'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath lies awake.  A glint of light crosses the
     window.  Masbath looks to it, gets up, peers out.

     THROUGH THE WINDOW, he can see the Van Tassel Manor House in
     the distance.  Lantern LIGHT crosses the lawn.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE, ORCHARD -- NIGHT

     The lantern light moves through the orchard, away from the
     house.  We cannot make out the person.

     Elsewhere, Young Masbath runs in pursuit.  He hides against
     one tree, leans to look...

     The light enters forest.  Young Masbath follows.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- MORNING

     Ichabod's hurting.  Masbath helps with a shirt.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Someone left last night.  Looked
               like they headed to the square, but
               I lost them in the forest.

                             ICHABOD 
               Man or woman?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               All I saw was their lantern.

                             ICHABOD 
               Business, best hidden is hidden best
               at night.

     Ichabod goes to his work table, organizing his satchel.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               If someone has the Horseman's skull...
               if they control the Horseman, then why
               haven't they sent him for your head
               yet?

                             ICHABOD 
               Because, I serve a fine purpose alive.
               It is perfection for our murderer if I
               return to New York City with nothing
               more than tales of a galloping ghoul. 
                     (pause) 
               We must uncover the reason these
               victims were targeted.  What was taken
               from them... other than their lives?
               Who benefits by their deaths?

     Ichabod fumbles the bottle of white powder.

     It bounces, cork popping out... rolls under the bed.

                             ICHABOD 
               Damn it.

     Ichabod kneels, pained.  A trail of the blood-detecting
     powder has spilled.  The bottle is out of reach.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               I'll get it.

     Young Masbath gets down, ready to crawl for it, but Ichabod
     stops him, peering under.

                             ICHABOD
               Wait...

     Far under, near the bottle, some powder is bubbling.

     Ichabod moves to the end of the bed and lifts, in pain. 
     Young Masbath helps. They drag the bed to one side.

     Under the bed: a Satanic PENTAGRAM has been DRAWN IN BLOOD.

     Ichabod stares, trying to grasp the implication.  Masbath is
     about to speak, but Ichabod puts a finger to his lips.

     Ichabod moves to lock the door.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
                     (whispers) 
               Who did this?

     Ichabod does not answer.  He picks up a wash basin and dumps
     the water to wash the Pentagram away.


     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- DAY

     WAGONS, HORSES and TOWNSPEOPLE swarm.  A CROWD loots the
     town's general store.  Provisions are passed along man to man
     and loaded on wheelbarrows.

     All up and down the long straight road, home owners board up
     windows with lumber.

     Ichabod and Young Masbath ride, passing many angry faces.

                             ICHABOD
               Panic has set in.

     They stop, tying their horses and climbing stairs to the door
     of the "NOTARY."  Ichabod looks off...

     DOWN THE ROAD, at the far end, people head to the church.
     Much activity there as well.

                             ICHABOD
               Sanctuary.  Or, so they hope.

     Families put up tents all around the church within the
     bordering wrought-iron fence.  Supplies abound.

     People work to build and erect massive wooden crosses.


     INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY

     Tidy room.  Young Masbath watches Ichabod hand a slip of
     paper to the elderly Notary, Hardenbrook.

                             ICHABOD
               Do you have these persons' wills?

                             HARDENBROOK
               I have everything... last testaments...
               birth certificates, death certificates...
               deeds.

                             ICHABOD
               Yes, sir... but, do you have these?

     Hardenbrook studies the paper with his one good eye.

                             HARDENBROOK
               Certainly... certainly.

     Hardenbrook nods, handing the list back, grinning.  Ichabod
     stands waiting.  Hardenbrook is still nodding.

                             ICHABOD
               May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?

                             HARDENBROOK
               Hmm?  See them?

                             ICHABOD
               May we look at them now?

                             HARDENBROOK 
               Of course.  You want them... it shall
               not take long.  Wait here.

     Hardenbrook heads across the room.  Ichabod offers the list.

                             ICHABOD
               Maybe you should take this.

                             HARDENBROOK 
               A fine idea.

     Hardenbrook takes it and exits.  Young Masbath sits.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What good is this?

                             ICHABOD 
               To discover what might have been taken
               from those who died, it will help to
               know what was there that could be
               taken in the first place.

     Ichabod waits.  After a moment, he looks uncertain.  He
     crosses to the half-open door...

     INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM -- DAY

     Ichabod sticks his head in, not liking what he sees.

     Hardenbrook's amidst unbelievable disarray.  Tables, shelves,
     and baskets of unevenly piled documents.

     Hardenbrook looks on a shelf, confused, then goes to a table,
     lifting papers, mumbling.

                             HARDENBROOK 
               Damn... damn... damn...

                             ICHABOD
               Master Hardenbrook...

     Hardenbrook turns, a bit startled.

                             ICHABOD 
               Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?

                             HARDENBROOK
               Well... that might be... helpful.

     INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM (TIME CUT) -- DAY

     Hardenbrook is asleep in a chair, snoring, blind eye open.
     Ichabod and Young Masbath face official-looking documents,
     with Ichabod focused on one will in hand.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               My father had farm land.  It was the
               only thing we owned of any value.

                             ICHABOD
                     (still reading) 
               And it now belongs to you, according
               to Baltus.  I heard him say it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Yes.

     Ichabod turns the will in his hand to Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               Then look here at your father's will,
               and tell me why you are not listed.

     Young Masbath takes it, boggled.  Ichabod grabs another.

                             ICHABOD 
               Van Garrett had denoted his elder son
               in his last wishes; the same son
               murdered along with him.  But Van
               Garrett's wife and two infant children
               are not written... and they were spared.
                     (picks up another will)
               Do you see?  Philipse had no family to
               bestow his farm to.  But, here...
                     (picks up another) 
               The Widow Windsor was listed on her
               late husband's will.  After her
               inheritance, she amended the document
               to include her bastard child.  This is
               why the Horseman made absolutely
               certain to impale the unborn descendant.

     Ichabod sits back.

                             ICHABOD 
               Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that
               the Horseman slaughters by assignment.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               But, if the farm is not mine, who stole
               it away?

                             ICHABOD 
               No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has
               gone intestate.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               In test... what?

                             ICHABOD 
               Intestate.  Your farm... all the
               farms... they belong to no one.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What does it mean?

     Ichabod stares off.

                             ICHABOD 
               Often in such cases, property which
               has gone intestate legally passes to
               whomever the deceased was indebted to.
               And, who in this town is owed a great
               many debts?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
                     (realization) 
               Baltus Van Tassel.

                             ICHABOD 
               Did your father take a loan?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.

     Ichabod stands, grim, gathering wills and his ledger.

                             ICHABOD 
               Tonight, we answer questions.  And, to
               discover who moves about the Van Tassel
               house after dark... all we need is a
               candle.

     A LOUD NOISE is HEARD from the other room.  Ichabod looks.

     INT.  HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY

     Ichabod bursts in.  No one there.  A chair has been knocked
     over and the front door is ajar.  Ichabod moves...

     EXT.  NOTARY -- DAY

     Ichabod exits.  All around is the commotion in the square as
     before.  No telling who it was who just fled.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY

     Young Masbath is seated, bored.  Ichabod writes in his
     ledger.  A KNOCK on the door.  They both look up.

                             KATRINA (o.s.)
                     (from outside door)
               Constable... are you there?
                     (long pause)
               Ichabod?

     The knob is tried and found locked.  Pause.  At the bottom of
     the door, a red rose is passed under.

     This saddens Ichabod.


     EXT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Quiet night.  The church is a sight, with a yard resembling
     an empty squatter's tent city, surrounded by crosses.
     Boarded over windows leak shafts of light.

     MOVING PAST THE WINDOWS: many eyes peer out from the slats.

     UP IN THE BELFRY, TWO RIFLEMEN are on watch.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Masbath are in darkness, still waiting.  Ichabod
     takes the cover off a lantern, looks at a clock.  Midnight,
     straight up.  Ichabod stands, picks up an unlit candle.

                             ICHABOD
               Midnight seems an appropriate time.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Young Masbath look out, cautious.  They move to
     the nearest door.

     Ichabod crouches, using the candle to mark the seam of the
     door and door frame.  He's making a low, wax seal.  If the
     door opens, the seal will break.

     They move to a second door, quietly.  Ichabod makes another
     low wax mark.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, MAIN ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs to a hall.  Ichabod
     continues his wax marking at each door.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, BALTUS' OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Young Masbath enter, shutting the door.  Ichabod
     walks to shelves at Baltus' desk, looks through ribbon bound
     DOCUMENTS and hands some to Masbath.

     Young Masbath pulls off the ribbon, pages through these "LOAN
     AGREEMENT" parchments.  Ichabod brings another pile.

                             ICHABOD
                     (whispering)
               They are alphabetical.

     Young Masbath has the M's.  "MARYIE," "MEGAPOLENISIS," AND
     "MELYN..." Not finding what he wants.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               There is no Masbath here.  My father's
               loan papers are missing.

                             ICHABOD
                     (regarding his documents) 
               There are none for Magistrate Philipse
               either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter,
               Thomas" "Pos, William."

     A FLOORBOARD CREAKS.  Ichabod looks, blows out the lantern.
     He and Young Masbath stand frozen.

     Across the room, light comes under the door, stops, then
     continues.  A DOOR is HEARD OPENING and SHUTTING.  Ichabod
     crosses to follow, pointing back.

                             ICHABOD 
               Keep looking.  Then, hide in my room
               and bolt the door till I return.


     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Lantern light moves, far ahead.  Ichabod follows.

     EXT.  FOREST, FURTHER ON -- NIGHT

     Ichabod stops, hidden.  He can see the light ahead, but it is
     no longer in motion.  He advances.

     EXT.  FOREST CLEARING -- NIGHT

     A lantern sits on a rock.  On a blanket, a semi-naked MAN and
     semi-naked WOMAN are in the midst of rough SEX.

     Ichabod crawls to peer from underbrush.

     The couple keeps coupling, with the man on top.  His grunts
     and gasps are particularly desperate.  He's all over the
     woman, who lays back... it is Lady van Tassel.

     Ichabod swallows, inches closer.

     Lady van Tassel pulls the man's shirt, exposes his flesh.
     She raises a small, sharp KNIFE behind his back.

     Ichabod's eyes widen.

     Lady Van Tassel brings the blade to her own hand, slicing
     deep in her palm.  Blood flows.  She rubs her cut hand over
     her partner's arching back, smearing blood.

     Lady van Tassel caresses the man's chest, neck, face...
     trailing blood.  The man lifts his head, in ecstasy, sucks
     the woman's bloody fingers... it's Clergyman Steenwyck.

     Ichabod backs away, having seen more than plenty.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath unlocks the door.  Ichabod enters.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               I was getting worried.  Who was it?

                             ICHABOD 
               Lady Van Tassel.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What was she doing?

                             ICHABOD 
               Something I really wish I had not seen.
               Never mind it.  Did you find the
               victims' loan agreements?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               No.  They are all missing.

     This troubles Ichabod.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               There is more, though.  While you were
               gone, I could hear someone else
               walking through the house.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Young Masbath creep round a corner.  Going to the
     LAST DOOR, Ichabod crouches, eyes narrowing...

                             ICHABOD
                     (whispers, to himself) 
               Katrina.

     The wax seal is broken, flecks of wax on the floor.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER AND HALL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs, checking all the wax
     marks.  Young Masbath finds one broken.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Here.

     Ichabod comes over, pushes the door...

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     They enter.  The kitchen is empty.  Ichabod crosses to
     another door, crouches.  Another broken wax mark.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT

     They enter... the room with the elaborate loom.  Ichabod
     moves his lantern to make a quick search, goes to table.

     He touches the top of a candle.  His finger comes away with a
     bit of still wet wax.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               There are no other doors.  This is as
               far as she could have gone.

                             ICHABOD 
               It is nothing.  She comes to read books,
               so her father will not find her.
                     (to convince himself) 
               It is absolutely nothing.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What books?

                             ICHABOD 
               Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does
               not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be
               long before Lady Van Tassel returns.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               But, sir... what books?  Where are they?

     Ichabod stops, looking around.  No books anywhere.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               If there is a secret place for books...
               it could be just as good for the
               missing loan agreements.

     Ichabod ponders this without saying anything.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     SEARCH MONTAGE:

     - Drawers are opened and searched, quietly.
     - Young Masbath uses a candle to look up the fireplace.
     - Ichabod opens a linen cabinet, unfolding blankets.
     - Young Masbath looks in a closet filled with big spools of
     sewing thread, on his knees, pulls a wooden box forward.
     Inside it, he finds only old cups and silverware.

     Ichabod pulls up a rug, feeling along the floorboards.

     Young Masbath crawls, doing the same.  He climbs under the
     loom, tapping on the floor.  TAP... TAP... TAP...

     He crawls further under the loom.  TAP... TAP... PLONK.  A
     hollow sound.  He taps again... PLONK... PLONK.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Constable.

     Ichabod comes over as Young Masbath lifts a loose board.
     Under the floor, there are piles of books.  Masbath brings
     them up, handing them to Ichabod, who studies the spines.

     Young Masbath reaches in up to his shoulder.  He comes up
     with "LOAN AGREEMENTS."

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Fie!  Here they are.

     Ichabod takes them.  Names are near the top: "Masbath," "Van
     Garret," "Philipse," and "Killian."

     Ichabod sits back, numb, his heart bitterly broken.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING

     Lady Van Tassel prepares food with two servants at the open
     fireplace/oven.  Ichabod enters, rushed.

                             ICHABOD 
               Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina
               is not in her room.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               No.  She has gone out.

                             ICHABOD 
               Where?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               She has taken the last of our grain
               to be milled.
                     (crossing to him) 
               You do have a background in the
               medical arts, don't you, Constable?

                             ICHABOD
               Very little.  I must be going...

     Lady Van Tassel holds out her cut palm, the gash sewn shut.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Will you look at this?  I cut my hand
               this morning: I sewed it myself, but
               I am afraid it will go bad.

     Ichabod takes her hand, distracted and nervous.

                             ICHABOD
               It appears well.  It has already
               clotted.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Look closer.  Do you have anything to
               clean it with?

                             ICHABOD
               It is fine.  Now, I must...

     Lady Van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the wrist, tight.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
                     (whispering, close) 
               I know you saw me.

                             ICHABOD
               What... ?

     Lady Van Tassel glances to servants, keeps her voice low.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               I know you followed last night.  You
               must promise not to tell Baltus...

     Ichabod tries to pull away, but she grips tighter.  The FRONT
     DOOR is HEARD SLAMMING.  Ichabod is panicky.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Have mercy on me.  Please... have mercy.

     Ichabod pulls away just as Baltus enters.  Lady Van Tassel
     goes back to work as if nothing happened.

                             BALTUS 
               Constable, it is urgent that we speak.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE FRONT PORCH -- MORNING

     Baltus leads Ichabod to the porch.

                             BALTUS 
               Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a
               meeting.  This time he is determined
               to have you forced out, or worse.

                             ICHABOD 
               How did you hear this?

                             BALTUS
               He came to me.  He promised great
               violence.  Said I should cast you out
               for my own protection.
                     (troubled pause)
               I must speak honestly.  There is no
               reason to think he will not meet with
               success.

     Ichabod looks to barn, sees Masbath bringing the horses.  The
     CHURCH BELL is HEARD TOLLING far away.

                             BALTUS 
               That is the meeting bell already
               calling.  With the murder of Killian
               and Brom, no one sees any good from
               you.  If... if you were to leave...
               you might be saving your own life.

     Ichabod studies Baltus, then offers his hand.  They shake.

                             ICHABOD 
               I appreciate your concern.  I thank
               you, sir.

     Ichabod hurries off, across the lawn, exasperated.  He runs.
     Masbath runs to him.  Ichabod takes Gunpowder and climbs up.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
                     (mounting his horse) 
               What now?  Where is she?

                             ICHABOD 
               Things have become complicated.
               Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead,
               find her and bring her to meet me
               outside the church.  Find her at all
               costs.  Quickly.

     They ride, fast.


     EXT.  FOREST -- DAY

     A conjuring pile of straw burns.  Gloved hands unfold a paper
     filled with clippings of human hair.  The hair is sprinkled
     on the fire.

     A cloaked FIGURE is kneeled at the pile.  The figure turns to
     remove A human SKULL from a cloth bag.

     The skull is placed at center in the flames.  It's teeth are
     sharp, cut to points.  The HORSEMAN'S SKULL.


     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     In the church yard refugee camp, food is prepared over fire.
     People inhabit the tents.

     INT.  CHURCH, STEENWYCK'S QUARTERS -- MORNING

     IN THE CHURCH: it's crowded with families.  Pews filled with
     bedding and belongings.  Steenwyck comes to CLOSE the DOUBLE
     DOORS of his quarters, turning, angry.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               You are astonishing, Constable.  Do
               you truly think your ridiculous
               accusations frighten me?

     Ichabod is doing nothing to hide his disdain.

                             ICHABOD 
               Only if I repeat them outside this
               room.  And, I will if I must...
                     (points to doors) 
               Out there, for all to hear.  Or...
               you may speak, as planned.  But, you
               tell them you feel compelled to move
               on to greener pastures.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               No.  You will not run me out.  No one
               will believe a word of what you say.

                             ICHABOD 
               Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does
               not travel alone for long here.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free
               thinker who does not believe in
               divinity.

                             ICHABOD 
               It is only important what you are.
               An adulterer...

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               I am the Lord's voice in this town.

                             ICHABOD
               Wallowing in sin and lust...

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               They need guidance.

                             ICHABOD 
               Wallowing quite literally in blood.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
                     (snapping, quaking) 
               Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!

                             ICHABOD 
               He may.  But, not soon enough for
               you, and not on your behalf.

     Ichabod walks.  Steenwyck is humiliated.

                             ICHABOD 
               You are so upset now... and yet, you
               seemed in such good spirits last night.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!

                             ICHABOD 
               Climb to the top of the tallest ladder
               you can find, Father.  That is the
               closest you ever come to God.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Pews are packed.  Steenwyck enters, walks to the altar.
     EVERYONE QUIETS.  Steenwyck has composed himself, barely.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               My friends... dear friends.  Those of
               you still on your farms, I thank you
               for coming.

     He sees Ichabod near the back.  THUNDER is HEARD OUTSIDE.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               I... I address unfortunate business. 
                     (pause) 
               I am forced to take my leave from
               Sleepy Hollow.  I will be moving on to
               do the Lord's work elsewhere.

     The GATHERERS MURMUR shock.  Ichabod walks out.


     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY

     Raining hard.  Baltus and Lady Van Tassel ride.

                             BALTUS 
               Hurry along.  The meeting has most
               certainly already begun.  We do not
               want Steenwyck as our enemy.

     Lady Van Tassel trails.  WOOD is HEARD SPLINTERING...

     Just off the road, a tree falls...

     The trunk catches Lady Van Tassel's horse on its rear flank.

     The horse falls.  Lady Van Tassel hits the dirt.

     Baltus looks back, halting.

     Lady Van Tassel looks up to Baltus in fear, then turns.

     Behind her, the Headless Horseman trots from, the forest on
     Daredevil, stops.  Calm.  He takes his axe in hand.


     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Storming.  The meeting is letting out.  Near the churchyard
     gate, Young Masbath rides with Katrina following on a horse
     cart.  Ichabod walks up as Katrina dismounts.

                             KATRINA 
               What is so urgent?

                             ICHABOD 
               Come with me.

     Ichabod leads her to where they can talk away from others.

                             KATRINA 
               Why have I not seen your face for so
               long?  You look much better.

     She touches his face, but he takes her hand, places the loan
     agreements there.

                             ICHABOD 
               Explain these.  I found them secreted
               away in the sewing room.

     Katrina's expression changes just so slightly to guilt.

                             ICHABOD 
               Why... why have I scrambled and run
               and clawed in all directions, only to
               find you against me?

     He stares at her.  Katrina stares back, in a small way
     defeated.  She looks for an out, but there is none.

                             KATRINA
               I have been reading your journal.
               I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating
               to resist. 
                     (pause, ashamed) 
               I rode to catch up with you at the
               Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I
               found you though, I overheard what you
               were said.

                             ICHABOD 
               It was you there?

                             KATRINA 
               When... when you spoke father's name
               along with accusations, I could not
               believe it.  I had to hide these... at
               least till I could confront him myself.

                             ICHABOD 
               And, what did he say?

                             KATRINA 
               He did not do these things.  If you
               knew him, you would realize...

                             ICHABOD 
               What did he say, Katrina?

                             KATRINA 
               I have not been able to face him yet.

                             ICHABOD 
               The loans give the land to your father.
               It does not matter survivors are still
               on their farms.  They could be thrown
               off... tomorrow... a year from now.

                             KATRINA 
               Yes, I have seen that, and I told you
               why I hid them.

                             ICHABOD 
               What would you have me believe?

                             KATRINA
                     (tiring, angry) 
               If you think I am behind this, say it.

                             ICHABOD 
               The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You
               share that name.

                             KATRINA 
               Call me a liar, then, and a murderess.
               Say it, out and out.

     Many people are starting to notice the confrontation.

                             ICHABOD 
               Katrina...

                             KATRINA 
               Speak the words, Constable.  What is
               stopping you?  What has happened to your
               ability to transcend sentimentality?

     Emotions tear at him.  Rain seems to pound down harder.

                             KATRINA 
               Oh, no.  No.  Please... don't dare stand
               looking as if you still care for me,
               after all that you have said.  If I were
               to confess, would that ease your
               suffering?  Would that make it easier
               for you to hate me?!

     A TORTURED CRY is HEARD O.S.

     Baltus comes charging through the square on his horse.

                             BALTUS
               The Horseman is coming!

     He's barely hanging on.  He stops, practically falling off,
     running towards Katrina and Ichabod.

                             BALTUS
               Save me...

                             KATRINA
               Father?

                             BALTUS
               He killed her...

     Baltus grasps Katrina, fearful.  HOOFBEATS are HEARD.

                             BALTUS
               The Horseman has killed her.

     Far behind, the Horseman rides to follow, axe held up.
     Instant mayhem -- people scatter all directions, screaming.

     Baltus runs headlong to the church.

                             KATRINA
               Father!

     Katrina runs after Baltus.  Ichabod backs away, watching the
     Horseman come, then heads to the church with Masbath.

     Baltus pushes through the iron gate, into tent city, joining
     the swarm of townsfolk pouring into the church.

     The Horseman rides behind, closing the gap.  Men, women and
     children run for cover all along the square.

     Amidst the churchyard panic, Ichabod looks back...

     The Horseman reaches the open gate and Daredevil suddenly
     rears up, snorting, unwilling to enter.

     The Horseman grabs Daredevil's reins, tries to move forward
     again.  Same result.  Daredevil freaks out.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Baltus makes his way in, shoving.  People are still clamoring
     in through the doors.

     Men pass rifles from stockpiles and climb onto pews at
     boarded windows.  Women herd children into a cellar.

     Baltus searches for a hiding place.  He looks across the
     church to see Steenwyck closing the doors of his living
     quarters.  Baltus moves...

                             BALTUS 
               Steenwyck!

     At the front doors, Katrina squeezes in with Ichabod and
     Young Masbath just as people are forcing the doors closed.
     It's madness.  People outside begin pounding.

     Katrina searches.

                             KATRINA 
               Father!

     Ichabod goes to a window, looking out between boards.

     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Across the yard, the Horseman gives his axe an underhand toss
     to the ground inside the gate.

     The AXE instantly BEGINS TO DEGRADE TO DUST in the rain.

     The Horseman rides, keeping outside the fence.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Ichabod comes away from the window, looking to panicked
     citizens.  He sees Katrina moving up the aisle...

     She's heading towards Baltus, who slams against the door to
     Steenwyck's room.

                             BALTUS 
               Damn you, Steenwyck!  Help me!
               Let me in!

     RIFLES BOOM LOUDLY as men at the windows begin firing.

     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     The Horseman circles, under fire.

     Great clouds of gun smoke shoot from the church.

     Men fire down from the belfry.

     Parts of the Horseman and Daredevil splatter red into the
     rain as slugs hit without effect.

     AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHURCH, the Horseman comes around,
     heading to the town square.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Rifleman shout to each other, running to the opposite windows
     to follow the Horseman.

     Young Masbath grabs a rifle and leaps to join the brigade.

     Baltus is still beating Steenwyck's door when a HUGE FARMER
     grips Baltus angrily and throws him...

                             HUGE FARMER 
               You'll kill us all!

     Baltus falls, knocking over pews.  Katrina's nearby.

                             HUGE FARMER 
               You're the one the Horseman wants.
               Why should we die for you!?

                             KATRINA
               NO!

     The huge farmer picks Baltus up, dragging him and shoving
     Katrina aside as she approaches.

     Ichabod's pushing past people, trying to reach them.

     EXT.  CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- DAY

     The Horseman brings Daredevil to a halt, yanking a large coil
     of ROPE off a hitching post.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     The huge farmer shoves Baltus to the floor again.

                             HUGE FARMER
               Get out!

     Others join the rage, pulling Baltus towards the front of the
     church, shouting.  Ichabod struggles to push them off.

                             ICHABOD 
               Stop this!

     Ichabod gets to Baltus' side, trying to protect.

                             ICHABOD 
               The Horseman cannot enter!  It does
               not matter who he wants, he cannot
               cross the gate!

     At the windows, ONE RIFLEMAN turns, crying out.

                             ONE RIFLEMAN 
               He's coming back!

     More panic.  The huge farmer moves towards Baltus.

                             HUGE FARMER 
               We have to save ourselves!

     Baltus pulls the pistol from Ichabod's holster, brandishing.

                             BALTUS 
               No!  Get away from me!

     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     The Horseman rides past the front, fired upon.

     He halts at the wrought iron gate, reaching to yank off one
     POST which is pointed on top, like an arrow head.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Baltus holds everyone's back with the pistol.

                             BALTUS 
               The next person to lay hands on me
               will have a bullet.  Stand off!

                             KATRINA
               Father...

                             BALTUS 
               No!  We're safe here.
                     (points at Ichabod) 
               You said it.  The Horseman will not
               have me.

     CRASH, the harpoon-like post SPEARS through a window,
     trailing rope tied to it...

     CRACK -- SKEWERS Baltus from behind, the bloodied point
     bursting out his breast bone.

     Baltus looks down, drops the gun... clutching the post with
     both hands.  Blood streams out his mouth.  Katrina screams.

     The rope yanks Baltus back.  He SLAMS into the WINDOW...

     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Baltus CRASHES out, hits the ground, dragged...

     Outside the fence, Daredevil runs with the rope tied around
     his saddle pommel.  The Horseman strides forward, sword out.

     Baltus SLAMS the fence and the rope snaps.  He is held there
     awkwardly, gurgling blood.

     The Horseman reaches Baltus... chops off his head.


     INT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS -- DAY

     The storm has passed.  Empty forest.  Long, peaceful pause,
     till Ichabod makes his way through, searching the ground.

     Ichabod comes to look down a small hill.  The corpse of Lady
     Van Tassel lies headless, in a dirty, torn dress.

     Ichabod walks to the body.  Lady Van Tassel's arm is twisted
     behind.  The sewn cut on the palm of her hand faces up.

                             ICHABOD
                     (shouting back)
               Here!  I have found her...
                     (looking at corpse,
                      quiet and miserable)
               Here she is.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL -- EARLY EVENING

     Doctor Lancaster comes out from where Katrina is asleep.  He
     closes the door, wipes his sweaty face.  Ichabod waits.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               It has been a terrible jolt to her
               nerves.

                             ICHABOD 
               You will stay at her side?

     Doctor Lancaster nods.  Ichabod walks.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- EARLY EVENING

     It's getting dark.  Ichabod comes out and crosses the porch.
     A few of the Hollow's residents are here.  Young Masbath gets
     up and follows Ichabod onto the lawn.

     Ichabod walks without waiting.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               She's the one who controlled the
               Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
                     (no answer)

                             ICHABOD 
               I need time for thinking.  Without you
               hanging on my coattails for a change.

     Ichabod keeps walking.  Young Masbath stops, wounded.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod stands holding a torch, looking up.  The whole area
     is bright from the light off a giant fire.

     There are broken lanterns and barrels around the agonized,
     twisted tree.  The tree is aflame, fire dancing up the trunk,
     and through every branch to lick the sky.


     EXT.  FOREST -- DAY

     Dawn.  Ichabod is seated overlooking the Hudson.  He stares
     at the beauty around him, brooding through bleary eyes.
     Gunpowder is tied to a tree.  BIRDS SING.

     The ledger is open in Ichabod's lap.  He thumbs pages
     absently, just keeps staring off.

     EXT.  FOREST -- DAY (TIME CUT)

     A fire burns in a circle of rocks.  Ichabod's ledger is
     thrown in.  The pages catch quickly.

     Ichabod watches, then walks away.  He's about to climb onto
     Gunpowder, but on second thought he opens his satchel and
     digs out a BOOK.  He walks back to the fire, throws it on...

     "Romeo and Juliet."  Flames devour it.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY

     The clearing is silent.  The twisted tree still stands,
     smoldering, impressive as ever, or perhaps even more so with
     the alien appearance its blackened skin now affords it.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod packs up baggage.  Young Masbath is miserable.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Won't you change your mind, sir?
               What can I say to convince you?

                             ICHABOD 
               Nothing.  To hell with this place
               and all the people here.

     Ichabod closes a bag, throws it with others.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Why... why are you like this?

                             ICHABOD
                     (pause, softening) 
               You do not know all that has happened.
                     (pause) 
               You cannot understand.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT

     A coach, with Gunpowder as one of its team, waits in the
     orchard.  Van Ripper comes to meet Ichabod and Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               Half now.  Half when we reach the
               city.

     Ichabod hands Van Ripper money.  Van Ripper takes the
     baggage.  Ichabod looks to the Manor House.  Only one light
     shines, in a second floor window.

     Katrina can be seen there a moment as she closes curtains.

     Ichabod turns to Young Masbath, who is beginning to cry.

                             ICHABOD 
               This is farewell.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Take me with you.  There's nothing
               left for me here.

                             ICHABOD 
               I cannot.
                     (bends to Masbath) 
               You should not worry.
                     (pause, sorrow) 
               Van Ripper and his wife will look
               after you.  They will.  You will be
               well cared for.

     Young Masbath hugs.  Ichabod hugs back, swallowing.

                             ICHABOD
               I am sorry.
                     (quietly) 
               Forgive me.  I failed you.

     Ichabod releases and goes quickly away, finding this misery
     unbearable.  He climbs in the coach.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Do not go, Constable.  How can you
               leave?

     INSIDE THE COACH, Ichabod slumps back in darkness and closes
     his eyes.  He pounds twice on the coach wall.

     OUTSIDE, Van Ripper whips the reins.  The coach starts.
     Young Masbath follows.  The coach picks up speed on the long
     straight road.

     Young Masbath stops, wiping tears.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Ichabod's coach moves through the town square.  A few people
     in the churchyard's tent city come out to watch it pass.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     The door is pushed open.  Young Masbath enters, looks around
     the empty room.  He goes to sit in a chair at the work table,
     crossing his arms and resting his head.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

     A plate of food sits untouched.  Katrina is slumped down in a
     chair, heartbroken, staring into the fireplace.

     Behind her, a shadow moves across the room.


     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT

     Van Ripper leads the coach through the stone pillars marking
     the entrance of Sleepy Hollow.

     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT

     Ichabod takes off his hat, sets it on the seat.  The window
     between him and the driver slides open.

                             VAN RIPPER 
               Sir... this is yours.
                     (offering something) 
               The Van Tassel girl said to give it
               to you after you were gone.

     Ichabod takes it.  It is the bird/cage spinning toy.  He
     studies it.  What melancholy.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Katrina sits with her eyes closed.  A BOARD is HEARD
     CREAKING.  She sits up. Suddenly, a FIGURE in black is behind
     her as she turns.  WHACK! -- a gloved fist strikes.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     A dull THUD is HEARD downstairs, like a body falling.  Young
     Masbath takes notice.  He moves to the door...


     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT

     Ichabod turns the strings on the bird/cage toy, ponders it.

     The paper disk spins, images flickering until the bird
     appears to be inside the cage.

     Ichabod keeps spinning it, looks out the window.

     A tear rolls down his cheek.

     The bird cage toy's rotation slows... stops.

     Ichabod looks at it a long moment, then pockets it and leans
     forward to the window at front.

     OUTSIDE THE COACH

     Ichabod's face appears behind Van Ripper.

                             ICHABOD
               Van Ripper, turn the coach about!

                             VAN RIPPER
               What did you say?

                             ICHABOD
               Turn around.  Now!


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER -- NIGHT

     Young	Masbath comes down the stairs, looking around meekly.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Hello?  Katrina?

     Masbath starts down a hall.  He does not see, in another
     room, Katrina's body is dragged across the floor.


     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

     The coach comes to Lancaster's.  Ichabod climbs out before it
     even stops fully, satchel in hand.  He hurries...

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT

     Doctor Lancaster, half asleep, comes to answer BANGING on his
     door.  Ichabod pushes past, taking Lancaster's lantern.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon the intrusion...

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod enters.  There are two coffins on the floor.

                             ICHABOD
               I never examined these bodies.

     Ichabod removes the lid from one coffin.  Lancaster is about
     to say something indignant, but then just looks disgusted.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               ... help yourself, you pompous ass.
               I will be in bed.

                             ICHABOD
               Would you stay, doctor?  I may need
               assistance.

     Lancaster reluctantly remains.  Ichabod stares at the dead
     Lady Van Tassel.  The neck wound is covered by a stained
     brown cloth, which Ichabod unwraps.

                             ICHABOD
               Stains of blood.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               What of it?

     Ichabod takes out one of the lenses that survived the
     magnification spectacles, bends to examine the neck.

                             ICHABOD
               Jagged flesh. 
                     (pause)
               The Horseman did not do this.

     Ichabod moves to the side of the coffin, lifting the hand
     with the stitched gash on its palm.

                             ICHABOD
               Here, Doctor.  Hold this just so...

     Lancaster holds the lens so that Ichabod can study the cut
     through it.  Ichabod takes a scalpel-like knife from his
     satchel, lifts the hand and cuts stitches.

     THROUGH THE LENS: the gash spreads easily, soft, bloodless.

                             ICHABOD 
               No clotting or gathering of pus.  No
               healing at all.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               What?

                             ICHABOD 
               When this cut was made, this person
               was already dead.
                     (stands straight)
               This is not Lady Van Tassel.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath enters.  The door swings shut.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Katrina.
                     (steps forward) 
               Is anyone here?

     Behind him, the door SLAMS open -- Lady Van Tassel reaches to
     grab Young Masbath by the throat.


     EXT.  CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod charges up to the church doors, pounding.

                             ICHABOD
               Open the door.  Open up, damn it!
                     (pounds, shouting)
               Lady van Tassel is alive.  The Horseman
               is her puppet.  Please... 

     The door opens and Huge Farmer points a rifle at Ichabod.
     Frightened people peer out from behind.

                             HUGE FARMER 
               Aren't we rid of you?

                             ICHABOD 
               Listen to me.  Lady Van Tassel has
               faked her death.  I need able men...

                             HUGE FARMER
               She's dead, and you have gone mad.

                             ICHABOD
               No...

                             HUGE FARMER 
                     (steps forward) 
               Get out!  Isn't it enough that you have
               ruined this town?  Go!

     Ichabod backs away from the gun, frustrated, runs...

     At the DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, Van Ripper is still on the coach.
     Ichabod sprints over, breathless, taking out his pistol.

                             ICHABOD
               Van Ripper... do you have a gun?

                             VAN RIPPER
               Yes.  Here...

     Van Ripper hold up a rifle.  Ichabod holds out his hand.

                             ICHABOD 
               May I see it?

     Van Ripper's confused, but hands the rifle over.  Ichabod
     immediately points his pistol at Van Ripper.

                             ICHABOD
               Get down.  Hurry!

     Van Ripper climbs off.  Ichabod climbs up, whips the horses.

                             ICHABOD 
               Sorry.

     Van Ripper watches the coach leave, still with his hands up.


     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     In a wooded area, Katrina lies unconscious.  Gloved hands
     reach to her hair and cut off a clump with SCISSORS.

     A conjuring pile has been made, containing a small animal's
     heart with an iron nail through it.  Katrina's hair is added
     and the pile is lit to burn.

     Nearby, Young Masbath watches, on his belly with his hands
     tied behind his back.

     Lady Van Tassel whispers over the fire, her white horse tied
     nearby.  She looks to Katrina, who stirs.

     Lady Van Tassel takes the Horseman's skull from a bag over
     her shoulder, places the skull in the flames.  THUNDER is
     HEARD.  Lady Van Tassel looks up, smiles.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT

     The wind tosses leaves in swirls.  The twisted tree opens
     wide, with a RUMBLE -- shafts of light shooting out.

     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod drives the coach hard ahead.

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Katrina sits up, groggy.  Lady Van Tassel looks down at her.

                             KATRINA 
               You... you are alive.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath
               dead along with me?

     Katrina sees Young Masbath, and beyond him, the dying fire.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               She commands the Horseman.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               And, quite beautifully done, wouldn't
               you say?  It is almost over.

     THUNDER again.  Wind starts to pick up.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
                     (of the wind) 
               He rides tonight.

                             KATRINA 
               Father saw you die.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman
               looming over me as I fled.  Things I
               wanted him to see.  But, as long as
               I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm
               me.  Baltus did not stay enough to
               see that.  He ran as a coward,
               unfettered by my fate.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Then, whose body was it... ?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               The precious servant girl Sarah.  I
               killed her and kept her body hidden,
               till I needed it.  And, when I
               return to the Hollow tomorrow, my
               version of the truth will come to
               pass. 
                     (faking meekness) 
               I mean, there I was that fateful day,
               following Baltus into the woods.  I
               did not know what he was up to...
               where he was going.  I worried for
               his safety.

     Katrina cautiously moves the hand she's supporting herself
     with, feels a rock and clutches it.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Imagine my surprise, finding him on a
               liason with a common servant.  A girl
               who had apparently become his secret
               love.

                             KATRINA 
               No one will believe your lies, whore.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               This whore will see your mouth shut
               forever very soon.  But... I am not
               going to kill you.  Not me...

     She picks up the Horseman's skull in her gloved hand.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               He will have that honor.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- NIGHT

     The Horseman rides Daredevil, a freight train of moldering
     flesh, heading towards a chasm with no bridge.

     They reach it, galloping in mid-air to the other side.

     EXT.  LONG STRAIGHT ROAD/VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod guides the coach into the Van Tassel orchard.

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Lady Van Tassel admires the skull.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL  
                     (mock sorrow) 
               Woe is me... that spying on my husband
               in his filthy indiscretion, I saw he
               and Sarah attacked by the Horseman.
               Oh pity me... so overcome was I that
               I wandered in the Western Woods...
               dazed... nearly blind from terror.

     Lady Van Tassel crouches, rubbing dirt on her face.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               And, tomorrow is my grand performance,
               having barely survived the elements...
                     (more emoting) 
               By sheer luck I found my way back to
               the Hollow.  But... what do I find
               here... ?  My dear, sweet step-daughter
               Katrina is dead.  Why has God forsaken
               her?

     Seeing that Lady Van Tassel lavish attention on Katrina,
     Masbath takes this opportunity to ease onto his knees.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
                     (of herself, pleased) 
               No one will suspect this sad woman who
               has been through such an ordeal.  With
               only the empty solace of her money and
               land to comfort her.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod leaps from the coach, bounds up the porch.

                             ICHABOD
               Katrina!

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     ICHABOD is HEARD.  Lady Van Tassel turns, astonished.

                             KATRINA
               Murderer!

     Katrina slings the rock -- strikes Lady Van Tassel in the
     head, a glancing blow that knocks her down.  Katrina runs.

     Katrina grips Young Masbath, helping him up...

     But, Lady Van Tassel scrambles up, grabs Katrina and throws
     her back to the ground.

     Lady Van Tassel steps hard on Katrina's ankle, touches her
     forehead, bleeding, pissed.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               You've been a naughty girl.

     Young Masbath leaps to action, charging head first -- slams
     into Lady Van Tassel, sends her backwards.

     Katrina runs and pulls Masbath up.  They flee.

                             KATRINA 
               Ichabod!

     Lady Van Tassel rolls, recovering, not very concerned.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Little bitch.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod comes out the open front doors... hearing...

                             KATRINA (o.s.) 
                     (far away) 
               Ichabod!

     Ichabod climbs back on the coach, taking off.

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Katrina and Young Masbath run out from a line of trees.

                             KATRINA 
               Ichabod!

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Here we are!

     BEHIND IN THE FOREST, Lady Van Tassel rides her white horse,
     in no hurry.  Wind kicks hard.  HOOFBEATS are HEARD.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Run, Katrina!  Fast as your pretty
               legs will carry you.  It makes no
               difference.

     ON THE LAWN, Ichabod drives towards Katrina and Masbath.

     Behind, at the tree line, Lady Van Tassel holds up the
     Horseman's skull, wind tossing her dress and hair.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Nothing will stop him now!

     At mid-field, Ichabod reaches Katrina and Masbath.

                             ICHABOD
               Climb up!

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Lady Van Tassel...

                             ICHABOD
               I know.  Hold on.

     With Katrina and Masbath on board, Ichabod turns the coach.
     Katrina unties Masbath's hands.  HOOFBEATS GET LOUDER.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Olly-olly oxen-free!

     Ichabod looks back towards Lady Van Tassel.

     At the treeline, the Horseman breaks into the open, hell on
     horseback.  Full speed ahead.

                             ICHABOD
               Christ.


     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT

     The coach hits the long straight road, away from the house.

     Katrina and Masbath hold on as the coach shakes violently.

                             KATRINA
               Where are we going?

                             ICHABOD
               I do not know.  Away.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Here he comes!

     Behind, the Horseman can be seen on the forest bordered road.
     Closing fast.  Breakneck pace.

                             ICHABOD
               We might make it to the church.

     Masbath takes a lantern, crawls back to the roof.

                             KATRINA
               Masbath... !

     He ignores, reaching the rear of the coach and throwing the
     lantern at the Horseman.  It smashes on the trail.

                             ICHABOD
               Damn it, boy, get back here!

     Young Masbath slides back.  Katrina helps him.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               What can we do?

                             ICHABOD
               Take the reins.

     Young Masbath takes them.  Ichabod slings Van Ripper's rifle
     over his shoulder and starts back.  Katrina grips him.

                             ICHABOD
               Masbath is right.  We must do something.

     She releases.  Ichabod gets to the luggage area at the rear,
     struggling to open a storage box.

     Behind, the Horseman draws his sword, closer.

     Ichabod opens the box, hefting out a long, jagged SAW.

                             KATRINA
               Ichabod!

     Ichabod looks.  The Horseman rides up, swinging...

     Ichabod recoils -- THWACK -- just missed by sword.

     The Horseman lets the coach get ahead, shifting to the
     other side of the trail... coming along side.

     Ichabod backpedals, looking to Masbath.

                             ICHABOD
               Keep him off!  Block him!

     Masbath guides the horses over.  The Horseman must fall
     behind to avoid the wheels.

     The coach hits a large, fallen tree trunk.

     Ichabod bounces, falling...

     He hangs off the side of the coach.

     Katrina climbs to offer her hand.  Ichabod offers the saw.

                             ICHABOD
               Take it!

     Katrina takes the saw.  Now with both hands, Ichabod tries
     for better purchase.  He grips the coach door.  It opens...

     Ichabod clings to the open door as branches slam him.

     He's reaching to the coach threshold, reaching...

     Ichabod pulls himself inside.

     BOOM -- the door hits a tree trunk, bashed to pieces.

     Ichabod looks out from the coach, dazed.  He climbs.

     Katrina looks back as Young Masbath guides the coach to block
     the Horseman again.

     The Horseman sheaths his sword, riding... reaching to grip
     the back corner of the coach.

     The Horseman dismounts, clinging, climbing...

     Ichabod takes the rifle off his shoulder, aiming...

     BANG! -- splattering the Horseman's hand point blank.  The
     Horseman hangs on with his other hand.

     The Horseman re-grips with the blasted hand, amazing since
     it's now all mush and bone.

     Ichabod throws the rifle on his way to the driver's perch,
     taking the saw from Katrina.

                             ICHABOD 
               Move forward!

     Katrina looks to the horses, then at Ichabod.

                             ICHABOD
               Go!

     Ichabod takes the reins from Young Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               Help her.

     Reins in one hand and saw in the other, Ichabod waits.  The
     Horseman rises up and moves in, taking out his sword.

     Young Masbath climbs down to the wooden pole connecting the
     coach to the bridles, puts out his hand.  Katrina takes it.

     Behind, the Horseman swings.  Ichabod blocks with the saw.

     Young Masbath guides Katrina as she leaps onto one horse.
     Bareback.  Young Masbath straddles the horse beside her.

     The Horseman swings, backhanded knocks the sword from
     Ichabod's hand as Ichabod falls back...

     Ichabod hits the bridle post, hanging onto straps for dear
     life.  His feet drag on the trail.

     Above, the Horseman comes to the driver's perch, close enough
     to kill Katrina.  He raises his sword...

     Katrina screams, ducking, helpless...

     Below, Ichabod pulls a bolt from the coach's hitching-rod.

     He shoves off with his feet.

     The Horseman swings.... missing.

     The horses detach from the coach, dragging Ichabod along.

     The coach careens out of control.

     It flies off the trail, hits an incline and sails off,
     throwing the Horseman.

     The coach hits a tree trunk and SMASHES.

     FURTHER DOWN THE TRAIL, the coach horses stop.  Young Masbath
     and Katrina climb off as Ichabod gets to his feet, hurting,
     clutching his previously wounded shoulder.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               What now?

                             ICHABOD
               I doubt that's the end.

                             KATRINA
               The church.

                             ICHABOD
               He moves too fast.

     Ichabod unhooks a lantern off the bridle rail.  The trail
     behind is silent, till a bone chilling SCREECH is HEARD.

                             KATRINA
               What was that?

                             ICHABOD
               His horse.

     They start moving.  Ichabod looks around.  He sees...

                             ICHABOD
               There...

     Through the tree line, the Hollow's massive windmill can be
     seen against the sky.  Katrina and Young Masbath run.


     EXT. WINDMILL FIELD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath book into this open area,
     heading to the windmill.  Another HORRIBLE SQUEAL echoes.

     Ichabod looks over his shoulder.

     Heavy, low hanging BRANCHES and VINES at the forest edge
     creep to life, parting... forming a sort of black tunnel.

                             ICHABOD 
               He's coming!

     The Horseman gallops out, throwing leaves in his wake.

                             ICHABOD 
               Hurry!

     The Horseman readies a battle axe.

     Ichabod gets under the windmill, helping Young Masbath up the
     ladder and in.  Katrina next.

     The Horseman is almost there.

     Ichabod follows Katrina.  He gets in, feet dangling.  The
     Horseman dismounts...

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod leaps up and struggles with the heavy trap door...
     slams it.  He closes the latch just as the Horseman hits.
     The door buckles.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               It won't hold.

     Ichabod goes to a large GRINDSTONE against a wall.  He
     struggles to roll it.

     Young Masbath helps him roll it to the trap door.  It falls
     on top with a thud.  The Horseman's sword jabs up through the
     grindstone's center hole.

     The sword withdraws.  A POUNDING begins.

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The Horseman chops at the door with his axe.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     POUNDING CONTINUES.  The grindstone shifts.  Katrina and
     Young Masbath back away.  Ichabod holds his lantern up,
     desperate for ideas, searching.

     Above, to the right, is the milling platform, where grain is
     ground and bagged.  To the left is the crooked staircase.

     Ichabod picks up a bailing hook, a plan forming.  He gives
     his lantern to Katrina and points.

                             ICHABOD 
               Get up those stairs.  Open the door to
               the roof and wait.

     Katrina and Young Masbath obey.  Ichabod crosses and climbs
     the ladder to the milling platform.  He grasps a wooden
     lever, pulling it.  Gears above begin to turn.

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The windmill's rotors CREAK to life, spinning.

     UNDER THE WINDMILL, the Horseman keeps chopping.  His axe
     exposes grindstone, throwing sparks.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Katrina looks down from the stairs.

     The Horseman's axe pries at the seam of the trap door.

                             KATRINA
               Ichabod...

                             ICHABOD
               Keep climbing.  I will follow...

     Ichabod pulls bags of grain, lining them up at the edge of
     the milling platform.

                             ICHABOD
                     (under his breath) 
               Hopefully.

     ABOVE, Young Masbath reaches the ceiling, throws open the
     door to the roof.

     BELOW, Ichabod cuts holes into the grain bags, so milled
     grain spills out and falls to the floor, creating dust.

     He grabs one open bag and dumps it.  More grain dust.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

     Masbath and Katrina come out.  Rotors spin behind them.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod sees below... the Horseman sticks a hand through,
     trying to push the grindstone aside, then withdrawing.  The
     RACKING axe continues.  Won't be long.

     Ichabod grabs one half-full bag of grain, swings it with
     effort, throws...

     The bag smashes on the grindstone, busting the door...

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The grindstone falls through, SLAMMING the Horseman down...

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod slices into a sack hanging from a pulley system.
     More and more dust rises.

     Below, the Horseman enters.  Katrina shouts from above.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Look out!

     The Horseman moves toward the ladder milling platform ladder,
     but Ichabod grabs it, pulling it up...

     The Horseman just misses the final rung.

     Ichabod throws the ladder aside as the Horseman backs off.

     Ichabod looks to the staircase.  No way to climb down from
     the milling platform and get there.

     The Horseman runs and leaps, grabbing a hanging chain...

     The Horseman climbs the chain, swinging...

     Ichabod runs across the platform, jumps...

     Ichabod grasps the frail rail of the staircase, barely.

     The rail creaks, about to break.  Behind, the Horseman lands
     on the milling platform.

     Ichabod is losing grip.  Young Masbath races down the stairs,
     grabs his hand.  He pulls Ichabod up.

     Ichabod's pistol slips from its holster and falls.

     Ichabod and Young Masbath look...

     The Horseman, following Ichabod's lead, runs across the
     milling platform and leaps...

     Grabs the staircase rail, only a few feet from Ichabod and
     Masbath.  Ichabod kicks the rail, breaking it...

     The Horseman falls in billowing dust, crashing below.

     Ichabod pushes Masbath up the stairs.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

     Katrina helps them onto the roof.

                             KATRINA
               Quickly, close it.

                             ICHABOD 
               No.
                     (takes lantern, points) 
               Get to the crest of the roof and be
               ready to jump.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Jump?  Jump where?

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The Horseman runs, agile, up stairs.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

     Ichabod shepherds Katrina and Young Masbath to the edge where
     the rotors spin close.

                             ICHABOD 
               The blades will carry us to the ground.
               Face front and wait for me.

                             KATRINA 
               I... I can't do this.

                             ICHABOD 
               We have no choice.

     Ichabod moves back to the trap door.

     Katrina and Young Masbath look at the rotors, and down at the
     long distance between them and the ground.

                             ICHABOD 
               Be ready...

     Ichabod throws the lantern into the windmill and runs.

                             ICHABOD
               Now!

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The Horseman continues up.  The lantern falls past.

     EXT.  WINDMILL, ROOF -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath jumps.  Ichabod grips Katrina and jumps...

     They hit one rotor and cling to the frame and cloth.  The
     rotor begins its downwards swing.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The lantern hits the ground and shatters.  FLAMES EXPLODE!

     Grain dust is consumed instantaneously -- FLAMES ROAR
     upwards, filling the windmill...

     Engulfing the Horseman.

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The rotor is halfway to its lowest point.  Masbath, Katrina
     and Ichabod hang on as the entire structure trembles.

     BOOM -- flames shoot out the windows, doors and seams,
     lighting up the night.

     On the rattling rotor, Ichabod struggles to hold the frame
     with one hand and keep a grip on Katrina.

     Masbath drops.  Ichabod releases Katrina, then drops.

     They hit the ground.  Ichabod rolls, gasping, holding his
     shoulder.  They all look at each other in disbelief a moment.
     Ichabod lets out a sort of rasping laugh, standing.

                             ICHABOD 
               Okay... come on...

     Ichabod ushers them across the field, uphill.  Running.
     Lightning flashes across the sky.  THUNDER RUMBLES.

     A bolt strikes the windmill, and it EXPLODES...

     SHOCKWAVE DEAFENING.  The rotors bust apart.  Splinters of
     burning wood spin all directions.

     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath keep
     running.  There is a WOODEN CART parked ahead.

     IN THE WINDMILL RUBBLE, the Horseman rises, shoving off
     burning debris.  His flame-ravaged uniform smolders.

     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod stumbles onwards, but notices
     something horrible...

     In the distance, Lady Van Tassel's white horse roams free.

                             ICHABOD
                     (as this registers)
               Oh, no...

     Young Masbath and Katrina are just past the cart when Lady
     Van Tassel rises from behind it, swings a plank...

     SLAMS Ichabod in the chest and sends him down.

     Lady Van Tassel grabs Katrina's hair, drags her.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Should have stayed away, Constable.

     Ichabod gets up slow, furious, reaches to his holster, only
     to find it empty.  He moves forward.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Keep back, or I kill her.

     She takes out scissors, holds them to Katrina's neck.
     Katrina ceases struggling.

     Ichabod keeps Masbath behind him, keeps his distance.  Lady
     Van Tassel shoots a glance...

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               See him...

     Par off, the Horseman strides from the wreckage.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               You cannot kill what is already dead.

                             ICHABOD
               Let her go!

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Yes... yes.  I think I will...

     Lady Van Tassel spins and throws Katrina in the cart, shoving
     against it.

                             ICHABOD
               No!

     The cart rolls downhill.  Ichabod moves forward.

     Lady Van Tassel turns, brandishing the scissors, slashing and
     missing.  Ichabod backs off.

     DOWNHILL, the cart picks up speed, headed for the Horseman.

     The Horseman starts running to meet it.

     UPHILL, Lady Van Tassel grins.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Say goodbye to her.

     Lady Van Tassel lunges, stabbing.  Ichabod avoids, puts all
     his fury behind his fist -- punches her in the face.

     Lady Van Tassel hits the ground and her bag falls open,
     sending the Horseman's skull rolling out...

     The skull rolls... rolls... landing far away.

     DOWNHILL, Katrina leaps out from the cart...

     She lands hard...

     The Horseman shoves the empty cart aside, still on the move.

     UPHILL, Ichabod sees the skull.  He runs towards it.

     Lady van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the ankle.  He falls.

     DOWNHILL, Katrina runs back.  The Horseman is catching up.

     UPHILL, Ichabod tries to pull f ree from Lady Van Tassel.

     Young Masbath comes behind her - BAM - hits her in the head
     with the wooden plank.  She's out.

     Ichabod scrambles to his feet.

     DOWNHILL, the Horseman catches Katrina, taking her by the
     hair as she falls to her knees and screams.

     UPHILL, Ichabod runs... grasps the Horseman's skull.

     He runs towards the Horseman and Katrina.

     DOWNHILL, Katrina struggles, but the Horseman holds her ready
     by her hair... raises his sword...

     UPHILL, Ichabod throws the skull...

                             ICHABOD 
               Horseman!

     The skull spins through the air...

     The Horseman drops Katrina, reaches up...

     Catches the skull.

     Katrina runs.

     Ichabod runs to meet her, grabs her as she falls, exhausted.
     Together, they back away from the Horseman.

     The Horseman holds the skull out, then brings it to his
     shoulders, to its rightful place.  THUNDER POUNDS.

     TRANSFORMATION begins -- blood and flesh rise up from the
     Horseman's throat and grip the skull.

     Young Masbath drops the plank, watching in awe.

     The Horseman's reformation continues.  Muscle forms.  Liquids
     become solids.  He is made whole once more, the same evil,
     human face we saw in Baltus' stories.

     He looks to Ichabod and Katrina, touches his restored face.

     Daredevil rides up, SCREECHING.  The Horseman replaces his
     sward and climbs into the saddle.

     He rides towards Katrina and Ichabod, but passes them by.
     They are so exhausted they fall down.

     Young Masbath backs up as the Horseman comes, but the
     Horseman does not want him either.

     The Horseman leans to grab Lady Van Tassel's unconscious
     form, pulls her up across Daredevil's back.

     He rides away with her.

     Ichabod and Katrina watch him go.  They look at each other,
     then kiss gratefully.

     Ichabod looks to Young Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               How are you?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Tired.

     Ichabod smiles and holds out his arm.  Masbath comes over.
     Group hug.  Lightning brightens the farmland around them.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, BURIAL GROUND -- NIGHT

     HOOFBEATS.  The Horseman enters the clearing, keeping a hand
     on Lady Van Tassel.  Ahead, the twisted tree awaits.

     Lady Van Tassel is awakening, face bloody.  She turns her
     head and looks forward.  She screams.

     The twisted tree's wound opens, wide and glowing.

     Daredevil picks up speed...

     Daredevil leaps just as a lightning bolt blasts down,
     striking the Horseman.

     For an instant, Horseman and horse are transformed, SKELETONS
     OF LIGHT, entering the tree.

     Silence and smoke.  At the tree, Lady Van Tassel's hand
     sticks out from the tight-shut suture.

     The sewn wound on her palm seeps blood.


     EXT.  NEW YORK CITY STREET, ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY

     A bright, busy day in New York.  A coach pulls up to
     Ichabod's home.  Ichabod is the driver.  He gets off, goes
     and opens the coach door.  He helps Katrina down.  Next,
     Young Masbath sticks his head out.

     Ichabod goes about unloading bags.  Katrina holds Young
     Masbath's hand, and they look down the street in wonder.

     THE END

          FADE IN:
          
          
          INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY
          
          CLOSEUP: A slender woman's hand writes on a chalkboard,
          in teacherly cursive.
          
          We PULL BACK to REVEAL STARLA GRANT, a stunningly beautiful
          Southern woman in her twenties, as she finishes writing
          out, "SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST"
          
          Starla glances at the classroom of high school students.
          She is a demure woman, somewhat awkward in her speaking,
          but she has the rapt attention of all the boys in the
          class.
          
                                   STARLA
                     When Darwin said 'fittest,' he
                     didn't necessarily mean the
                     strongest or the most intelligent,
                     or any one trait -- he merely meant
                     those organisms most well-suited
                     to their environment.
          
          The boys in the class look her up and down as she speaks.
          KYLIE STRUTEMYER, a pretty student, notices a BOY beside
          her drawing Starla, only without her clothes. She hits
          him. He CHUCKLES.
          
                                   STARLA
                     We humans think we're more fit,
                     more evolved, because we're smarter.
                     But we're neophytes. We've been
                     around two million years, give or
                     take. The cockroach has been here
                     for 350 million. You tell me who's
                     the more successful species.
          
          A BOY raises his hand.
          
                                     STARLA
                     Will.
          
                                   WILL
                     How's all this go with how the
                     Bible says there ain't no dinosaurs?
          
          Some of the kids LAUGH at the boy.   Starla pauses, about
          to answer, when the BELL RINGS.
          
                                   STARLA
                     We'll tackle that tomorrow...
                     Everyone bring your boxing gloves.
          
          The kids start to leave.
          
                                                                   2.
          
          EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          Celebratory banners are strung over this street, including
          one that reads: "DEER SEASON STARTS TODAY!" We're in the
          center of Wheelsy, South Carolina, a moderately depressed
          small town. Today's a big day, as HUNTERS from far and
          near crowd the streets in their massive pickups.
          
          MEN spill in and out of a gun store buying loads of
          ammunition. OLD HUNTERS with faces like prunes stand
          outside Angell's Tavern getting drunk. A MAN WITH FEW
          TEETH has a dead deer strung out across the back of his
          truck, skinning the carcass, its innards spilling loose.
          
          JACK, an older, uptight man in fancy clothes, is driving
          through town in his big old Cadillac. He comes upon a
          hunter's truck, double-parked, jamming up traffic. Jack
          jams on his HORN.
          
                                  JACK
                    Get the fuck out of the way,
                    cocksucker!
          
          Jack turns to see a MOTHER and her two CHILDREN on the
          sidewalk, listening and staring in shock.
          
                                  MOTHER
                    Mornin', Mayor.
          
          Jack smiles, a bit embarrassed. Jack notices a group of
          HUNTERS on the sidewalk, looking and pointing at something
          up in the sky.
          
          He looks up to see a small meteor plummeting toward earth.
          
          
          EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Students file out of the open door for the day. Kylie,
          Starla's pretty student, is among them. She and her FRIEND
          are looking up at the falling meteor.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    Prolly go find it later, sell it
                    on eBay.
          
          
          EXT. HORSE RANCH - DAY
          
          A RANCHER with a cleft palate turns his head to see the
          meteor, much closer to him. It's rushing down toward the
          treetops of a nearby forest.
          
                                                                  3.
          
          INT. GRANT'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          A framed wedding photograph of a very young Starla and a
          large man is sitting on a desk. The photo TREMBLES
          LIGHTLY, with the impact of the meteor hitting the earth.
          
          GRANT GRANT, a large, indelicate man in his mid forties,
          notices the photos on his desk moving. He looks up from
          his desk and out his door, where there's a GLASS WORKSHOP.
          Two WORKERS are carrying a large pane of glass, looking
          relieved they didn't drop it.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Just a tremor, boys.
          
          Grant goes back to filling out the tags of file folders
          with a Sharpie.
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
          
          Four cops -- BILL PARDY, the town's young,   relaxed, and
          handsome Chief of Police, WALLY, an older,   toad-like cop,
          TREVOR, a younger, somewhat goofy cop, and   MARGARET, a
          mannish cop -- are standing stock-still in   the station
          parking lot. They CHUCKLE.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Did ya' feel that?!
          
          They enter the station.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
          
          The four cops start to remove their holsters and so forth,
          finished for the day.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    I always get afraid when that
                    happens, 'cause what if the ground
                    cracks open and you fall inside?
                    It's so hot in there you get all
                    burnt to nothin' like that --
                          (snaps)
                    Happened to my uncle Barry.
          
          Wally and Bill LAUGH at him.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Who told you that story, Trevor?
          
                                    TREVOR
                    My aunt.
          
                                                                   4.
          
                                  BILL
                    Your uncle Barry left her for a
                    stripper up in Winnsboro.
          
          Trevor looks shocked, sad.
          
          SHELBY, a slightly dim dispatcher, on his headset at the
          police operator's unit, swirls toward them, alarmed.
          
                                 SHELBY
                    Chief! We got a 'mergency over at
                    the diner!
          
          
          INT. DINER - LATER
          
          The four cops move in.   There's a COMMOTION.   Most of the
          patrons are standing.
          
                                  WAITRESS
                    Back there, Bill!
          
          The Waitress nods back through the service window, into
          the kitchen, where a large DOE is hopping around. A
          DISHWASHER stands on the counter, YELPING with fear.
          
          
          INT. DINER KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill, Wally, Trevor, Margaret, and the Waitress enter.
          The doe skips around.
          
                                  WAITRESS
                    She slipped in, was eating trash.
                    We seen it on TV, how they kill
                    ya'--
          
                                   BILL
                    Right.
          
                                  WAITRESS
                    So we thought we best call in.
          
          Bill spots the open rear door, and tries to herd the deer
          toward it.
          
                                  BILL
                    Come on now, honey, door's this
                    way.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    It's open season. Let's shoot
                    her.
          
                                  BILL
                    She's just scared, Margaret.
          
                                                                 5.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Also, Bill likes to take a female
                    through the back door any chance
                    he gets.
          
          Wally and Margaret LAUGH. Trevor snatches a dish-towel
          and rushes the doe, using it like a cape. The scared doe
          leaps away from him, jumping onto the kitchen counter.
          
                                  BILL
                    She ain't a bull, Trevor!
          
          The animal kicks off a pot, which hits Margaret.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Goddamn bambi-rat!
          
          As the doe jumps to the floor, she gets her hoof wrapped
          in a telephone cord.
          
          The cord is plugged into the wall, trapping the doe in
          place. Wally, Margaret, and Trevor attempt to dive for
          the cord, but can't avoid the doe's crazy, flying hooves.
          
                                  BILL
                    Get back.
          
          The other cops step away.   Bill steps slowly toward the
          doe, speaking calmly.
          
                                  BILL
                    It's okay, sweetheart.   Nobody's
                    gonna hurt you.
          
          The doe looks at him, settling a bit.   His voice seems to
          be soothing her. Bill gets closer.
          
                                  BILL
                    That's right. Just gonna pull
                    this cord out. It's gonna be all
                    right.
          
          The cops and restaurant folk look on in awe as the doe,
          breathing heavily, becomes still. Bill scoops close past
          her, and yanks the telephone cord out of the wall.
          
          Bill smiles. Then the doe runs forward, almost knocking
          Bill over, and streaks out the back door.
          
          Bill, Wally, Margaret, and Trevor move up to the doorway
          and watch the deer skitter off into the woods beyond,
          dragging the telephone, tied to her leg.
          
                                  BILL
                    Hell, she took a phone. Now them
                    forest critters are gonna be calling
                    us all hours of the night.
          
                                                                     6.
          
          Everyone LAUGHS.   Wally pretends to be on the phone.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Chief of police there? This a
                    squirrel. Bring me a bag of
                    peanuts, motherfucker!
          
          Everyone LAUGHS some more.
          
          
          INT. GLASS WORKSHOP - EVENING
          
          Grant locks his office for the day.   His SECRETARY sees
          him going.
          
                                  SECRETARY
                    'Night, Mr. Grant.
          
                                  GRANT
                    See ya', Ashley.
          
          Grant walks across the workshop toward the door. He sees
          a crowd of WORKERS lounging around a glass-cutting table,
          LAUGHING at something.
          
          Some of them nod at Grant, and he nods back.   But he's
          completely outside their circle.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          A sizable two-story suburban home.    All the lights are
          off but one.
          
                                  GRANT (O.S.)
                    So I get home today, phone's
                    ringing. It's Hank Wilcox.
          
          
          INT. GRANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla and Grant eat dinner in this well-decorated room.
          As Grant chatters, Starla occasionally smiles politely at
          him.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Callin' for you. What the hell?
                    I said, 'Hank, that's a little bit
                    outta line don't'cha think, a single
                    man callin' someone's wife?' At
                    night, nonetheless.
          
          Starla is quiet, almost afraid:
          
                                                                     7.
          
                                  STARLA
                    He's teaching environmental science,
                    Grant. Probably wants to borrow
                    my lesson plans from last semester.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Oh yeah, that's what he wants to
                    borrow, this guy.
          
                                  STARLA
                    It's just a work thing.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Work thing hell, Starla. He just
                    wants to get in your pussy. Him
                    and most these other ones around
                    here. That's where their minds is
                    at, them sick fucks.
          
          Grant takes a big bite of food, stuffing his mouth.
          
                                  GRANT
                    I'll tell you, sugarplum, you're
                    lucky you got me. You're too damn
                    trusting. Without me to protect
                    you, you'd get kilt one of these
                    days.
          
          Starla nods.
          
          
          INT. GRANT MASTER BATHROOM - LATER
          
          Starla stares at herself in the mirror as she brushes her
          hair. She uses long, slow strokes, as if stalling.
          
                                  GRANT (O.S.)
                    Sugarplum, you coming into bed?
          
          Starla turns toward the door.       She doesn't say anything
          for a moment.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Just a second.
          
          Starla sets her brush down on the counter. She arranges
          it neatly beside the others. And walks into the bedroom.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant turns off the TV as Starla gets into bed with him.
          It's almost completely dark in here.
          
          Grant crawls on top of Starla. He kisses her and grabs
          her in a way not meant to be rough, but is utterly without
          grace.
          
                                                                  8.
          
          After doing this for a few moments, Starla starts to push
          him off her.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just --
                    I'm not in the mood.
          
          Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Come on, baby, it's --
          
                                   STARLA
                    I'm sorry.   I don't just have some
                    switch.
          
                                   GRANT
                    Sure you do.
          
          Through Starla's nightgown, Grant pretends to flick one
          of her nipples.
          
                                   GRANT
                    Flip.
          
          Then the other.
          
                                   GRANT
                    Flip.
          
                                  STARLA
                    That's disrespectful.
          
          Grant, peeved, gets off of her. He sits on the edge of
          the bed for a moment, in silence. Starla looks afraid.
          
                                  GRANT
                    When are you in the mood, exactly?
                    Seems to me that mood's as rare as
                    winnin' the Goddamn lotto.
          
          Grant grabs his slacks off the valet and starts putting
          them on.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Where are you going?
          
                                  GRANT
                    I'm just some big clown to you,
                    ain't I?
          
                                  STARLA
                    That's not true -- Where are you-?
          
                                   GRANT
                    Out.
          
                                                                9.
          
          INT. HENENLOTTER'S SPORTS BAR - LATER
          
          Grant sits at the bar, knocking back a shot of tequila.
          He's getting drunk. He taps his glass.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Hit me again there, killer.
          
          The BARKEEP fills his drink.
          
                                  BARKEEP
                    Hey, Grant, how's it you come to
                    have the same last name as first?
          
                                  GRANT
                    Parents thought it sounded pleasant,
                    I s'pose. Joke on me, ain't it?
          
          Grant notices a woman with a lot of makeup -- BRENDA
          GUTIERREZ -- staring at him from across the bar, smoking
          a cigarette. Grant stares at her, trying to figure out
          who she is. She slides off her stool.
          
          She sashays toward him. She props herself on the stool
          beside him, leans drunkenly in toward him.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Megan Halesy' little sister.
          
                                   GRANT
                    Shit.   You're kidding me.
          
                                      BRENDA
                    Nope.   Brenda!
          
                                  GRANT
                    Hell, you were --
          
          Grant holds his hand only so high.
          
                                 BRENDA
                    I was! And I'll tell you somethin',
                    Grant Grant. I's in love with
                    you.
          
          Grant stares at her.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    My sister Megan, she's a big fat
                    cow. Was then, even more so now.
                    I'd be thinking, what'd you see in
                    her ain't in me?
          
                                  GRANT
                    Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been
                    eleven.
          
                                                                  10.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Hell, I was game!
          
          She LAUGHS. So does Grant. He stares at her,
          contemplating sinful things. He nods at her wedding ring.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Who's the lucky fella?
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn
                    half-Mexican.
          
                                     GRANT
                    Already ain't.     Married a gal named --
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Starla Covington. Don't be
                    ignorant. Everyone knows that.
                    Fucking prom queen.
          
          Grant thinks.
          
                                     GRANT
                    Yeah.
          
          Grant finishes his drink, and gets up to go.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Where you goin'?
          
          Grant speaks more loudly than need be:
          
                                  GRANT
                    Starla, she gets real worried 'bout
                    me I stay out too late. Loves me
                    too much, that one.
          
          He glances around to see if people have heard, and stumbles
          out.
          
          
          EXT. SHADED CREEK - LATER
          
          Grant sits on a boulder beside a creek, looking miserable,
          downing a six pack.
          
          He throws an empty can into the creek, when he glances
          down and sees particles flowing down the river.
          
          Grant slides off the boulder. He kneels and examines the
          particles. They shimmer in the moonbeams coming down
          between the trees.
          
          Grant peers up the creek from where the particles are
          coming.
          
                                                                  11.
          
          He sees a gap on the edge of the creek, where water
          splashes and is diverted in streamlets down the hill.
          
          He approaches the spot, and comes upon a small crater on
          the side of the creek. The meteorite is inside the crater,
          but it's cracked into pieces. The rock seems almost
          organic, like a shell. The shimmery specks are part of
          the shell itself, flecking off into the creek and rushing
          downstream.
          
          Grant crouches. He touches the meteorite, and feels some
          sort of goo inside it. It's sticky.
          
          He notices a strip of the same slime leading out of the
          crater itself and into the woods.
          
          Grant, curiously, slowly, follows the slimy trail.
          
          He comes to a flurry of colorful wild flowers. Something
          is rustling the flowers ever so slightly. He moves in
          closer.
          
          A gelatinous yellow organism slithers sluggishly between
          the flowers. The organism is a mound a few inches high,
          gross and veiny, yet as colorful as the flowers around
          it. A small cavity on the apex of the organism constricts
          and expands lightly. I guess it's not worth keeping secret
          that this thing looks a tad like a bright yellow vagina.
          
                                   GRANT
                    What the...?
          
          Grant is a little freaked-out by this thing, even
          frightened. He looks around for someone else.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Hey, anybody 'round here?   'Lo?
          
          No one answers. Grant looks down at the organism, unsure.
          He picks up a tree branch.
          
          Grant softly prods the organism with the pointy end of
          the branch.
          
          Nothing happens.
          
          He does it again.   The thing pulses a little, and surges
          toward Grant.
          
          Grand pokes it again.
          
          A small, thin quill -- a SPORE -- emerges from the cavity
          in the center of the organism. The spore is quivering
          and, as it trembles upward, little bulbed spurs pop up as
          well.
          
          Grant slowly bends down to look at it when --
          
                                                                12.
          
          The SPORE suddenly SHOOTS OUT.   It strikes Grant in the
          stomach.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Ow!   Fuck!
          
          Grant yanks up his shirt, looking at a wound on his
          abdomen. He watches as the spore quivers and disappears
          inside him.
          
          He clutches his stomach, SCREAMS in agony. He falls back
          into the colorful flowers. His body convulses.
          
                                                        MATCH CUT TO:
          
          
          CAT SCAN SHOT - INT. GRANT'S BODY
          
          We see the insides of Grant's body, as if sliced in half.
          We ZOOM IN on the little spore, which is jittering up
          through his body, and into his neck.
          
          The spore keys into the base of Grant's cerebellum, and
          his entire brain crackles with a WHITE ELECTRICAL ENERGY.
          
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Grant freezes in place, his fingers contorted up in front
          of him, silent. He's utterly still, a wax corpse.
          
          A hippie CAMPING COUPLE run into the area, looking for
          the source of the screams. The man looks down at the
          frozen Grant.
          
                                  CAMPER
                    Over here!
          
          The Camper crouches down beside him.
          
                                 CAMPER
                    Hey, man. You all right?...
                    Dude?... Oh shit.
          
          The Camper turns from Grant to his girlfriend.
          
                                  CAMPER
                    I think he's d --
          
          Grant GASPS suddenly, sitting up and grabbing the man,
          like a drowning man popping up above water. The Camper
          YELPS and jumps back. Grant sweats and heaves, trying to
          speak, but hardly can --
          
                                  GRANT
                    It's taking... my... brain.
          
                                                                  13.
          
                                  CAMPER
                    Buddy?
          
          Grant's eyes glaze over, and he eases off. He heaves
          there, momentarily confused. His eyes dart around, as if
          seeing his surroundings for the first time. Grant stands.
          
                                  CAMPER
                    You all right, man?
          
          Grant looks down curiously at the camper. Then he turns
          and stumbles away from them, out of the forest.
          
                                  CAMPER
                    That might of been a stroke, buddy.
                    You better take it easy.
          
          
          INT. GRANT'S PICKUP - DAWN
          
          Grant drives down the road in his luxury pickup truck,
          sweating and blinking rapidly.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOUSE - MORNING
          
          Grant steps out of the truck in his driveway, when he
          hears --
          
                                  NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
                    Hey ya', Grant.
          
          Grant swings his head toward his NEIGHBOR, who is taking
          a happy BEAGLE for a morning walk.
          
                                  NEIGHBOR
                    What were ya', night-fishing again?
                    You catch anything?
          
                                  GRANT
                    I caught a little somethin', yeah.
          
          Grant walks inside his house.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - MORNING
          
          Grant looks around the foyer.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Grant creeps into the bedroom, looking around.   We can
          hear the SHOWER RUNNING.
          
          Grant spots his face in a mirror above the dresser. He
          moves in close to the mirror, and stares at his own image.
          
                                                                  14.
          
          He pulls on his face a little, his eyes brimming with
          excitement. He smiles at himself.
          
          Grant looks toward the open bathroom door, where he hears
          the running shower. He creeps toward it.
          
          Grant peeks around the doorway. Starla is in the shower,
          soaping herself. She looks beautiful there. Grant tilts
          his head to the side like a dog. He watches her,
          mesmerized, even moved.
          
          
          INT.   GRANT BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla is wearing a white towel and brushing her wet hair
          in the foggy bathroom mirror when she hears Air Supply's
          EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD coming from the bedroom. She's
          struck by it.
          
          She moves toward the door.   Opens it.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          The shades are drawn, darkening the room. A few candles
          have been lit. Grant is standing there, mostly in
          silhouette. He's silent, and he doesn't move.
          
                                   GRANT
                     Hey there, sugarplum.
          
          Starla looks at him, stirred.
          
                                   STARLA
                     Haven't heard this for a while.
          
          Grant walks toward her. He takes her hand in his own,
          lifting it beside him. He wraps his other arm around her
          waist. And he slow dances with her. Starla dances too,
          a bit hesitantly, a bit shy.
          
                                   STARLA
                     I never danced in a towel before.
          
                                   GRANT
                     Wearing white, just like on our...
                     wedding day. I remember it.
          
          Starla nods.
          
                                   GRANT
                     I'm sorry about last night. I get
                     a little insecure sometimes, want
                     to hold on too tight. It's just
                     'cause you're precious to me,
                     Starla.
                                   (MORE)
          
                                                                15.
          
                                  GRANT (CONT'D)
                    But I swear to God, baby, I'm
                    turning over a new Goddamn leaf.
                    Okay?
          
          Starla nods, touched.    Grant's eyes are teary.
          
                                  GRANT
                    I love you, sugarplum.
          
          Starla and Grant kiss, tenderly.
          
          Grant falls to his knees in front of her. He runs his
          hand over the curve of her hip, her thigh, her buttock,
          with as much fascination as lust. He pushes Starla back
          onto the bed.
          
          He lifts her leg, and kisses it, nibbles on it a little,
          scrapes his teeth on it. Starla is surprised by this,
          but enjoys it too: it's probably the most foreplay she's
          had in years.
          
          Grant crawls on top of her, runs his hands over her
          breasts, her face. Starla's hand moves over Grant's back,
          and to his stomach. When she stops, startled.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Grant, what's that?
          
          She gazes down at the wound between them, on Grant's bare
          abdomen, where the spore entered him. The wound is
          yellowish, and surrounded by veins.
          
          Grant, embarrassed, pulls his shirt down.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Just a little bug bite is all.
          
          Grant kisses and munches on Starla as she lies back on
          the bed, enjoying it.
          
          O.S. HUMMING.
          
                                                             FADE TO:
          
          
          INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY
          
          Starla is HUMMING Every Woman in the World as she drops
          coins into a soda machine and chooses Tab. JANENE, a
          heavyset black teacher, notices this.
          
                                  JANENE
                    What are you so smiley about, girl?
          
                                    STARLA
                    Oh, nothin'.
          
                                                                  16.
          
          Starla grabs her soda and sits down with Janene.   Janene
          just stares.
          
                                   STARLA
                     Just, Grant and I had a nice
                     morning. It's been a while.
          
                                   JANENE
                     Oh! You got that fresh-fucked
                     glow, don't you?
          
                                    STARLA
                     Janene.
          
                                    JANENE
                     You slut.
          
                                    STARLA
                     Hush.
          
                                    JANENE
                     No shame.   You're a married woman.
          
                                   STARLA
                     He was... considerate. Maybe this
                     is the start of a real change in
                     Grant.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BATHROOM - DAY
          
          Grant is holding up his shirt, and looking at his torso.
          The wound on his side is blackened and gangrenous, and is
          starting to puff up into a veiny little spout. A fuzzy
          bluish moss is growing in the crevices around the spout.
          A pus oozes out.
          
          Grant looks concerned. He squirts some Neosporin onto
          his fingers. He massages it slowly into the wound.
          
          
          INT.   GRANT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant opens the refrigerator door and rummages around
          inside. He pulls out some bread. Some cheese.
          
          He opens the meat drawer. It's replete with cold cuts.
          He pulls out some Oscar Mayer baloney. Turkey. Pastrami
          and salami. He grabs every type of meat there is.
          
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant assembles a sandwich at the table. Two pieces of
          bread and some cheese. He starts putting the meat on.
          But he can't stop, piling more and more on until he has a
          little sandwich tower.
          
                                                                  17.
          
          He looks at it. Something seems off about it. He removes
          the cheese. Better. And then the bread. Even better.
          He stares at what is now simply a tower of cold cuts.
          
                                     GRANT
                    Meat.
          
          After contemplating it for a moment, Grant stands and
          carries off the pile of meat.
          
          
          INT. GRANT GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant enters the garage through a door from the FOYER.
          He flips the lights on with his shoulder. He looks around.
          
          Grant spots an old file cabinet. He sets the tower of
          meat down on the oily floor and opens a drawer. It's
          filled with files. He closes that drawer, and opens
          another. It has manila file folders, but no files.
          
          Grant takes out the folders. He uses a Sharpie to write
          out "BALONEY" on a folder. Then he stuffs all the baloney
          into the folder and files it away.
          
          He starts writing out "PASTRAMI".
          
          
          LATER
          
          Grant flips through his alphabetically-filed meat: from
          "BALONEY" through "TURKEY." But he doesn't look satisfied.
          
          
          INT. SUPERMARKET - LATER
          
          Grant stands beside the butcher's counter with a shopping
          cart. He peers dreamily in through the glass at the rows
          of steaks, pork chops, and so on.
          
                                     GRANT
                    Meat.
          
                                  BUTCHER
                    Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to
                    the Deer Cheer this weekend?
          
          Grant snaps out of his reverie.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Sure thing, killer.
          
                                  BUTCHER
                    What can I do you for?
          
                                                                18.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple
                    of these big ol' rib eyes.
          
                                  BUTCHER
                    How many you need?
          
          Grant stares at the steaks.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Well... having us a little dinner
                    party... I'd say... eight. No,
                    no... fourteen...
          
          The Butcher nods, starts to grab steaks.   Grant CHUCKLES.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Hell, what am I holding back for?
                    Why don't you just give me
                    everything you got here?
          
                                  BUTCHER
                    All the rib eyes?
          
                                  GRANT
                    Yep. And while you're at it, get
                    me a few of them chicken wings...
                    some pork loins... and, ooo, what's
                    this here? Osso buco?...
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - LATER
          
          Grant backs his pickup toward the garage. Meat is piled
          into the bed. Wrapped packages of meat fill the seats
          around him.
          
          
          INT. GRANT GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant stands in the garage, tearing open the packing, and
          letting the loose meat slide into piles onto the floor,
          muttering:
          
                                    GRANT
                    Meat.
          
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant rolls slabs of beef over the dirty floor and into a
          pile.
          
          SOMETHING skitters across the garage and around the pile.
          Grant peers around the pile and sees a RAT nibbling on
          some ribs. He realizes something.
          
                                                                  19.
          
                                     GRANT
                     You're meat.
          
          The rat moves away from Grant. But Grant snaps out his
          arm with alarming speed, snatching the rat. It SQUEAKS
          and wriggles in his grip, tearing and biting at him, trying
          to get free.
          
          Grant snaps its neck, and tosses the dead rat onto the
          pile of meat. Continues on.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          Starla pulls into the driveway.     She presses the button
          on her garage door opener.
          
          The door SHUDDERS but stays closed.    Starla's confused.
          
          She gets out of the car and examines the door. She looks
          down and sees a new padlock, locking the door to the cement
          driveway with bolts on both sides.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla enters the house. She heads toward a door along
          the wall that leads to the garage. There's a shiny new
          lock on that door as well. She touches it, baffled.
          
          She turns to see Grant standing at the end of the foyer.
          He's in shadows, a little spooky in the darkness.
          
                                     GRANT
                     Welcome home.
          
                                   STARLA
                     Grant? Why are there -- did you
                     put locks on the garage?
          
          Pause.   No answer.
          
                                   STARLA
                     You drilled into the driveway.
          
          Grant walks into the light.
          
                                   GRANT
                     Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got
                     so excited about... your present.
          
                                     STARLA
                     My present?
          
                                   GRANT
                     You're my princess, aren't you?
          
                                                                20.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Okay.
          
                                  GRANT
                    I got a super-special birthday
                    present for you this year. I
                    couldn't risk you finding it, so I
                    had to put them locks on the doors.
          
          Pause.
          
                                   STARLA
                    All right... I have to clean up
                    before dinner.
          
          Grant smiles at her. Starla confused, tries to smile
          back, then turns and heads up the stairs. Grant watches
          Starla's fine form from behind, somewhat lustily. But
          his leering gaze gradually turns into something darker,
          and he has a realization.
          
                                   GRANT
                    You're meat.
          
          Starla turns.
          
                                   STARLA
                    What?
          
          Grant snaps himself out of it.
          
                                   GRANT
                    Oh, nothin'.   Nothin'.   See you in
                    a sec.
          
          Starla smiles uneasily, and heads on upstairs.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant steps onto the front porch to get some air. He's
          blinking and seems a little dizzy. He gazes around the
          neighborhood:
          
          Down the way, a BOY in a little league uniform and his
          MOTHER get out of their car and walk toward the front
          door.
          
          Across the street, THROUGH A KITCHEN WINDOW, a PLUMP MAN
          and his WIFE are eating dinner.
          
          At another home, a SHORT MAN steps on a stepladder,
          changing the dome light on his porch.
          
          Grant stares at these individuals, looking like an animal
          ready to lunge at its prey, fighting the urge.
          
                                                               21.
          
                                      GRANT
                     Meat.
          
          He HEARS a BARKING. Grant turns to see the beagle next
          door, tied to the tree, YAPPING at him.
          
          Grant looks around to make sure no one's watching.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - MORNING
          
          Starla walks to get the paper in her robe, and she sees a
          BOY, aged thirteen or so, stapling a LOST: REWARD flyer
          to a telephone pole, with a picture of the beagle.
          
                                      STARLA
                     Roscoe's gone?
          
          The Boy's face is streaked from a long night of crying.
          
                                   BOY
                     You haven't seen him, have you?
          
          Starla shakes her head.
          
                                   STARLA
                     I'm sure he'll show up, Tim.
          
          The Boy nods, and walks to the next telephone pole to put
          up another flyer.
          
          
          EXT. SHADED FOREST - DAY
          
          Grant moves up a hill, between trees, looking around for
          something. He comes to a stop, trying to remember which
          way to go. He does, and moves on.
          
          
          EXT.   OLD BARN - LATER
          
          Grant comes upon an old wooden barn. The structure is
          maybe a hundred years old, and long abandoned. It's
          spattered with graffiti. Grant stares at it.
          
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant gathers large fronds and other foliage in his arms.
          
          
          INT.   OLD BARN - LATER
          
          Grant spreads the plant life over the floor of the barn.
          He arranges it, fluffs it there. His actions are very
          animal-like when no one's around. He seems to be making
          a nest. He sits back, looks at it.
          
                                                                 22.
          
          He's happy.
          
                                                             FADE TO:
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla, dressed in her weekend finery, is looking in the
          mirror above her dresser, and putting on earrings.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Grant, are you almost ready?
          
          
          INT. GRANT MASTER BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant looks ill. He is leaning over the sink, sweating,
          clutching his stomach.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Yeah, hon, I'll be right there!
          
          Grant turns and pushes open his door.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Grant sees Starla sitting on the edge of the bed, her
          back to him, as she puts on her nylons. She doesn't know
          he's there.
          
          Grant stares at her, demented, and moves slowly toward
          her, stalking her.
          
          Something starts to push Grant's shirt up at his stomach,
          like a bellybutton erection. The thing slips out of his
          shirt -- a writhing, pointy tubule, aiming toward Starla's
          back.
          
          Grant looks at the nape of Starla's neck.    Her delicate
          ear. He becomes confused; he softens.
          
          Starla turns to see Grant, his body now turned away from
          her. He's trying to push the tubule back down.
          
                                  STARLA
                    What are you doing?
          
                                     GRANT
                    You're pretty.
          
          Starla nods, confused by his behavior.
          
                                                               23.
          
          EXT. WHEELSY SADDLE LODGE - LATER
          
          A banner hangs across the front of the lodge, "DEER CHEER
          '05" -- the first Friday of deer season in Wheelsy.
          Inflatable deer totems decorate the front of the wooden
          lodge. RAMBUNCTIOUS MUSIC comes from inside. Partyers
          enter.
          
          Grant and Starla step out of his truck. As they do, one
          of Starla's students, Will, sees her and waves. Starla
          waves back.
          
          Grant notices this and grabs Starla's arm, a bit too hard,
          pulling her back.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Who's that?
          
                                  STARLA
                    It's just one of my students, Grant.
          
          Grant stares at the boy with distrust, and ushers Starla
          towards the lodge.
          
          Bill, Trevor and Margaret are hanging out on a large rock
          outside the entranceway, drinking beer. Bill watches
          Grant and Starla cross the lot. Trevor sees this.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    What's she see in that douchebag?
          
                                  BILL
                    That's the mystery of the ages
                    there, Trev. Starla was seventeen
                    when they got engaged. He was,
                    like, in his thirties. No one
                    even knew they were goin' out till
                    she had that ring on her finger.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Ain't no mystery to it. She's
                    raised in them shanties off St.
                    Luc. Dirt-poor.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Gold-digger, huh?
          
                                  BILL
                    Hell, you don't know that, Margaret.
          
          Margaret shrugs, BELCHES. Jack, the mayor, with his WIFE,
          stops beside them after she does, staring at her.
          
                                  JACK
                    Bill, you're Chief of police now.
                                  (MORE)
          
                                                                 24.
          
                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    Comes with some Goddamn
                    responsibility, like keeping your
                    people in line.
          
                                  BILL
                    You're right, Jack.    Margaret,
                    you're fired.
          
          Margaret and Trevor LAUGH. Jack shakes his head with
          disdain, and enters the party.
          
          
          INT. WHEELSY SADDLE LODGE - NIGHT
          
          Wheelsy citizens celebrate.   A country-western band PLAYS.
          Couples two-step.
          
          Starla and Grant move through the party. Grant looks
          around at the dancing and laughing bodies. Starla sees
          her friend from school.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Janene!
          
          Janene LAUGHS heartily and the two embrace
          
                                  JANENE
                    Hey, Grant.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Why don't you two catch up? I'll
                    go see what the boys are doing.
          
          Starla nods. She and Janene watch as Grant moves off
          through the crowd.
          
                                  STARLA
                    He's been strange the past couple
                    days.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELSY SADDLE LODGE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant steps outside, and looks around.
          
          Across the parking lot is a playground. Two YOUNG CHILDREN
          are spinning on a little carousel there.
          
          Grant starts toward them.
          
          
          EXT. SADDLE LODGE PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
          
          The Children GIGGLE, unaware of Grant inching up on them.
          Grant gets closer, excited, when he hears:
          
                                                                 25.
          
                                  BRENDA (O.S.)
                    Hey there, handsome.
          
          Grant turns and see Brenda Gutierrez standing there.
          Once again, she's very drunk.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Must be fate, us meeting again
                    like this.
          
          Grant smiles.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Well, you might be right...
          
          Grant sees if anyone's watching.   He circles around her.
          
                                  GRANT
                    You're lookin' awful pretty.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Shut up.
          
          Brenda SNICKERS.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Where's the old half-Mexican?
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Took the kids to his Mom's for the
                    weekend.
          
          Grant smiles.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
          
          Grant holds Brenda's hand, and he pulls her between the
          trees. She GIGGLES.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Where you takin' me, you bad boy!
          
          Grant stops in a secluded place, beside the creek, looking
          around. No one's there. He turns toward her, smiles.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Take off your shirt, doll.
          
          Brenda looks at him, confused.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Guess it's hard to explain how
                    amazin' a human brain is to someone
                    who that's all they know.
          
                                                                   26.
          
                                    BRENDA
                    What?
          
                                  GRANT
                    Stuff you can never imagine.
                    Feelings. Big thoughts. And love.
                    Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it
                    into somethin' more. So, go ahead
                    there, beautiful, and take off
                    your shirt.
          
          Brenda, though startled, leans back on a boulder and starts
          unbuttoning her blouse. After a moment, she looks at
          Grant, trying to be sexy while she does it. Grant looks
          at her in her bra.
          
                                    GRANT
                    Nice.
          
          Grant unbuttons his shirt as well.    As he removes it
          completely, he turns toward her.
          
          Brenda sees the wound on his stomach has blossomed into a
          veiny, blue-moss-encrusted yellow spout, huge and pulsing.
          
                                    BRENDA
                    Grant!?    What -- ?!
          
          Grant grabs her.    She tries to push his arms away.
          
                                    BRENDA
                    No, no, we --
          
          Brenda gets up, trying to run away. But Grant grabs her
          necklace, yanking her back. The necklace snaps and falls
          into the creek beside them.
          
          Grant pins Brenda's wrists against the rock.    She struggles
          to get free.
          
          Brenda's eyes widen as she looks down to see the writhing,
          tentacle-like tubule emerge from Grant's wound. She
          SCREAMS.
          
          Grant shoves his hand over her mouth, shutting her up.
          He's extremely strong. She watches as the tubule twitches,
          feeling its way like a blind snake.
          
          The tubule comes to rest on her abdomen. Tears stream
          down from Brenda's eyes. It pushes into her flesh.
          
          Brenda goes into convulsions. Something -- a fluid --
          pumps through the tubule and into Brenda.
          
          Grant watches Brenda without emotion as her body spasms
          there beside him.
          
                                                                27.
          
          Then she falls back, unconscious.   The tubule retracts
          into Grant's torso.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELSY SADDLE LODGE BACK PORCH - NIGHT
          
          Starla is leaning over a wooden rail, looking at the lights
          of the town below. She turns to see Bill lean on the
          rail beside her. She looks genuinely happy.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Hey, Bill!
          
          Starla catches herself, and looks around to see if Grant
          is watching.
          
                                 BILL
                    Don't worry. The lurker ain't
                    around. I checked.
          
                                  STARLA
                    That's not funny.
          
                                  BILL
                    Sorry.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Whatcha' doin'?
          
                                  BILL
                    Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm
                    too buff. Too much muscle mass.
          
          Starla LAUGHS.
          
                                  BILL
                    What you up to?
          
                                  STARLA
                    Just checking out the lights.
          
          Bill and Starla look out over the city together.
          
                                  BILL
                    Pretty, ain't they?
          
                                  STARLA
                    I don't know. I've seen them so
                    many times before. I guess any
                    spot gets boring after awhile.
          
                                  BILL
                    Well that's only if you're in the
                    wrong spot.
          
          Starla looks at him.
          
                                                                     28.
          
                                    BILL
                      There's a place over there on the
                      bluffs. When the fog is just right,
                      like tonight, the lights of Main
                      look like a kaleidoscope.
          
                                      STARLA
                      Oh, yeah?
          
                                    BILL
                      Mm hm. But only a few folks know
                      how to get there. Wally. Rollo
                      Linkski coulda taken you, but
                      'course he got hit by that train.
                      Me.
          
                                    STARLA
                      I'll get Wally to show me sometime
                      then.
          
            Starla LAUGHS out loud.   So does Bill.
          
                                    BILL
                      Oh, will you now?
          
                  STARLA                            GRANT (O.S.)
          Or Rollo's ghost.               Starla.
          
            They turn to see Grant approaching.     He's a mess.   His
            pants are streaked with mud.
          
                                    STARLA
                      Grant, where'd you go?
          
                                      BILL
                      Hey, Grant.
          
            Grant eyes Bill with suspicion.    He grabs Starla.
          
                                    GRANT
                      You ready, sugarplum?
          
            Starla nods.   She looks at Bill and mouths:
          
                                      STARLA
                      Bye.
          
            Bill watches Grant and Starla head off, as he downs the
            rest of his beer. Wally walks up beside him.
          
                                    WALLY
                      Surprised you're able to lift a
                      mug after carrying that torch for
                      so long.
          
                                                                 29.
          
                                  BILL
                    Hey, Wally. Glad you're here.
                    There was something I wanted to
                    tell you...
          
          Bill SNAPS his fingers, trying to remember.
          
                                     WALLY
                    What?
          
                                     BILL
                    Oh yeah.     Fuck you, fat ass.
          
          They both LAUGH.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - LATER
          
          Starla lies on her side, awake. She's staring at the
          dirt on Grant's pants, which are hung over a valet. Grant
          holds her from behind, sleeping peacefully.
          
                                                              FADE TO:
          
          
          INT. WHEELSY POLICE STATION - DAY
          
          The front door of the precinct opens, and a confused
          Mexican MAN walks inside. He is trying to keep from
          crying. Three half-naked children follow him, clutching
          onto his clothes. The man walks slowly through the office,
          looking around for help.
          
          Margaret sees him from her desk.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Sir, may I help -- ?
          
                                  BRENDA'S HUSBAND
                    My wife, Brenda. I think something
                    has happened to her!
          
          
          EXT. STOP SIGN - DAY
          
          Starla, in her car with groceries, comes to a stop sign.
          She looks at the telephone pole beside it and sees that
          it's covered with flyers for missing pets.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla enters with a shopping bag.    The lights are off.
          CREEPY MUSIC plays.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Grant?
          
                                                                  30.
          
          No answer.    Starla tries to turn on the lights, but nothing
          happens.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Damn fuse.
          
          She passes the door to the garage, noticing the lock.
          
          
          INT. GRANT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla sets down the bags on the counter, looks around.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Grant?
          
          Again, no one's here. She sees a potted flower on the
          counter. A green INCHWORM is crawling up the stem, little
          by little. She stares at it, as if it's a portent.
          
          She hears a MOAN, coming from upstairs.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla moves slowly into this dark room, looking for her
          husband. It seems no one is here.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Grant, where are y -- ?
          
          Starla turns, when Grant POPS INTO FRAME. Starla,
          startled, SCREAMS. Grant is sick and trembling. But,
          worse, he's been transforming. There are small pustules
          all over his face.
          
                                    STARLA
                       Grant. Oh my God. What happened
                       to your -- ?
          
                                     GRANT
                       Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks,
                       sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here.
                       I had a reaction to a bee sting.
                       He gave me a prescription. Said I
                       should be fine, in a couple days.
          
          Starla stares at him, mute and horrified.
          
                                     GRANT
                       Don't look at me like that, baby.
                       Please? I'm gonna go get my...
                       prescription filled.
          
          Grant grabs his keys off the dresser, puts them in his
          pocket, trying to pretend he doesn't hurt.
          
                                                                      31.
          
                                  STARLA
                    I'll get if for you.
          
                                       GRANT
                    No!   No.   Heh.     I'll be right back.
          
          He moves outside the door, leaving Starla, shell-shocked.
          
          
          INT. GRANT GARAGE - DAY
          
          It's too dark to see much in here, but we do see Grant
          putting meat into a garbage bag.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOUSE - DAY
          
          Grant looks around to make sure no one's looking, as he
          places the garbage bag full of meat into his trunk, closes
          it.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - EVENING
          
          Grant moves through the forest, in massive pain, dragging
          the garbage bag.
          
          Grant comes upon the old wooden barn.
          
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Grant enters. It is almost completely dark.          He hears
          WEEPING. CHAINS RATTLE.
          
          Grant peers over at Brenda, mostly in silhouette, sitting
          on the nest he has made. She's chained up and MOANS
          through a mouth gag. Grant walks to her. Her body is
          horribly pear-shaped and misshapen, like some tumorous
          pregnancy. Grant pulls her gag away.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so
                    fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna
                    die.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Brought you munchies.
          
          Grant pours the garbage bagful of rotting meat and dead
          animals out in front of her.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Been saving for a rainy day.
          
          CLOSEUP: Brenda's face, still mostly in darkness. She
          stares at the meat, simultaneously excited and repulsed.
          
                                                                 32.
          
          She looks up at Grant.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Grant, I'm sorry if I did something
                    wrong! I think I gotta -- I think
                    I should go to a hospital!
          
          Grant doesn't respond.    Brenda's eyes trail back down to
          the meat.
          
          Brenda's hand reaches out, and grabs a maggot-infested
          pork chop, pulling it toward her.
          
          We HEAR, but can barely see, Brenda CHOWING DOWN on the
          raw pork in the nearly pitch black barn.
          
          
          INT. GRANT'S TRUCK - LATER
          
          Grant gets into his pickup; he trembles and YELPS as his
          body is wracked with pain and his body starts to transform
          even more.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          There's a HARD KNOCKING on Starla's door. She swings it
          open to see Bill and Wally standing there, worried.
          
          Wally tries to see inside.
          
                                     WALLY
                    Grant around?
          
                                   STARLA
                    No.   He went to the pharmacy.
          
                                     WALLY
                    Pharmacy?
          
                                  STARLA
                    He's got a... rash.
          
          Bill and Wally exchange a glance -- maybe this means
          something. Starla can see Trevor and Margaret, across
          the street, talking to another neighbor.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla, you know Brenda Gutierrez?
          
          Starla shakes her head.
          
                                  BILL
                    Maybe she's ever called the house,
                    or -- ?
          
                                                                  33.
          
                                     STARLA
                    No.   What...?
          
                                  BILL
                    She disappeared Friday night. We
                    got reason to believe foul play
                    might be involved.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Some kids found her necklace near
                    Tipper Creek, as well as what might
                    be her blood on a rock.
          
                                  BILL
                    The problem, Starla, is, the last
                    person anyone saw her talking to
                    was Grant.
          
          Starla looks at him, surprised.
          
                                  BILL
                    The Deer Cheer. And Wally and me,
                    we also saw him that night, with
                    mud all over his slacks.
          
          Bill hands her his card.
          
                                  BILL
                    Have him call me right away, okay?
          
          Starla nods, distraught. Bill tries to smile kindly before
          he and Wally move out and off to canvas other neighbors'
          homes.
          
          Starla closes the door behind her, distraught, panicked.
          
          She looks at the foyer door, leading into the garage.
          Her eyes fall down to the floor, where she sees what
          appears to be blood drop stains near the door.
          
          She gains courage, and moves off toward --
          
          
          INT. GRANT CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla throws open this door. She looks at old, unused
          sports equipment. She grabs an aluminum baseball bat.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla holds the aluminum bat, standing in front of the
          door to the garage. She hesitates a moment. But then
          she swings the bat at the lock on the door.
          
          She swings it again, GRUNTING.
          
                                                                 34.
          
          And again.
          
          Finally, the lock is knocked off the wooden door.
          
          Starla pushes away the useless lock, letting it fall to
          the floor.
          
          Starla steels herself, and slowly pushes open the door
          into the dark garage. As she does, the horrendous stench
          hits her. Terrified, she covers her face with her hand,
          and enters.
          
          
          INT. GRANT GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          Starla sees what's there: not only a huge stockpile of
          rotten meat, but a dozen dead pets. They are neatly
          divided into various categories, and labeled: Pork, Ground
          Beef, Cats, Dogs. The walls and doorway have been heavily
          insulated so the smell doesn't sink into the home. She
          looks on the floor and sees poor, dead Roscoe the beagle,
          his tongue dangling out.
          
          Starla starts to CRY.
          
          She moves quickly back inside.
          
          
          INT. GRANT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla runs to the front picture window, and looks out
          onto the street. She can't see any of the cops.
          
          She turns from the window and picks up a cordless phone.
          She looks at the card Bill gave her, and dials the number.
          The phone RINGS, and:
          
                                     SHERRY (O.S.)
                       You've reached Chief Pardy at the
                       Wheelsy Police Department. Please
                       leave a message and your call will
                       be returned as soon as possible.
          
          There's a BEEP.    Starla tries to speak through her SOBS,
          pacing:
          
                                     STARLA
                       Bill, it's Starla!
          
          As Starla passes the large picture window, she doesn't
          see Grant staring in at her, his face now that of some
          diseased cephalopod.
          
                                     STARLA
                       It's -- I think you better come
                       over right away -- I think Grant's
                       sick, he --
          
                                                                  35.
          
          Starla turns to see the monstrous Grant through the window.
          
          She just stops.   They stare at each other for a moment.
          
          And then Grant lets out a FURIOUS WAIL.
          
          Starla turns and dashes toward the back of the house.
          
          Grant disappears from the window.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          As Starla runs through here, she looks behind her at the
          front door to make sure Grant isn't following.
          
          
          INT. GRANT HALL - NIGHT
          
          She runs past a wall of family photos.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla sees the door on the rear of the house, leading to
          the backyard.
          
          She arrives at it, and flings it open --
          
          Grant is there.
          
          He lunges onto her. Starla SCREAMS and drops the cordless
          phone, just as it starts RINGING. Grant crawls on top of
          her body. Starla reaches for the ringing phone, but he
          pins her hands above her head. He looks into her eyes.
          He's CRYING. His voice and breath are sick and raspy.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
          
                                     STARLA
                    Grant, no!
          
                                     GRANT
                    I loved you.     I loved --
          
                                  STARLA
                    Grant, you're sick!
          
          Grant is about to cry.
          
                                  GRANT
                    I wanted you by my side, but you --
                    I can't trust you now!
          
          Starla's WEEPING, confused. Grant rips his shirt open.
          Starla looks down to see the tubule protruding from the
          
                                                                36.
          
          now enormous yellow spore on Grant's chest. The tubule
          feels over Starla's blouse, and then slips beneath it.
          It starts to poke into her skin.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Noooo!
          
          Starla grabs the leg of a coffee table beside her. She
          SLAMS the table into Grant's head. This hurts and
          surprises him sufficiently to let Starla get out from
          under him.
          
          Starla grabs the cordless phone, which is no longer
          ringing, and scurries behind the couch. She dials 9-1-1.
          
          Grant thrusts the couch aside.
          
          Starla crawls away again, when Grant attacks her from
          behind. He wraps his arm around her neck, pulling her
          back. He looks down at her with his sick, angry eyes, as
          his arm -- now apparently jointless -- curls around her
          like a snake.
          
          Starla gasps for air. Her face turns purple.   She hears
          a SLAMMING on the door.
          
                                   BILL (O.S.)
                    Starla?!!   Starla, are you in
                    there?!
          
          Starla tries to speak but she cannot.   Suddenly, we HEAR
          the FRONT DOOR OPEN.
          
                                   BILL (O.S.)
                    Starla?!
          
          Starla, with barely an ounce of life left in her, sees
          Bill, Wally, Trevor and Margaret burst into the living
          room.
          
          They are surprised, to say the least, to see this diseased
          humanoid strangling Starla from behind.
          
                                   TREVOR
                    Fuck!
          
          The cops, freaked out, pull their guns. Grant makes a
          SCREECHING SOUND at them. They SHOOT at Grant, nicking
          him.
          
          Grant jumps away from Starla, back into the shadows,
          SCREECHING in anger and pain. Starla falls to the floor.
          
          Grant slips out the back door and away.
          
          The cops stare, gape-jawed and frozen with shock; what
          the hell was THAT?!
          
                                                                       37.
          
            Starla rubs her neck, COUGHING.
          
            Bill Pardy runs toward the back door.
          
          
            EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
            Bill runs out into the backyard. Wally runs up behind
            him. They look around at the trees surrounding the area.
            Grant is nowhere to be seen.
          
            We CRANE UP and AWAY from them as we...
          
                                                              FADE TO BLACK.
          
            O.S. SNIFFLING.
          
                                       PASTOR (O.S.)
                         Jesus, these past few days have
                         been a trying time for us.
          
          
            INT. CHURCH - DAY
          
            We PAN OVER an altar where family members have placed
            little items that remind them of Brenda -- photographs,
            mementos, "Come home, Mommy" cards, etc.
          
                                       PASTOR (O.S.)
                         We ask you now for the safe return
                         of our beloved Brenda.
          
            Everyone in this modest little church has their heads
            bowed as the PASTOR leads the prayer service.
          
                                      PASTOR
                         Our sister. Our daughter.    Our
                         mother. Our wife.
          
            Brenda's husband, in the front pew, loses it, CRYING.
            His little children, beside him, fiddle in their seats.
          
                                       PASTOR
                         And we ask that you keep your light
                         alive in her heart, wherever she
                         may be. We ask all this in your
                         name, Lord. Amen
          
            Bill Pardy is here, in full uniform, hat in hands.
          
                  BILL                               CONGREGATION
          Amen.                            Amen.
          
            Bill looks around the church. He spots Starla, in the
            very back of church, head down, distraught, guilty.
          
                                                                38.
          
          He also sees a group of OLD CRONES nearby, pointing at
          Starla, and whispering about her.
          
          
          EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla's high heels CLACK on the pavement as she moves
          quickly to her car.
          
                                     BILL (O.S.)
                    Starla.
          
          Starla turns to see Bill coming after her.   She stops.
          
                                  BILL
                    I talked to the CDC. They didn't
                    have nothin' on file consistent
                    with Grant's... symptoms.
          
          Starla nods.
          
                                  STARLA
                    How about Brenda?
          
                                  BILL
                    New? No. We're hoping we find
                    Grant, he'll lead us to her.
          
          Starla nods. The wind is strong. Her hair is flying
          over her face. Tears come to her eyes.
          
                                     BILL
                    You all right?
          
          Starla nods.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Yeah.
          
          She moves away from him.
          
          Bill watches her go.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
          
          Bill enters. A few COPS and SECRETARIES are bustling,
          making phone calls, etc. They all look tired, as if they
          haven't slept. Jack, the mayor, sees Bill.
          
                                     JACK
                    Bill!
          
          Bill spots him, moving quickly toward him.
          
                                     BILL
                    Shit.
          
                                                                 39.
          
                                  JACK
                    Bill, we need to talk!
          
                                  BILL
                    'Mornin', Jack.
          
          Bill crosses the station.   Jack follows.
          
                                  JACK
                    Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's
                    niece. We need to find Grant
                    yesterday! The town council has
                    lit a Roman candle and stuck it up
                    my ass!
          
                                  BILL
                    Hell, Jack, your leisure activities
                    ain't my business.
          
                                  JACK
                    Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your
                    post here as Chief is in dire
                    straits you don't work this shit
                    out.
          
          They come to a desk with Wally and Trevor working away.
          
                                  BILL
                    Don't worry, we'll find him.
                          (to Trevor)
                    Anything new?
          
          Trevor shakes his head.
          
                                  JACK
                    How are you going to find him?
          
                                  BILL
                    Dude's a half-squid. Ain't many
                    places he can hide. Sea World,
                    maybe.
          
          Jack sees a SECRETARY making copies nearby.    He speaks in
          hushed tones:
          
                                  JACK
                    That young lady heard you say
                    'squid.' She's gonna go out and
                    create a Goddamn hysteria!
          
                                  BILL
                    Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
          
                                  SHERRY
                    Not today, Bill.
          
                                                               40.
          
                                  JACK
                    Still, quit that talk! You yourself
                    said it was dark in there! You
                    don't know what you saw!
          
                                  TREVOR
                    We saw his arm was all bendy.
          
                                  JACK
                    Bastard obviously got lyme disease!
          
                                   BILL
                    What?
          
                                  JACK
                    Touch some deer feces out in the
                    forest. Eat a sandwich without
                    washing your hands. Then you got
                    lyme disease.
          
                                  BILL
                    And that makes you look like a
                    squid?
          
                                  JACK
                    I'll tell you what, no one with
                    lyme disease gonna win any damn
                    handsome contests!
          
          Bill, Wally, and Trevor can't help but SNICKER.
          
                                  JACK
                    Well, screw you all for laughin'.
          
                                   SHELBY (O.S.)
                    Bill!
          
          Bill looks over at Shelby, on his headset at the dispatch
          unit.
          
                                  SHELBY
                    Another ranch attack!   Up at the
                    Castavets'.
          
          Bill nods for Trevor and Margaret to get up from their
          desks. They do, and start to move out with Bill and Wally.
          
                                   JACK
                    'Ranch a -'?   What 'ranch attacks'?
          
          
          EXT. CATTLE RANCH - LATER
          
          POV: A dead rottweiler is lying on its back in the long
          grass, its gut split open and intestines spilling out,
          almost perfectly symmetrical.
          
                                                                  41.
          
                                     WALLY (O.S.)
                       It looks like one of them psyche
                       tests. What do they call it?
          
          Bill and Wally are staring at the dog from above.
          
                                     BILL
                       Rorschach.
          
                                     WALLY
                       What do you see? I see a butterfly.
          
          Bill moves on through the windswept weeds.
          
                                      BILL
                       I see we're fucked.   Three ranches
                       in three days.
          
          Margaret is taking measurements and writing in a note
          pad; she sees Bill.
          
                                     MARGARET
                       So, I think I got it part-way
                       figured. You want to hear it?
          
          Bill nods.
          
                                     MARGARET
                       So Grant -- I mean, we're saying
                       this is Grant, right?
          
          Bill nods.
          
                                     MARGARET
                       Grant kills a cow right about here.
                       See there's the blood, musta slit
                       its neck.
          
          Margaret walks backward, showing the trail of blood in
          the crushed grass.
          
                                     MARGARET
                       So he drags the cow backwards here.
                       Only he prolly didn't know 'bout
                       the Castavets had them dogs.
          
                                     TREVOR (O.S.)
                       Hey, look!
          
          Bill looks over at Trevor, standing up between the tall
          weeds, holding a dog's head in his hand.
          
                                     TREVOR
                       He knocked this'n's head clear
                       over here!
          
                                                                42.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Put that down, numbnuts!
          
          Bill peers at the various slaughtered dogs around them.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    So the dogs attacked, somehow he
                    slew 'em all, and he stole off
                    with the cow into the forest.
          
          Trevor heads toward them. Bill looks off into the dark
          forest on the edge of the ranch.
          
                                  BILL
                    He's gotta be in the forest. All
                    three ranches run alongside it.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Think we should get up a search
                    party, head in there?
          
                                  WALLY
                    It's a hundred thousand acres. Be
                    finding a needle in a fuckstack.
          
          Bill has a realization.   He moves quickly for his car.
          
                                  BILL
                    Wally, come on. Trevor and
                    Margaret, get some folks together.
                    I think I know where he's gonna
                    hit next.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - LATER
          
          CLOSEUP: A property map of Wheelsy is tacked to a bulletin
          board. Red Magic Marker circles are around various ranch
          properties on the edge of the city, next to an enormous
          forest. A finger points to one of the red circles.
          
                                  BILL
                    So the night after Grant ran off,
                    a calf went missing from here, the
                    Raglans' ranch.
          
          REVEAL Bill, standing beside the bulletin board. A posse
          has gathered, listening intently: Wally and the usual
          cops; Jack; an OLDER COP, probably pulled out of
          retirement; and a couple of recruits -- a REDNECK and a
          GOOD OL' BOY. Bill points to the next red circle.
          
                                  BILL
                    Two nights ago, a mare was stolen
                    from this property, run by
                    Fitzgibbon, that old rancher with
                    the cleft palate.
          
                                                              43.
          
          Wally whispers to Margaret, amused:
          
                                  WALLY
                    Looks like a chipmunk.
          
                                  BILL
                    Your momma wasn't too proud when
                    you came out neither, Wally.
          
          Bill points to the next circle.
          
                                  BILL
                    And then we get here, the
                    Castavets', where last night's
                    shit-storm took place.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    I see. It's like as if he's going
                    in a pattern. Is that what you're
                    saying, Bill?
          
          Bill nods and points to the next red circle.
          
                                  BILL
                    And if he sticks to that pattern
                    he'll be here next. Belongs to a
                    family, the Strutemyers'. Now I
                    know y'all are tired and you've
                    barely seen your families. But
                    we're gonna have to go there
                    tonight, lie low and wait.
          
          The posse nod, agreeing.
          
                                  REDNECK
                    Let's get that son-of-a-bitch,
                    Chief.
          
                                  BILL
                    Just remember, we don't know what
                    we're up against here. So let's
                    be careful.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION/ARMORY - DAY
          
          Beside a small armory, Trevor loads a Benelli M-1 super
          semiautomatic shotgun. Margaret checks the site on a
          Remington 700 PSS rifle. Bill takes a Springfield M-1A
          pump-action for himself, while Wally stuffs numerous
          pistols and ammo into a leather satchel. Trevor notices
          a dusty grenade on a shelf.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Hey, Bill, we got that grenade we
                    confiscated from them jokers wanted
                    to use it fish for trout?
          
                                                                 44.
          
          Bill looks at Trevor, considering.
          
                                  BILL
                    Can't hurt.
          
          As Trevor puts the grenade into a side-pocket on the
          satchel, Bill sees Jack and the Older Cop, watching.
          
                                  JACK
                    I didn't know the Russkies were
                    invading there, folks.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    You seen this guy, you'd wished
                    they was.
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION - LATER
          
          The posse loads up their vehicles, and start taking off
          out of the parking lot.
          
          Bill and Wally walk out to their police car.   Bill tosses
          the leather satchel into the trunk.
          
          They get in the car, Bill starts the engine, when --
          
          Starla Grant pulls quickly into the parking lot. Bill
          rolls down the window as she gets out of her car and runs
          toward them.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Bill, I heard what you're doing.
                    I think I should go along.
          
                                 BILL
                    Why? Listen, it doesn't matter.
                    I gotta go.
          
          Bill starts to roll away, but Starla holds on to the car,
          following.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's
                    still out there, how will you find
                    her? How, unless you bring Grant
                    in alive? Your best chance of
                    doing that is with me. I can talk
                    to him --
          
                                  BILL
                    He tried to kill you, Starla.
          
                                  STARLA
                    He did. I know. But I got him
                    angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This
                    time I could --
          
                                                                      45.
          
          Starla's on the verge of tears.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Please, Bill. What happened, it's
                    my fault, I know it.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla, it ain't --
          
                                  STARLA
                    It is. He'd been acting strange.
                    And the physical changes. I should
                    have told someone right away...
                    But I was just blind. I wanted to
                    pretend it wasn't happening... If
                    I don't do what I can to help now,
                    I just couldn't live with it.
          
          Bill looks at her.   He looks at Wally.     Wally shrugs.
          
          Bill nods for Starla to get in.
          
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER KITCHEN - EVENING
          
          Kylie is blowing on a cup of coffee. Her MOM, DAD, and
          two younger SISTERS, aged 9 and 11, are relaxing after
          dinner. As Kylie's Mom picks up plates --
          
                                 KYLIE'S MOM
                    Kylie! What'd you do to your
                    fingers?
          
          Kylie's Mom grabs her hand, looking at her very long
          fingernails. They're painted sky blue and spotted with
          minute teddy bear and bumblebee decals.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    Kiri Goshima done 'em.    She's
                    Japanese.
          
                                  KYLIE'S DAD
                    Looks like Pokemons done 'em to
                    me!
          
          Kylie's sisters LAUGH out loud.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    Foreign stuff is classy if you
                    knew something.
          
          Kylie's family sees, OUT THE WINDOW, police cars pulling
          up by a gravel road.
          
                                  KYLIE'S DAD
                    Oh. There's Jack. I want y'all
                    to stay inside tonight. All right?
          
                                                                  46.
          
          Kylie's sisters nod.   Kylie too.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER FARMHOUSE - EVENING
          
          Kylie's Dad steps onto the front porch of this quaint
          family farmhouse. He sees Jack heading toward the ranch,
          and waves. Jack gives a little salute, while muttering
          to the Older Cop.
          
                                  JACK
                    This turns out to be a mountain
                    lion we're gonna look like a damn
                    bunch of idiots.
          
          The Redneck and Good Ol' Boy make their way to the ranch
          as well. They see Bill with Starla.
          
                                  REDNECK
                    Didn't know it was date night.
          
          The Good Ol' Boy LAUGHS.
          
                                  REDNECK
                    I'll be expecting you toss my salad
                    at the end of all this then,
                    Charlie.
          
                                     GOOD OL' BOY
                    Shut up.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The posse fans out over this grassy land where the cattle
          graze, finding places to hide. The sun sets behind them.
          
                                                            FADE TO:
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Darkness has crept over the ranch, and the beautiful,
          pastoral scene has become distinctly more sinister.
          
          The wind blows hard, WHISTLING through the long weeds.
          
          A rusty rooster windmill atop the old barn twists and
          CLINKS on its half-bent perch.
          
          A piece of tarp hangs down from the barn roof, FLAPPING
          incessantly against the wooden wall.
          
          Trevor and Jack; the Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy; and
          Margaret and the Older Cop are hidden around the ranch,
          waiting, watching or dozing.
          
                                                               47.
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT
          
          Inside the barn, the wind is only slightly quieter, and
          it's darker. Bill, Starla, and Wally are here. Bill
          peers out through the doorway at cattle drinking from the
          trough. He looks at Starla; her head tilts to the side
          as she nods off. When her head falls all the way, she
          snaps back up, and catches Bill gazing at her.
          
          Bill nods and smiles. She doesn't smile back; she's
          embarrassed and miserable and this is the last place she
          wants to be.
          
          They sit there for a moment in the dark.
          
                                  BILL
                    Hey, Starla, remember that time
                    when you were a kid and you came
                    knocking on my window in the middle
                    of the night?
          
          Wally looks at them.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla here's twelve. Guess I was
                    fourteen. I said, 'Starla, what
                    the hell you doing out there?'
                    She tells me she's running away to
                    Hollywood to become a big star.
                    She said she knew I was in ROTC,
                    and she was gonna need a bodyguard.
                    Invited me along.
          
          Wally LAUGHS. Bill smiles. Starla is embarrassed, but
          grudgingly enjoys the story.
          
                                  BILL
                    I said, 'Starla, if there's anybody
                    can take care of herself, I think
                    it's you. I'm gonna have to
                    decline.'
          
                                  WALLY
                          (to Starla)
                    How far'd you get?
          
                                  STARLA
                    About the bus stop. Ranger Rick
                    here called my dad.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Ha! A cop from the get-go!   You
                    son-of-a-bitch!
          
                                  STARLA
                    You fucked up our fame and fortune,
                    Bill Pardy.
          
                                                               48.
          
                                  BILL
                    Yeah, maybe I did.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Jack smokes a cigarette as he keeps an eye out for the
          cow killer. The burning ember of the cigarette is blown
          off by the wind. Jack searches for it in the dry grass,
          trying to catch it before it starts a fire. He crawls
          forward, slapping the ground, when he glances up and
          sees...
          
          A large, shadowy shape hulking through the trees on the
          edge of the forest.
          
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill, Starla, and Wally see Grant Grant emerging from the
          forest. He has transformed into something much more
          monstrous: a giant, gangrenous, slug-like beast, a clump
          of cells and tumor-like protuberances. He has various
          tentacle-like-arms growing out of him, like overgrown
          eyes on a potato. As opposed to just having the disease,
          he now seems to BE the disease itself.
          
                                    STARLA
                    Grant?
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Jack and Trevor watch in amazement as Grant slithers across
          the field, his large, dark, watery eyes searching out
          prey. Jack turns to Trevor, pissed, and whispers:
          
                                  JACK
                    You said 'squid'!
          
                                    TREVOR
                    It got worse.
          
          The Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy watch too, mouths dropped.
          
          The diseased Grant slithers through the grass just a few
          feet beside Margaret and the Older Cop. They duck below
          the grass, looking as if they're going to have heart
          attacks.
          
          Grant approaches a cow. The cow makes a little MOO of
          protest when he gets too close, and steps back.
          
          The Grant-creature stabs one of his tentacle growths into
          the cow's neck, piercing it. The cow stumbles, choking.
          Blood spurts from her neck. And she topples over.
          
                                                                49.
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill and Wally stare out the window, motionless.
          
                                  WALLY
                    What we gonna do now, Bill?   Cuffs
                    won't even fit on 'im.
          
          Starla musters courage.   She stands, and moves out of the
          barn.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla, where you...?
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Grant wraps a feeler around the cow's horns, and starts
          dragging it back in the direction of the forest.
          
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill motions through the barn window to Margaret.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Margaret motions to Trevor.
          
          Trevor motions to the recruits.
          
          And Starla moves slowly in toward Grant.
          
                                    STARLA
                    Grant?
          
          Grant turns and looks at her with his half-human eyes.
          His breathing is loud, raspy, and sick. He sees, in a
          wide circle around him, the nervous posse standing up,
          their guns at the ready.
          
          Starla moves even closer.   Bill and Wally are coming in
          close behind her.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Grant?   It's okay.
          
          As Starla and the posse get closer, Grant looks almost
          scared. His eyes dart around from cop to cop.
          
                                  STARLA
                    You're just sick is all. But we'll
                    take you to get help right now.
                    I'll stay by your side, Grant,
                    just like I swore I would. For
                    better or worse. Remember?
          
                                                                 50.
          
          Grant's huge milky eyes betray that he does.
          
                                     STARLA
                     Okay?
          
          The posse inch in closer, tightening the circle.
          
          Grant lets out a PIERCING SCREECH of protest.    All of the
          posse stop, terrified.
          
          Everything is quiet and still except for Grant's gross
          breathing. Deep: In, out.
          
                                     STARLA
                     Okay, Grant?    It's gonna be all
                     right.
          
          Grant SCREECHES again: a warning. He looks from Starla
          to Bill, with hurt, jealous eyes, and GROWLS.
          
          Then Grant's eyes close to half-mast, and he turns away.
          His tentacle tightens around the cow's horns, and he again
          drags it toward the forest.
          
          While Bill tries to decide what to do, the Good Ol' Boy
          nervously blocks Grant's path. He aims his pistol at
          him.
          
                                   GOOD OL' BOY
                     You stop right there, you son of a
                     bitch. I don't care what kinda
                     leprosy you got. We need to find
                     that girl. Now you can make this
                     peaceful, or you can make it hard.
          
          Pause.   Grant and the Good Ol' Boy stare at each other.
          
          And then Grant SNAPS out a tentacle-arm, whipping it up
          the front of the man's body, and back.
          
          The front of the Good Ol' Boy's whole body is split neatly
          in half. For a split second, he remains alive: the two
          different sides of his split head look down in disbelief
          as his organs spill out from inside him. And then he
          topples over.
          
                                     BILL
                     Fire!   Fire!
          
          The posse SHOOT at Grant.    Starla covers her head.
          
          Grant is struck; he SCREECHES in pain. He lets go of the
          cow. He slithers with incredible speed off toward the
          forest.
          
          Bill and the other posse members take off after him like
          hounds on the heel of their prey. They SHOOT madly.
          
                                                                 51.
          
          Starla watches as the posse follows Grant into the woods.
          
          Starla stands alone and worried a moment, and then she
          darts off after them.
          
          
          INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kylie is running a bath.    She hears GUNSHOTS ECHO in the
          distance.
          
          She peers out a little window above the tub, trying to
          see where the shots are coming from.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
          
          The posse run through this very dark forest after Grant,
          leaping over brush and rocks. They're nervous, but also
          excited, as the primordial hunting urge takes over. Their
          eyes are filled with anger and bloodlust.
          
          They're able to follow Grant only by catching glimpses --
          a flash of flesh between trees, a tentacle disappearing
          around brush.
          
                                     WALLY
                    There he is!     Over there!
          
          They FIRE at the creature, taking chunks out of trees,
          but missing. He's too fast.
          
          
          EXT. CREEK - NIGHT
          
          Grant slips around a boulder and splashes through a creek,
          and into the plentiful trees beyond. He rustles thick
          fronds as he moves up alongside the creek.
          
          The posse run up the creek itself, splashing, trying to
          peer through the leaves to get a shot at Grant.
          
          Jack, carrying his revolver, trips and falls in the creek.
          He cuts his knee on a sharp rock. He stands, and keeps
          going.
          
          They come to --
          
          
          EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
          
          The posse come up out of the creek. They've completely
          lost track of the diseased man-beast.
          
          They stop, out-of-breath and looking around.   They whisper:
          
                                                                 52.
          
                                     TREVOR
                    Where'd he go?
          
                                  MARGARET
                    We ain't never gonna find that
                    girl now.
          
          The Redneck is WEEPING with rage.
          
                                  REDNECK
                    I'll kill that asshole what he did
                    to Charlie.
          
          Bill sees Starla run up behind them.    He waves her back.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla, get the hell out of here!
          
          Starla takes a couple steps back, but doesn't leave. She
          watches there, half in shadows as the posse creep around,
          searching for some trail of Grant.
          
          Margaret looks down into the bubbling creek. She sees
          it's turning red. She looks up the trail of red, which
          is rippling downhill in the water. The red flow starts
          somewhere near a boulder.
          
          Bill and Wally are searching in front of the boulder.
          Margaret SEES, but they don't, Grant pulling himself up
          on a tree branch and RISING behind them. Blood from a
          shotgun wound is dripping into the creek. Grant, pissed,
          lifts a tentacle.
          
                                     MARGARET
                    Bill!!
          
          Bill turns as the tentacle swings down toward him. He
          falls back; the tentacle slashes inches from his face.
          
          Bill BLASTS his shotgun up at Grant, but Grant is already
          slithering swiftly back into the thick brush.
          
          The posse squeeze themselves though the brush, following.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          The posse emerge on the other side of the brush, only to
          be confronted by a terrible odor. They cover their noses
          and mouths as their faces shrivel in disgust.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    What the hell's that smell?
          
                                  WALLY
                    It's something dead.
          
                                                                 53.
          
          The posse gaze up at the old ramshackle barn where Grant
          had brought Brenda.
          
                                  JACK
                    It's coming from in there, ain't
                    it?
          
          Margaret looks at Bill.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Think he's inside?
          
          Bill takes the lead, carefully approaching the barn.
          
          The posse follows, their weapons drawn. The closer they
          get to the barn, the more unbearable the smell becomes.
          Only Bill, intent on the task in front of him, doesn't
          react to the stench at all.
          
          Bill leans his ear in close to the front door, and listens.
          Through the door he can HEAR a QUIET SOBBING. Bill and
          Wally exchange a look.
          
          Bill steps back. He and Wally aim their shotguns at the
          door. Bill nods to Margaret, and gestures for her to
          open it. Starla watches all this from the rear.
          
          Margaret swings open the door.
          
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill and Wally move cautiously but quickly inside.   But
          they stop suddenly, in disgust and horror.
          
                                    BILL
                    Oh...
          
          It's Brenda. And she doesn't look good. Her weepy little
          head is stuck to the front of a huge fleshy orb, which is
          what her body has become. This enormous ball of flesh is
          nine or ten feet tall. Vestigial fingers protrude from
          the sides. She is utterly immobile. Her flesh sloshes,
          slightly and constantly; a thousand snakes seem to be
          slithering beneath her thin, tight, bruised skin. The
          woman is in great pain. She SOBS. Her mouth and chin
          are stained with blood.
          
          The posse and Starla enter behind Bill and Wally and are
          equally astounded.
          
                                    OLDER COP
                    Oh, shit!
          
          They see the source of the awful stench:
          
                                                                 54.
          
          Brenda is encircled by the rotting carcasses of cows and
          horses and forest critters. They are mostly skeletal, as
          they have been largely devoured. They're swarming with
          flies. The stench is so bad the posse cover their faces
          with the bottom of their shirts.
          
          The SOBBING Brenda looks desperately at Bill and Wally.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Something's wrong with me.
          
                                    WALLY
                    Uh, yeah.
          
          Bill and Wally get in a little closer.
          
                                    BILL
                    Brenda, um...
          
                                  BRENDA
                    I didn't want no one to be seeing
                    me like this.
          
          As the posse inch closer, Brenda's whole body suddenly
          LURCHES FORWARD a bit -- like whatever's inside her is
          trying to get out and to the posse. Brenda SCREAMS in
          agony.
          
          The posse jump back.    They stare as she recomposes herself.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    How are my boys, Bill?    Are they
                    all right?
          
                                  BILL
                    Boys are fine, Brenda. Uh, what's --
                    what's happening here, exactly?
          
                                  BRENDA
                    I'm so fucking hungry, Bill. I'm
                    so hungry. I just never knew
                    anybody could be so hungry.
          
          Brenda tries to smile in a way she might charm her Daddy
          into giving her candy. This is creepy as hell.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Would you mind handing me a piece
                    of that possum there at your feet?
                    Little bit?
          
          Trevor gags and runs out of the barn.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Trevor vomits into some bushes.
          
                                                                 55.
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill eyes poor Brenda.
          
                                  BILL
                    I think we best get you to a
                    hospital right quick.
          
                                  WALLY
                    What the fuck they gonna do with
                    her in a hospital, Bill?
          
          Again, Brenda SCREAMS.    Her body LURCHES FORWARD.
          
                                  OLDER COP
                    Why's she doing that?!
          
                                  REDNECK
                    Her tumors is moving.
          
                                  JACK
                    Bill, get her to stop that shit!
          
                                     BRENDA
                    It hurts!
          
          Her body lurches forward AGAIN.     She sobs.
          
                                     BRENDA
                    Help me!!     Help!!
          
          And then AGAIN. Starla notices that Brenda's skin is
          starting to SPLIT AND TEAR on her side.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Bill!
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Little fuckers are tearing me
                    aparrrr- !
          
          Brenda SCREAMS like a woman giving a thousand evil births
          at once and her body RIPS OPEN in one part; and then, in
          quick succession, ANOTHER, and ANOTHER. Bill looks out
          one of the windows. Grant is peering in at them, smiling.
          
                                  BILL
                    He led us here.
          
          And then Brenda's body BURSTS OPEN COMPLETELY, like a
          water balloon hitting cement, and thousands of little
          SLITHERING EYELESS PARASITES with slippery black-red skin
          like slugs spill forth. The horrid creatures, eight inches
          long and a few inches thick, swarm over the posse,
          completely covering them before they can react.
          
                                                               56.
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Trevor sees the things flooding over the posse in the
          barn. The parasites are especially drawn to the posse's
          heads. Because there are so many, the weight of the beasts
          knocks most of them down.
          
          Trevor runs, but the things make it out the doorway,
          covering him like lava in One Million B.C., and he buckles.
          
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          A parasite slithers quickly and fluidly into Wally's mouth.
          He gags on it. His eyes flip back up into his head, and
          his body starts to spasm.
          
          Jack tries to pull one away from his face, but it's too
          slippery and it disappears inside his mouth. His body,
          too, convulses, and he spits up blood.
          
          Bill notices the parasites slithering into the mouths of
          the Redneck and the Older Cop as well; whites of their
          eyes, bodies convulsing, spewing blood. Bill sees the
          things oozing up Margaret's neck.
          
                                  BILL
                    Margaret, cover your mouth!
          
          Bill sees Trevor outside the door in the dirt, trying to
          slap the parasites off. Bill yells to everyone:
          
                                  BILL
                    Don't let 'em in your mouths!
          
          One starts to get in Bill's mouth as he speaks, but he
          slaps it aside. Margaret pulls her shirt over her face.
          
          Starla SHRIEKS. She puts her hand over her mouth as the
          parasites rush up her. She's knocked over, and falls
          back onto the floor.
          
          A parasite slithers between Starla's lips -- when,
          suddenly, a KNIFE thrusts down, pinning the creature to
          the dirt, stopping it from oozing further into Starla.
          
          Bill is holding the knife in one hand, his other hand
          firmly over his mouth. Bill swats more incoming parasites
          away from Starla's mouth. He covers her mouth with his
          free hand. He lies on top of her, mushing their bodies
          and faces as closely together as possible so the things
          don't get into them. The parasites swarm all over them,
          flapping their slimy little tails as they try to fight
          their way inside their mouths. But Bill holds tight to
          himself and Starla.
          
                                                                 57.
          
          Eventually, the parasites give up on Bill and Starla, and
          begin to slither away. Bill watches as they crawl off
          the posse and filter out of the barn in a squirmy mound.
          
          Eventually, they're gone. Bill takes his hand from
          Starla's mouth. Starla looks around.
          
          She sees Margaret lift her face from the ground, shivering,
          holding her shirt over her mouth. They gaze out the front
          door of the barn.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Trevor pulls his face from the dirt and stands. He spits
          violently and wipes the dirt off his tongue with his wrist.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    They wanted us to eat 'em!   Why
                    would they want that!?
          
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill is trying to make sense of it all. He gazes down at
          Brenda's body, her bloody skin and misshapen skeleton
          spread out over the floor, split open like an enormous
          bloody tiger rug.
          
          He looks around at the posse lying on the floor in mangled
          positions, their mouths and lips covered in blood, still
          lightly convulsing.
          
          He gazes out INTO THE FOREST to see the parasites rushing
          away like an ugly wormy army, shaking the brush as they
          head off in different directions.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Parasites crawl over rocks and out of the forest and onto
          the ranch. The Strutemyer farmhouse looms nearby.
          
          
          INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kylie is taking a steamy bubble bath. Her head is back,
          her eyes shut; she's enjoying the warm water. The tub
          faucet drips lightly in an uneven rhythm.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          The parasites squirm up the side of the house, sticking
          to the wood siding.
          
                                                                       58.
          
            INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
            Kylie glances out the window beside the tub, at the starry
            sky and crescent moon, beautiful and still.
          
            There's a KNOCK on the bathroom door. Kylie turns toward
            the door -- as she does, a parasite crawls across the
            window behind her, streaking a moist slimy trail.
          
                                     KYLIE'S MOM
                      Kylie! You're gonna turn into a
                      plum in there!
          
                                      KYLIE
                      Prune, Mom.    Plums turn into prunes.
          
          
            INT. STRUTEMYERS' HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
            Kylie's Mom is at the bathroom door.
          
                                    KYLIE'S MOM
                      I know what turns into what. You
                      got school tomorrow. Finish up in
                      there and get to bed.
          
            O.S. Kylie GRUNTS in vague agreement.
          
            Kylie's Mom trots down the hall, to another door.
          
            She KNOCKS once, then opens the door to --
          
          
            INT. STRUTEMYER GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
            Kylie's younger sisters lie in single beds, reading
            Goosebumps by bed-lamps clipped to the headboards.
          
                                    KYLIE'S MOM
                      Time to turn in, ladies.
          
                                    KYLIE'S SISTER 1

                      Come on now.
          
            The girls SIGH in lazy protest, but still turn off their
            reading lamps.
          
                                      KYLIE'S MOM

          Night, Mom.                     Night.

          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          THROUGH THE WINDOW we see Kylie's Mom start to close the
          door.
          
                                   KYLIE'S MOM
                    Sleep tight.   Don't let the bed
                    bugs bite.
          
          Numerous parasites slither INTO FRAME, up the side of the
          house, approaching the girls' bedroom window, which is
          open a few inches for air.
          
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kylie's Mom shuts their door completely. The girls turn
          on their sides and close their eyes to sleep.
          
          And the parasites pour in through the cracked window.
          They slither over the walls. Their slimy black-red bodies
          contrast sharply with the pretty flowered wallpaper.
          
          
          INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          The door cracks open, and a parasite enters.   It slithers
          silently over the linoleum tiles.
          
          It arrives at the base of the tub, and crawls up the side.
          
          Kylie continues relaxing, her eyes closed. She doesn't
          see the parasite enter the soapy bath water at her feet.
          
          Kylie hears a SOFT SPLASHING and peers down. She spots
          the creature swimming toward her between her knees.
          
          Kylie SHRIEKS and scrambles up to get out of the tub.    As
          she clamors out, she slips and falls to the floor.
          
          The parasite squirms up Kylie's wet naked back. Kylie
          SHRIEKS again, jumping up as she tries to slap the thing
          off.
          
                                   KYLIE
                    Mom!!
          
          The parasite winds toward her lips. Kylie goes to grab
          it with both hands, but it slips through them. The thing
          slides into Kylie's mouth as she looks down at it.
          
          Kylie snatches the very end of the parasite's tail. Her
          long, teddy-bear-spotted fingernails pinch it there,
          digging into the parasite's flesh, barely stopping it
          from sliding completely into her mouth. It wildly flaps
          its tail like a docked trout, desperate to enter her.
          
                                                                  60.
          
          Kylie falls to her knees. Her eyes roll back in her head,
          and her body spasms while she holds tenuously onto the
          very tip of the parasite's tail.
          
          We TRACK IN to a CLOSEUP of Kylie's face: a slight white
          electrical-telepathic charge can be seen SPARKING inside
          her mouth.
          
                                                           FLASH TO:
          
          
          KYLIE'S VISION
          
          We are RUSHING through some amoebic landscape, PAST
          microbes and cytoplasm and cells, and to:
          
          
          KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - CREATURE'S POV
          
          Perhaps the memories of some creature not of earth. Its
          eyesight is not like our own; it's in grainy black and
          white and amber outlines. Various images FLASH in quick
          succession, including the following:
          
          -- We are on top of an alien ANIMAL, pinning it down.    It
          HOWLS beneath us as we tear into its flesh, feasting.
          
          -- All around us, diseased monstrous BEASTS feed on more
          alien animals. They lunge toward them and pin them down,
          ripping them apart, like some National Geographic
          documentary shot in Hell.
          
          -- In FAST MOTION, unfamiliar plant life around us grows
          sick and withers, dying out.
          
          -- A group of diseased monstrous beasts CRY OUT in uniform
          pain. They buckle to their knees; now they're dying.
          
          -- The diseased beasts feed on their own appendages.
          
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Kylie tries to regain control of her mind. Her eyes fight
          against flipping back in her head. Tears pour down her
          face. She pulls the parasite out just a bit.
          
          But then it SLAMS back into her and there are more SPARKS
          inside her mouth --
          
          
          KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - MANGLED INSECT POV
          
          -- We are CLIMBING UP through a creamy, gelatinous yellow.
          An opening slit widens in front of us, and we see Grant
          slowly bending to look at us, the forest behind him.
          
                                                                61.
          
          KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - GRANT'S POV
          
          -- We watch Starla soaping herself in the shower.
          
          -- We make love to Starla, our hands on her face.
          
          -- We sit over a convulsing Brenda, impregnating her with
          our tubule.
          
          -- We see the posse members coming in toward us.
          
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          With a last, desperate effort, Kylie yanks at the exhausted
          worm, pulling it fully from her mouth. It flaps in her
          fingers. Kylie spits up blood.
          
          Kylie tosses the parasite away from her. Though slightly
          crippled, the little bastard writhes back toward her.
          
          Kylie spots her curling iron on the counter; it's plugged
          in, the red light is on. She grabs it, and swings it
          into the wormy thing.
          
          The parasite SQUEAKS and trembles with pain. Smoke rises
          from it as Kylie digs the curling iron in deeper, burning
          it, and, finally, killing it.
          
          Kylie lifts the iron in front of her and looks at it.
          The dead parasite is stuck to it, dangling from the metal.
          
                                      KYLIE
                    Mom!!!
          
          Kylie drops the iron. She quickly steps into her clothes
          lying on the floor. She runs out of the bathroom and
          into --
          
          
          INT. STRUTEMYERS' HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Kylie runs to the stairway.
          
                                      KYLIE
                    Mom!!    Mom!!!
          
          Kylie stops. Dozens of the things are slithering up the
          stairs and up the handrail towards her.
          
          O.S. Kylie hears her SISTERS' SCREAMS.   She looks in their
          direction, running toward their room.
          
                                    KYLIE
                    Emily!!    Jenna!!
          
          Kylie tosses open her sisters' door.
          
                                                                  62.
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kylie's youngest sister is on her knees on the bed, a
          parasite sticking out of her mouth. Her eyes are rolled
          back. Her arms flail spastically. The slithering beast
          wags its tail as it disappears down her throat.
          
          Kylie's other sister is backing into a corner, with
          parasites crawling up her body. She's SCREAMING bloody
          hell, trying to slap them off.
          
          Kylie runs toward her to help. Kylie slaps the parasites
          off her sister. But there's too many and they're too
          fast. They slide into her sister's mouth.
          
                                    KYLIE
                    No!!   Nooo!!
          
          Her sister's eyes flip back in her skull as the thing
          disappears completely, and she starts spitting up blood.
          
          Kylie sees the parasites around the room coming at her.
          There's a clear path toward a window. Kylie runs to the
          window, and shoves it open. As the things approach her,
          she crawls out --
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE AWNING - NIGHT
          
          Kylie steps onto this shingled, angled canopy over the
          front porch. She turns to see the parasites slithering
          out towards her. She looks down. It's probably too far
          to jump, but she has no choice.
          
          So she jumps down onto --
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FRONT LAWN - NIGHT
          
          Kylie lands, hard, tumbling over.
          
          She glances back at the front of the house.
          
          THROUGH THE KITCHEN WINDOW she sees her Mom and Dad, eyes
          rolled back, convulsing, spitting up blood.
          
          More parasites are crawling towards Kylie through the
          grass.
          
          She spots her family's old Luv pickup truck on the driveway
          in front of her. She breaks for it.
          
          She throws open the front door, and jumps inside.
          
          The things approach, crawling in after her. Kylie tries
          to slam the door shut, but it won't; many things are stuck
          in the door jamb.
          
                                                                    63.
          
          They SQUEAK in a chorus of pain, trying to wriggle toward
          her.
          
          So she SLAMS the door AGAIN, and AGAIN, and she slices
          the little bastards in half.
          
          
          INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT
          
          Kylie makes sure none are inside.
          
          She feels for the keys in the ignition.    There aren't
          any.
          
          The creatures crawl up and over all the pickup's windows,
          trying to get in. Slithery shadows cover over Kylie,
          leaving her in almost complete darkness.
          
          Kylie crouches down in on herself, and WAILS.
          
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Starla, Trevor, and Margaret stand, wide-eyed and shaken.
          All three seem to be in some mild state of shock.
          
          Bill, suppressing his desperation, is trying to make
          contact on his police radio.
          
                                  BILL
                    11-41. We're gonna need paramedics
                    out here right away. We got four
                    men down.
          
          Bill listens for a response, but there's only STATIC.      He
          presses the button again.
          
                                  BILL
                    Shelby, you there?
          
          Still, only STATIC.    Bill tries another frequency.
          
                                  BILL
                    Shelby, this is Bill.     We got an
                    emergency here.
          
          STATIC.
          
                                    BILL
                    Goddammit.
          
          Bill steps outside the doorway, to see if he can get
          reception. Trailing off:
          
                                    BILL
                    Shelby?
          
                                                                 64.
          
          Starla sees Wally's body on the floor. His skin is white
          and corpse-like. His mouth is streaked with blood. Starla
          crouches beside him, and takes his pulse. Her hands are
          visibly shaking.
          
                                     MARGARET
                    Is he alive?
          
          Starla looks at Margaret, and nods.
          
                                     MARGARET
                    Praise Jesus.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking
                    pushing it, Margaret.
          
          Trevor looks about to cry.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    What the hell were those things?!
                    You ever seen anything like that?
                    You ever heard of anything like
                    that?
          
          Margaret shakes her head.    Trevor looks at Starla, who
          also shakes her head.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Me neither. And I watch 'Animal
                    Planet' all the fuckin' time!
          
          Bill re-enters.
          
                                  BILL
                    No reception out here.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Bill, I'll run out to your car,
                    call for paramedics from there.
          
                                   MARGARET
                    That's a long ways. Them worms
                    are out there.
          
                                  STARLA
                    I'll keep my mouth covered.
          
                                  BILL
                    No. I'll go. The three of you,
                    you wait here. Get these folks,
                    out of the barn. The stench and
                    rot can't be any good for 'em.
          
          Margaret and Trevor nod.    As Bill starts to leave, Starla
          grabs him.
          
                                                               65.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Be careful, Bill.
          
          Bill nods. Makes a feeble attempt at a smile.   He jogs
          off into the forest.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill runs into the small glade, and looks around, trying
          to remember which way he came from.
          
          He gazes between some greenery, some distance away, and
          spies a long-lashed deer munching on foliage. A couple
          more deer and a fawn are eating as well. Bill looks at
          them a moment, peaceful, perhaps a sign of some hope...
          
          And then a parasite crawls up the deer's neck and slithers
          into its mouth. Parasites crawl up the bodies and necks
          of the deer behind it. The deer buck and flounce and
          scratch trying to get the things off of them.
          
          Bill runs away as fast as he can.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Trevor and Margaret carry Jack out of the barn. He's
          bloated, corpse-like and covered in varicose veins.
          Margaret is wearing a gag-like swatch of clothing tied
          around her mouths, to protect themselves. Trevor's gag
          is down around his chin so he can chatter.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    It's got to be some Goddamn
                    biological weapons. Government's
                    testin' 'em out on us! 'Cause who
                    gives a shit if Wheelsy disappears,
                    right?!
          
          They set down Jack and head back toward the barn.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    I hope it ain't contagious. I'll
                    be pissed as hell I turn into a
                    big mollusk. I'll fuckin' sue, I
                    swear to God.
          
          Starla, also wearing a gag, is kneeling beside Wally, who
          is similarly sick and bloated. His lips are parched and
          cracking.
          
          Starla squeezes a wet cloth, dripping all the water onto
          Wally's lips. Then she stands, and heads toward the creek.
          
                                                                  66.
          
          She doesn't see Wally open his eyes behind her. He sits
          up, and stares over at Starla with milky eyes as she kneels
          down beside the water.
          
          Starla dips the swatch of clothing into the creek, re-
          wetting it.
          
          She stands, and turns, only to see Wally directly in front
          of her, standing between trees, almost completely covered
          in darkness.
          
                                   WALLY
                     Hey, sugarplum.
          
          Pause.   Starla pulls the gag from her mouth.
          
                                      STARLA
                     What?
          
          Wally speaks with Grant's cadence.
          
                                   WALLY
                     Marriage. It's a sacred bond.
                     Just like you said.
          
          Starla stares at him.   Wally almost looks weepy.
          
                                   WALLY
                     I'm sorry 'bout trying to strangle
                     you and all. I lost -- Lost my
                     head. I didn't want to do none of
                     the things I done. Not kill them
                     pets. Not make Brenda a womb.
                     But it's my nature, ain't it? How
                     can you blame a one for actin'
                     according to his nature?
          
          Starla, too freaked to speak, takes a step back from him.
          
                                   WALLY
                     I wanted to tell you what was going
                     on. But I didn't - didn't think
                     you'd love me no more. I never
                     knew... love, Starla, I --
          
          Trevor and Margaret are setting down the Older Cop.   They
          see Wally standing. Margaret pulls down her gag.
          
                                      MARGARET
                     Wally?
          
          Wally turns and stares at her like some angry animal.
          
                                      MARGARET
                     You all right?
          
          Wally doesn't answer.
          
                                                                  67.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Maybe you better sit back down.
                    You don't look so good.
          
                                   TREVOR
                    Margaret.
          
          Trevor's staring at something. Margaret follows his eye
          line. Jack and the Older Cop are sitting up, staring at
          her, just like Wally.
          
          The Redneck stumbles into the barn doorway, also staring
          at them.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE/INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT
          
          Kylie is still alone in the Luv truck. The windows are
          clear; the parasites have abandoned their quest, just as
          they did with the posse in the barn. But Kylie stays in
          the car, trembling, afraid to leave.
          
          She HEARS a DOOR OPEN. She sees her parents and her
          sisters come stumbling out the front door of her home.
          They're also bloated and diseased. Their chins and shirts
          are stained with the blood they spit up.
          
                                  KYLIE'S DAD
                    Kylie, honey, you okay? Come on
                    out.
          
          Her family lumbers up to the truck. They peer in with
          their milky eyes. Her youngest sister pushes her face up
          close to the window.
          
                                   KYLIE'S SISTER 2
                    Hi, Kylie.   It's me.
          
          Her family tries the door handles, but they're locked.
          
                                  KYLIE'S MOM
                    Open the door, sweetie. I know we
                    don't look so good, but your mommy
                    and daddy love you.
          
                                   KYLIE
                    Get away!!
          
                                  KYLIE'S MOM
                    Now, Kylie, there's no excuse why
                    not to be with your family. This
                    is family fun day, isn't it?
          
          They continue RATTLING the door handles, over and over.
          They SLAP the windows.
          
          Kylie SOBS.   Her sister speaks in a singsongy voice:
          
                                                                    68.
          
                                  KYLIE'S SISTER 1
                    Kyyy-leee, this is your last cha-
                    ance.
          
          Her Dad leans over and picks up a large rock. He carries
          it toward the truck. He holds it up over the windshield.
          
          Kylie SCREAMS as he SMASHES it down. The windshield
          CRACKS, but doesn't shatter. He holds it up again.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST NEAR STRUTEMYER'S - NIGHT
          
          Bill, out of breath, runs out of the forest --
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Bill emerges on the edge of the ranch, stretching five or
          six acres out in front of him. On the other side of the
          field is the gravel road, where his police car is parked.
          Beside the field is the Strutemyer's farmhouse.
          
          Bill HEARS a CRASH. He turns to see the diseased
          Strutemyers in their driveway, all holding rocks now,
          smashing the pickup's windows.
          
                                  BILL
                    Hey!
          
          The Strutemyers stop, mid-swing.   They turn toward him.
          
          Kylie sees Bill through the rear windshield.    She unlocks
          the door, and jumps out of the car.
          
                                  BILL
                    What's -- ?
          
          Kylie runs past her family and up to Bill.    She grabs
          onto him, and hides behind him, WEEPING.
          
                                  BILL
                    What's going on here?
          
          Kylie's Dad's cadence is also like Grant's:
          
                                  KYLIE'S DAD
                    Well, hello there, Pardy.
          
                                  BILL
                    What happened to you, Dwight?
          
          Kylie's Dad looks down at his own bloated arm.
          
                                  KYLIE'S DAD
                    Poison ivy out back, maybe?
          
                                                                   69.
          
                                   KYLIE'S SISTERS
                    We're itchy!
          
          Kylie is obviously in shock.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    They're not my... They killed...
          
                                 BILL
                    Okay. Y'all just wait in this
                    spot. I'm gonna call the paramedics
                    for you. Kylie can come with --
          
                                  RANCHER (O.S.)
                    Hey there, killer.
          
          Bill turns to see the RANCHER with the cleft palate, now
          diseased, holding a shovel. He swings it into Bill,
          knocking him down.
          
          Kylie SCREAMS. Her family runs in toward them. She looks
          around to see a couple more DISEASED RANCHERS rushing
          toward them through the fields.
          
          The Cleft Palate Rancher stands over Bill and raises the
          shovel to bring it down again.
          
          Bill feels for his shotgun, which has fallen into the
          dirt beside him. He yanks the trigger.
          
          The BLAST hits the Rancher in the foot.    He buckles.
          
          Bill stands, pulling Kylie with him as the other diseased
          folks rush toward them through the fields.
          
                                   BILL
                    Come on.
          
          Bill and Kylie dash toward the cluster of cars as the
          diseased chase them.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          The infected posse -- Wally, Jack, the Older Cop, and the
          Redneck recruit -- are all coming in towards Trevor and
          Margaret.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Now, what'd I say?! Y'all just
                    sit down! You need to get some
                    Goddamn rest! You're sick!
          
          Starla watches this, by herself, next to the creek.      She
          eyes a rifle in the dirt.
          
                                                               70.
          
          Jack grabs a fistful of Trevor's hair and restrains his
          arms. Wally pulls his pistols from their holsters and
          tosses them into the dirt.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Let go!!
          
          Margaret goes to grab her pistol, when the Redneck opens
          his mouth wide and --
          
          GLEEKS; that is, he sends a yellowish globby-stream
          shooting out of the back of his throat. The glob SPLASHES
          on Margaret's hand. Margaret SCREAMS, drops the pistol.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    It burns!!
          
          Margaret looks at her hand as the gleek-liquid sinks into
          her skin. The hand is swelling monstrously. It's soft.
          Parts of it are nearly dripping off the bone.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    What'd you do to my fuckin' hand?!
          
          Jack opens his mouth and GLEEKS too -- shooting the stream-
          glob forward and onto her neck. Margaret SCREAMS again,
          grabbing onto her neck.
          
          Margaret tries to speak, but she struggles just to breathe,
          as her neck puffs up, impeding her thorax.
          
                                  OLDER COP
                    Meat.
          
          The Older Cop buries his fingers into her neck. The puffy
          flesh comes off easily; it's soft, almost creamy. He
          stuffs the flesh into his mouth, eating it.
          
          As Margaret topples over, dying, the other posse members
          turn to look at a very freaked-out Trevor. The Redneck
          opens his mouth at him, when --
          
                                  STARLA (O.S.)
                    Let him go!
          
          The posse turn and see Starla, who has made her way over
          to where the rifle was on the ground, and is now pointing
          the rifle at the posse, trembling.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Trevor, come on.
          
          Surprised, they release Trevor.
          
                                  STARLA
                    What'd you do to her?!
          
                                                                      71.
          
            Jack stares at Starla.    He too speaks with Grant's cadence.
          
                                    JACK
                      There you go, sugarplum! Why you
                      choosing camps 'fore you hear --
          
                  JACK                            REDNECK
          Both sides of the story!?       Both sides of the story!?
          
                                    STARLA
                      Why are you talking like Grant?!
          
            The posse moves toward her. Starla is CRYING. The posse
            makes a COLLECTIVE SCREECHING sound, then speaks again:
          
                                    WALLY
                      'Cause I am Grant!
          
                  WALLY                           REDNECK
          I'm you husband --              I'm you husband, Goddammit --
          
                                    JACK
                      You swore to honor and obey --
          
                  OLDER COP                       REDNECK
          Obey me --                      Obey me, so put that Goddamn
                                          gun down.
          
                                    STARLA
                      Don't come any closer.    I'll...
                      shoot.
          
                                    WALLY
                      You ain't gonna shoot me! You
                      always needed me to protect you!
                      You for damn sure ain't got the
                      balls to --
          
            Starla BLASTS Wally, blowing open a big crater into his
            face.
          
            Wally falls to his knees.    Starla and Trevor look on in
            shock, as they see...
          
            A slithering parasite squirming out of the crater on his
            face -- out of the Wally's brain.
          
            The little thing squirms down Wally's body and slithers
            off quickly into the woods. Wally falls over, dead.
          
            The sick posse look at Starla, surprised, infuriated.
          
            And then they leap at her.
          
            Starla tries to shoot them.   But she's out of ammo.
          
                                                                  72.
          
          She and Trevor turn and dash away as quickly as their
          legs can take them.
          
          
          EXT. TREE-THICK FOREST - NIGHT
          
          Trevor and Starla run in a zigzag pattern through trees
          rooted closely together, panicked, breathing heavy.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit!
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Bill and Kylie arrive at his police car. Bill throws the
          door open, and shoves Kylie inside. As he starts to get
          in, he turns to see the two little girls closing in.
          
          One opens her mouth and GLEEKS -- it shoots out and lands
          on the car right beside Bill's hand.
          
          The other little girl opens her mouth to GLEEK as Bill
          jumps into the driver's seat. He slams the door shut
          just as the oozy liquid splashes on the window beside
          him.
          
          Bill is grossed-out by this, but he doesn't have much
          time. He goes to reload his shotgun, when he remembers.
          
                                   BILL
                    Shit.   Ammo's in the trunk.
          
          He grabs the police radio.
          
                                   BILL
                    Trevor!   Margaret!
          
          
          EXT. TREE-THICK FOREST - NIGHT
          
          Trevor turns and sees Jack, the Redneck, and the Older
          Cop leap powerfully over the brush behind them, coming in
          fast. But he's able to grab onto his radio.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    They killed Margaret!
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Kylie's two sisters jump onto the hood, SCREECHING.   They
          SLAM rocks on the windshield. Kylie SCREAMS.
          
                                  BILL
                          (into radio)
                    Where are you?!
          
                                                               73.
          
                                  TREVOR (O.S.)
                    We're coming your way, man!
          
          Bill JAMS the car forward, knocking the sisters off the
          hood. Then he slams on the brakes.
          
          He looks back and sees the two little girls running toward
          the car again.
          
          And he sees the mass of diseased ranch families also
          running toward the car. Kylie is SCREAMING and CRYING.
          
                                    KYLIE
                    Go!   Go!   Please!
          
          But, instead, of pulling forward on the gravel road, Bill
          turns up and onto the ranch itself -- back towards the
          running diseased.
          
                                  BILL
                    My friends are still in the forest.
          
          Bill speeds the police car over the dirt field, trying to
          avoid approaching ranchers. Some leap at the car, holding
          on and getting tossed aside. Bill zooms back toward the
          trees.
          
          Just as Bill gets a little headway on the diseased, the
          car gets stuck in some mud. The wheels spin, spraying
          mud, as the infected approach.
          
          
          INT. TREE-THICK FOREST - NIGHT
          
          Starla looks back to see Jack right behind her.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT
          
          The infected arrive at the car. Bill just lets his foot
          off the gas, and sits there, letting the ranchers leap
          onto the car. Kylie looks at Bill, panicked by his choice
          to do nothing.
          
                                  BILL
                    We need their weight.
          
          Bill slams down the gas again, and the car zooms forward.
          The diseased get knocked off.
          
                                    BILL
                    Dumbshits.
          
          Bill rushes toward the trees of the forest.
          
                                                                74.
          
          INT. FOREST - NIGHT
          
          Starla keeps running, when she trips and falls. She looks
          down to see she stumbled over old barbed wire fencing,
          now long fallen and curling on the forest floor. Starla
          forces herself up, as Jack closes in.
          
          Jack grabs onto her blouse, SCREECHING furiously.   When
          he HEARS something and looks over to see:
          
          Bill's police car, cruising over the forest floor, directly
          toward him. Jack, frightened, lets go of Starla. He's
          about to get hit when --
          
          The police car suddenly stops, jammed between two trees,
          inches from Jack.
          
          Jack smiles, and moves toward Bill -- but Starla rises
          behind him, holding a sharp rusty stake from the barbed-
          wire fence.
          
          She thrusts it forward, hard; and it pops out the front
          of Jack's neck.
          
          Jack turns to look at Starla, and topples over into the
          leaves.
          
          Bill backs the car out from between the trees. He sees
          the Older Cop and Redneck coming in toward them.
          
                                  BILL
                    Come on!
          
          Trevor and Starla get into the car.   The Older Cop watches
          them back away and yells:
          
                                  OLDER COP
                    Starla!!
          
          
          EXT. ROAD AWAY FROM FOREST - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The police car pulls up and out of the forest. The car
          is in bad shape. Steam rises from the smashed grill.
          
          Bill looks to his side; he's down a bit from the
          Strutemyers' ranch. He pulls away, heading back toward
          town.
          
          The foursome sit in a stupefied daze. Starla's beside
          Bill. Trevor and Kylie are in the back. Bill grabs the
          police radio.
          
                                  BILL
                    Shelby?
          
                                                                 75.
          
          Nothing. STATIC.   Everyone notes this, worried.    Bill
          tries again:
          
                                  BILL
                    Shelby, you there?
          
          For a moment, there's nothing.    And then:
          
                                   SHELBY (O.S.)
                    Yo, Chief.   How y'all doin'?
          
          Bill and Starla look at each other, relieved.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
          
          Shelby sits at the police operator's unit, peppy.
          
                                  SHELBY
                    You dig that rat out of the hole?
          
          
          INTERCUT POLICE CAR AND STATION
          
                                  BILL
                    Listen, you got any reports of...
                    I don't know what you call 'em.
                    They look like big slugs, only
                    fast.
          
                                  SHELBY
                    Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin'
                    about that new waitress down at
                    Sloan's! Ha ha!
          
                                   BILL
                    Shelby --
          
                                  SHELBY
                    Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police
                    radio aficionado. If so, I apolog -
          
                                  BILL
                    Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out
                    for these things. If you see 'em,
                    keep your mouth covered. Otherwise
                    they'll go straight down it. All
                    right?
          
          Shelby looks confused, and nods.
          
                                  BILL
                    Are you nodding?
          
                                   SHELBY
                    Yeah.
          
                                                                  76.
          
                                  BILL
                    I can't hear when you're nodding.
          
                                    SHELBY
                    Sorry.
          
                                  BILL
                    We'll be there in ten minutes.
          
          Bill hangs up. Kylie is clutching onto herself, hollow-
          eyed, in deep shock. She mutters, almost unintelligibly:
          
                                  KYLIE
                    The worms are in their brains.
          
          Starla, Bill, and Trevor look at her.
          
          
          INSERT - FOREST
          
          The CAMERA TRACKS QUICKLY FORWARD, through the forest,
          and to a CLOSEUP on the Redneck, who is hunched over
          Margaret's body, eating her flesh.
          
          MATCH CUT TO a CAT SCAN of the REDNECK'S HEAD: a parasite
          is imbedded into his brain; its tail hangs down his spine,
          wagging just a bit.
          
                                  KYLIE (O.S.)
                    Drivin' 'em around...
          
          
          BACK TO THE POLICE CAR
          
          Bill stares at Kylie like she's insane.
          
                                  STARLA
                    She's right. We saw one -- one
                    came out of Wally's head.
          
                                 TREVOR
                    Yeah. Sort of his eye, it came
                    out there --
          
                                  STARLA
                    Kylie, how do you --
          
          Kylie is rocking back and forth.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Kylie, how do you know that?
          
          Kylie shakes her head.    She doesn't want to answer.
          
                                    BILL
                    Kylie, honey.    Please.
                                    (MORE)
          
                                                         77.
          
                                  BILL (CONT'D)
                    A lot of bad things have happened
                    to you today, we know. But we
                    need your help to find out what's
                    going on.
          
          Kylie CRIES.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    I was in the bath. It tried to go
                    inside me and I -- for a minute I
                    became it.
          
                                     BILL
                    The worm?
          
                                     KYLIE
                    I got it out.
          
                                     TREVOR
                    What are they?
          
                                     KYLIE
                    Part of him.
          
                                     BILL
                    Who?
                           (pause)
                    Who?
          
                                  KYLIE
                    Mrs. Grant's husband.
          
          Starla stares at her.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    But not always. I was -- He was...
                    other stuff too.
          
                                  STARLA
                    What other stuff?
          
          Kylie kind of points at the sky.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    He's a fucking Martian?!
          
                                  BILL
                    A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
          
          Kylie tries to think.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    For real it looks like a needle.
                    Its real face. But it always gots
                    another.
                                  (MORE)
          
                                                               78.
          
                                  KYLIE (CONT'D)
                    He goes from place to place,
                    worlds... planets... killing 'em.
                    He takes over half of what's alive
                    and eats the other half. Till
                    they're gone.
          
          They stare at her, freaked out.
          
                                     KYLIE
                    Now he's here.     He went in Mr.
                    Grant.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Through a wound on his stomach?
          
          Kylie nods.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    He took him over. His body. His --
                    his brain, everything what he knew.
                    He's only been dumb stuff before -
                    amoeba-things, and rhino-things.
                    He liked being human. Didn't want
                    to change.
          
                                  STARLA
                    And you said the worms are part of
                    him. They're all linked, like one
                    creature?
          
                                  KYLIE
                    When one sees you they all see
                    you.
          
                                  STARLA
                    An animal that doesn't procreate.
                    It spreads, grows. A living
                    disease.
          
                                   BILL
                          (to Kylie)
                    So the way to stop this thing is
                    to stop Grant?
          
          Kylie shrugs.   The police car starts CHUGGING.
          
                                     BILL
                    Shit.
          
          The car slows, and comes to a stop.
          
          
          EXT. ROAD TOWARD WHEELSY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill, Starla, Kylie, and Trevor step slowly out of the
          car. They look around the deserted road.
          
                                                                79.
          
          The wide-open night is shrouded in darkness. Quiet.
          They can see the lights of Wheelsy down the road in front
          of them.
          
          Bill speaks into the radio again, as he gets his leather
          satchel of weaponry out of the trunk. Trevor grabs ammo
          from the satchel to reload his pistol.
          
                                     BILL
                       Shelby, we broke down on 22, a
                       mile outside town. Come pick us
                       up.
          
                                     SHELBY (O.S.)
                       I got to leave my post.
          
                                      BILL
                       Do it.
          
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          The foursome walks down the road, toward the city.   Starla
          and Bill are in the lead.
          
                                      BILL
                       Hey, Starla.
          
          She looks at him.
          
                                     BILL
                       Was always curious why you...
                       married Grant in the first place...
                       Just never seemed outta love.
          
                                     STARLA
                       I know what people say, Bill.
                       I... Remember, back in high school
                       I worked at my father's gas station?
          
          Bill nods.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Grant used to get filled up every
                       day. I knew it was just to see
                       me. He was too old -- But he was
                       handsome. And he had that big ol'
                       Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
          
                                     BILL
                       Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess
                       I would have flirted with him too.
          
          Starla smiles, thinks.
          
                                                             80.
          
                                     STARLA
                       My father, he was -- he was real
                       close to evil. People didn't know.
                       Still don't. From the time I was
                       a toddler he'd beat the hell out
                       of me. I don't mean just like a
                       smack for smart-mouthing... he
                       took a real enjoyment in it. And
                       when I turned eleven or twelve,
                       things... well, they got worse.
          
          Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
          
                                     BILL
                       When you wanted to run away, I
                       called your dad.
          
                                     STARLA
                       That wasn't a good night, no.
          
                                     BILL
                       I'm sorry.
          
          Starla shrugs it off.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Anyway, Grant rolls in one day. I
                       fill his tank with like an eighth-
                       a-gallon as usual. And he notices
                       my lip's all swollen up, and starts
                       asking me how it happened. I don't
                       know why I chose then, why Grant --
                       I guess I saw an opportunity. And
                       I told him everything, first time
                       I told anyone. Grant was furious.
                       He picked up a tire iron, walked
                       straightaway into the garage, and
                       beat my father half to death. You
                       say it's not about love, Bill.
                       But that was the closest thing to
                       it I ever knew.
          
          Pause.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Grant asked me to marry him a few
                       weeks later. I felt... safe with
                       him.
          
          Bill nods.    Starla looks at him, smiles.
          
                                     STARLA
                       After all this shit tonight, I
                       know for sure now you regret not
                       running off with me to Hollywood!
          
                                                                 81.
          
                                    BILL
                    Hell, Starla.    I always regretted
                    that.
          
          Starla looks at him, moved.
          
          Trevor looks at Kylie, shivering and terrified.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Don't worry, kid. Pretty soon,
                    we'll be in town, everything'll be
                    fine.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELSY CITY LIMIT - NIGHT
          
          A slithering parasite squirms over a paint-chipped sign
          that reads "WELCOME TO WHEELSY, SOUTH CAROLINA, THE WHEELS
          OF THE FUTURE," featuring early-'sixties graphics of a
          utopian future.
          
          THE CAMERA MOVES DOWN to the road, where hundreds of
          slithering parasites squirm into the city. They divide
          off in thin lines heading toward the various homes.
          
          We MOVE UP TO a WINDOW on a SMALL HOUSE, through which we
          can see an OVERWEIGHT WOMAN in spasms with a slithering
          thing in her mouth.
          
          We PAN TO the WINDOW of the HOME NEXT DOOR, where we can
          see a FAMILY gathered around a CORPSE, feasting on his
          goopy flesh.
          
          
          EXT. ROAD TOWARD WHEELSY - NIGHT
          
                                    STARLA
                    What's that?
          
          Our foursome look up to see a Buick Century parked at a
          haphazard angle in the middle of the road. The driver's
          side door is open. The headlights are still on.
          
          They look at each other. Bill takes his flashlight off
          his belt and aims it in front of him. They all slowly
          approach the car, in the darkness.
          
          Bill aims his flashlight into the Buick.   The keys are
          still there, but no one's inside.
          
          Trevor looks at the grill of the car.   It's dented.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    They musta hit a deer. Probably
                    got out to see if it's okay.
          
          Bill and the others look around.
          
                                                                  82.
          
          Bill hears a LAPPING sound behind him.   He turns, aiming
          the flashlight downward.
          
          A DISEASED DEER is lapping a thick purple tongue on the
          wound of a dead man. The sick creature is mostly hairless
          and pink and covered in veins. Bulbous black eyes hang
          on the sides of its head like a goldfish's.
          
          The diseased deer glances up at Bill and GROWLS a low
          growl.
          
                                  BILL
                    Fuck me.
          
          The deer springs upward, bringing his hoofs into Bill's
          chest. Bill is knocked violently to the gravel, dropping
          his shotgun and satchel. The deer rears back and brings
          his hoofs down into Bill again. They CRACK Bill's head
          against the hard road.
          
          Kylie, Trevor, and Starla see diseased deer coming in at
          them from different directions. The deer SCREECH like
          dying rabbits.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Bambi-rats!
          
          Trevor aims his pistol at a DEER jumping toward him. He
          SHOOTS, misses. The deer knocks him down. The deer stomps
          his feet, rearing up and down on Trevor's ribs, almost
          like a little dance. The deer tears at Trevor's sleeve
          with decidedly carnivorous teeth, forcing him into letting
          go of his gun.
          
          Kylie SCREAMS. She dives into a small space beneath a
          rock overhang on the side of the road. She watches what's
          going on from there.
          
          Starla sees the Buick a few yards away. She glances beside
          her to see the largest diseased deer of all, a HORNED
          BUCK, careening toward her.
          
          She dashes toward the Buick as fast as she can.
          
          A TUMOROUS DOE leaps onto Bill, biting into his shoulder
          and tearing at his flesh, so now he has two deer on him.
          Bill is bleeding, dizzy, and disoriented, but he's able
          to turn, just a bit, to see the barrel of his shotgun
          above him. He tries to scoot himself back as he's being
          battered. He reaches up for the shotgun; but the tips of
          his fingers barely graze the muzzle.
          
          Starla arrives at the Buick, and starts to crawl into the
          front seat.
          
          But the horned buck is upon her.   He bites into Starla's
          ankle. She SCREAMS.
          
                                                                 83.
          
          He yanks back on her, half pulling her onto the road.
          But Starla grabs onto the steering wheel with all her
          might, and pulls against the horned buck's massive power.
          
          The deer on Trevor starts pulling him off, dragging him
          down the road as he HOLLERS.
          
          Kylie, underneath the rock overhang, watches Bill try to
          scoot himself back and reach for the shotgun. It's just
          a little too far away. She works up her nerve and slowly
          starts to crawl out toward him.
          
          As Starla is stretched between the horned buck pulling on
          her ankle, and her hand on the steering wheel, she's able
          to flip on her side and turn the keys in the ignition;
          the ENGINE STARTS. She reaches one hand down to the
          floorboard, pressing on the gas.
          
          The Buick lurches forward, wrenching her away from the
          horned buck's mouth.
          
          Bill reaches again for the barrel of his rifle. It's too
          far away. But then he sees Kylie, at the butt of the
          rifle. She reaches out and pushes it just a little, into
          Bill's hand. Bill grips the muzzle like a baseball bat,
          and swings it into the face of the deer jumping on him,
          knocking the beast back.
          
          The deer tries to stumble forward again, but its whole
          head and neck have been knocked askew. It topples over,
          dead.
          
          Bill flips the shotgun forward into his hands. He stuffs
          the muzzle into the tumorous doe biting into his leg.
          The deer looks at him. Blood is running down Bill's face
          and he looks half-crazed. Bill glances down and sees the
          telephone wire wrapped around her ankle.
          
          Bill pulls the trigger, destroying her.
          
          He stands, looking around for the deer with Trevor. It
          has dragged him a fair distance down the street. Bill
          SHOOTS once, missing it, and again, hitting it straight
          on.
          
          Kylie looks around to see more diseased deer running
          through the fields toward them.
          
          Starla pulls herself into the driver's seat and backs up
          alongside her friends. Throws open the passenger door.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Get in!
          
                                                                84.
          
          INT. BUICK CENTURY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill fumbles for the radio controls.
          
                                     BILL
                    Shelby!
          
          Trevor looks out the window, watching the deer fade away
          behind them.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving

                                     BILL

                                  BILL
                    Shelby! We need people out here
                    at Cosgrove and McCammon right
                    away!

          EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
          
          Shelby, sick and bloated, speaks into his radio, as he
          moves down the street with a hoard of the infected.
          
                                  SHELBY
                    Already on our way.
          
          
          BACK TO BUICK
          
          Kylie turns her head, and glances out the window.   And
          SCREAMS. Starla, Bill, and Trevor turn to see --
          
          An SUV barreling straight towards them.
          
          It SLAMS hard into the side of the Buick.
          
          And SMASHES the car back, across a short lot, and through
          the glass storefront of a flower store.
          
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
          The Buick and SUV are destroyed, amidst the ruins of this
          store. Shattered vases and flowers surround them. Glass
          fragments dangle from the window frame. Some fall and
          CLINK to the floor.
          
                                                                   85.
          
          Starla lifts her battered head from the wheel. She looks
          beside her to see Bill and Trevor, seemingly unconscious.
          
          She looks back at Kylie. The impact has killed her. Her
          neck is bent at an ungodly angle. Bone juts up out of
          her skin.
          
          Starla looks out her rear window and sees the SUV door
          open, and the DISEASED DRIVER stumble out. His body is
          battered and broken, but, still, he lumbers toward her.
          He tries to speak, but his jaw is broken, and only a MUMBLY
          MOAN comes out.
          
          Starla struggles to get out of the car. Eventually, she
          does, and she falls to the floor, amidst the broken glass
          from the shattered window, and the water all over the
          floor from the broken vases.
          
          She sees the moaning driver limping toward her.   He's
          still trying to speak, but he's unintelligible.
          
          The driver gets close, ready to grab her. Starla sees a
          metal bar. She grabs it. And SLAMS it into the diseased
          man's shin.
          
          He topples over.
          
          She crawls onto the fallen driver and brings the metal
          bar down into his head, again and again, SHOUTING and
          CRYING with fury.
          
          Starla looks down at the man, who is very dead.
          
          Starla looks up to see dozens of DISEASED TOWNSFOLK coming
          at her, from down the street, between buildings. They
          see Starla there.
          
                                  DISEASED TOWNSFOLK
                    Starrrrrlaaaaaa!!
          
          Bill and Trevor limp up behind Starla, pulling her toward
          a door on the back wall.
          
                                  BILL
                    Come on.
          
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill closes and locks the door behind them.
          
          
          EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
          The diseased townsfolk surround the little store on all
          sides. They SCREECH.
          
                                                                 86.
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT
          
                                  TREVOR
                    What the hell are we going to do?!
          
                                  BILL
                    Just block the doors, any way you
                    can.
          
          Bill grabs hammers and nails off a hardware bench.
          
          Trevor knocks things off shelves and yanks up the metal
          shelving.
          
          Starla looks doubtful of this whole activity.   But still,
          she helps.
          
          The storeroom has two doors.    They start nailing anything
          over them they can.
          
          Trevor sees some slithering parasites coming in through a
          crack in the upper corner of the room.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Goddamn snakes!!
          
          Trevor aims his pistol at the things and starts shooting
          wildly at them, BLASTING up the whole room.
          
          Bill and Starla see slithering parasites coming in from
          other cracks in the room as well. They also BLAST at
          them. Dust is all around; they can hardly see.
          
          Bill runs out of ammo. He grabs a hand-held Black and
          Decker electric circular saw and turns it on. He starts
          jamming it into the parasites, cutting them up, and putting
          big slices in the floor. They SQUEAK with pain.
          
          
          EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
          The diseased townsfolk WAIL and SLAP their hands on the
          walls, almost rhythmically, like some tribal ritual.
          Some push on the doors.
          
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT
          
          Bill hears something POP behind him. He turns to see a
          little hole in one of the doors. Three diseased fingers
          slip inside, trying to pull away more.
          
          Bill uses the circular saw to cut off the fingers.
          
          An arm pops through the door.    Bill slams the circular
          saw into that. Blood spurts.     Bone grinds.
          
                                                               87.
          
          A man's eye peeks through another crack. Bill jams the
          circular saw through the crack and into the man's face.
          
          
          EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
          The FACE-SAWED MAN backs away from the hole, clutching
          his bleeding eye.
          
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT
          
          Bill spots a wide piece of shelving falling off the door
          across from him. He runs over to the space, when the
          circular saw stops turning. Bill turns to see he's
          accidentally unplugged it.
          
          
          EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
          The diseased townsfolk have all gathered on one side of
          the building now, putting all their efforts into tearing
          down one door. Some have even climbed onto the roof above
          it, curling off the gutter and roofing overhead.
          
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT
          
          Bill grabs his leather satchel, and starts to reload his
          shotgun. Starla sees that the diseased townsfolk have
          almost torn down one of the doors.
          
                                  STARLA
                    This is stupid.
          
          Starla goes to the other door, and starts tearing away
          the planks they nailed there.
          
                                  BILL
                    What are you doing?!
          
                                  STARLA
                    We can't make it. Just get away,
                    when you get the chance.
          
                                   BILL
                    What?
          
                                  STARLA
                    He wants me, Bill! I'm going to
                    get him to take me to him! See if
                    you can follow me, and kill him!
          
                                   BILL
                    No, Starla!   No!
          
                                                                     88.
          
            Another full metal plate is pushed off the door. A
            DISEASED MAN'S face peeks through. Trevor swirls to see
            it. The Man GLEEKS, hitting Trevor on his chest. Trevor
            looks down, in shock.
          
            And the whole door and part of the wall bursts open. The
            Diseased pour inside and around Trevor, GLEEKING all over
            him, splattering his body with the burning liquid. Trevor
            starts to puff up, swelling, becoming soft. They grab
            him.
          
                                     BILL
                      Nooo!
          
            Bill grabs Trevor by the wrist, and tries to pull him
            away from them. But Trevor SCREAMS in agony; the liquid
            has made his flesh too soft. His entire body splits apart
            like wet tissue, his organs spilling out in front of them.
          
            Bill stares down in shock, still holding Trevor's arm.
          
            Starla has pulled away enough boards of the other door.
            She throws it open. None of the diseased are on this
            side of the building anymore. She moves outside.
          
          
            EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
            Bill follows her. Two DISEASED PEOPLE appear, SCREECHING
            and running toward them. Bill SHOOTS them both. And he
            makes a break for it, running as fast as he can across
            the street.
          
            He turns, expecting to see Starla right behind him. But
            she has stayed behind, staring quietly at the ground.
            Starla has tears in her eyes. She motions with her head
            for Bill to go. Bill is confused.
          
            The diseased townsfolk come up around Starla from the
            sides of the flower store, no one paying attention to
            Bill. They encircle her, slowly. Some SCREECH angrily
            at her. She's too disgusted or fearful to even look in
            their eyes. They BREATHE with SICK, RASPY breath.
          
                  DISEASED WOMAN                 DISEASED KID
          Starlaaaaaaa!                  Starlaaaa!
          
            And they WAIL, in a cacophony of simultaneous voices, all
            the deep angers, fears, frustrations, and jealousies they
            inherited from Grant Grant, such as:
          
                                    SMASHED-FACE MAN
                      You said for better or worse! You
                      lied!
          
                  NO LONGER PRETTY                BRENDA'S HUSBAND
          I gave you everything!         I.   Loved. You!
          
                                                                      89.
          
                  SHELBY                           FAT SICK GUY
          It's not just about lesson       I wanted you by my side,
          plans! Hank Wilcox wants         sugarplum. But I'm too
          your pussy!                      ugly now, huh!!?
          
                  MR. INAPPROPRIATE                WAITRESS
          Your daddy'd still be            You always thought I was a
          fucking your every hole          joke, ain't you?
          weren't it for me!!
          
                                    BRENDA'S HUSBAND
                      You like Pardy better'n me? That's
                      who you want to screw now?!
          
                                    STARLA
                      Grant... Please...
          
            They surround her. They touch her body, her ass, her
            breasts. Pull on her clothes. She trembles.
          
                                    STARLA
                      I'm sorry... I know I haven't
                      behaved how you -- how you want.
                      I know. Don't... hurt... me.
          
            Starla glances down to see a diseased dog licking her
            calf, tasting her.
          
                                    STARLA
                      We need... to... talk.
          
            A DISEASED MAN grabs the side of her neck and face.
          
                  DISEASED MAN                     BRENDA'S HUSBAND
          Then talk.                       Then talk.
          
                                    STARLA
                      Not here, though, okay? Not all
                      of you. I'm not used to -- I want
                      to talk to your face, Grant. Your
                      more real face. Your --
          
            The diseased townsfolk grab Starla, enveloping her, and
            start dragging her away.
          
            A few townsfolk remain behind.    They look around for Bill.
          
                                     SMASHED-FACE MAN
                      Pardy?!!   Where are you, Pardy!!
          
            But he's nowhere to be seen.    They SCREECH angrily.
          
          
            EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
          
            Bill runs as fast as he can across the street here -- the
            same direction the hoard took Starla, but down a block.
          
                                                                 90.
          
            EXT. SIDE OF MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
          
            Bill falls against the side of this building, hiding in a
            dark crevice. Down the way, he can see numerous dead
            bodies, and a WOMAN chased down and tackled by some
            infected townsfolk.
          
            Some diseased townsfolk wander by Bill, looking for him.
            Bill crouches down so he isn't seen.
          
                   DISEASED WOMAN               SHELBY
          Pardy.   Pardy. Pardy.        Come on out, Pardy.
          
                                     PASTOR
                       We've surrounded the town, you
                       prick! Ain't no way outta here!
          
            Bill waits for them to pass. When they're gone, Bill
            looks up toward the next street -- he can see the hoard
            moving Starla across that street.
          
            He makes sure no one's looking, and follows her.
          
          
            EXT. GRANT STREET - LATER
          
            One of the diseased pushes Starla too hard, and she falls
            to her hands and knees. They keep pushing her. She
            stumbles back to her feet and moves on. She's almost
            hyperventilating.
          
          
            EXT. GRANT HOME - MOMENTS LATER
          
            Here, the Diseased Townsfolk around Starla stop. She
            looks up to see that they've led her onto her own front
            yard. Starla gazes up at her home:
          
            The diseased have done a little remodeling. Part of the
            front wall has been torn away, replaced with some primitive
            thatched woodwork. The front doorway has also been
            partially destroyed. Because of the sloppy reconstruction,
            the roof is caved-in and sloping.
          
            Diseased people sit in meerkat-like poses on all sides of
            the Grants' home, watching out for trouble.
          
          
            EXT. HOUSE ACROSS FROM THE GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
            Bill, out of breath, arrives across the street. He can
            see Starla standing with the diseased. He hides behind
            some shrubs.
          
                                                                   91.
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
          The diseased push Starla up between them, violently, to
          the front door.
          
          Starla stops at the dark hole on the front of the house.
          It's pitch black inside. She looks back at the rotting
          faces behind her. And then slowly enters.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Starla balks at the smell. She looks beside her at the
          garage; the wall has been torn out, and this has become
          Grant's feeding area, with rotten meat, including some
          bodies, in a pile.
          
          Starla steps slowly forward, looking around.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Grant?
          
          Starla can see into the shambles of a kitchen from here.
          
          
          EXT. HOUSE ACROSS FROM THE GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
          Bill looks at the diseased surrounding the Grant home.
          They seem impossible to get through.
          
          Bill eyes the house next door, maybe twenty-five feet
          from the Grants'. He makes sure no one's paying attention
          for a moment, and he darts across the street to a parked
          car. The diseased don't see him. Bill gazes down the
          street beside him.
          
          The sun is just barely beginning to rise.   They don't
          have much time to move in the darkness.
          
          Bill makes a break for the house next door.
          
          
          INT. GRANT KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Starla walks into the kitchen. Cooking supplies and
          condiments are scattered over the floor. She spots a
          meat thermometer on the floor amongst other utensils.
          
          She glances out the rear window. Diseased people are
          guarding the backyard, looking away from the home.
          
          She grabs the meat thermometer. She snaps the thermometer
          part off the top, discards it, and shoves the long metal
          spike into the seam of her skirt.
          
                                                                  92.
          
          Suddenly, Starla hears EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD, the song
          she and Grant danced to earlier, starting to play through
          tinny speakers.
          
          Starla looks up through a missing section of ceiling; she
          can see a tiny piece of Grant in the bedroom above her.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Grant?   We should talk.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S BACKYARD - NIGHT
          
          Bill has made his way into the backyard. He looks over
          at the Grant home. Some diseased townsfolk in the backyard
          could conceivably see or hear him. He tries the back
          door, but it's locked.
          
          Bill notices a window slightly open.    He starts to push
          it up. It SQUEAKS LOUDLY.
          
          He peers over at the diseased. They don't hear. He throws
          the window up further, and crawls inside the home.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Starla stands at the base of the stairwell.    The SONG is
          louder.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Grant?
          
          She starts to ascend the stairs.     They CREAK beneath her
          feet.
          
          
          INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Bill peeks out the window, careful not to be seen by the
          diseased humans around Grant's. Bill can see Starla in
          the home next door, walking up the stairs.
          
          Bill runs toward the stairwell here.
          
          
          INT. GRANT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Starla looks down the hall.    Most of the walls have been
          torn away.
          
          Between wooden beams, Starla can see Grant's cumbersome
          mass, his back to her, in what was once the bedroom.
          
          In front of him, the SONG ENDS on the CD player. It starts
          into the NEXT SONG on the album. Grant uses one of his
          crusty tentacles to push the back button.
          
                                                                  93.
          
          EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD starts over.
          
          Starla walks toward him.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Grant keeps his back to her. Starla takes in the room.
          Photographs from their scrapbooks are all over the walls:
          photos from their wedding, and vacations, and family
          parties.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Hey, Grant.
          
          Starla walks around Grant, giving him a decent berth.
          
                                  STARLA
                    You did some real interesting
                    decorating here.
          
          Grant watches her from the corner of his sad, purulent
          eye.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Hey.
          
          Starla walks by a window.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Look, the sun's starting to come
                    up.
          
          Starla starts to open the drapes.
          
          
          INT. NEIGHBOR'S UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
          
          Bill happens to look through the neighbors' kid's bedroom
          and to the home across the way where Starla is pulling
          the drapes away from the window. She sees Bill there.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Grant SCREECHES angrily at Starla. She quickly closes
          the drapes, not letting on she saw Bill.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Sorry. I didn't -- I didn't know
                    you wanted it dark.
          
          
          INT. KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bill walks into this young boy's bedroom, filled with
          airplanes and sports memorabilia.
          
                                                                   94.
          
          He peeks around the window frame at the Grant bedroom
          window, now closed to him. He makes sure his shotgun is
          loaded.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla tries to change the subject by walking to a wall
          with the photos.
          
                                  STARLA
                    You like these memories, huh, Grant?
          
          Grant looks away from her.   Starla moves toward him, almost
          seductively.
          
                                  STARLA
                    You like being called Grant, don't
                    you?
          
          Grant is silent.   She gets closer.
          
                                   STARLA
                    I think you do. You really do.
                    You like being Grant. Like when
                    we danced. And when you... made
                    love to me here on the bed.
                    Remember that?
          
          Grant looks embarrassed.   Starla becomes more brazen.
          
                                  STARLA
                    I know you've been alone, Grant.
                    Almost forever. From here to there
                    to there to here, there's never
                    been another one for you.
          
          Starla almost looks as if she's about to cry, out of
          compassion for him.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Grant. Grant, I could help you.
                    Be with you the way you want.
                    See, I want to live. I've never
                    had much use for this world, not
                    really. You and I, together, we --
          
          She touches his tentacle with her fingers.   He moves it
          back, and GROWLS a little.
          
          Starla moves her trembling fingers toward him again. She
          sets them on his tentacle once more. He glares at her
          distrustfully, breathing his deep, sick breath.
          
                                  STARLA
                    You don't trust me, I know. That's
                    why I brought you someone, Grant.
          
                                                                   95.
          
          Starla looks into his eyes.
          
                                 STARLA
                    It's Bill. He's in the house next
                    door. Just look.
          
          
          INT. KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bill glances down to see a diseased man looking up at
          him. In fact, they're all looking up at him. Bill is
          confused.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Grant looks at Starla with sad eyes, perhaps touched.
          Starla smiles nervously, expectantly.
          
                                  STARLA
                    See? I brought him here for you!
                    As an offering! To prove I love
                    you more than him!
          
          Grant wraps his tentacle around Starla. Starla, though
          obviously disgusted, touches his face with her hand.
          
          
          INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          The diseased townsfolk break down the door, moving into
          the downstairs below Bill.
          
          
          INT. KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bill hears them approaching. He SHATTERS the window, and
          crawls onto a small mock-balcony outside.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla moves slowly in toward Grant, as if to kiss him.
          Grant looks, well, joyful.
          
          And then she yanks the metal spike from her skirt and
          JABS it into Grant's eye.
          
          Grant SCREECHES, blind and bucking.   Starla SLAMS the
          spike into his other eye.
          
          And she STABS him again, shoving the spike into his
          forehead, where it stays.
          
          Starla leaps to the window.   She throws open the drapes.
          
                                                               96.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Now, Bill!!   Kill the motherfucker!!
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S MOCK BALCONY - NIGHT
          
          Bill raises his shotgun and BLASTS as Starla jumps away
          from the window.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          The WINDOW SHATTERS and the shot strikes Grant. He
          SCREECHES, swinging his tentacles aimlessly around the
          room in fury.
          
          One tentacle SLAMS Starla against the wall, probably
          breaking a rib or two. Another tentacle SMASHES the CD
          player, squelching the song.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S MOCK BALCONY - NIGHT
          
          The diseased townsfolk enter the kid's bedroom, rushing
          toward Bill on the balcony. But Bill won't stop. He
          BLASTS the shotgun again.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Grant is struck in the head. He starts slithering out of
          the bedroom, feeling his way out.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S MOCK BALCONY - NIGHT
          
          Bill is out of shells. He drops his shotgun. He grabs
          the grenade out of the pocket on the black leather bag.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla, clutching her ribs and barely able to move, pulls
          herself up on the window.
          
          Bill tosses her the grenade. She tries to catch it, but
          misses it. It lands on the carpet. She see Grant's
          tentacles slipping away. She tries to move but she's
          hurt bad, bleeding.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S MOCK BALCONY - NIGHT
          
          The diseased GLEEK at Bill, but Bill throws himself
          forward, letting himself fall through the flimsy balustrade --
          
                                                                  97.
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
          Bill lands hard on the lawn between the two homes. He
          grabs a .38, and stands beside the window on Grant's house.
          
          Through the window he sees Grant barreling down the stairs.
          
          Bill SHOOTS Grant with the .38, SHATTERING the glass.
          
          He UNLOADS the clip into him.
          
          The diseased townsfolk surround Bill, grabbing him. Grant,
          using the others' eyes to see, snaps his tentacle forward,
          wrapping it around Bill's neck, raising him up. Grant
          SCREECHES.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Starla appears at the top of the stairs, clutching her
          bloody side. She has the pin in one hand and the grenade
          in the other.
          
          With all her remaining effort, she lobs the grenade behind
          Grant.
          
                                     GRANT
                    Er...?
          
          It EXPLODES.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
          Grant's exploding flesh sends Bill flying backwards.
          
          
          INT. GRANT HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Starla is thrown back.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
          Around the house, the diseased's eyes gaze lifelessly
          upward as they each plummet to the grass.
          
                                                            FADE TO:
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - MORNING
          
          Bill unwraps what's left of the tentacle from his bruised
          neck, and looks around at the dead diseased. Grant's
          splattered flesh is around him.
          
                                                               98.
          
          Bill hears a quiet RATTLING sound. He looks around him.
          And then sees, down at his feet, what is actually a
          distorted piece of Grant's cerebellum. Sticking out of a
          new organic slit in the cerebellum is the quill-like spore.
          It quivers and trembles upward, its little bulbed spurs
          popping out.
          
          
          INT. GRANT HALLWAY - MORNING
          
          Starla crawls forward to look down through the smoke:
          most of the second floor has been blown away. Her mutated
          husband is just a mass of flesh and alien organs.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla comes around the side of the house, holding a paper
          towel roll to the slice on her ribs. She sees Bill
          standing there. She smiles.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Hey.
          
          Bill smiles too.
          
                                   BILL
                    Hey.
          
          
          EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          Bill and Starla hobble down the town center. The leather
          bag is slung over Bill's shoulder. Everything around
          them is dead: the victims who were being feasted on, as
          well as the various diseased. The torture is over, but
          no life remains.
          
          
          EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill finds an abandoned Nissan Maxima in the middle of
          the street, with the keys still in it.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla, over here.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELSY EXIT - LATER
          
          In the Maxima now, Bill and Starla pull around a toppled
          ambulance and through a spouting fire hydrant, and out

          EXT. ROAD BEYOND WHEELSY - DAY
          
          The sun is bright and beautiful, glistening on the car.
          Bill and Starla breathe more easily and smile a little as
          they head up this long, barren road outside the city.
          
          
          EXT. CLUSTER OF STORES - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill and Starla pass through a small block of stores.
          
          Starla gazes out the window to see people -- real, actual,
          HEALTHY HUMAN BEINGS: men and women and children -- going
          about their daily chores. Tears come to her eyes.
          
          Bill grabs Starla's hand.   She clenches his tightly.
          
                                  STARLA
                    We can probably get some first aid
                    and food at this gas station up
                    here.
          
                                    BILL
                    Yeah.   Good.
          
          
          EXT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The Maxima pulls into the station, and stops.
          
          
          INT. GAS STATION MART - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla and Bill pile stuff up on the cashier's counter --
          Band-Aids, gauze, alcohol; Power Bars and Gatorade. The
          CASHIER rings it up, staring at them because of their
          wounds.
          
                                  CASHIER
                    Comes to 32.87.
          
          Bill pulls money out of his pants pocket. As he does,
          Starla glances down. His arm pulls up his shirt, and
          Starla can see the black and yellow wound there on his
          stomach. She turns away, looking around, confused.
          
          Bill pays, smiles at the cashier.
          
                                    BILL
                    There you go.
          
          
          EXT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER
          
          A stunned Starla steps with Bill out of the station, moving
          toward the car.
          
                                                                100.
          
          Starla stops.
          
                                 STARLA
                    Shit. I- I forgot... I wanted to
                    get aspirin.
          
          She starts to move back inside.     Bill stops her.
          
                                  BILL
                    I'll get it for you.      Ibuprofen or
                    aspirin?
          
                                     STARLA
                    Aspirin.
          
          Bill smiles, and goes back inside. Starla moves quickly
          with the bag of stuff toward the car.
          
          
          INT. GAS STATION MART - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill pays for the aspirin, and walks out with it.
          
          
          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
          
          Bill walks out; the Maxima is still there.
          
          
          INT. MAXIMA - DAY
          
          Bill gets in the driver's seat, puts his keys into the
          engine.
          
                                  BILL
                    We'll just head up here into
                    Bishopville, get checked up in the
                    hospital. Then maybe we'll head
                    off to Hollywood after all, huh?
          
                                     STARLA
                    Okay.
          
          Bill turns to smile at Starla. She's aiming the .38 at
          his face. Tears are streaming down her cheeks.
          
                                  BILL
                    Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my
                    best not to hurt anybody --
          
                                     STARLA
                    You took Bill.
          
                                  BILL
                    It's my nature.
          
                                                                101.
          
                                  STARLA
                    And this is mine.
          
          Starla pulls the trigger, the GUNSHOT CRACKS OUT.
          
          
          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
          
          As the Maxima sits in the lot, ANOTHER GUNSHOT CRACKS
          OUT. Then we hear the HORN BLARING.
          
          
          INT. MAXIMA - DAY
          
          Bill's dead body is slumped over the steering wheel.
          Starla really can't bring herself to look at it, as she
          reaches across it and toward the door handle.
          
          
          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
          
          The car door flips open.    The horn stops blaring.
          
          And Bill's body is kicked out of the car, sliding onto
          the pavement.

          Starla WIPES the tears away from her face. She glances
          out the window to see the cashier peeking out of the
          cashier's station.
          
          Starla scoots over into the driver's seat.    She shoves
          the car into drive.
          
          And she takes off down the road, not looking back.
          
          Starla's blanched and numb but the tears still keep coming.

          Sometimes within the brain's old
          ghostly house,
          I hear, far off, at some forgotten
          door,
          A music and an eerie faint carouse
          And stir of echoes down the
          creaking floor.

          In the black, a child HUMS. Gentle WATER sounds.

          FADE IN:

          INT A BATHROOM NIGHT
          JAKE, a four year old boy, sits in a bathtub. The door to thi
          bathroom is open and his mother is visible in the background,
          walking back and forth in the bedroom, getting dressed to go
          out. The STEREO is blaring in the bedroom, the music echoes
          off the tile in the tiny bathroom.
          Jake is playing with a plastic airplane. He answers a
          question.

          JAKE

          YES

          (PAUSE)
          Sometimes.

          (PAUSE)
          With my toys.
          He looks up, but we're close in on him and can't see who he's
          looking at.
          JAKE (cont'd)
          My... blue sword. No! The one with
          the gray tape around the middle. That
          one.
          He lands the airplane on the water. He giggles.
          JAKE (coast' d)
          That's silly.
          MAGGIE (o.s.)
          (from the bedroom)
          Jake? You all right in there?

          JAKE
          (calling out to the door)

          YES!
          The airplane takes off again. Jake lowers his voice to a
          whisper.
          JAKE (cont'd)
          What?

          (PAUSE)
          My daddy, but he doesn't know about it
          yet.
          He brings the airplane in for a careful water landing and lets
          go of it. He looks up.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          2. 

          CONTINUED:
          JAKE (cont' d)
          Can I ask you a question?
          He pauses, looks to the door to make sure his mother isn't too
          close. Moving back now, we see that Jake is all alone in the
          bathroom, staring at the empty bathtub across from him.
          JAKE (cont'd)
          Does it hurt to be dead?

          UNDER THE WATER,
          the toy airplane sinks and crash lands on the bottom of the
          tub.

          IN THE BATHROOM,
          MAGGIE WITZKY, twenty-six or seven, Jake's mom, city girl
          knows how to take care of herself, pokes her head in the
          doorway, buttoning up her blouse.

          MAGGIE
          Who you talkin' to, Jake?
          He turns to her and whispers.

          JAKE
          It's a secret.

          CUT TO:

          INT JAKE'S ROOM NIGHT
          TOM WITZKY, Maggie's age, lean and muscled like somebody who
          works for a living, lies on Jake's bed next to his son,
          reading him a story. Jake is nearly asleep.

          TOM
          Well, I was walking in the night, and
          I saw nothing scary. For I have never
          been afraid of anything. Not very. I
          was deep within the woods when,
          suddenly, I spied them. I saw a pair
          of pale green pants with nobody inside
          them! I wasn't scared. But, yet, I
          stopped. What could those pants be
          there for? What could a pair of pants
          at night be standing in the air for?
          Maggie leans in the doorway and whispers.

          MAGGIE
          Is he asleep? My brother's here.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          3. 

          CONTINUED:
          Tom looks at Jake, who is asleep. Tom closes the book, turns
          off the light, and covers his son. He kisses him on the
          forehead. Tom goes to a dresser and turns on the baby monitor
          (the transmitter). Its red light glows.
          After Tom leaves, Jake opens his eyes and stares.

          CUT TO:

          EXT STREET DAY
          The Chicago skyline looms over the street they live on. Not
          the suburbs, but not quite downtown either. Racially mixed.
          Two story brick houses jammed side by side, barely room for a
          raised voice across the narrow driveways. Bar on the corner,
          neon sign -- "BERNIE'S TAP." A HOMELESS GUY rants his way
          down the opposite sidewalk.
          Tom, Maggie, and PHILIP, early twenties, come out of the house
          and head down the steps. Tom carries the baby monitor (the
          receiver) in one hand. Jake's breathing is clearly audible on
          the speaker.
          Tom's on the sidewalk. Maggie, still three steps up, stops
          and puts her arms wide. Tom turns around and Maggie lets
          herself go, falling straight forward. Tom catches her on his
          back and carries her piggy-back. She leans around and bites
          his ear.

          PHILIP
          What are the odds of a single woman
          being at this thing?

          TOM
          `Bout a million to one.

          PHILIP
          Any hot mommies?

          TOM
          Depends. How big you like `em?
          The hot engine of a Yellow Trans-Am fires up in the driveway
          of the house across the street. It backs into the street, its
          passenger door hanging open. The DRIVER honks the horn and a
          SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD KID runs out of another house and jumps
          into the moving vehicle. They take off. The Homeless Guy
          berates them, shaking his fist.
          They reach the steps of the house next door. PARTY NOISE
          comes from within, shadows move in the windows. Tom swings
          Maggie around, puts her on the step, wraps his arms around
          her, and kisses her. Great kiss. It goes on.

          CONTINUED:

          PHILIP
          Excuse me, hello, I enjoy soft-core as
          much as the next guy, but this is
          almost like incest for me.

          MAGGIE
          (still kissing Tom)
          Should we tell him?

          TOM
          Sure.

          MAGGIE
          I'm pregnant.

          PHILIP
          Get the fuck outta here!
          He grabs Maggie and hugs her. Tom starts up the steps.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          Look at this, I haven't even had a
          second date in a year and a half, you
          guys are on your second kid!
          Philip catches up to Tom and throws his arms around him.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          You big huggable bear. You're still
          goin' back to school, though, right?
          You promised me.

          TOM
          I don't know, I just found out about
          this.

          PHILIP
          I'm telling you, if you never go back
          to college you'll regret it for the
          rest of your life. The memories I
          have of being a freshman -- those were
          three of the happiest years of my
          life.

          INT BOBBY & VANESSA'S - LIVING ROOM NIGHT
          TWENTY OR THIRTY PEOPLE are crowded into a living room. It's
          loud, smoky, there's music and a ton of booze -- empty beer
          bottles, five gallon jugs of wine, big liter bottles of vodka
          and gin.

          The men are mostly on one side, women on the other. As Maggie
          heads toward the women, Tom grabs her arm and pulls her back
          close.

          TOM
          Seven years, and I've still never been
          to a party where you weren't the one I
          wanted to hang with.
          She smiles, melted, and they part. Tom joins the men. BOBBY,
          Vanessa's husband, an athletic-looking guy holding a sleeping
          three-year-old on his shoulder, talks with FRANK McCARTHY,
          fortyish, big Irish drinker, and HARRY DAMON, who is also
          older than the rest.

          FRANK
          Tom-Tom-Tommy, how are ya?
          He shoves a beer into Tom's hand.

          TOM
          Alive on the planet.

          the floors, Harry.

          That's it, take the medicine deep into
          your body. Good, good.

          HARRY
          So how you likin' the neighborhood?

          TOM
          Well, I grew up about a mile from
          here, it ain't like a foreign country.

          FRANK
          The hell it isn't! This is the best
          God damn neighborhood in Chicago,
          `cause we look out for each other, and
          that's sayin' a lot as we approach the
          Year of our Lord two thousand.

          Everybody GROANS.

          FRANK
          (to Bobby)
          What is Lenny doing here? Did you
          tell him you were having a party?!

          BOBBY
          Vanessa made me.

          LENNY
          Yeah, laugh it up, laugh it up, and
          when you all wake up dead with your
          throats cut some night --

          FRANK
          I mean, I could see if he just heard
          the noise and wandered in, but to
          actually invite him into your home.. .

          LENNY
          -- don't come cryin' to me!

          ACROSS THE ROOM,
          Philip surveys the selection of females. He sees VANESSA,
          late twenties, hasn't lost the weight from the last baby yet --

          PHILIP
          Not attracted to...
          -- SHEILA, a thin, nervous woman around Frank's age --
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          Not drunk enough for...
          -- and a LOUD WOMAN with enormous hair.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          Frightened by...

          LATER,
          everyone has eaten, some have left, the ones that remain are
          bombed. A DRUNK COUPLE dances dirty. Frank stares long and
          hard at someone's cleavage.

          7. 

          CONTINUED:
          Sheila, the nervous woman, stares at Frank, pissed off. He
          looks at her, gives her a "What?" gesture. Must be married to
          each other.
          Tom, on the other side of the room, hears a SHRIEK of women's
          voice: and turns. He sees Maggie blushing, receiving hugs and
          congrLtulations from the two or three women around her.

          IN THE :ITCHEN,
          Vanessa talks to Maggie while she mixes up a blender of
          Margaritas. The room is jammed with people.

          VANESSA
          How did you and Tom meet?

          MAGGIE
          He saved my life.

          VANESSA
          No, really.

          MAGGIE
          I'm serious. The summer I was
          nineteen, I was at Jones Beach, I swam
          out too far and got a cramp in my leg.
          There was no way I was gonna make it
          back. I was goin' down, I was
          swallowing water and everything. Tom
          was a lifeguard. I don't know what he
          was doing out that far, he said he
          just had a feeling.

          VANESSA
          Oh my God, did you have sex with him
          like, that night?

          MAGGIE
          Had to. He said I'm his slave until I
          saved him back.

          VANESSA
          That's so romantic. Bobby and I met
          when I peed in the guys' john at a Bon
          Jovi concert.
          She hits "puree" on the blender.

          STILL LATER,
          the party's down to the hard-core half dozen, who are passing
          a joint. Tom sits on the couch, feet on the coffee table next
          to their baby monitor. Maggie is next to him, Frank and
          Sheila are jammed in there too.

          CONTINUED:
          Bobby and Vanessa sit on the floor opposite. Philip is in a
          chair at the end.

          VANESSA
          P(ople who say they were hypnotized
          weren't really, they were just, you
          kn)w, playing along.

          PHILIP
          Then how could they have needles stuck
          into their throats without bleeding?
          Without even making a sound?

          FRANK
          Bullshit.

          VANESSA
          You never saw that happen.

          PHILIP
          Uh, hello, I had a two inch needle
          stuck right into the thick of my arm,
          by my professor, while I was under
          hypnosis.

          FRANK
          Bullshit!

          VANESSA
          You're making it up!

          BOBBY
          That's disgusting!

          MAGGIE
          I saw his arm the next day. It left a
          mark.

          FRANK
          Bullshit!

          SHEILA
          Can you learn another word?

          FRANK
          Prove it.

          VANESSA
          Yeah, let's see.

          FRANK
          Hypnotize somebody. Hypnotize
          Vanessa.

          VANESSA
          Oh, no. Uh uh.

          PHILIP
          Why not?

          VANESSA
          Because, I .night make a fool out of
          myself! I n. ;.ght, I don't know, expose
          myself or sowething.
          She clutches her arms around her breasts as she says that.
          You get the feeling she'd like to expose herself.

          PHILIP
          I thought you didn't believe in it.

          VANESSA
          I don't, but -- do Maggie.

          MAGGIE
          Yeah, right.

          FRANK
          You do it, Sheila. We promise not to
          make you do a strip tease on the
          kitchen table.
          Sheila glares at him. They must be fun to hang out with.

          VANESSA
          That's what I'd do! That's exactly
          the kind of thing I'm afraid I'd do!

          MAGGIE
          Hey Frank, you're the one who's so
          curious, why don't you-

          FRANK
          No.

          MAGGIE
          Ah, that's different. Whaddya got to
          hide?

          FRANK
          No fuckin' way, I ain't gonna do it.
          Tom sits forward.

          TOM
          What the hell? I'll try anything
          once.

          

          

          

          

          A MOMENT LATER,
          a hand switches off the lamp on the table.
          Another hand turns off the lamp in the corner.
          The music is turned off.
          Tom sits in the armchair in the n3arly-darkened room. Philip
          shoves the coffee table back and sits on it, directly in front
          of him. The others crowd around expectantly, silent.

          PHILIP
          No sound.from anyone, please. Any
          distraction can break it up.
          He raises his index finger and holds it about a foot in front
          of Tom's face.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          Okay. Look at it.

          TOM
          Damn fine lookin' finger.
          Laughter.

          PHILIP

          (AUTHORITATIVE)
          Be quiet.
          (they do)
          Look at it. Keep looking at it.
          Don't look at anything else, just my
          finger.

          TOM
          Can you clean out the nail, it's kinda
          makin' me sick here.
          Philip raises two fingers and jabs Tom in the eyes.
          TOM (cont' d)
          Hey, what the fuck?

          PHILIP
          Shall we try this again?

          TOM
          (rubbing his eyes)
          Asshole.

          PHILIP
          Look at me, Tom. You're not afraid of
          this. You want this to happen. Don't
          you?

          TOM
          Poke me again you son of a batch and
          I'll clock you, I swear to Go'..

          MAGGIE
          Philip, have you ever done this
          before?

          PHILIP
          Maggie, please, I nearly have a
          master's degree in cognitive psy-

          MAGGIE
          Have you ever done it before?

          PHILIP
          Well, I've seen it done a dozen times.

          MAGGIE
          Try not to screw him up permanently.

          PHILIP
          (to Tom)
          You want to be hypnotized. Say yes.

          TOM
          Yeah.

          PHILIP
          "I want to be hypnotized."

          TOM
          I want to be fuckin' hypnotized,
          already.

          PHILIP
          Okay. Close your eyes.
          As Tom does, our eyes close too, big heavy lashes dropping
          over everything and plunging us into blackness.
          PHILIP (o.s.)
          Just listen for a moment.

          

          

          

          

          12. 

          IN THE BLACK,
          we can still hear the sounds of the living room. Tom
          breathes. Ice CLINKS in a glass as someone drinks. A car
          HUMS by outside.
          PHILIP (o.s.)
          Now look at the backs of your eyelids.
          Do you see anything there?
          TOM (o.s.)
          Uh...
          Out of the pitch black, we can detect tiny images.
          TOM (o.s.)
          Some colors... something floating...
          up.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          Focus on it.
          A small squiggly line comes into focus, drifting up through
          the black, then bouncing suddenly downward.
          PHILIP (o.s.)
          Now... I want you to pretend you're in
          a theatre.

          INT THEATRE NIGHT
          We're sitting in a theatre, a bare stage at the front.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          A movie theatre.

          INT MOVIE THEATRE NIGHT
          Okay, we're sitting in a movie theatre. It's crowded with
          people, waiting for the movie to start.
          PHILIP (o.s.)
          You're the only one there.
          The people disappear. The theatre is empty.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          You're sitting near the front.
          We pop up ten rows closer to the screen.

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          The walls of the theatre are black,
          covered with black velvet.
          SHOOOP! Black velvet descends over the walls.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          The seats are covered with black
          velvet.
          Black velvet crawls over the seats.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          There is no light in the theatre.
          The lights click off.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          In the whole pitch-black theatre,
          there's only one thing you can see.
          The white screen. You drift toward
          it, in your chair.
          Up ahead of us, the screen is a dazzling white. We move
          slowly toward it, floating over the seats.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          There are letters up on the screen.
          Tall, thick, black letters, but
          they're out of focus. You drift
          closer to them, trying to read them.
          Blurry black letters appear on the screen. We drift closer.
          PHILIP (o. s . )
          You're comfortable in your black
          velvet seat, very comfortable. You
          just sit there, looking at the screen,
          drifting closer in your chair, staring
          at those letters on the screen.
          You're relaxing. Your feet and ankles
          are relaxed. Your legs are relaxed.
          Your hands are limp and heavy. Your
          arms are relaxed. Your face. The
          letters come into focus, you're close
          enough now, you can read them.
          The letters are right in front of us now, but still blurry.
           PHILIP (o . s . )
          The letters spell --

          CONTINUED: (2)
          The moment he speaks the word, five giant black letters come
          into focus on the white screen, filling our entire field of
          vision.
          PHILIP (o . s . )

          SLEEP.
          We stare at that word for a moment --
          -- and then everything goes black. No sound, no image, no
          nothing. And then...

          INT BOBBY & VANESSA'S LIVING ROOM NIGHT
          Six faces stare right at us from up close. Tom is in the
          chair, eyes open, looking disoriented.

          TOM
          Didn't work, huh?
          All six faces burst out laughing, a great nervous tension
          released. Somebody turns the lights back on, somebody else
          hits the music.
          TOM (cont' d)
          What?
          More laughter. Philip seems very pleased with himself.
          Maggie comes and sits on the arm of the chair next to Tom,
          puts her hand on his face.

          MAGGIE
          Are you okay?

          TOM
          Did somethin' happen?
          People start talking, all at once.

          VANESSA
          You were faking it. You had to be
          faking it.

          TOM
          What are you talking about?

          FRANK
          That was the weirdest thing I've ever
          seen in my whole fuckin' life.

          PHILIP
          How do you feel?

          How am I supposed to feel?

          PHILIP
          A little.., hot, maybe?
          EveryboJy laughs again. Tom wipes his forehead. He's covered
          with sweat. He gets up. He doesn't like this at all, being
          the only one not in on the joke.

          TOM
          What'd you do to me?

          PHILIP
          Nothing much. Just had you stretched
          out as stiff as a board between those
          two chairs --
          He points to two dining room chairs that are sitting back to
          back four or five feet apart.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          (lighting a lighter)
          -- and ran this back and forth under
          your legs.
          Tom feels the backs of his legs. He looks at Maggie.

          TOM
          That happened?

          MAGGIE
          You said it didn't hurt at all. And
          he kept it moving.

          TOM
          Hey, thanks a lot, it was very nice of
          you not to burn my flesh.

          FRANK
          Joey Ariola woulda burned it.
          They laugh again. Tom looks at him, stunned.

          TOM
          Who?

          FRANK
          The kid who beat you up all the time
          when you were twelve. You told us all
          about him. You were cryin' and
          everything.

          Don't.

          FRANK
          Not time yet.

          TOM
          What?

          (INNOCENTLY)
          Huh?

          Not time for what?

          Tom, you didn't do anything
          embarrassing or anything.

          TOM
          Aright, somebody else go. Come on,
          let's go, somebody else, right now.

          PHILIP
          Tom, look --

          TOM
          Nobody? Well, then I guess the
          party's over, ain't it?
          (to Maggie)
          Let's go. Come on, let's go home.

          PHILIP
          You're getting a little too worked up
          about this.

          TOM
          You know, I don't think so, because
          I'll tell you something, it's a very
          nasty feeling to know somebody's been
          fuckin' around in your head for
          everybody else's amusement, you know?
          (lightening up a bit)
          I mean, Joey Ariola, Christ, I haven't
          thought about him in maybe ten years,

          On the mantle over the fireplace, a clock CHIMES. Everyone is
          immediately silent, staring at Tom. He looks at the clock.
          It's eleven.
          He lifts his foot, pulls off his shoe --
          -- and throws it out the window.
          There is an explosion of laughter.

          PHILIP
          Why'd you do that, Tom?

          TOM
          I... have no idea.
          Even more laughter, now everybody's slapping him on the back.
          Tom nods, "yeah, yeah, laugh it up."

          PHILIP
          I couldn't resist.
          Tom cranks an arm around Philip's neck and pulls him down,
          choking him. But it's playful, his sense of humor returning.

          TOM
          Any other surprises you left in my
          head, you fuckin' dead man, you?

          CUT TO:

          INT TOM & MAGGIE'S HOUSE NIGHT
          It's dark. Tom and Maggie lie in bed, awake.

          MAGGIE
          I hope it's a girl, I can't help it.
          Six brothers, I mean, give me a break.
          I'm sick of all these balls around the
          house.
          He doesn't laugh. She rolls over, strokes his chest with one
          hand.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          What's the matter?

          TOM
          Two kids. I'm only twenty-six. How
          did this happen?
          She slides one hand down, under the covers.

          CONTINUED:

          MAGGIE
          (imitating him)
          "Please, baby, please baby, just this
          one time, I can't feel anything with
          one of those on."

          TOM
          No, I now how it happened, I'm just
          sayin'... You're gonna have to stop
          work, at least for a while. I'll be
          workin' Saturdays for at least another
          year, maybe two.

          MAGGIE
          You don't have to. We'll get by, we
          always do.
          Tom stares at a dark brown water stain on the ceiling.

          TOM
          How many times I gotta ask Harry to
          fix that? He said he fixed this place
          up, so how come the roof leaks every
          time it rains?

          MAGGIE
          Relax.
          Her hand is moving. He twists.

          TOM
          Maggie, you don't think, I mean, ten,
          twelve years from now... I don't want
          you to think I'm gonna be a line man
          forever, you know, like Frank or
          somethin'.

          MAGGIE
          It's a good job. You know how many
          guys would kill for your job?

          TOM
          I'm smarter than that, I know I am.

          MAGGIE
          (kisses his ear)
          Relax.
          She's making it hard for him to concentrate.

          CONTINUED: (2)

          TOM
          I'm smarter than Philip, Christ, six
          years in college, he's still got his
          head up his ass. I just want you to
          know, this ain't where I plan to stop.
          She licks his ear. He closes his eyes.
          TOM (cont' d)
          All my life, I feel like there's
          something better inside me, it's
          trying like hell to get out and it's
          like x won't let it.
          She rolls on top of him and whispers.

          MAGGIE
          Let me help.

          LATER,
          the clock reads 2:31 a.m. Maggie is asleep, Tom is lying on
          his back, still awake.
          He looks over at the clock, agitated. He stares up at the
          ceiling. He closes his eyes.

          A BARRAGE OF IMAGES
          races across the back of his eyelids:
          -- Philip's face, close to his, a finger held in front of him.
          -- A flame, leaping out from a cigarette lighter.
          Six more faces, pressed in close to his.
          Himself, floating in an armchair above an empty movie
          theatre.

          IN THE BEDROOM,
          Tom snaps his eyes open. He rolls over onto his side,
          punching his pillow. He closes his eyes again.

          MORE IMAGES COME,
          faster this time. We share his point of view:
          -- A twelve year old boy beats us up in an alley near a
          dumpster.
          -- A fourteen year old girl kisses us behind a brick building.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          20. 

          CONTINUED:
          -- A vicious dog sinks its teeth into our calf.
          -- Maggie, drowning, reaches out to us.
          The images Increase in speed, a half a dozen flip by so fast
          they're almcst subliminal -- a car tire, a broken arm, falling
          into water, breaking window, ham and eggs, a bolt of
          lightning.

          IN THE BEDROOM,
          Tom sits up abruptly, shaking his head to clear it.

          TOM
          .the fuck, man?
          He puts his hands to the side of his head. It hurts. A lot.
          Maggie stirs, but doesn't wake up. Tom gets up and walks out.
          As he passes Jake's room, he does a double take.

          IN JAKE'S ROOM,
          the four year old is awake. Not just awake, but standing next
          to his bed, perfectly straight, staring at the open doorway.
          Tom steps in. He can see by the light of the nightlight.

          TOM

          (WHISPERS)
          Jake?
          The little boy doesn't answer. Tom walks slowly over to the
          boy and squats down in front of him, putting his arms on the
          boy's shoulders.
          TOM (cont' d)
          Are you okay?
          Jake just looks at Tom, straight into his father's eyes. The
          boy's face lights up in a wide smile. He reaches out with one
          hand and rests his fingertips on Tom's forehead.

          JAKE
          Don't be afraid of it, Daddy.
          The hell does that mean?
          But before Tom can respond, Jake turns, climbs back in bed,
          rolls over to face the wall, and goes back to sleep.

          

          

          

          

          INT BATHROOM NIGHT
          Tom shakes some Advil into his palm; washes three down with a
          glass of water. He runs water in the sink, splashes some on
          his face. He straigltens, looks in the mirror as he wipes his
          dripping face. He stares at himself for a moment, then
          summons his nerve and closes his eyes.

          IMMEDIATELY,
          more images come.
          -- The front of Tom's own house, from a distance. A MAN IN AN
          OVERCOAT stands on the porch, waving to us to come in.
          -- Rough hands attack us, covering our eyes and face.
          -- A face, close to ours but blurry and distorted, as if seen
          through dirty, blue-tinted eyeglasses.
          -- Wooden floorboards as we race down toward them. We hit,
          hard, and our blood sprays out onto the wood.

          IN THE BATHROOM,
          Tom's eyes pop open. That was disturbing.

          INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT
          Tom strides into the living room. Their house is small,
          crowded with kids' toys and furniture they got for their
          wedding. Tom paces back and forth, holding his head in his
          hands. He turns and bolts into the kitchen.

          IN THE KITCHEN,
          Tom rips the refrigerator open and searches the top shelf. He
          finds what he's looking for, a large carton of orange juice.
          He opens a cabinet, takes out a glass and fills it.
          He upends the glass, drains it in one gulp. Still
          unsatisfied, he picks up the carton. He drinks the rest.
          Juice runs down his chin.

          BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM,
          Tom drops onto the sofa. He sits for a moment, trying to
          regain himself. His breathing returns to normal. He sits
          forward, picks up the remote off the coffee table, points it
          at the TV and turns it on. When he sits back --
          -- there's a woman sitting next to him.

          22. 

          CONTINUED:
          She's eighteen or nineteen years old, so pale her skin's
          almost luminous. She's attractive but odd, she wears a
          billowy black dress with a diamond pattern, bangles up and
          down each wrist. Her lips are light blue, her eyes red-
          rimmed. Steam rises softly from her hair and skin; when she
          speaks, her breath comes out of her mouth in clouds of vapor.

          WOMA I
          You can kiss me if you want to.
          Tom bolts to his feet and staggers away from the couch. The
          woman stares intently at him and says something else, but her
          words are lost under the rising sound of static on the
          television.

          TOM
          What?!
          She repeats, but he can only see her lips moving, the words
          are lost under the static. Realizing, Tom turns hurriedly
          toward the TV and hits the mute switch. When he turns back --
          -- the woman is gone. He stands in the middle of the room,
          looking all around him. But he's alone.

          INT BEDROOM NIGHT
          Tom crawls back into bed and pulls the blankets up tight
          around him. He's shivering.

          A HAND
          drops over him and he nearly jumps out of his skin. It's
          Maggie, rolling over to embrace him in her sleep. He takes
          her hand in his and lies still, eyes wide open.

          CUT TO:

          INT KITCHEN DAY
          Morning. Tom and Maggie sit at the kitchen table. From the
          living room, we can hear a-kids' morning show on the
          television. Tom is wearing jeans and a phone company uniform
          shirt. Maggie is staring at him. They keep their voices low.

          MAGGIE
          What do you mean, like... You mean
          like a hallucination?

          TOM
          Maybe. I was awake, I know that.
          She nods, thinking, no idea how to deal with this.

          MAGGIE
          Did you, uh, get her name?

          TOM
          You know, she didn't menti. -in it.

          MAGGIE
          You sure you weren't dreami.g?

          TOM
          Positive. I had this headache like
          you wouldn't believe, and I was
          thirsty as hell.

          MAGGIE
          What should we do? You want to call
          Philip?

          TOM
          Yeah, I'll call him. But I don't
          think he's got a fuckin' clue in life.
          From the living room, Jake laughs uproariously at something on
          the TV.

          MAGGIE
          How about my cousin Elizabeth?

          TOM
          I don't need brain surgery, I just had
          a weird thing happen, that's all.
          Like a hypnosis hangover. One-time
          deal, don't worry about it.

          MAGGIE
          Well, if anything like this happens
          again, we should go talk to Elizabeth.

          TOM
          Maggie...

          MAGGIE
          Promise me.

          TOM
          I promise.

          EXT HOUSE DAY
          There's a pickup football game in the street, a half a dozen
          sixteen and seventeen year olds timing their plays to coincide
          with the red lights.
          Tom gets into a pickup truck with a phone compaty logo on the
          door, starts it up, and pulls forward to the neat house. He
          hits the horn. While he waits, he turns and loo--s back up at
          the front of his own house.

          HE REMEMBERS
          one of the images that blasted through his mind last night.
          It's his own house, on a wintry day. A man in an overcoat is
          standing on the porch, waving an arm in a friendly way --
          "C'mon in." But the image is silent, slow and eerie. We move
          slowly toward the porch, toward the man in the overcoat.

          BACK IN THE PICKUP,
          Tom turns slowly away from his house, just as

          THE FOOTBALL
          BANGS off his windshield, nearly breaking it. TWO BODIES
          hurtle through the air and land on his hood with a loud metal

          CLANG.
          Tom jumps a foot. He gets out of the car. ADAM McCARTHY,
          seventeen, climbs off the hood, embarrassed.

          TOM
          Jesus, you guys scared the shit out of
          me!
          The kid with Adam doesn't seem embarrassed, he just reaches
          for the football. Tom beats him to it.
          TOM (cont' d)
          You gotta play right here in the
          middle of the street?
          Frank is out of his house now, approaching the truck. He
          wears the same uniform shirt as Tom, carries a tool belt over
          his shoulder.

          FRANK
          Lighten up, Tommy, you sound like your
          own grandfather .

          CONTINUED:

          TOM
          (looking at his hood)
          Aw man, it's dented. This ain't even
          my truck. They're gonna dock me for
          this.

          FRANK
          That'll pop right out. Use one of
          them plunger things. Adam, say you're
          sorry.

          ADAM
          I'm really sorry, Mr. Witzky.

          FRANK
          There you go, he said he's sorry,
          whaddya want from a kid. Let's go.
          Frank gets in the truck. The other football players walk
          toward Tom, calling for the ball. KURT DAMON, a great-looking
          seventeen year old, stares pointedly at the ball in Tom's
          hand. Tom looks at him.

          TOM
          Hell of an arm ya got there.
          Kurt smiles and shrugs. Tom tosses the ball back to him.
          Kurt turns and catches it behind his back as he walks away.

          IN THE TRUCK,
          Tom gets back in and closes the door.

          FRANK
          That Damon kid, he's gonna break your
          old passing records this Friday.

          TOM
          Bound to happen some time.

          FRANK
          Comin' to the game?

          TOM
          (starts the car)
          Yeah, I'm comin', I'm comin'
          HARRY (o.s.)
          Hey, Tom!
          Tom turns. Harry Damon, the guy from across the street, is
          headed toward him. But Tom notices something behind Harry. A
          police car has turned onto the block and is rolling to a stop.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          26. 

          CONTINUED:
          The UNIFORMED COP behind the wheel is staring out the window,
          looking right at Tom.
          Harry comes up to the open window and starts talking, but Tom
          is looking past him, at the Cop, who has stopped now.
          HARRY (cont' d)
          Thought I'd stop by and pick up the
          rent. Save you the trip across the
          street.

          TOM
          It's still two days yet, isn't it?
          Tom looks more closely at the Cop. He realizes the Cop isn't
          looking at him, he's looking past him, toward Tom's house.

          HARRY
          Yeah, just thought you'd want to get
          it out of your hair.

          TOM

          (DISTRACTED)
          Well, my checkbook's inside.

          HARRY
          I can wait. Hey, Frank, some game we
          picked to miss last night, huh? How
          many yards Adam end up with?
          Tom turns in his seat, following the Cop's line of vision.

          FRANK
          Two hundred eleven and two touchdowns.
          Harry lets out a low whistle. Tom sees what the Cop is
          looking at so intently -- it's Jake, who's playing on the
          sidewalk in front of their house while Maggie watches. Tom
          turns back, but as he does the police car is just pulling
          away.

          CUT TO:

          INT SIGNAL DIVISION DAY
          The signal division of the local phone company has a large
          main floor. A twenty-foot wall on one side of the room shows
          a forest of jagged, blinking lines.

          IN THE TOWERS,
          Tom is wedged between giant walls of circuit boards. He pulls
          a red circuit clip from his belt and picks a line at random.

          CONTINUED:
          He pulls up the test handset unit that hangs from'his belt and
          listens, hoping from a dial tone. Instead, he cuts in on a

          WOMAN'S VOICE.
          VOICE (o.s.)
          (on phone line)
          -which was okay, I guess, but then he
          told me he loves me, and it was just
          like, oh my God, can you please make
          yourself any less attractive?
          Tom pulls off the clip and picks another line. Now it's a

          SNEAKY MAN'S VOICE.
          VOICE (o.s.)
          -unless they find out we already
          locked in with Cooper at eighty, so
          it's imperative we lead them to
          believe we're honestly trying to-,
          Tom clips to another line. It's a SEXY WOMAN'S VOICE.
          VOICE (o.s.)
          -start at my lips and lick your way
          all the way down to my-
          Tom starts to unclip, then hesitates, only human. The voice
          abruptly changes.
          VOICE (coast' d)
          Hey, did somebody pick up on your end?
          Is your wife there?
          Tom unclips and picks another line. He gets a dial tone. He
          enters a number on his headset. A SLEEPY VOICE answers.

          TOM
          Phil, it's Tom. Is there anything
          else important you said to me last
          night, while I was under?

          INT PHILIP'S APARTMENT DAY
          Philip (Maggie'a brother) is still in bed in his apartment.
          It's a smallish place, one wall is all windows with a lovely
          view of a factory, its stacks belching black smoke into the
          air. Philip's hung over. He holds the phone like he resents
          it.

          PHILIP
          What time is it?

          still in bed?

          PHILIP
          Quarter after eight? Jesus, Tom, this
          is barbaric.

          (INTERCUT)

          TOM
          Other than the shoe thing, what else
          did you say to me?

          PHILIP
          Hang on, lemme, I gotta get my
          bearings here... Who is this again?

          TOM
          Phil, I gotta get back to work, was
          there anything else you told me to do
          after I came out of it?

          PHILIP
          If you're asking if I gave you a post-

          HYP-

          TOM
          Post-hypnotic suggestion, I know what
          it's called, Phil. Did you leave any
          others behind when you were kickin'
          your big, clumsy-ass feet around
          inside my brain?

          PHILIP
          No.

          TOM
          Tell me the truth, Phil!

          PHILIP
          No, I swear! I went out of my way not
          to, I even added a thing at the end to
          make sure!

          TOM
          What thing?

          PHILIP
          I, I didn't want you to retain any of
          the experience, you know, I wanted you
          to have control back, so I made up
          this thing.

          God, I don't remember, I haven't had
          caffeine in almost eighteen hours, how
          am I supposed to-

          TOM
          In general, what was it?

          PHILIP
          Well, it was perfectly harmless, I
          just said, uh, I said "When you come
          out from under, your mind will be
          completely free. There's nothing
          binding it. Nothing holding it back.
          You will be completely open."
          Tom stops, thinking for a long moment.

          TOM
          Yeah, I'd say that about describes it.

          PHILIP
          Describes what?

          TOM
          Never mind, it's gone now. I gotta
          go.

          PHILIP
          Describes what?
          But Tom has hung up. Philip unplugs the phone and goes back
          to sleep.

          Jake sits at the kitchen table in his pajamas, eating a bowl
          of cereal. Maggie, in work clothes, is walking back and forth
          behind him, talking on the phone, finishing her makeup,
          drinking coffee, and doing the dishes.
          MAGGIE (o . s . )
          Hi, Adriana, it's Maggie. Listen, our
          baby-sitter just backed out on us for
          next Friday night --
          Jake turns and looks at the empty chair next to him. He
          smiles at it. Then he giggles. He covers his mouth.

          Shit. Shoot. Shoot, I mean.
          She picks up the phone and dials again. With all she's doing,
          she doesn't notice that Jake is having a conversation with the
          empty chair.

          Philip, hi, it's me, call me when you
          wake up, is there any way --

          JAKE
          Yes.

          MAGGIE
          -- you'd consider dumping whatever
          bimbo you're going out with Friday
          night and baby-sitting for us instead?

          JAKE
          Who?

          MAGGIE
          I'd call mom, but it's a long drive
          for her and she's not feeling very
          well again, so... call me as soon as
          you can, and no, I'm not kidding.

          câ¢.real. She looks at her watch.

          MAGGIE
          Good idea.
          She picks up the phone and dials a number. Jake just keeps
          eating. Behind him:
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          Hi, Vanessa, it's Maggie. What's your
          baby-sitter's name again, Dorothy?
          Are you gonna use her Friday night?
          Really? Would you mind if I asked her
          to sit for us, just this once? Oh,
          great, thank you so much, you saved my
          life. What's her number? Uh huh, uh
          huh. Great, thanks again. Okay.
          She hangs up and finishes her make-up in her reflection in the
          toaster.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          When did you ever meet Dorothy, Jake?

          JAKE
          Samantha told me.

          MAGGIE
          (didn't hear that)
          Oh, I bet you saw her when you were
          over playing with Jessica the other
          day, right? She was there then?
          Jake turns to the empty chair on his left. He looks at it for
          a moment, then turns back to Maggie.

          JAKE
          Yes. That's when I met her.

          She shakes his hand limply and steps
           inside, just to the side
          of the door, looking down.
          Tom stares at her,
           longer than is Maggie comes
          forward with the baby
           Y monitor and takes ove r, leading Dorothy
          into the room.

           Dorothy, thanks for coming,
          remem ber me? I'm Maggie, we met over
           at Vanessa's once or twice. Okay,
           Jake's asleep already and he hardly
          ever wakes up, a band
          could play in
           his room and he wouldn 't hear it, so

           YOU
           Shouldn't have any trouble with
           him a t all. His room is right
           up at

           As she goes on, showing Dorothy aroundexplaining where they'll be se and
           where he is, staring. and so forththe , Tom stands rooted
           At Doroth yâ¢ A strange BUZZING sound
          grows in his ears. He just watchest

          sneaks a look up at Tom, then g. Feeling his stare, Dorothy
          staring down quickly averts her gaze again,
           at the carpet, Th e buzzing fades.

          She runs upstairs. Tom is still
           standing where he was.
          Dorothy sits on
           the sofa, hands in the pockets of her jacket,
          which is still zi pped up to the neck.

          TOM
          'Whir don't you, uh... why don't you
          mak%- yourself comfortable. Take off
          your coat.
          Without looking at him,
          Dorothy obediently unzips her jacket
          and takes it off. Her b reasts are fuller than one would
          expect at her age. She l ooks up at Tom, and now there's
          defiance in her eyes. Wh at are you lookin' at?
           TOM (cont' d)
           Excuse me.
           He goes upstairs.

          INT BATHROOM NIGHT
           In the bathroom, Tom drinks
           a glass of water quickly, then
           shakes three or four Advil in to his palm. In the mirror, he
           notices Maggie, staring at him from the doorway.

          TOM
          Where did you find Dorothy?

          MAGGIE
          Vanessa recommended her. She's used
          her before, she said she's real
          reliable.
          Tom nods.
          (cont' d)
          Are you...
          She's looking at the Advil. He smiles, faking it.

          TOM
          Too much caffeine, that's all.
          He pops them in his mouth and swallows them dry.

          instructions and says goodbye.
          Tom reaches the open doorway and glances back inside. Dorothy
          is looking at him as he swings the door shut.
          EXT FRONT PORCH NIf :HT
          The buzzing stops the momen% the door is shut. Tom and Maggie
          go down the steps. Tom lookz back over his shoulder, at the
          house, in time to see Dorothy's face, peering out between the
          blinds at them.
          She releases the blinds and they snap back into place.

          BUSY STREET NIGHT
          Tom and Maggie walk down a crowded sidewalk with Frank and
          Sheila, from next door.

          FRANK
          (to Tom)
          Don't get me wrong, it's great what
          the Damon kid is doin' and everything,
          I mean, I'm sorry your record's
          gettin' broke, but, what, it held up
          almost ten years?
          Tom is terribly distracted, looking back over his shoulder,
          still plagued with a headache.

          TOM
          Yeah, `bout that.
          They round a corner. Just ahead, a high school football field
          is surrounded by bright lights, mobbed with STUDENTS and
          PARENTS. A BAND plays on the field, it's just about time for
          kickoff.

          FRANK
          (raising his voice over the

          CROWD)
          So you got that, that's great. What
          I'm sayin', though, is this year it's
          all Kurt Damon this and Kurt Damon
          that, and yeah, the kid has an arm,
          but high school football is running
          the ball -- smash-mouth, in-your-face,
          power football. Always been that way.
          Tom glances up at a mercury-vapor streetlight as they pass
          under it.

          CONTINUED:
          The same BUZZING sound, the one he heard when he first looked
          at Dorothy, comes back now, seeming to come from the street
          light. Tom shakes it off.
          FRANK (cost' d)
          Now Adam, and I admit, L am biased,
          but my kid is having ona hell of a
          season and it's like nol.-)dy noticed.
          If they'd just give him he carries he
          could break a thousand yards. And on
          an eight game schedule!
          He pulls out a pint bottle of schnapps and has a bump, offers
          one to Tom, who declines. A SEXY TEENAGE GIRL walks past.
          Frank notices. Carefully.

          BEHIND THEM,
          Sheila and Maggie walk together. Sheila stares at Frank as he
          ogles the teenager.

          SHEILA
          Look at him. Why doesn't he just lick
          them when they walk by?

          MAGGIE

          (LAUGHS)
          According to Tom, the average guy
          carries around a hard-on two and a
          half hours out of every day. What are
          you gonna do?

          SHEILA

          (DARKLY)
          I've got a few ideas.
          A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN walks past and Frank gives her the big
          crank-around.
          SHEILA (cont' d)
          Look at that! He's not even picky. I
          swear to God, that man will stick it
          in a bowl of soup if it's still warm..
          Maggie notices Tom, up ahead, with a hand to his temple. She
          catches up.

          MAGGIE
          Are you okay?
          He forces a smile. They head into a crowded tunnel that leads
          into the stadium.

          

          

          

          

          36. 

          IN THE TUNNEL,
          Frank raises his voice still higher. It becomes a horrible
          drone to Tom.

          FRANK
          Six eighty-three with three game.-
          left, he only needs to average, ti.iat,
          a hundred and five, hundred and six
          yards a game? He hits a thousand and
          we're talkin' major scholarships, the
          kid could write his own ticket. That
          kinda thing's good for everybody,
          helps the whole neighborhood. He's
          goin' a hell of a lot farther than I
          ever did. Look at the quality of the
          tail he's already gettin'. He passed
          me in that department when he was
          about fourteen.
          He passes Tom the bottle. This time, he takes a swig.

          EXT FOOTBALL FIELD NIGHT
          They come through the tunnel and into the stands. Below, the
          field is brightly lit. Frank's voice is, thankfully, drowned
          out by the enthusiasm of the crowd.
          They make their way to the first open seats in the bleachers
          and sit down. The crowd is delirious with anticipation, and a
          bit loaded -- there's a lot of schnapps in that crowd, and
          beers snuck in here and there. And that's the grown-ups.

          ON THE FIELD,
          the visitors kick off.

          IN THE STANDS,
          the crowd ROARS. Tom tries to concentrate on the game, but
          he's totally distracted. He looks to the right, drawn by a
          flash of light.
          A car is pulling into the parking lot at the end of the field
          with its high beams on. Tom stares at the lights. The
          BUZZING sound comes back, louder the longer he stares.
          The crowd ROARS its approval of something. Tom turns back,
          tries to follow the game. He wipes sweat from his forehead.
          Maggie is staring at him. She takes his hand and leans over,
          SHOUTING into his ear.

          WHAT'S WRONG?
          As Tom turns to her, his eye is drawn by something just over
          her head.
          A GIANT LIGHT STANCHION towers over them. When Tom s\ares
          directly into the dozen large globes, the BUZZING souni
          overwhelms him, nearly deafening. His hands shoot up to his
          ears --
          -- and he leaps to his feet.

          TOM
          Sf"S TAXING BIM AWWAY!

          MAGGIE

          WHAT?!
          Tom fights his way out of the row, climbing right over people.
          They SHOUT their objections.

          INT TUNNEL NIGHT
          Tom races down the now-empty tunnel. A light shines at the
          far end, BUZZING madly. A few seconds later, Maggie starts
          into the tunnel.

          MAGGIE
          Tom, wait!

          EXT BUSY STREET NIGHT
          Tom bursts out onto the busy sidewalk, threading his way
          between PEOPLE and cars as fast as he can. Maggie follows a
          few moments later.

          EXT OUR BLOCK NIGHT
          Tom races around the corner and onto his block. He bolts
          across the street, forcing a car to lock `em up at the last
          second. The Driver SHOUTS: Tom keeps running.
          He reaches the sidewalk just in front of his house and stops
          in his tracks, staring at the house, wild-eyed.
          All the lights are off.

          TOM
          Oh, no.
          He bounds up the steps and tries the door. It's locked. He
          fumbles in his pockets for the keys.

          

          

          

          

          INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT
          Tom unlocks the door and bursts inside.

          TOM
          Jake?!
          No answer. He races up the stairs.

          INT JAKE'S ROOM NIGHT
          Tom SMACKS open the door to Jake's room and flicks on the
          lights. In Jake's bed, the covers are pulled back, the sheets
          are rumpled.
          But Jake Js gone.
          Tom races out. Still staring at that empty bed, we can hear
          other doors in the house being thrown open, lights being
          switched on, and Tom's outraged voice calling out for his son.

          EXT STREET NIGHT
          Maggie comes hurrying up the steps of the porch just as the
          front door flies open.

          MAGGIE
          What the hell is the-

          TOM
          She took him.

          MAGGIE
          What?!

          TOM

          SHE TOOK HIM, HE'S NOT THERE, SHE TOOK

          HIM SOMEPLACE!

          MAGGIE
          Oh, my God!
          She bounds up the steps, calling out for Jake.

          TOM
          She can't be that far!
          He runs to the corner, desperate, and looks up and down the
          street in both directions. There are a lot of people out, she
          could be anywhere.

          

          

          

          

          39. 

          CONTINUED:
          He turns, looks up and down the side street. Nothing in the
          first direction, but when he looks the other way, he hears a
          faint BUZZING sound in the distance. He doesn't hesitate,
          just takes off toward it.

          TWO BLOCKS AHEAD,
          Tom is running as hard as he can. He stops, abruptly. The
          buzzing sound is gone. He looks to his right. Behind a wall,
          there is a large parking lot filled with buses.
          He turns around. A dull white glow comes from the windows of
          the place on the corner. He looks up, at the sign.
          It's a Greyhound bus station.
          Tom hurries back toward it, reaching the door just as Maggie
          comes running up from the opposite direction.

          TOM
          Wait right here, keep your eyes open!
          He opens the door and goes inside.

          INT BUS STATION NIGHT
          Tom steps into the station, still breathing hard. The BUZZING
          sound returns. But from where? Is it in his mind this time,
          or really here, in the bus station?
          The place is empty except for one person, sitting on a wooden
          bench with their back to him, near the departure doors. Tom
          walks slowly across the place to the figure. It's Dorothy.
          As he draws closer, he sees Jake's face, over Dorothy's
          shoulder. Jake's eyes are open, and he's staring up at the
          ceiling.
          Tom follows his son's gaze. Jake is staring up at the lights,
          the old-style fluorescent tubes that give the place its
          cancerous look. The tubes BUZZ loudly. It's the sound Tom's
          been hearing.
          Jake sees his father and smiles. Tom puts a finger to his
          lips -- "Shhhh." Jake yawns, closes his eyes, and drops his
          head onto Dorothy's shoulder. He goes back to sleep.
          Tom walks slowly around the end of the bench. Dorothy is
          SINGING softly, an old nursery rhyme.
          She looks up suddenly and sees Tom. She starts to jerk to her
          feet. Tom puts a hand out -- take it easy. Dorothy sits
          back, caught. Tom steps closer to her, carefully. He holds
          both his hands out, palms up.

          CONTINUED:

          TOM
          Give him to me.
          She shakes her head no. Outside, a SIREN WHINES and a police
          car flashes past the window, its red lights spinning. They
          both hear it and glance over, then look back at each other.
          Tom raises an eyebrow. She knows what he means.
          TOM (cont'd)
          Give him to me, Dorothy.
          Trembling, Dorothy reaches out, Jake in her arms. Tom gently
          takes the boy from her and holds him tight.
          The front door flies open and Maggie races inside. Tom gives
          Jake over to her.

          JAKE
          (half asleep)
          Oh, hi, Mommy.
          She's relieved, but livid.

          MAGGIE
          (to Dorothy)
          What the hell is the matter with you?!
          Dorothy jumps to her feet and races through the door that
          leads to the back, where the buses leave from.

          TOM
          (to Maggie)
          Take him home! I'll be there as soon
          as I can!
          He runs after Dorothy.

          EXT PARKING LOT NIGHT
          Dorothy races out of the bus station and into the forest of
          parked buses. Tom comes out a few seconds later, giving
          chase.
          Dorothy cuts between two parked buses --
          -- and is nearly hit by a third that's just arriving. Its
          horn BLARES as she trips and falls to the ground, the bus just
          missing as it ROARS past her.
          Tom reaches her. Dorothy writhes on the ground, sobbing,
          raking her hands through the gravel, hysterical.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          CONTINUED:

          TOM
          Sit up. Sit up, I want to talk to
          you.
          She manages to drag herself into a sitting position. She
          shoves back, against the wheel of a bus. Beyond them, the bus
          that nearly hit her stops on the far side of the lot.
          Dorothy is quivering, still crying. Tom squats in front of
          her, a few feet away.
          TOM (cant' d)
          Why were you taking my son?

          DOROTHY
          Go away.

          TOM
          Do you want me to call the police?
          (shakes her head no)
          Then tell me why you took him.

          DOROTHY
          He isn't safe in your house.

          TOM
          Why do you say that?

          DOROTHY
          He told me! He told me so!
          The DRIVER of the bus that nearly hit her is out of his bus
          now. He SHOUTS at them from the other side of the lot.

          TOM
          Jake said that?
          (she nods)
          What else did he say?

          DOROTHY
          Nothing. I was sitting there, I was
          watching him sleep, I was just
          watching him, like I'm supposed to,
          and... and he sat up in bed, he looked
          right at me, and he said "I'm not safe
          in this house." Two times, he said
          it, and then he went back to sleep.

          TOM
          Where were you taking him?

          real father, not --
          (like poison on her tongue)
          -- Duane. Jake would be safe at my
          father's house, we'd both be safe
          there.

          TOM
          You too?
          (she nods)
          Why aren't you safe here?
          She doesn't answer. The Driver is coming over to them, still

          SHOUTING.
          TOM (cont' d)
          Dorothy? Dorothy, why aren't you safe
          here?
          The Driver is still closer. Frightened, Dorothy gets up, to
          run again. Tom grabs her.
          TOM (coat' d)
          Hey, wait a sec-
          As his hands close around her arms --

          AN IMAGE
          flashes through his mind. A MAN'S FACE, sweaty and unshaven,
          leers over us, too close.

          IN THE PARKING LOT,
          Tom abruptly pulls back from Dorothy. He is enraged.

          TOM
          Who is he?!
          She just looks at him, frightened. He shakes her, violently.
          TOM (cont' d)

          WHO IS HE?!

          CUT TO:

          INT DOROTHY'S HOUSE NIGHT
          DUANE, fortyish, slouches on a sofa, watching Moe hit Curly
          with a rake. Duane's drinking bourbon. In his defense, he is
          using a glass. Duane's face is the one Tom just saw in the
          image in his mind.

          Duane hears the front door open and close.

          DUANE
          You're early. Your mom's still at
          work. Hey, do you know if she bought
          any more who the fuck are you?
          Tom is storming across the room toward him.
          DUANE (cant' d)
          Hey hey hey hey HEY!
          Tom already has Duane by the collar. He wrenches him to his
          feet.
          DUANE (cont' d)

          WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE

          DOIN'?!

          TOM
          Are you Duane?

          DUANE
          Who?! I don't even know who you're-
          Duane looks over Tom's shoulder. Dorothy is standing in the
          doorway, frightened.
          DUANE (cont' d)
          Dorothy, who the fuck is this guy?!
          Tom hurls Duane across the coffee table, knocking over Duane's
          bong. Duane hits the floor hard. He starts fumbling in his
          pocket, but Tom is on him, ripping him to his feet again.

          TOM
          She's a little girl, you son of a
          bitch! She' s fifteen years old, and
          you fucked her!? What the hell is the
          matter with you?! YOU DON'T DO SHIT

          LIKE THAT TO PEOPLE WHO CAN'T DEFEND

          THEMSELVES!

          DUANE
          Look, man, I don't know who you are or
          what she told you, but-
          Tom hurls Duane across the room. He SMASHES into a bookcase,
          breaking the glass shelves and knocking a bunch of pictures
          and knickknacks to the ground. Duane SCREAMS, tries to roll
          away to escape Tom, but Tom picks him up by the back of his
          collar and his belt, like a dog.

          TOM

          GET OUT!
          He hurls Duane toward the stairs. Duane CRUNCHES down hard.
          Before he can get up, Tom hauls him to his feet and hurls him
          furthe: up. He's kicking Duane's ass up the stairs.
          At the +,)ttom, Dorothy watches, her hands over her mouth.
          She's thrilled.

          AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS,
          Duane lands, a few feet ahead of Tom. This time he's got a
          second or two, and he manages to dig the butterfly knife he
          was groping for out of his pocket.
          He whips it around, opening it, but Tom is fast and crazy with
          rage, he just grabs the thing by the blade and rips it away
          from Duane. Blood flows over Tom's knuckles as he tightens
          his grip on the knife. He twists it around, holding it by the
          butt. There's madness in Tom's eyes.

          TOM
          (wielding the knife)
          You got ten minutes. Pack your shit.
          You don't leave a note, you don't try
          to call, and if you ever, ever come
          back here again, I'll know, I'll find
          you, and I'll stick this so far into
          you they'll never get it out. You got
          it?
          Duane nods, terrified.

          DOWN IN THE LIVING ROOM,
          Dorothy sits on her hands at the edge of the sofa, waiting
          nervously. Tom comes down the stairs. He folds the knife,
          uncertainly, never handled one of these things before. He
          shoves it in his pocket.

          TOM
          I'll stay until he's gone.
          Upstairs, dresser drawers SLAM, Duane CURSES. He's packing.
          TOM (cont' d)
          Shouldn't be long.

          She hurries into the kitchen. Tom looks around, at the mess
          he's made. He's embarrassed, frightened by his own rage.
          Dorothy comes back with a dish towel. She takes Tom's hand,
          wipes the blood away and wraps the towel around it.
          DOROTHY (cont' d)
          Than : you.
          He starts to pick up the things that were knocked off the
          bookcase.

          TOM
          Tell your mother I'll pay for this.

          DOROTHY
          It's okay.
          He picks up a framed photograph. Broken glass falls out of
          the frame as he turns it over. Tom freezes.
          DOROTHY (cont'd)
          What's the matter?
          Tom just stares at the picture.
          DOROTHY (cont' d)
          What?
          Tom turns the picture around to show Dorothy. The woman in
          the picture is about eighteen or nineteen, bears a faint
          resemblance to Dorothy --
          -- and is the same woman he saw in his living room.
          DOROTHY (coast' d)
          Yeah?

          TOM
          Who is this woman?

          DOROTHY
          My sister.

          TOM
          Did she have a black dress, kind of a
          diamond pattern on it?

          DOROTHY
          Yeah.

          She wore a lot of bracelets, those
          thick ones, different colors, all up
          and down her arms?

          DOROTHY
          Yeah, all t2;+ time, she probably still
          does. How d., you know that?
          Upstairs, there is a tremendous SLAM as a closet door closes
          and Duane SHOUTS.
           DUANE (o.s.)

          CRAZY MOTHERFUCKERS IN A CRAZY FUCKING

          TOM
          Where is she?

          DOROTHY
          I don't know.

          TOM
          Can I talk to her?

          DOROTHY
          No.

          TOM
          Why not?

          DOROTHY
          She ran away. About six months ago.

          TOM
          Where did she go?

          DOROTHY
          I don't know! She don't write or
          nothin'.
          Tom looks down at the photograph again.

          INT TOM i MAGGIE'S HOUSE NIGHT
          The red light glows on the baby monitor, and Jake's breathing
          can be heard from in his bedroom. Tom and Maggie sit on the
          couch in their living room, the nonitor beside them, just one
          light on. He has his arms arounc' her, holding her tight. His
          hand is bandaged. They're shaker..

          MAGGIE
          Samantha?

          TOM
          That's what she said.

          MAGGIE
          Where have I heard that name before?

          TOM
          Dorothy said she ran away about six
          months ago.

          MAGGIE
          But she could still be around! Hiding
          or something. I mean, she could have
          actually been here when you saw her!

          TOM
          If she was, she's very quick getting
          in and out of a room.

          MAGGIE
          Where was she? When you saw her,
          where was she exactly?

          TOM
          On the cushion right next to you.
          Maggie looks down at the empty half of the couch, freaked out.
          She pulls in closer to him.

          MAGGIE
          What was it like? At the game, I
          mean, how did you know about Jake?
          Did you see anything?

          TOM
          It's hard to explain. I just got this
          -- feeling.

          MAGGIE
          Like when I was drowning?

          TOM
          A little bit. But a hundred times
          stronger.

          MAGGIE
          Does it hurt when it happens?

          TOM
          Like you wouldn't believe. Fecls like
          my brain is tearing in half.

          MAGGIE
          God, Tommy, what's the matter with
          you?

          TOM
          Why do you assume it's bad? Maybe
          this is a good thing.

          MAGGIE
          If your brain is tearing in half?

          TOM
          I told you there was somethin' in me.
          Maybe it's comin' out.

          MAGGIE
          I like it better in.

          TOM
          Just roll with it. What's the worst
          that can happen?

          MAGGIE
          You'll go insane. Kill yourself.
          Kill me and Jake first.

          TOM
          Well, yeah, that...

          MAGGIE
          I want you to go see my cousin
          Elizabeth. Make sure there's nothing
          wrong. Just tell her about the
          headaches, that's all she needs to
          know, you don't have to bring up the
          other stuff.
          Suddenly, he smiles.

          TOM
          Hey, know what?
          (she looks at him)
          It is a girl.
          She furrows her brow, "how do you know?", then follows his
          gaze down to her belly, where his hand is resting.

          INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR DAY
          Tom, dressed in a patient's gown, walks down a hospital
          corridor with DR. ELIZABETH NOONAN, fortyish. Elizabeth makes
          notes on a clipboard, walking and talking fast, all business.
          Elizabeth does not have the human touch.

          ELIZABETH
          Do you have any metal plates in your
          skull?

          TOM

          ELIZABETH

          TOM

          ELIZABETH
          Any shrapnel lodged anywhere in your
          body?

          TOM
          No.

          ELIZABETH
          No cardiac pacemaker, I assume -- iron
          filings near your eyes?

          TOM
          Huh?

          ELIZABETH
          You don't work with sheet metal, do
          you?

          TOM
          No.

          ELIZABETH
          Left here.

          They turn down another corridor.
          ELIZABETH (cont' d)
          Do you have an inner ear transplant?

          TOM
          No.

          ELIZABETH
          Aneurism clips in your brain?

          TOM
          No thanks.

          ELIZABETH
          Do you suffer from claustrophobia?

          TOM
          Only in, like, really small spaces.
          (she looks at him, straight

          FACED)
          You have a great sense of humor.

          ELIZABETH
          Right, then jog left.
          They do.

          TOM
          Do we really gotta do this?

          ELIZABETH
          You've had no head trauma, no serious
          viral infections you can recall, you
          haven't been out of the country,
          you're not a drug user, you have no
          history of migraines... I suppose I
          could open up your skull in the
          operating room and then decide what to
          do, but I'd rather take a few pictures
          first, wouldn't you?
          She pushes through a set of double doors.

          INT MRI ROOM DAY
          The MRI machine is a long tunnel with a body slab sticking out
          obscenely, like a tongue. TWO NURSES stand on either side of
          it. One wall of the room is glass, behind the glass are the
          TECHNICIANS -- and Maggie, who waves supportively.
          Tom swallows.

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:

          TOM
          How's it work?
          Elizabeth goes to a computer terminal and types in some
          commands.

          ELIZABETH
          It creates an electromagnetic field
          thirty thousand times stronger than
          the earth's. That stimulates your
          brain's protons to align themselves.
          Then we shoot radio waves into you,
          which knocks the protons out of
          alignment. They then realign
          themselves, sending out radio signals
          we record on the scanner. The
          computer reads the signals and makes a
          series of detailed cross-sections of
          the layers of tissue.
          Tom looks at the machine, then back at her.

          TOM
          Can I have another Valium?

          A FEW MINUTES LATER,
          Tom lies down on the "tongue." The Nurses wrap sheets around
          his arms and tuck them in under his body, immobilizing them.
          He looks at one of them questioningly.

          NURSE
          So your arms don't touch the sides of
          the machine.

          TOM
          That would be bad?
          She smiles and nods. The other Nurse puts a white cloth over
          his hair.

          NURSE 2
          Your party hat.
          He tries to smile, but he is unnerved. Elizabeth leans in,
          staring down at Tom.

          ELIZABETH
          It's so nice you and Maggie finally
          came to see me at work.

          

          

          

          

          IN THE CONTROL ROOM,
          a Technician hits a series of switches.

          IN THE MRI ROOM,
          the tongue starts to move, sliding into the tunnel. Tom lies
          still, staring upward as he is pulled inside, like a corpse in
          a drawer sliding back into the wall of the morgue.

          INSIDE THE MACHINE,
          it's only about two feet across, and less from top to bottom.
          Tom blinks, staring up at the ceiling as the tongue comes to a
          stop. It's incredibly claustrophobic.

          TOM
          Kinda hot in the coffin.
          ELIZABETH'S VOICE comes blaring out of speakers mounted on
          either side of the tunnel.

          ELIZABETH

          YES, IT USUALLY IS AT FIRST, BUT IT

          COOLS DOWN ONCE THE HAMMERS START

          MOVING.

          TOM
          Yo, hey, hey, woah, I'm right here.
          Can you turn it down a little bit?

          ELIZABETH

          NO, YOU'LL WANT IT LOUD. WE'RE

          STARTING NOW.

          IN THE CONTROL ROOM,
          Elizabeth leans back from a microphone and turns to a
          Technician.

          ELIZABETH
          Go ahead.
          The Technician enters some commands on a keyboard.

          IN THE MRI ROOM,
          the giant "hammers" that are contained in the cylinders that
          surround the tunnel start to move, slowly at first.

          IN THE CONTROL ROOM,
          Elizabeth turns to Maggie.

          (CONTINUED)

          ELIZABETH
          Did he bring any music?

          MAGGIE
          Yeah, right here.
          She hands him a cassette. Elizabeth puts it into a tape deck
          and pushes "play."

          IN THE MRI ROOM,
          the hammers pick up speed, and these things move. It gets
          noisy fast.

          IN THE TUNNEL,
          Tom's eyes widen. The hammers whip faster. Their POUNDING is
          tremendous. Tom's music starts playing from the speakers.
          It's The Doors, "People Are Strange."
          The hammers whip faster. Elizabeth was right, it's good the
          music is loud, because the sound coming from the hammers is
          deafening, like gunshots going off all around his head.

          ELIZABETH

          TRY TO RELAX. THIS'LL ONLY TAKE AN

          HOUR OR SO.
          Tom, in spite of himself, bursts out laughing.

          IN THE CONTROL ROOM,
          they can hear the thundering hammers, the blaring music, and
          above it all, Tom's crazy kind of laughter.
          Elizabeth looks at Maggie.

          CUT TO:

          INT CONTROL ROOM DAY
          Three electronic screens, two red and one whitish-blue,
          display various cross-sections of Tom's brain. Graphs and
          columns of numbers are listed alongside.

          ELIZABETH
          No tumors, no growths, no scars or
          lesions, no intrusions or damaged
          tissue of any kind. Except for one
          tiny abnormality, your brain anatomy
          is textbook. Physically, anyway.

          MAGGIE
          What abnormality?

          ELIZABETH
          Well, it's so insignificant it's
          hardly worth mentioning.
          She leans forward to one of the screens and points to a spot
          on a cross-section.
          ELIZABETH (cont' d)
          It's the parietal lobe. Here.
          There's a slight distension, just the
          tiniest bulge here in the arc of the
          crescent. That's uncommon.

          MAGGIE
          How uncommon?

          ELIZABETH
          One in a half million, maybe, it
          doesn't really have a name. But it
          isn't consequential. Wouldn't have
          any effect on cognitive processes.

          TOM
          Great. There's nothing wrong with me,
          I gotta get back to work.
          (stands and shakes hands)
          Thank you for everything, Elizabeth, I
          owe you a giant one, hey, you think I
          can get some of that Valium to go?
          Elizabeth scowls at him.
          TOM (cont' d)
          Worth a try. Take care, say hi to
          Michael.
          (to Maggie)
          I'll pick up Jake, I told him I'd take
          him to the Pier tonight.
          He heads for the door, eager to get the hell out of there.
          Maggie lingers, looking at Elizabeth, hopeful.

          MAGGIE
          There's really nothing wrong with him?
          Nothing at all?

          ELIZABETH
          Maggie. I said nothing physical.

          INT BEDROOM DAY
          Maggie is in the bedroom, cleaning up. She picks up Tom's
          pair of jeans from the floor and folds them over one arm.
          Something THUNKS to the floor. She picks it up.
          It's the butterfly knife, the one he took from Duane. She
          stares at it, fascinated and frightened. She lets it drop
          open. There is dried blood on the blade.
          Gingerly, she closes it again. She opens a drawer and puts it
          in, then thinks better of that. She takes it out again, looks
          for a place to put it.
          She drops it in her purse and zips it shut. She'll deal with
          it later.

          CUT TO:

          EXT NAVY PIER NIGHT
          Navy Pier is an amusement park/shopping mall built on a pier
          jutting out into Lake Michigan. It's a nice night, the pier
          is crowded, just enough urban edge to be interesting. A
          figure bobs along above the crowd -- Jake, sitting on Tom's
          shoulders. They stop and join a CROWD watching a JUGGLER, a
          good one, keeps five burning pins in the air.
          Jake suddenly looks up, confused by something. He stares past
          the juggler, through the flames. Behind the juggler, a
          UNIFORMED COP is staring at the little boy -- it's the same
          Cop who was parked outside their house earlier. Jake stares
          back, the flaming pins flying up between them.
          Tom moves on, his boy still on his shoulders. The Cop turns
          and watches them go. Jake turns, looking back over his
          shoulder at the Cop. The Cop raises a hand and waves. Jake
          just stares.

          AT A TOY STORE,
          there is an elaborate model train set on display in the
          window.

          JAKE
          Daddy, look!

          TOM
          Woah, check it out.
          He stops, helps Jake down off his shoulders. Jake presses
          right up against the glass, staring at the train as it circles
          the track. Tom squats, admiring it with him.

          BEHIND THEM,
          the Cop is still watching them. He walks closer, stops only
          about ten feet away, staring. Tom glances up, sees him,
          thinks nothing of it.
          The 'op steps closer.

          IN THE. WINDOW,
          Tom sees the reflection of the Cop. Closer now, staring. Tom
          turns and smiles, tight-lipped. He recognizes him from the
          other day. The Cop smiles back, doesn't go away.

          TOM
          (to Jake)
          Hey, look at that one!
          He carries Jake to the next window over, a different display.
          The Cop wanders closer. Tom finally turns to him, tense.
          TOM (cont' d)
          How ya doin'?

          COP
          Fine, fine.
          He's staring at Jake.

          TOM
          Is there a law against lookin' in the
          window now?

          COP
          Huh? Oh, no, `course not. I'm
          off duty. I live right up there.

          TOM
          That's great. See ya later.
          He sweeps Jake up onto one hip and starts to walk away.

          COP
          It's even stronger in him than it is
          in you.
          Tom stops. Turns back.

          TOM
          What?
          The Cop smiles and makes a face -- "you heard me."

          about.

          COP
          Jon't be afraid of it.
          Tom just star .s at the Cop, trembling slightly. The Cop walks
          forward. Fascinated, Tom does not back away. The Cop lowers
          his voice.
          COP (cont' d)
          You're not alone.
          Tom is too rattled to speak.
          COP (cont' d)
          You don't know about Cacophony yet?
          Tom shakes his head no. The Cop pulls out a note pad,
          scribbles something on a page, tears it out and holds it out
          to Tom.
          COP (cont' d)
          Come next time.
          His hand shaking, Tom accepts the paper. The Cop reaches out
          and tousles Jake's hair.
          COP (coast' d)
          Bye, Jake.
          The Cop turns and walks away.

          JAKE
          Bye, Neil!
          The Cop looks back over his shoulder and smiles. Tom looks at
          his son as if he's never seen him before.

          INT JAKE'S ROOM NIGHT
          Jake, fresh from a bath and in his pajamas, sits on the floor
          of his room, playing with model cars, intent. He's HUMMING a
          soft tune to himself, the same one he hummed during his bath
          in the opening.
          Tom and Maggie sit near him, staring at him. They're freaked
          out. What have they got on their hands here? Their tone is
          soft, gently probing.

          Jake, do you remember the other day
          when we were talking in the kitchen?
          Jake doesn't look up, just keeps playing and HUMMING.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          I was loo3.ing for a baby-sitter,
          remember?
          (Jake plays)
          And you said "Samantha" told you about
          Dorothy. Do you remember that?
          He keeps playing, HUMMING.

          TOM
          Jake? Mommy's asking you a question.
          Nothing.

          MAGGIE
          Is Samantha someone who talks to you
          sometimes, Jake?
          No answer. She tries a different route.
          MAGGIE (cont'd)
          Can you remember any of the things
          that Saman-
          Jake looks up sharply.

          JAKE
          Don't ask the boy any more questions.
          They freeze, staring at him. His tone was odd. And did he
          just refer to himself in the third person?
          JAKE (cant' d)
          Talk to me.
          He goes back to playing, and to that little tune. It's
          becoming rather haunting.
          Maggie and Tom look at each other. Good God.

          INT BEDROOM NIGHT
          Nighttime. Tom and Maggie are asleep in bed. Suddenly, Tom's
          eyes pop open.

          59. 

          CONTINUED:

          TOM
          She's downstairs.
          He sits up. His head is killing him again. There's a glass
          of water on the night table. le grabs it and drinks greedily.
          He turns and looks to the open -loorway. He swallows.
          He stands up. He looks down at Maggie, who's still sound
          asleep.
          He walks to the door.
          Maggie stirs, feeling him gone.

          INT HALLWAY NIGHT
          Tom walks down the narrow hallway, toward the staircase at the
          far end. He's scared.
          He starts down the stairs. Halfway down, he dares a look
          through the wooden posts that support the handrail.
          Samantha is standing in the middle of the room.
          She looks up at him. For a long moment, they just stare at
          each other. Steam rises lightly from her as she breathes.
          Tom is shaking, barely finds his voice.

          TOM
          Samantha?
          She speaks, but when her voice comes out it's horrible and
          distorted -- muffled in a strange way.
          He takes a few trembling steps down the stairs, closer to her.
          She walks forward a step or two. She speaks again, louder,
          but the voice is still unintelligible and bizarre.
          Tom reaches the bottom of the stairs. She reaches out a hand.
          He stares, terrified. The hand draws closer.
          Almost beyond his own control, Tom raises his own hand.
          She comes closer.
          Tom is frozen at the bottom of the stairs. Their hands draw
          closer still.
          Their fingertips touch.

          60. 

          CONTINUED:
          Tom GASPS, as if something very heavy were put down on his
          chest. His mouth drops open, his chest twitches. He can't
          breathe.
          They stand there, frozen in that position. Tom tries, but
          can't draw air.
          MAGGIE'S VOICE calls out from the top ci the stairs.

          MAGGIE
          Tom?
          He can't answer. He's panicked, but unable to move. With
          every twitch of his chest clouds of steam burst from his
          mouth, all the air going out, none coming in.
          From the top of the stairs, Maggie can see him, standing
          there, hand outstretched into the darkness, touching nothing.
          But from Tom's point of view, he's touching fingertips with
          Samantha. He's frozen, breathless, and now his cheeks start
          to turn pale, unnaturally white. Another few seconds of this
          and he'll pass out.
          MAGGIE (con t' d)
          Tom!?
          She races down the stairs.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)

          TOM?!
          Tom can't look at her, can't move. A tear rolls down his
          cheek as his lips begin to turn blue.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          TOM, BR. ATfHE!
          She grabs hold of him. As soon as Maggie makes contact, Tom
          collapses. He sees Samantha break away from him with a SHRIEK
          of irritation. She moves, not quite walking, but a herky-
          jerky kind of lateral movement toward the dining room, fast,
          like someone on a dozen espressos, an angry thing that has to
          slow itself down to a crawl just to talk to us.
          In the dining room, she flops over onto the floor, like a
          reflection appearing suddenly on the surface of a pond. Into
          the floor, she disappears.
          Maggie grabs Tom's face and turns it toward her. He takes a
          big lungful of air.

          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          Was she here?!
          Tom nods, sucking air greedily.
          MAGGIE (cont'd)
          Why?!

          TOM
          I think we better find out.

          EXT OUR BLOCK DAY
          It's a street party, and it's jammed. Police barricades are
          at both ends of the block. Half barrels of beer sit in big
          plastic garbage cans, ice dumped over them. Everyone seems to
          have agreed on which radio station to listen to, and most of
          the couple dozen cars parked in the driveways have their
          radios tuned to it, loud, the windows hanging open.
          Outside Bernie's Tap, the bar on the corner, a DOZEN DRUNK
          GUYS are running pass patterns out the front door, cutting
          left at the mailbox, and catching a football thrown from
          inside the bar, out an open window. Well, they don't actually
          catch the ball...

          AT ONE OF THE TAPS,
          the Homeless Guy we've seen on the street a few times is
          drinking right out of one of the beer taps while nobody is
          watching. Lenny, the local crank we met before, is outraged.

          LENNY

          HEY, GET THE HELL AWAY FROM THERE!
          He chases him off, trying to kick him in the ass but spilling
          his own beer in the process.
          LENNY (cont' d)
          (to no one in particular)
          You see what I'm talkin' about?! You
          see what I mean?!

          ON A FRONT YARD,
          Jake plays with a couple other NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS.

          AT ANOTHER KEG,
          Frank is giving a lurid lesson on the proper way to pump the
          keg to two ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMEN. Tom joins him.

          TOM
          You know you're under surveillance
          here.
          He gestures to Sheila, Frank's wife, who's about ten feet
          away, keeping an angry eye on him.

          FRANK
          What can I do? Nature commands me to
          spread my seed. I hear and obey.

          TOM
          Sure, great, just don't be surprised
          if some day Sheila digs out your 38
          and buries a slug or two in your ass.

          FRANK
          Please. The woman can't even step on
          a spider.

          TOM
          Spider doesn't fuck around on her.

          A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY,
          Sheila is talking to Maggie, disgusted with Frank.

          SHEILA
          They change, Maggie. Ten or so years
          of marriage, a kid or two -- they
          become a different human being.

          MAGGIE
          Sheila, if you're so miserable, why
          don't you leave? Adam's almost out of
          school, he can handle it.

          SHEILA
          Oh, Frank would love that. No. I
          want him out. I like that house.

          MAGGIE
          How long have you guys been there?

          SHEILA
          Almost fifteen years.

          MAGGIE
          So... you know most of the people
          around here pretty well, right?

          

          

          

          

          IN FRONT OF BERNIE'S TAP,
          somebody actually manages to catch one of the passes coming
          from out of the bar and is immediately tackled by three
          drunks. On the pavement. Ouch.

          IN THE CROWD,
          Tom is now talking to Harry Damon.

          HARRY
          But, you know, what am I gonna do, I'm
          a single father with a son to support,
          I can' t just say fuck everything. So
          I scraped together enough money to
          make a few downpayments, and here I
          am. A landlord, for Christ's sake.

          TOM
          So you've been in this neighborhood a
          long time, right?

          MAGGIE
          is questioning Sheila.

          MAGGIE
          Did you ever hear of a girl named
          Samantha Muller?

          SHEILA

          (THINKS)
          From over by Baldwin?

          MAGGIE
          I think so.

          SHEILA
          Yeah, kinda, name rings a bell.

          HARRY DAMON,
          in response to the same question from Tom, calls over to his
          son Kurt, the good-looking football player, who is leaning
          against the front of his yellow Trans-Am, talking to a couple
          other guys.

          HARRY
          Hey, Kurt, you remember that Muller
          girl?
          (to Tom)
          Like he ever tells me anything.

          The music coming from the car is too loud, Kurt can't hear.
          HARRY (cont' d)

          (SHOUTING)

          DO YOU REMEMBER THE -- COME OVER HERE !
          He gestures. Kurt drags himself off the hood and saunters
          over.
          HARRY (cont' d)
          Do you remember that Muller girl?

          KURT
          What, Dorothy?
          He makes a "big breasts" gesture.

          HARRY
          No, the other one. Samantha.
          Lenny, the crank, joins the conversation.

          LENNY
          You mean the retard? She ran away.

          HARRY
          She did?

          SHEILA
          is on the same subject.

          SHEILA
          She was always hanging around the
          guys, you know, she wanted to be with
          the "in" clique and everything. There
          wasn't much chance of that.

          HARRY DAMON,
          asks Tom a question.

          HARRY
          Why you wanna know about her?

          TOM
          Oh, Dorothy baby-sits for us sometimes
          and she started talking about her
          sister, wonderin' how she was doing
          and stuff. I promised her I'd ask
          around, see if anybody'd heard
          anything from her.

          LENNY
          She took off back in March, I think,
          with some black guy.

          TOM
          )id she ever live in that house we're
          .n?
          Frank comes up, one arm around his son Adam.

          FRANK
          Who?

          HARRY
          No. You're the first tenants since I
          bought it.

          LENNY
          (to Harry)
          Harry, I saw those Dominicans back in
          the park again. By the basketball
          courts?

          HARRY
          What do you want me to do about it,
          Lenny?

          LENNY
          We could go talk to `em. Scare `em
          off, if there were enough of us.

          FRANK
          Yeah, Lenny, they're gonna be
          terrified of you.

          SHEILA
          keeps talking to Maggie.

          SHEILA
          She was a pretty girl, but real shy.
          Pretty simple. She had these crazy
          ideas she could be an actress, you
          know. She thought she was gonna be a
          big movie star. I mean, there was no
          way, but you couldn't tell her that.
          I thought it was kind of sad.

          FRANK AND ADAM
          have joined Tom and the others.

          TOM
          Got it.

          FRANK
          Two hundred eleven.

          TOM
          I give up, Frank.

          FRANK
          (puts his son in a hammerlock)
          Two hundred and eleven yards rushing
          the other night. That makes eight
          ninety-four with two games to play,
          kid needs a hundred and six, that's
          only fifty-three a game. He could
          walk through the rest of the season
          and hit a thousand.

          ADAM
          (pulling free)
          Dad...
          Behind them, the guys playing football out of Bernie's Tap
          have now organized a full-fledged game of tackle in the
          street, over the objections of their wives and girlfriends,
          who shout at them to stop.

          FRANK
          I embarrass him. Are there worse
          things that can happen to a human
          being?

          She was almost your age, Adam. You
          know anything about her?
          Adam doesn't answer right away. They all look at him.

          FINALLY:

          ADAM
          Huh uh.
          Suddenly, the guys playing football run a play right through
          the middle of them -- sweaty, middle-aged bodies fly in every
          direction. Everybody SHOUTS and lunges backward, protecting
          their beers. The conversation is broken up.
          But the football players are upset, and a fight breaks out.
          The crowd gets out of the way, half to watch the fight with
          glee, the other half to shake their heads and watch the fight.

          OVER AT KURT'S CAR,
          while the fight goes on in the background, Adam wanders away
          from the group and sits down on the hood of Kurt Damon's car.
          He's rattled. Kurt notices him and comes over. He sits next
          to him.

          Really, Mom? How do I look?

          KURT
          (hands up in surrender)
          All right, all right. Just, if
          there's, you know, if there's
          somethin' you wanna bullshit about or
          anything, just let me know. Might
          help.

          ADAM
          You could climb off my back, that'd
          help.
          Adam walks away.

          KURT
          Sorry.

          AT THE END OF THE BLOCK,
          two police cars arrive, their lights flashing. COPS jump out
          and wade through the crowd to bust up the fight. So much for
          the party.
          Sheila shakes her head.

          SHEILA
          It can't ever just be nice. Someone's
          always got to ruin it.

          Nighttime. The city lights are on. The sound of SOBBING
          rises faintly over them. We're on the roof of a house, and a
          figure with its back to us is doing the crying. The figure
          drinks from a bottle. A long, hard pull.

          Tom pries his eyes open, exhausted. Sunlight streams through
          the window, right into his face. He squints, looks at the
          clock. It's 10:26.

          TOM
          Oh, man...
          He sits up, painfully. A beam of sunlight cuts him right
          across the eyes.

          A MINUTE LATER,
          Tom pulls his jeans on. He sits on a chair, puts on a shoe.
          But the other one's gone. He feels under the chair. Not
          there.
          He opens the closet door. Not there.
          He looks under the bed. There it is. He grabs it.

          Tom comes downstairs and heads for the kitchen. There's
          someone standing in his living room, in the doorway from the
          dining room. It's Frank, his neighbor from next door, wearing
          a red shirt. Frank is staring at the floor.

          TOM
          Frank? What are you doing here?
          Frank looks up at him. His face is sad.

          FRANK
          They're going to kill you, Tommy. You
          and Maggie both.

          70. 

          CONTINUED:
          Frank turns and walks to the front door. He opens it, walks
          outside, and sits on the top step of the porch, looking out at
          the street.
          Tom follows him.

          EXT FRONT PORCH DAY
          It's a beautiful day, but the street is still kind of a m..ss
          from the party yesterday. Tom comes out and looks down at
          Frank, who's just sitting there, staring out at the litter.

          TOM
          Why did you say that, Frank?

          FRANK
          (in his own world)
          This is a decent neighborhood.
          On the street, TWO KIDS ride their bikes straight at each
          other, full tilt, SCREAMING. At the last second, one of the
          kids swerves, the other taunts him with cries of "Chicken!"
          A bird swoops over Tom's head, too low, and Tom flinches. He
          walks across the driveway, toward Frank's house. The MAILMAN
          waves to him, headed down the block. Tom waves back.
          Tom walks up the steps to Frank's front door and knocks. A
          VOICE calls from inside.
          ADAM (o.s.)
          Come in!

          INT FRANK'S HOUSE DAY
          Tom opens the door and comes in. Adam, Frank's son, is
          standing in the middle of the living room floor, a big smile
          on his face and one arm behind his back.

          ADAM
          Hi!

          TOM
          Hi.

          ADAM
          Want to see what I've got?

          TOM
          Sure.
          Adam pulls his arm around from behind his back. He's holding
          a 38 with a carved white handle.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          71. 

          CONTINUED:
          TOM (cont' d)
          Is that your dad's?

          ADAM
          Not today. Come here:
          Tom walks toward him.
          ADAM (cont' d)
          Closer.
          Tom walks closer. He's right in front of Adam.
          ADAM (cont' d)
          I bet you never saw this before.
          He points the gun barrel at Tom --
          -- then swings it around and points it at his own heart.

          TOM
          Oh, don't do that.
          Adam pulls the trigger.
          Tom SCREAMS as Adam collapses to the floor, blood pouring from
           his chest. His body convulses --

          INT BEDROOM DAY
          -- and Tom's eyes pop open, in bed. That was weird.
          Tom blinks, exhausted. Sunlight streams through the window,
          right into his face. He squints, looks at the clock. It's

          10:26.

          TOM
          Oh, man...
          He sits up, painfully. A beam of sunlight cuts him right
          across the eyes.

          A MINUTE LATER,
          Tom pulls on a pair of jeans. He sits down, puts on a shoe.
          But the other one's gone. He feels under the chair. Not
          there.
          He opens the closet door. Not there. Tom blinks, unsettled.
          This is kinda familiar.
          He turns and looks at the bed.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          72. 

          CONTINUED:

          TOM
          Please don't be under there.
          He bends down, lifts the blanket, and looks under the bed.
          There's his shoe.
          TOM (cont' d)
          Shit.
          He grabs it.

          INT BATHROOM DAY
          A note is taped to the bathroom mirror -- "WENT TO THE PARK

          WITH JAKE. M."
          Tom winces as he takes it down and reads it. Again.

          INT LIVING ROOM DAY
          Shod, Tom comes down the stairs and into the living room.
          Frank's not there, thank God.
          Tom goes to the front door and opens it.

          TOM
          Uh... Frank?
          But Frank's not on the porch either. Tom steps outside.

          EXT FRONT PORCH DAY
          It's a beautiful day, but the street is still kind of a mess
          from the party yesterday. A SHOUT draws Tom's attention.
          Those same two kids ride their bikes at each other, full tilt.
          Tom walks down the steps of the porch, staring at them as they
          SCREAM. At the last second, one of the kids turns away. The
          other taunts him with cries of "Chicken!"
          Tom stands frozen on the sidewalk. A bird swoops low over his
          head; he really flinches this time. The Mailman waves to him,
          headed down the block. Too stunned, Tom doesn't wave back.
          He turns, panicked, and looks at Frank's house. He starts to
          walk toward it, slowly at first, then picking up speed,
          jogging across the driveway. He's halfway there --
          -- when a GUNSHOT rings out from inside.

          TOM
          Oh, God...

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          73. 

          CONTINUED:
          He races the rest of the way, bounds up the steps to the
          house, rips open the screen door. But the front door is
          locked. He POUNDS on it.
          TOM (coast' d)

          ADAM?! ADAM, OPEN THE DOOR!!
          He POUNDS harder, but there's no answer. He goes to the
          window beside the door and peers through it.

          THROUGH THE WINDOW,
          he sees Adam lying on the floor in the middle of the living
          room.

          ON THE PORCH,

          TOM
          Oh, God, no!
          Tom picks up a porch chair and heaves it through the window.

          INT FRANK'S HOUSE DAY
          Glass SHATTERS and sprays all over the floor. Tom knocks the
          rest out of the frame with his elbow and climbs into the
          house.
          He races over to Adam's body. There is a pool of blood around
          his chest and his body is convulsing. In his right hand, he
          clutches a 38 with a carved white handle.

          TOM
          Oh, God, no, Jesus, no, please...
          He grabs a blanket off a chair nearby, presses it to Adam's
          chest, trying to stop the bleeding.
          TOM (cont' d)
          This is really happening.., it's
          really happening...

          CUT TO:

          EXT OUR BLOCK DAY
          Tom sits on his front steps, shell shocked, red light flashing
          off his face. An ambulance and two police cars are parked in
          front of the house next door, radios SQUAWKING with official
          activity.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          74. 

          CONTINUED:
          Tom just stares. A car comes barreling around the corner and
          SQUEALS to a halt in front of the house. Frank and Sheila
          leap out of the car and race toward the house.
          Tom watches as they're intercepted-by a COP who tries to
          restrain them for a second. But they're hysterical, they've
          obviously been told something serious has happened and they're
          desperate to get inside.
          They blow past the Cop and hurry up the stairs, just as THREE
          PARAMEDICS wheel a stretcher out of the house, headed for the
          ambulance. The sheet isn't over Adam's head, at least, but
          that's about the only good sign, they're working on him
          frantically.
          Tom buries his head in his lap as he hears the cries of Adam's
          parents -- Frank's anguished, disbelieving BELLOW, Sheila's
          horrified SCREAM.

          CUT TO:

          INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT
          CLOSE ON a torn off piece of notebook paper with an address
          and a time scribbled on it. The word "Cacophony" is legible.
          Maggie picks it up, stares at it for a moment, then hands it
          to Tom, who is by the front door, zipping his jacket. He
          takes it and shoves it in his pocket. He's nervous. They
          both are. She smooths his jacket. He turns to go, but she
          tightens her grip on his jacket. Doesn't want to let him go.

          TOM
          We need some answers, right? Maybe
          they're the only ones who have any.
          She nods. Thinking of something, she picks up her car keys
          from the table by the door and pulls something off the ring.

          MAGGIE
          I'm sure they're very nice people, but
          in case they aren't --
          She hands a thin black cannister to him.
          MAGGIE (coat' d)
          Mace the shit out of `em.
          He smiles and shoves it in his pocket. She kisses him.

          

          

          

          

          EXT DINGY STREET NIGHT
          Tom walks down a street in a dodgy neighborhood at night,
          checking addresses. He stops and looks up, at an old,
          formerly grand apartment building that's fallen on hard times.

          INT BUILDING - CORRIDOR NIGHT
          The corridor is even creepier. And massive. Tom reaches a
          door all the way at the end and knocks. A moment later, the
          door opens. A very heavy-set woman in a floral print dress
          (VIVIAN) smiles at him.

          VIVIAN
          I hope you like fondue!

          INT VIVIAN'S APARTMENT NIGHT
          Vivian sets a plate down on a TV tray in front of Tom. There
          is a pile of chunks of various hard-to-identify meats, a
          silver fondue spear, and a chocolate cupcake with an American
          flag stuck in it. Tom sits on an overstuffed couch that's
          leaking stuffing.

          VIVIAN
          Dip away!

          TOM
          Thank you. Listen, is, uh --
          Vivian gives another plate to a man sitting next to Tom,
          HERMAN, in his seventies, in a wheelchair, an oxygen tube
          running into his nostrils.
          TOM (coat' d)
          Is there a guy named Neil here? He's
          a cop?

          VIVIAN
          Well, of course he is!
          She turns and heads back into the kitchen, passing BEVERLY,
          her identical twin, who's wearing the same print dress, this
          one with a red background instead of blue. Beverly serves two
          people on the far couch, one a THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, the
          other a HOMEY in his early twenties.
          Tom picks up a ham chunk and looks at the steaming fondue pot,
          full of cheese. Beverly dips and eats, winks at him, and
          flits off across the room.
          Herman turns to Tom and asks something in a raspy voice.

          TOM
          Excuse me?
          Irritated, Herman gestures for him to lean closer. Tom does.

          HERMAN
          What does it want you to do?

          TOM
          I don't... I'm sorry, I don't under-
          Herman wraps his bony fingers around Tom's wrist.

          HERMAN
          Then you're not listening!
          NEIL (o.s.)
          It's his first time, Herman. Give him
          a break.
          Tom turns. Neil, the cop he saw the other night, has come in
          from the kitchen. Tonight he's in street clothes.
          NEIL (cont' d)
          (points at Tom)
          Lemme guess. "Distended parietal
          lobe," right?

          TOM

          (AMAZED)
          Who are you guys?

          NEIL
          Don't have a name. Cacophony Society,
          somebody said once, that stuck for a
          while. You know, like too many voices
          in our heads? I think it's too
          melodramatic. How about "fellow
          sufferers?"
          Vivian comes in from the kitchen with two big gallon jugs of
          orange juice. There are AAAAHS1 of appreciation.

          TOM
          Does everybody here -- see things,
          like me?

          NEIL

          (NODS)
          Buncha freaks, huh?

          HERMAN
          Speak for yourself.

          NEIL
          No, Herman, you're a freak. "Mutants"
          is a better word for the rest of us.
          He pulls 'ip a chair and sits down opposite Tom. On the other
          side of tie room, Vivian and Beverly tell an animated two-part
          story to he teenage girl and the homey, finishing each
          others' se. .tences .
          NEIL (cont' d)
          Like any other part of our body, our
          brains have evolved a lot in a hundred
          thousand years. Our first thoughts
          were formless. Struggling
          consciousness. Sensation. An
          instinctive tie to our environment.
          But then our brains began to focus.
          We sacrificed the intuitions we first
          had so our thoughts could be directed,
          so we could master specific functions.
          That's where we are at the moment.
          We're brilliant with technique, but
          we've given up instinct. So the next
          evolutionary step, the step yet to
          come, or perhaps it's already in the
          making, is actually backward. To
          maintain our higher functions, but
          reawaken the part of our brain that
          was pure intuition. That was
          receptive to anything, because it
          didn't know enough not to believe.
          You're a freak of nature, pal, an
          evolutionary step. You're double-
          jointed.
          (taps his head)
          Up here.

          TOM
          Are we the only ones?

          NEIL
          Hardly. I've heard of groups like
          ours in San Francisco, New York,
          Minneapolis -- those are just the
          cities I've been to. Tom, you're what
          they used to call a medium. You're
          like a man in a dark tunnel with a
          flashlight, but the light only goes on
          once in a while. When it flickers on,
          you get a glimpse of something, but
          not enough of a glimpse to know what
          it is. Just enough to know it's
          there.

          (sn files)
          The ncxt generation. Much better
          flashlight.

          TOM
          Wright, if there's all these people
          who got this power, why doesn't
          everybody know about it? Why isn't it
          common knowledge?

          NEIL
          It is. A lotta people know.
          Unfortunately, the easiest people to
          convince, the believer types, they
          also tend to be the dumbest. And
          people who demand proof -- well, this
          isn't something we can control, it
          comes when it comes, so if you can't
          make it happen, how can you prove it?
          It's like that singing frog in the
          cartoon, but when the guy puts it on
          stage it just croaks and he looks like
          a jerk.
          Herman laughs, horribly. He likes that cartoon.
          NEIL (cont' d)
          Some of us try anyway. I say who
          needs that kind of aggravation?

          TOM
          This all started when I was
          hypnotized. Is that how it always is?

          NEIL
          First time I've heard that one. it
          comes all different ways. Sometimes
          it goes the same way it came.

          TOM
          So it does go away.

          NEIL
          For some people. Don't look for
          rules. We're off the map here.

          Z 'M
          Yeah. Twice. t. girl that disappeared
          from my neighborhood. Now the kid
          next door just tried to kill himself.
          I think he knew something, but now
          I'll never know what it was. And I
          gotta know.

          HERMAN
          Look, what'd the bitch want?

          TOM
          Why do you assume she wants something?

          NEIL
          They always do. Something they need
          finished, something they can't do any
          more.

          TOM
          Why me?

          NEIL
          Because she's confused. Doesn't know
          why other people won't answer her.
          She only knows that you will. If she
          hasn't asked for something yet, she
          will. And once they ask, it's very

          What do you mean? She can, it can
          make me do something I don't want to
          do?

          NEIL
          Oh, no. You'll want to. Badly. You
          won't think about anything else. You
          won't sleep. You won't eat. You'll
          lie. And God help anyone who tries to
          stop you.

           A HAND pounds on an apartment door. Philip opens up. He was
          asleep.

          PHILIP
          What, what, what?

          TOM
          I want you to hypnotize me again.

          INT PHILIP'S APARTMENT NIGHT
          Tom paces the floor in Philip's apartment.

          PHILIP
          Just slow down, you gotta be a little
          patient with me here, `cause, um...
          well, Tom, Tom, I've got a confession
          to make. See I, I, I just smoked this
          great big fatty a few minutes before
          you walked in, so this shit you're
          tellin' me here is fuckin' with my
          mind just a little bit extra, okay?
          Tom grabs a chair from Philip's desk and sits.

          TOM
          Do it.

          MOMENTS LATER,
          they sit face to face.

          PHILIP
          Okay. Close your eyes.
          Tom closes his eyes.

          Just like last time -- I want you to
          concentrate. Listen to the room
          around you.
          Tom listens. The factory CHURNS softly outsioi the windows.
          A few CARS in the street below. His BREATHING.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          Now focus. Concentrate. Look at the
          backs of your eyelids. Do you see
          anything there?

          (opens his eyes)
          Would you just get to it, please?

          PHILIP
          All right, all right.
          Tom closes his eyes again.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          I want you to pretend you're in a
          movie theatre.

          INT MOVIE THEATRE NIGHT
          We're sitting alone in an empty movie theatre. The seats and
          walls are covered in black velvet.
          PHILIP (o.s.)
          It's very dark. Everything is covered
          in black velvet. The seats, the
          walls, the floor. In the whole pitch-
          black theatre, there's only one thing
          you can see. The white screen. You
          drift toward it, in your chair.
          Up ahead of us, the screen is a dazzling white. We move
          slowly toward it, floating over the seats.
          PHILIP (o.s.)
          There are letters up on the screen.
          Tall, thick, black letters, but
          they're out of focus. You drift
          closer to them.

          We do drift closer to the blurry letters, but our attention is
          diverted by something. Three rows from the screen, there is a
          figure in one of the seats, its back to us.

          INT PHILIP'S APARTMENT NIGHT
          Tom's eyes are sill closed. His face furrows in conctrn.

          TOM
          There's someone in here.

          PHILIP
          No, it's empty.

          TOM
          There's someone else here.

          PHILIP
          No, man, I said you're alone in the
          theatre.

          INT MOVIE THEATRE NIGHT
          But there is someone in the theatre with us, and we continue
          to drift forward toward them.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          You're comfortable in your black
          velvet seat, very comfortable...
          Actually, we're quite nervous, drifting closer and closer to
          that figure sitting in the third row, its back to us.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          Your feet and ankles are relaxed.
          Your legs are relaxed.

          INT PHILIP'S APARTMENT NIGHT
          Tom's eyes are still closed. His chest is twitching.

          TOM
          hard to breathe

          INT MOVIE THEATRE NIGHT
          The figure in the seat is only a row or two ahead of us now.
          It's a woman. We keep drifting closer.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          Your hands are limp and heavy. Your
          arms are relaxed. Your face.

          Our hand reaches out, touches the shoulder of the woman. She
          turns.
          It's Samantha. Her face is shrouded in plastic. Her mouth
          presses against the plastic, it forms a horrible round 0,
          contorted in a silent scream.

          INT PHILIP'S APARTMENT NIGHT
          Tom's eyes flicker madly under the lids. Philip's worried.

          PHILIP
          I want you to look at the screen.

          TOM

          (GASPING)
          I can't breathe!

          PHILIP
          Look at the screen, Tom.

          INT MOVIE THEATRE NIGHT
          Now Tom's not just an observer in the movie theatre, he's in
          the movie theatre, sitting right next to Samantha. She's
          pawing at him, it's all he can do to fight her hands off. In
          their struggle, his fingers close around the plastic that
          shrouds her face. He sweeps it off her head.
          PHILIP (o.s.)
          The screen, Tom, look at the screen!
          You can read the letters now!
          Samantha's face is bloodied and bruised, as the plastic comes
          off she GASPS for air and lets out a ghastly, inhuman SHRIEK
          that fills the theatre. Philip's voice gets louder as he
          struggles to maintain control of the hypnosis.
          PHILIP (o.s.)
          Look at the screen, Tom, you're close
          enough now, you can read the letters,
          you're right up next to them!
          Tom, still holding off Samantha's grasping hands, turns and
          looks up at the movie screen.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          The letters come into focus, they
          spell --
          Tom's eyes widen as he stares at the screen. Three huge
          letters pop into focus and fill our field of vision. The
          letters say:

          Tom's eyes pop open and he staggers backwards, gasping for
          air, knocking the chair out from under himself. He falls back
          against Philip's desk, scared out of his mind.

          PHILIP
          What?! What happened?!

          TOM
          Couldn't breathe...

          PHILIP
          Are you okay?!
          Tom wipes his brow, he's covered in sweat.

          TOM
          Plastic, like sheets of plastic...
          He shoves Philip out of the way, finds the refrigerator on the
          other side of the room. He rips it open, searches for
          something to drink. Philip follows him.

          PHILIP
          I think you need to sit down, man,
          something very next level was
          happening there, you should have seen
          your face.
          Only beer in the fridge. Tom CRACKS one open and upends it.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          Uh... want a brew?
          Tom drinks the entire can.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          Feel better?
          Tom nods, wiping his chin.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          What happened?
          Tom looks at him, calming.

          Maggie's Sentra pulls into the driveway of their house,
          parking behind Tom's phone company truck. She gets out,
          dressed in work clothes, and pulls two bags of groceries out
          of the trunk. She looks at Tom's truck, then at her watch.
          Home already?

          INT TOM & MAGGIE'S HOUSE DAY
          Maggie comes in the front door.

          MAGGIE
          (calling out)
          Hey! You're home early!
          She struggles to take the keys out of the door while still
          holding the groceries.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          Can you pick up Jake? I'm exhausted!
          She comes in and kicks the door shut behind her. Tom's
          nowhere to be seen. From somewhere in back, there is a faint
          CRUNCHING sound.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          Hello?
          No answer. She heads into the kitchen with the groceries.

          INT KITCHEN DAY
          In the kitchen, a letter is waiting in the tray of an old fax
          machine on the counter. Maggie stops in the doorway, staring
          at the floor. Muddy footprints lead into and out of the
          kitchen, through the door to the back. Thick chunks of wet
          mud are everywhere.

          MAGGIE
          Hey, look what I'm not cleaning up.
          She sets the groceries down on the counter and pulls out a
          gallon of milk. She opens the refrigerator. She does a
          double take. The entire top shelf is jammed with cardboard
          cartons of orange juice.
          From outside, the CRUNCHING sound comes again. She follows
          the muddy footprints out the kitchen door.

          

          

          

          

          EXT BACK YARD DAY
          The back yard is smallish, but it's a nice little patch of
          grass. Used to be, anyway, because now there are three large
          holes in it, dug seemingly at random locations. Large piles
          of dirt and rock are heaved up next to the holes.
          Tom stands in one of t1.e holes, his back to Maggie, hoisting a
          large pick axe high over his head. CRUNCH. He brings the
          pick down, into the hole. Busy guy.
          Maggie is aghast. She walks slowly across the yard, past a
          pile of shovels and buckets and other tools. She draws closer
          to him.

          MAGGIE
          Tom?
          Tom raises the pick high and brings it down hard. CRUNCH.
          The hole he's in at the moment isn't more than two or three
          feet deep. But, hey, it's early.
          Maggie draws closer. In between swings --
          MAGGIE (coast' d)
          Tom.
          Tom whirls, the pick raised to defend himself. His shirt's
          off, his chest and face are streaked with mud and sweat.
          Maggie jumps back.

          TOM
          You scared me.
          And with that, he turns back to the job. Swing. CRUNCH.

          S scared you?
          Swing. CRUNCH.

          Maggie walks around him, so she's facing him. He keeps
          working.

          MAGGIE
          What do you mean?
          Zom shrugs. Swings the pick.

          TOM
          I'm supposed to dig.

          MAGGIE
          Who says?
          He just looks at her from under his sweaty brows. You know
          who.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          Oh.
          Tom manages to break apart the rock he was working on with the
          pick. He tosses the axe, which bounces crazily across the
          grass at Maggie's feet. She jumps out of the way. He hoists
          himself out of the hole and picks up the garden hose. He
          sprays water into the hole.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          Why are you doing this?

          TOM
          Water softens up the dirt.
          He tosses the hose aside and grabs a shovel. He jumps back in
          the hole and starts to dig.

          MAGGIE
          No, I mean... Could you stop for a
          minute?
          (he keeps digging)
          Would you please stop for a minute?

          What don' t you get? I'm supposed to
          dig.

          I'm searching.

          MAGGIE
          What are you searching for?

          TOM
          The question isn't "what." We both
          know very well "what," even if we
          don't want to may it out loud. The
          question, Maggie, which, as you can
          plainly see, I am very busy trying to
          answer -- the question is "Where?"

          MAGGIE
          I think we should call the police.

          TOM
          And tell them what, exactly? Run it
          by me once. Practice, see how it
          sounds.
          (looks at his watch)
          Anything else?

          MAGGIE
          Why don't you come in the house with
          me? Take a break. I want to talk to
          you, you're not yourself right now.

          TOM
          This is just fucking typical, isn't
          it?
          He climbs out of the hole and walks toward her.
          TOM (cont' d)
          What do you want me to do, Maggie, you
          want me to go inside, sit down in
          front of the TV, drink eight or nine
          beers till I fall asleep in the chair?

          By the and of his tirade, TWO NEIGHBORS are staring over the
          back fence. He's only a few feet from Maggie now, the veins
          in his neck standing out. She holds her ground.

          years old, you never talked to me like

          He stares at her, furious --
          -- and then jumps in the hole and starts digging again.
          Maggie turns and stalks across the yard and into the house.
          Tom keeps digging for a moment, then hurls the shovel across
          the yard.

          the doorway, composing himself. She keeps reading. He sighs,
          heavily. She doesn't turn around.
          He goes to the refrigerator and takes out a carton of orange
          juice. He takes two glasses from a cupboard and sits down at
          the table opposite her. He fills both glasses and puts one in
          front of her. She looks up at him as he drains his. He

          She doesn't answer. He takes her glass, drinks some.
          TOM (cone' d)
          I'm sorry.
          No answer.
          TOM (coat' d)
          Okay, I'm not sorry.
          She ignores him. He looks at the letter in her hands.
          TOM (cont' d)
          Who's that from?

          MAGGIE
          My brother Steve. My mother's going
          back in the hospital again.

          TOM

          (IMMEDIATELY)
          No, sh-
          He stops himself. She looks at him.

          MAGGIE
          What?
          He shakes his head.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          What?

          TOM
          Nothing.
          They stare at each other. Tom's face is pale. Maggie is
          concerned.
          The phone RINGS. Maggie stares at Tom. The phone RINGS
          again. She lowers her voice, pleading.

          MAGGIE
          What is it?
          Tom can't look at her. The phone RINGS again. Tom gets up,
          opens the door that leads to the back yard, and goes outside.

          

          

          

          

          EXT BACK YARD DAY
          Tom takes a few steps out of the house, putting his hands to
          his head in pain. Whatever it is, he knows. In the house,
          the phone rings a fourth time. Maggie's voice drifts through
          the open doorway as she answers i;.

          MAGGIE ( - 9.)
          Hello?
          Tom closes his eyes.
          MAGGIE (o.s.)
          Steve, I was just going to-
          She stops. There is a long silence. Tom opens his eyes. A
          tear runs down his cheek. He wipes it away.
          He turns and walks back toward the house, slowly. There is
          dead silence inside. As he nears the doorway, he hears the
          sound of the telephone being placed back in its cradle.
          Maggie reaches the doorway at the same time Tom does. She
          looks up at him, her eyes filled with tears. He puts his arms
          around her and she breaks down. He holds her.
          He holds her for a long moment.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          You knew.
          (no answer)
          You knew, didn't you?

          TOM
          When's the funeral?

          MAGGIE
          Sunday. We should leave as soon as we
          can.

          TOM
          We?
          She stiffens.
          TOM (cont' d)
          Oh, you, uh... you want me to go with
          you?
          She looks at him, deeply hurt. Then enraged. She pushes him
          away from her, hard. He stumbles back into the yard.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          93. 

          CONTINUED:
          TOM (cont' d)
          Hey, I just thought, maybe, you
          know... your family might want...

          MAGGIE
          Do I WANT you to come with me:! To my
          MOTHER'S FUNERAL?! Of COURSE L want
          you to come, why the hell WOULLV'T you
          come?!
          But he's looking past her, at the holes in the yard.

          TOM
          I'm just... kind of in the middle of
          something here.
          She looks at him, absolutely incredulous --
          -- and then storms back into the house, SLAMMING the door so
          hard two of the glass panes spiderweb.

          CUT TO:

          EXT DRIVEWAY DAY
          Jake, twisted around in his car seat, looks out the back
          window of Maggie's car. He raises one hand, waving.
          Tom stands in the open doorway of the garage, still in his mud-
          stained jeans and tee shirt. He waves back.
          The car pulls out of the driveway, fast, and ROARS off down
          the block. Jake and Maggie are gone.

          EXT BACK YARD DAY
          There are now five large holes in the back yard, and Tom is
          running out of places to dig. Nevertheless, he drags the hose
          across the yard to an untouched patch of grass in the far
          corner.
          He stops short. Hose won't reach.

          AT THE SPIGOT,
          he unscrews the hose and carries it across the yard.

          AT ANOTHER SPIGOT,
          this one in the far corner, he reconnects the hose and turns
          on the water. Nothing comes out.

          CONTINUED:

          TOM
          Come on!
          Tom curses and trudges back toward the house.

          INT KITCHEN DAY
          Tom gets a screwdriver from a tool drawer in the kit-hen.

          INT DINING ROOM DAY
          Tom stomps into the dining room and goes to a closet on the
          far wall. He opens the door and tosses aside a carpet flap
          that covers the floor. He shoves the screwdriver into a crack
          in the floor and pries up a trap door, two feet square, in the
          middle of the closet floor.
          Through the hole, he can see a ladder resting up against the
          wall below. He feels for the rungs with his feet and starts
          to climb down.

          INT BASEMENT DAY
          As Tom climbs down, he reaches out for a chain that hangs from
          a bare bulb in the ceiling and turns it on. They have only a
          partial basement, a ten by ten foot space about eight feet
          deep. The rest of the area under the house is just crawl
          space, barely enough to wriggle through.
          Tom reaches the bottom and goes to the far side, where a mess
          of water pipes all converge. He picks through them, finds the
          valves that lead outside, turns one off and another one on.
          WATER surges through the pipes, headed out to the far spigot.
          He turns to climb back up the ladder.
          And stops.
          He looks down, at the floor. It's dirt.
          He kicks at the dirt with his shoe, thinking.

          A FEW MINUTES LATER,
          the pick axe falls. Tom has brought all his tools into the
          basement and is now digging in the middle of the basement
          floor. The bare bulb throws his exaggerated shadow on the
          earthen walls.
          He works.

          

          

          

          

          EXT OUR BLOCK DAY
          It's quiet in the neighborhood. The CRUNCHING sound of Tom's
          pick axe falling echoes over the block.

          INT BASEMENT DAY
          Tom digs. The hole is almost four feet across, five feet
          deep. He's uncovered a large rock, a major chunk of stone,
          right in the middle of where he wants to dig. He's excavated
          all around the edges of the thing and is trying to wedge it
          loose with a pry bar, but it won't budge.
          Tom collapses onto the floor, leaning against the pile of mud
          and stone he's already hauled out. He thinks.

          CUT TO:

          INT YARD SUPPLY WAREHOUSE DAY
          Tom walks down an aisle along one wall in a huge yard supply
          warehouse. Tools are mounted on the wall for sale -- shovels,
          picks, post hole diggers. Got all that. Tom keeps walking.
          The tools get bigger. Huge shovels. Tractor blades. Hand
          pile drivers. Almost, but not quite. Tom keeps walking.
          At the end of the row, underneath a sign that says "FOR RENTAL
          ONLY" is an industrial-size jackhammer, the kind road crews
          use to bust through whatever's in their way.
          Tom's face lights up.

          EXT STREET DAY
          The jackhammer rides in the back of Tom's pickup truck,
          rattling along as the truck bounces over potholes. Tom pulls
          into his driveway, comes around, and drops the gate.
          Using all his strength, he wrestles the jackhammer out of the
          back of the truck. It's incredibly heavy, it takes all his
          strength to haul it up the stairs, kick open his door, and
          bring it into the house.

          IN THE STREET,
          Lenny, the neighborhood crank, is washing his car. He hears a
          CRASH from over at Tom's place and turns. He sees Tom at his
          pickup, lugging a huge air compressor out of it.
          Tom fights his way into the house with the compressor.
          Lenny stares at him.

          Sheila, carrying flowers and looking like didn't sleep last
          night, comes out of her house and heads for her car. She
          stops and stares too.

          INT BASEMENT DAY
          In Tom's basement, the compressor descends through the trap
          door above, seemingly of its own accord -- than we see it's at
          the end of a rope and Tom is up in the trap door space,
          sweating and straining, lowering the thing down.
          It settles on the floor next to the jackhammer.

          A BIT LATER,
          Tom reaches up to the hanging light bulb, which also has an
          electrical outlet in its fixture, and plugs in a yellow safety
          cord.
          He flicks a switch on the compressor and it RATTLES to life.
          He follows a hose over to where it plugs into the side of the
          jackhammer, which now quivers with unleashed power.
          Tom picks up the jackhammer. He hauls it over to the rock
          that's been in his way. He positions the jackhammer's spike
          on the top of the rock. He lowers a pair of goggles over his
          eyes. He swings his weight up, onto the jackhammer, and
          squeezes the handles.
          The jackhammer ROARS to life. It's deafening. Tom's whole
          body quivers. It's like riding a bull, but the rock begins to
          split in half.
          Tom WHOOPS with joy, barely heard over the din that echoes in
          his basement.

          EXT STREET DUSK
          As the sun goes down, the sound of the ROARING jackhammer is
          plainly audible on the block. The familiar Homeless Guy stops
          and SHOUTS something at Tom's house.
          Across the street, Kurt Damon comes out his front door and
          stares at Tom's house. What the hell is that guy up to?

          INT STEVE'S BEDROOM NIGHT
          The door is ajar, people visible through it as Maggie dials a
          nu-rber on a bedside telephone. The phone rings on the other
          enc. And rings. And rings. Just as she's about to hang up,
          Tom answers.
          TOM (o.s.)
          (sounds angry)
          Hello?

          MAGGIE
          It's me.
          TOM (o.s.)
          (changes his tone)
          Oh, hi. How ya doin'?

          MAGGIE
          I'm okay.
          TOM (o.s.)
          How's your family?

          MAGGIE
          You know. Drunk. Fighting with each
          other.
          TOM (o.s.)
          Listen, Maggie, I'm sorry. I was an
          asshole. I should be there with you
          right now.

          MAGGIE
          Yeah, well, what can I say? You are
          kind of an asshole. How do you feel?
          TOM (o.s.)
          Fine. A lot better. Much, much
          better. Everything's fine here. Real
          good.

          MAGGIE
          Have you had any-
          TOM (o.s.)
          Nope. Not even one.

          MAGGIE
          Look, I'm sorry too. I' wish I hadn't
          just stormed out of there, I shouldn't
          have left you alone.
          TOM (o.s.)
          I deserved it.

          MAGGIE
          Are you okay? You sound funny. What
          are you doing?
          TOM (o.s.)
          Just... moving a chair. There.

          MAGGIE
          Why don't you come up here with us?
          This time of night you could make it
          in an hour.
          TOM (o.s.)
          Well, I can't, really.

          MAGGIE
          Why not?
          TOM (o.s.)
          (a lame lie)
          I'm, uh, not supposed to use the truck
          for personal trips.

          MAGGIE
          (trying to keep her cool)
          Alright. I'll come down there and get
          you. I'll leave right now.
          Behind her, the bedroom door swings open. Jake stands there.
          He looks terrible. She doesn't hear him come in.
          TOM (o.s.)
          No, no, no, no, no, what do you want
          to do that for? Don't come down here.

          Tom SLAMS down the phone. He's standing in the dining room,
          which is now so mud-spattered it looks like the inside of a
          cave. The table has been shoved against the wall, legs
          sticking out into the room. One corner is filled with a pile
          of broken-up chunks of rock. Tom strides across the room in
          two steps, lowers himself, and drops his legs through the open
          trap door.

          INT BASEMENT NIGHT
          Tom sails down into the basement and lands nimbly on the
          floor. Doesn't even use the ladder anymore.
          The rock is gone, broken apart by the jackhammer, and the hole
          is now eight feet long and as many wide, and about four feet
          deep. Tom leaps down into it and goes back to work.

          MAGGIE
          Why not?

          JAKE
          Because I'm not safe there. Because
          of the feathers.

          MAGGIE
          What does that mean, Jake?
          He shrugs. Philip, Maggie's brother, stands in the doorway to
          the other room.

          PHILIP
          It's okay, I can watch him.
          Maggie, in a hurry, agrees. She bends over and kisses Jake on
          the forehead.

          MAGGIE
          Be good.
          She opens the door and heads out. As it's swinging shut:

          JAKE
          Don't stop for the train, Mommy.

          EXT UNCLE STEVE'S HOUSE NIGHT
           Maggie hears that just as the door closes behind her. She
           misses a step, thinking about it, then starts walking to her
          car.
          She walks faster.
          Then she runs.

          INT BASEMENT NIGHT
          In the basement, Tom abruptly stops digging, staring at the
          dirt. The corner of something shiny is sticking out from the
          pile. He bends down and pulls it out.

          CONTINUED:
          It's a piece of clear blue plastic sheeting, about two inches
          square. Tom's hand starts to shake as he holds it.

          AN IMAGE
          flas.es through his mind again, the one he's seen twice
          befoi-. A FACE, too close to his, sting at him through that
          blurr blue, like through bad eyeglasses.

          IN THE BASEMENT,
          Tom turns and leaps into the hole, shovel in hand. He begins
          to dig, wildly, flinging dirt in all directions. At one end
          of the hole, his shovel slips, the dirt spilling off it as it
          sticks on something. Something buried.
          Tom drops the shovel. He falls to his knees and uses his
          hands to rake the dirt away from whatever it was.
          More blue plastic.
          Tom tugs out about eight inches of the plastic, gets a good
          grip on it with both hands. He pulls it up.
          Like a rope pulled out of the sand, the edge of the blue
          plastic rises up, unearthing itself in a line down the middle
          of the pit.
          Breathing hard, Tom grabs the shovel again.

          THE DIRT,
          flies away from the plastic as Tom works furiously.

          TOM'S FACE
          is of a man possessed. He digs as fast as he can.

          FINALLY,
          Tom stands back, staring down at what he has unearthed.
          Above him, we see what it is. A long piece of blue plastic,
          wrapped around something about five and a half feet long and
          two and a half feet wide.
          Tom bends down and lays one hand on the plastic. He flinches.

          AN IMAGE
          pops into his mind, another familiar one. A FIGURE IN Afl
          OVERCOAT, standing on the front porch of Tom's own house in
          winter, waving to us to come up.

          CONTINUED:

          IN THE BASEMENT,
          Tom jerks his hand off the plastic. He swallows.
          He goes to hi= toolbox and pulls out a utility knife. He
          slides the ra or blade forward.
          He goes to one and of the plastic, bends down, and jams the
          knife through the sheeting. He walks the length of it, making
          a slit down the middle. He reaches out with shaking hands and
          pulls part of the plastic back.
          The first thing he sees is a partially decomposed human hand.
          Around the withered wrist, there are a half dozen multi-
          colored bracelets.
          Tom yanks the rest of the plastic away, revealing the half-
          decomposed body of Samantha Muller, still in the black dress
          with the diamond pattern. Tom stands there, his chest
          heaving.
          He looks at her hand, thinking.
          He sits down next to her.
          He reaches out for her hand, then pulls his own back.
          Can't do it.
          But he's gotta. He opens his hand, reaching out for hers. He
          slides his hand underneath --
          takes a deep breath --
          -- and closes his living fingers around her skeletal ones.
          He GASPS.
          His face turns a horrible shade of pale, his lips go ice blue,
          and STEAM comes out of his mouth, the way it did hers when he
          first saw her in his living room.

          EXT TOM'S HOUSE DAY
          It's a wintry day. That same steam rises up in front of us,
          coming from our own mouth. We're looking at the front porch
          of Tom's house as we walk past it. The house is being
          remodeled, it's surrounded by scaffolding, its windows covered
          with plastic Duvateen.
          The Figure in the Overcoat waves to us.

          I want to show you something!
          We look back, over our shoulder, then back at the Figure. You
          mean me? This close now, we see the Figure is Kurt Damon.

          SAMANTHA
          You want to show me something?
          Her manner of speech is childish, like a grade-schooler's.

          KURT

          (CHARMING)
          Well, of course! I don't see anybody
          else around!
          We start up the steps of the porch. Kurt smiles, beguilingly,
          and holds a hand out to us.

          SAMANTHA
          What is it?

          KURT
          It's a surprise.
          He tugs. She resists.

          SAMANTHA
          What kind of surprise?

          KURT
          Well, if I told you, it wouldn't be
          much of a surprise, would it?
          We let him pull us through the door.

          INT HOUSE DAY
           Kurt leads us into the living room. The windows are covered
           with tinted plastic, casting an eerie blue light through the
          place.
          Adam McCarthy is in the living - loom too, drinking from a
           bottle of schnapps. He's drunk, slurring. He sees us.

          ADAM
          Happy St. Patrick's Day.

          SAMANTHA
          What's the surprise?

          ADAM
          Uh... don't you have it?
          He giggles.

          KURT
          Oh yeah, the surprise.

          ADAM
          The surprise.
          They laugh and look at each other. Kurt drinks, then forces
          the bottle back at Adam.
          ADAM (cant' d)
          I'm too wasted.

          KURT
          Drink, motherfucker, drink
          motherfucker, drink motherfucker

          DRINK!
          He wrestles with Adam, forcing him to drink. Half of it runs
          down Adam's chin.

          SAMANTHA
          I don't think there is a surprise.
          We turn and start for the door. Kurt hurries around,
          intercepts us.

          KURT
          Yeah there is, yeah there is.
          He puts his arm around us, leads us back into the room.

          KURT (cont' d)
          The surprise is... we decided we want
          to be your friends.

          SAMANTHA
          You do?

          ADAM
          Oh, yeah, so bad.
          He laughs.

          SAMANTHA
          Why do you want to be my friend?

          KURT
          Are you kidding? Look at yourself!
          Kurt turns Samantha toward an old mirror that hangs over the
          fireplace. She's good-looking, if she knew it. Terribly
          insecure, doesn't even like looking at herself. We turn away,
          embarrassed.
          KURT (coast' d)
          Ah ah ah, look!
          He makes us look in the mirror again.
          KURT (cont' d)
          Mama, you are hot.
          He turns her toward him, looks at her, closely.
          KURT (coast' d)

          (SOFT)
          Come on, let's be friends.

          SAMANTHA
          Well.., you can kiss me if you want
          to.
          Kurt leans in close, kisses us. After a moment, we force our
          head away, looking down. Kurt's hand is on Samantha's breast.
          We push him back.
          SAMANTHA (cont'd)
          Not like that!
          But Kurt pulls us closer, roughly. We struggle.

          KURT
          Come on, Samantha, I'll be your
          friend, I swear I will.

          Just be nice to me. Be a good girl.
          You're a good girl, aren't you?

          SAMANTHA
          I have to go home.
          We struggle some more. He gets his powerful hanis on our
          shoulders and starts to push us down.

          KURT
          Come on, baby, how `bout a little
          helmet wash?
          His belt buckle comes into our view, and his hands on it. We
          tear away, get up and run for the door.
          From behind, something hits us very hard. The floorboards
          race up at us, all of a sudden. We land on them, hard, bounce
          off, our own blood spraying out on the unfinished wood.
          Our head lands sideways on the floor. We see Adam McCarthy,
          vomiting in the corner.
          Abruptly, we're rolled over and are staring at the ceiling.
          Kurt Damon is on top of us, his face too close. Her hands
          rise up, try to push him off, but he's stronger.
          Samantha starts to SCREAM. Hands close over our face. She
          bites, and the hands are pulled away. She SCREAMS again.
          KURT (cont' d)

          SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
          Kurt holds her down, begins to try to undress her. She
          writhes and SCREAMS. She gets one hand into Kurt's hair and
          pulls as hard as she can. He SHOUTS in pain.
          In the corner, Adam McCarthy has his hands over his ears.

          ADAM

          MAKE HER STOP! MAKE HER STOP

          SCREAMIN', MAN, MAKE HER STOP!
          But she keeps screaming. Adam staggers to a boom box that's
          sitting on the fireplace mantle and flicks a switch. A SONG
          comes on, loud. It's a haunting tune, we recognize it.
          St's the song Jake has been humming.
          Kurt continues his fumbling, drunken attempts at rape, tearing
          her hand out of his hair.

          KURT

          SHUT HER UP! USE YOUR JACKET OR

          SOMETHING'
          Adam lunges to the wall and tears down a sheet of the blts
          plastic Duvateen. He races over to us with the sheet --
          -- and everything turns blue. Now our sights and sounds aye
          muffled and distorted through the blue plastic. We see the
          image that has haunted Tom, the face of Kurt Damon, a blue
          demon as he grapples on top of us.

          IN TOM'S BASEMENT,
          Tom is sprawled out beside the corpse, their hands locked
          together. His color is cadaverous. He's suffocating. He
          thrashes.

          IN THE HOUSE,
          back in Samantha's point of view, we struggle, we thrash, it
          seems to go on forever. Slowly, the sounds become fainter and
          fainter and fainter...
          and everything stops. We hear the muffled voices of Kurt
          and Adam SCREAMING at each other.
          The sheet is ripped off. We stare up at them as Kurt and Adam
          stand above us, chests heaving, revolted looks on their faces,
          looking at us like we're a dog they just killed with their
          car.

          ADAM
          Oh, my God.

          KURT
          What the fuck did you do that for?

          ADAM
          Is she dead?

          KURT
          No shit she's dead.

          ADAM
          Oh, my God.

          KURT
          Look at her tongue, man.

          ADAM
          I'm not here.

          KURT
          I never saw nobody dead before.
          We start to fall back, and down, as if sinking into the floor.
          Kurt and Adam grow taller, further away. Their voices fade.

          ADAM
          I wish I wasn't here.

          KURT
          It's fuckin' gross.

          ADAM
          This isn't happening.

          KURT
          Fuckin' plastic over her face. Good
          thinkin', Adam.

          ADAM
          What do we do now?
          Kurt and Adam are very far away, blobs of light at the end of
          a black tunnel that's closing in around us. Just before
          everything goes completely black --

          INT BASEMENT NIGHT
          Tom's fingers twitch open and his hand pulls free of
          Samantha's. He opens his eyes and gulps air. The color
          returns to his face as he pulls his hand away from hers.
          But as he does so, he stops, staring intently at something in
          her fingers. We don't see what it is.
          Tom draws himself to his feet and climbs the ladder that leads
          upstairs.
          As he goes, we pause, looking between two rungs near the top
          of the ladder. In the darkened crawl space under the rest of
          the house --
          -- a pair of eyes stare at us.
          It's Kurt Damon. He twists around quickly and scoots back out
          under the house, the way he came in.

          EXT TOM'S HOUSE NIGHT
          Under the front porch, a wood frame access panel lies on the
          grass next to the foundation of Tom's house, where it has been
          removed. Kurt Damon wriggles out from under the house and
          comes onto the grass.

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          But the sound of the front door of Tom's house opening sends
          him scurrying back into the shadows. TOM'S FEET come down the
          steps and head off across the driveway.
          A moment later, Kurt darts out from'his hiding place and
          hurries across the street, toward his own house.
          "om, nearing the front steps of Frank's house next door,
          thought he heard something. He turns back, but Kurt is gone.
          Tom climbs the steps to Frank's house. Bouquets of flowers
          have been left here and there on the steps, along with a few
          candles and handwritten signs -- "Hang in there, Adam," "We
          Love You," that sort of thing.

          ON FRANK'S FRONT PORCH,
          Tom knocks on the front door. A moment later, Frank opens it.
          He looks devastated, shell-shocked, his eyes sunken from
          crying. He's wearing a red shirt we've seen before.

          TOM
          How's he doin'?
          Frank shrugs. Can't talk much.

          FRANK
          He might make it. Might not.
          Sheila's over there now, I'm headed
          back.

          TOM
          Frank, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
          because... I think I know why Adam
          shot himself. And I have to call the
          police about it. But I don't want you
          to hear it from them, I don't want
          Sheila to read it in the paper. You
          have the right to know before anybody
          else.

          FRANK
          What are you talking about?

          TOM
          Come with me.
          He nods toward his own house. Frank stares at him,
          frightened, but what could possibly be worse than what's
          already happened?

          FRANK
          Hang on a second.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          
          no. 

          CONTINUED:
          He turns and heads into the house. A few moments later he
          reappears, carrying his jacket.
          Tom leads him across the driveway. The Damon house is visible
          across the street. One by one, the 'lights flick on in its
          windows.
          Tom doesi.'t see. He and Frank reach the steps of his house
          and start up.
          FRANK (cont' d)
          This better be important.
          Tom doesn't answer, just opens the door and gestures for Frank
          to go first.

          INT DAMON GARAGE NIGHT
          In the Damon garage, HANDS scramble frantically through
          drawers and come up with a handgun. Now the hands find a box
          of bullets, shake them out onto a workbench.
          The hands load the gun.

          INT TOM & MAGGIE'S HOUSE NIGHT
          Tom closes and locks the front door. Frank looks at him ---
          well?
          Tom leads him toward the dining room.

          INT DAMON HOUSE NIGHT
          In the Damon house, the same hands pull on a pair of leather
          gloves. The gloved hands screw the top off a bottle of
          bourbon, raise the bottle to lips that drink heavily.

          INT DINING ROOM NIGHT
          Frank reacts to the ruined dining room. He looks at Tom.

          FRANK
          What the hell is goin' on around here?
          Tom goes to the trap door and lowers himself halfway through.
          Frank follows.

          INT DAMON HOUSE NIGHT
          The gloved hands carry the bottle of bourbon into the Damon
          living room, still under construction. The hands raise the
          bottle and offer it --

          gloves. Kurt looks terrified.

          HARRY
          Drink up. You got this'started,
          you're God damn well gonna help finish
          it.
          Kurt takes the bottle and drinks. He starts to lower it, but
          his father forces him to drink more, and more, until he nearly
          retches.

          INT TOM'S BASEMENT NIGHT
          Tom and Frank stand on opposite sides of the grave, staring
          down at the corpse of Samantha Muller. Frank is horrified.

          FRANK
          How did you find this?

          TOM
          Does it matter?

          FRANK
          You don't know it was Adam and Kurt.

          TOM
          It was.

          FRANK
          But there's nothing to... you're
          talking like a nut, that's what people
          will say. This is just a body, it
          doesn't prove anything.

          TOM
          No, it doesn't.
          He bends down and lifts Samantha's lifeless hand. He pries
          open her fingers.
          She's clutching a tuft of hair.
          TOM (cont' d)
          But this probably will.
          Frank stares for a long moment, struck dumb. Finally, he
          turns his back. His shoulders heave as he cries, silently.

          EXT OUR BLOCK NIGHT
          In the misty night, the figures of Harry and Kurt Damon come
          out of their house and skulk across the street, toward Tom's.

          Maggie drives, as fast as she can. Up ahead, red lights flash
          and gates fall in front of a set of railroad tracks. Train
          coming. Cars are stopped, waiting for it.
          Maggie pulls to a stop at the back of the line --
          -- then thinks better of it. She drops the car in gear, hauls
          it around the others, and bolts for the tracks. The train,
          nearly upon her, BLARES its horn.
          Maggie flies across the tracks and SLAMS through the gate on
          the other side, a split-second before the train HURTLES
          through the intersection behind her.
          She cuts it hard to the right to miss the waiting cars on the
          other side, and pulls it back on the road.
          She drives on, shaking like a leaf.

          INT BASEMENT NIGHT
          Frank is still sobbing, his back to Tom. Tom takes a step
          toward him, to comfort him.

          TOM

          FRANK-

          FRANK
          I mean...

          TOM
          Frank, we have to-

          FRANK
          I mean, what were we supposed to do?
          Tom stops.
          FRANK (cont' d)
          The kids come to us, she's already
          dead, the damage is done, there's
          nothin' gonna bring her back. But
          those boys, they've got everything
          ahead of them.
          Frank lets his jacket drop to the floor, revealing his right
          hand.
          He's holding the 38 with the carved white handle.
           He turns and looks at Tom.

          FRANK (coast' d)
          What were we supposed to do? Send our
          boys to jail for the rest of their
          lives? Our own flesh and blood? Over
          her?

          E3 T HOUSE NIGHT
          Hairy and Kurt Damon reach the front steps of Tom's house.
          They look up and down the block. There's no one out. No one
          to see.

          INT BASEMENT NIGHT
          Frank still has the gun hanging at his side, tears streaming
          down his cheeks.

          TOM
          Who you planning to shoot with that?

          FRANK
          Who do you think?

          TOM
          I think you haven't decided yet.
          He's right, and Frank knows it.

          FRANK
          Get out of here.

          TOM
          What are you gonna do, Frank?
          Frank raises the gun, in a fury.

          FRANK

          I BEEN LIVIN' WITH THIS FOR ALMOST A

          YEAR, YOU THINK ANYTHING YOU SAY IS

          GONNA MAKE ONE BIT OF DIFFERENCE TO

          ME?! GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!

          TOM
          Frank, I won't go until you-
          Frank aims the gun just to the left of Tom's head and pulls
          the trigger. The bullet CRACKS off the ladder.

          FRANK

          GET OUT! GET OUT!
          Tom starts up the ladder.

          INT DINING ROOM NIGHT
          Tom crawls out the trap door and hurries out of the dining
          room.

          INT LI"ING ROOM NIGHT
          Tom races ak. ross the living room, scoops hi: truck keys off
          the desk, opens the front door --
          and finds himself face to face with Harry Damon and his son
          Kurt. Harry SLUGS Tom in the face with the butt end of the
          gun.
          Tom falls to the floor, moaning. They step inside, quickly
          closing the door behind them. They don't speak.
          Kurt starts to drag Tom, who is still stunned, across the
          living room floor. Harry pulls a folded sheet of blue plastic
          from inside his jacket and spreads it out on the carpet.
          Kurt drags Tom into the middle of the plastic and drops him
          there. Tom is staring up at them, starting to regain his
          senses.

          KURT

          DON'T LOOK AT ME!

          HARRY

          ROLL HIM OVER!
          Kurt does. Tom, regaining his strength, starts to struggle,
          but Kurt puts his knee in the middle of. Tom's back and pulls
          his head back.
          Kurt is blubbering, hysterical.
          HARRY (con t' d)

          SHUT THE FUCK UP!
          Harry pulls the gun from his belt and raises it, putting it to
          the back of Tom's head.
          But then he lowers it, his hand shaking so hard he can barely
          hold onto it. He works up his nerve --
          HARRY (cont'd)

          AHHHHHH!!
          -- raises the gun again, puts it to the back of Tom's head,
          cocks it --

          CONTINUED:
          and a spray of headlights splashes across the far wall of
          the room.
          Nobody moves.
          Outside, they hear k car pull into the driveway and park. The
          engine shuts off.
          Kurt looks at his father, panicked.
          Harry looks down at Tom.
          Tom closes his eyes and prays.

          EXT DRIVEWAY NIGHT
          Maggie-pulls the keys from the ignition and gets out of the
          car. She walks toward the house, looking anxiously around the
          neighborhood.
          As she reaches the steps, the light in the living room window
          abruptly clicks off.
          She stops.
          She starts forward again, slowly. Now the porch light clicks
          off.
          It's real dark.
          Maggie digs the car keys out of her pocket and feels for
          something on the key chain. Something that's not there.

          MAGGIE
          Mace... shit.
          She starts up the stairs. She reaches the top. The last
          light that was on inside clicks off. Now the house is totally
          black inside.
          Remembering something, she pulls her purse around and feels
          inside it. She finds the butterfly knife, the one she found
          in Tom's pants. She holds it in her left hand, keys in her
          right.
          She goes to the door. She unlocks the deadbolt.
          Inside, she hears a SCURRYING sound.
          She unlocks the knob.
          She puts the keys back in her purse.

          CONTINUED:
          She switches the knife to her right hand, keeping it closed,
          concealed.
          She opens the door.

          INT LIVING ROOM NIGF.T
          The room is pitch black, so b:Aggie leaves the door hanging
          open. Some light spills in from the street.

          MAGGIE
          Tom?
          No answer. She steps inside and fumbles for a light switch.
          She flicks it. Nothing happens.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          Are you here?
          She crosses the room to another light and CLICKS its switch.
          As the light floods the room:
          Harry, who was hiding behind the front door, BANGS it shut.
          Kurt Damon is still kneeling on Tom's back, holding one hand
          roughly over his mouth, trying to keep him quiet.
          MAGGIE (cont'd)

          WH-
          Harry raises the gun in his hand and points it at Maggie.
          She lunges toward Tom, but Harry grabs her by the arm and
          flings her roughly to the ground.
          Tom takes advantage of the moment to flip Kurt off his back.
          As the kid flies, Harry whirls, training the gun on Tom.

          HARRY

          DON'T MOVE!
          But Tom tries to scramble to his feet. Harry starts to
          squeeze the trigger --
          -- and SCREAMS in agony.
          Looking down, he sees Maggie has plunged the knife into his
          thigh. She rips it out and plunges it in again. Harry's arm
          flies up, the gun goes off, and the bullet RIPS through the
          ceiling.

          

          

          

          

          INT JAKE'S ROOM NIGHT
          On the second floor, in Jake's bedroom (which Jake is not in)
          the bullet CRACKS up through the floorboards, tears through
          his mattress, and bursts through the little boy's pillow.
          The pillow explodes in a cloud of fea-hers, which fly
          everywhere.
          Feathers everywhere.

          INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT
          Tom crawls over to Maggie and grabs hold of her, putting
          himself between her and Harry, who still has the gun.
          Over at the fireplace, Kurt Damon pulls the poker out of its
          holder.
          Harry aims the gun.
          Kurt lunges forward with the poker.

          BANG! BANG!
          Two shots ring out from the doorway to the dining room. Harry
          clutches his chest and drops to the floor.
           They all turn. Frank stands in the doorway to the dining
          room, clutching his 38. Kurt rushes toward him, SCREAMING,
          poker raised high.
          Frank pulls the trigger two more times.
          Kurt goes down.
          Maggie SCREAMS. Tom huddles over her.
          Frank lets the weapon slip from his fingers. It hits the
          hardwood with a CLATTER.
          Tom and Maggie look up. Frank looks at them. In that red
          shirt, he is exactly the image Tom saw of him in his dream.

          FRANK
          They were gonna kill you, Tommy. You
          and Maggie both.
          Frank turns and walks to the front door. He opens it, walks
          out onto the porch, and sits down on the top step, facing the
          street.
          Tom looks at Maggie. They're both in shock, can hardly speak.

          You saved me. Baby, I'm alive be;ause
          of you...
          They hold each other.

          EXT FRONT PORCH NIGHT
          Tom comes out of the house. Frank, sitting on the top porch
          step, makes no attempt to flee. Tom sits down beside him.
          From all around the block, voices are starting to rise up --
          "Did you hear that?" "What the hell?!" "Somebody call a
          cop!" Frank shakes his head.

          FRANK
          Cold-blooded murder. I can't let
          something like that happen. Not here.
          He looks at Tom.
          FRANK (con t' d)
          This is a decent neighborhood.
          A few tentative faces gather across the street, staring at
          Tom's house, wondering what the hell. A SIREN wails in the
          distance.

          TOM
          I thought so, Frank. I sure as hell
          always thought so.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR DAY
          A NEWBORN BABY stares up at us from inside a rolling bassinet.
          The bassinet is wheeled swiftly down a hospital corridor by a
          NURSE. It's a long trip, wherever it's going, but the baby
          waits patiently, staring up at the ceiling, eyes open.
          Above the baby, the lights streak by, white blurs.
          The Nurse leans down and looks at the baby. To the baby,
          she's just a fuzzy blob.

          NURSE
          Almost there!

          CONTINUED:
          The baby turns and looks sideways. The doors of the hospital
          rooms whiz by, brown smears.
          NURSE (cont' d)
          Just around this corner!
          She rolls the bassinet around a corner and toward one or in
          particular.
          The baby sees a bunch of shapes inside the room.

          INT HOSPITAL ROOM DAY
          Maggie, who has recently given birth, struggles to sit up in
          bad as the Nurse rolls the bassinet into the room. Tom,
          grinning, gets up from the chair he's sitting in with Jake.

          NURSE
          Meet the family!
          She picks up the baby and holds her out to Maggie, who takes
          her eagerly.

          MAGGIE
          Hi, baby, did you sleep well? I sure
          didn't.
          The baby sees Maggie's face, blurry, but friendly.
          Tom leans in.

          TOM
          So you're the one that's been kicking
          my wife!
          The baby sees Tom's blurry face. Jake steps up, onto a step
          stool, so he can see over the edge of the bed.

          JAKE
          Let me see, let me see!
          Maggie turns the baby so she's facing Jake. The infant looks
          at her older brother. At first, his face is as blurry as
          everybody else's. But slowly, Jake's face becomes crystal
          clear, even though everything around him stays out of focus.
          JAKE (cont' d)
          Can I hold her?

          MAGGIE
          If you're very, very careful. Climb
          up here.

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          Jake climbs up on the bed. Maggie puts some pillows around
          him and carefully places the baby in his lap. Jake looks down
          at the infant. His expression becomes very serious. Gently,
          he reaches out with one hand and puts his fingertips on the
          baby's forehead, the same way he did to Tom's forehead that
          first night.
          The baby and Jake stare at each other for a long moment. So
          long, in fact, that the adults become uncomfortable.

          NURSE
          Well, they... certainly get along,
          don't they?
          Suddenly, Jake breaks into a wide grin and looks up at his
          parents, thrilled. Then he looks back at his sister. He
          leans down and whispers softly in her ear.

          JAKE
          Don't be afraid of s t.
          Tom and Maggie look at each other.

    FADE IN:

    ...on a BLACK WAVE - vast, oceanic, and coming right at us.
    BEGIN TITLES.

    The wave is relentless, huge, menacing. We can't tell if this
    is daytime or night because it simply obscures everything -
    noisily. It sucks, it yawns, it roars.

    Then we realize... this massive wave of darkness is actually
    just a RUN-OFF of dirty black WATER alongside the edge of an
    Interstate. We PULL OUT OF IT now...

    ...to find concrete, and garbage, and weeds. END TITLES.

1   EXT. DITCH - OFF THE INTERSTATE - 4:30 A.M.                      1

    Amongst the refuse is a discarded MILK CARTON, resting on its
    back. The carton asks "Have You Seen Me?" above a photographed
    face that's been obscured by grime.

    Yellowing newspaper, old Coke cans, Twinkie wrappers... in
    that bed of untended weeds. A hollow Texas wind blows through
    it all. We stay with the carton...

    Then that hollow wind gains speed... and a deep RUMBLE grows
    in the distance, becoming a ROAR. The yellowed newspaper lifts
    off and whips past us.

    ...as an 18-WHEEL MACK TRUCK blows by, just a blur in the
    corner of our frame, doing 75 in the pre-dawn darkness.

    Then, the truck is gone, and the rush of air dissipates. The
    milk carton, the coke cans... they lie undisturbed.

    A LIGHT RAIN begins to fall... and some of the grime washes
    away from that milk carton, revealing a face. A child. "Have
    You Seen Me?" It's heartbreaking.
    TILT UP... to take in the vast flatness of Texas' I-35:
    concrete forever. In the distance, gray highway yields to
    black STORMCLOUDS gathering silently over endless prairie.

    A vertical vein of LIGHTNING streaks through one of them.

                                                     CUT TO:

2   INT. "THE ALL-AMERICAN DINER" - GAINESVILLE TEXAS - CONTINUING 2
    (4:30 A.M.)

    HAROLD SPECK sits: mid 40's, pleasant face. A family man.
    Reads "Rod and Reel" magazine. Has a SALESMAN'S CASE by his
    side. Around him is a TRUCK-STOP in twilight:

    Truckers at the counter, Elvis on the wall, a "Drink Bud!"
    mirror. The WORLD SERIES can be heard on a RADIO...

                         DOLLY (O.S.)
               Top that off for ya, Hon?

    That's DOLLY, a waitress, (50, been here too long.) Speck
    looks up, smiles thinly, "No." Dolly heads off. Speck returns
    to his article, underlining a particular passage.

    ...until a MAN seats himself, suddenly, in the seat opposite
    Speck's. Speck reacts, startled.

                          SPECK
               Jesus...

    The MAN's name is O'RYAN. We only see PIECES of him: his eyes,
    his hands, a stain on his parka...

                         O'RYAN
               What's in the case?

                          SPECK
               I'm sorry?

                         O'RYAN
               You're always lugging that case around.
               I'm curious.

    Speck looks around: there are plenty of empty tables in here.
    So why is this guy bothering me???

                         O'RYAN (CONT'D)
               What do you sell?

                         SPECK
               I'm... in restaurant supplies. I didn't
               get your name?

                         O'RYAN
               Must travel a lot, huh?

    Speck is looking for Dolly, a Manager, anyone...

                         O'RYAN (CONT'D)
               Whole country, or just hereabouts?

                                                           3.


                     SPECK
           I don't mean to be rude but--

                     O'RYAN
           How's your wife feel about it?

That spun things a bit. Speck pauses.

                     SPECK
           What?

                     O'RYAN
           She must get lonely, with you gone all
           the time. Does she?

                     SPECK
           Look, I...

                     O'RYAN
           Do you get lonely?

Speck's so thrown now he can't answer.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Ya miss fucking her, Harold?

                     SPECK
           Listen, I don't know who you are but you
           can't--

O'Ryan silences him... by holding up a piece of paper. On it
is a DRAWING. The image faces away from us. But Speck can see
it in rich detail. And his eyes go wide.

We catch GLIMPSES: The color of flesh. A body-part. Looks like
a rendering of a young, naked WOMAN.

And, just like that, Speck finds himself STARING. Glued.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Did it myself. It's sort of a hobby.
               (no reply)
           I've got more. Would you like to see
           them?

O'Ryan lowers it and slides a SECOND DRAWING over... Speck is
speechless, transfixed. Can't look away.

                      O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Tell me: those jokes about the traveling
           salesman and the farmer's daughter - are
           they true?
                      (MORE)

                                                            4.


                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
               (Speck remains silent)
           Here. This one's my favorite.

O'Ryan slides over DRAWING #3. Again, we don't get to see it.
And we still haven't seen all of O'Ryan's face.

But we can see Speck, and his reaction. Utter horror. In fact
he recoils so violently that his coffee spills.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Really says it all, wouldn't you agree?

                     SPECK
           You're a... You're sick.

                     O'RYAN
           That's a matter of opinion.

                     SPECK
           You're sick!

He rises, leaving the drawings behind. We STAY WITH HIM as he
crosses the diner - deeply unsettled. He reaches the Manager,
(MEL, balding, 50, in no mood) at the register.

                      MEL
           Mmm-hmm?

                     SPECK
           I'm having a problem - with another
           customer. I'd like you to ask him to
           leave, please.

                     MEL
           What kind of problem?

                      SPECK
           He's--

He turns, to point out O'Ryan.

...but the booth, suddenly, is empty. The guy has simply
disappeared, taking those drawings with him.

Speck tightens. Mel eyes him, annoyed.

                                                  CUT TO:

                                                                 5.


3   EXT. ALL-AMERICAN DINER - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER             3

    Speck hurries out to his Buick, checking over his shoulder
    repeatedly. Gets to the car, fumbles with his keys. They fall
    to the asphalt. He grabs them, opens the door.

                                                       CUT TO:

4   INT. SPECK'S CAR - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER                        4

    Speck guns the Buick. Interstate 35 flies by. The farther he
    gets away from that Diner, the happier he'll be.

    ...until a strange SOUND gets his attention: it's WIND, as if
    whistling through a ghost town. Hollow, varied - building then
    falling off again. Wind.

    Trouble is, the windows in this Buick are up.

    Yet there it is again: a thin, hollow GHOST-TOWN WIND,
    whistling over his shoulder. He's heard it before - in every
    Western he ever watched as a kid.

    But this wind is coming from his back-seat.

    The blood drains right out of Speck's face. Doesn't know if he
    should jam on the brakes or drive faster.

    He looks in his rear-view, catches a glimpse of a LATEX GLOVE
    snapping onto a hand. Dear God: O'Ryan is back there, making
    that odd Ghost-Town wind sound. Whistling.

                          SPECK
                    (sheer terror)
               What-do-you-want?! What-do-you-want-with-
               me?!

    No reply. Instead, another gift appears from the back: a
    FOURTH DRAWING, tossed from the darkness into Speck's lap.

    He looks down, registers the image... and SHRIEKS.

                         O'RYAN (O.S.)
               There's a rest stop, next off-ramp. Pull
               into it.

                         SPECK
               I have some money. It's not a lot but--

                         O'RYAN
               Nobody wants your money, Harold. Just
               pull in.

                                                                 6.


                         SPECK
               Why?!

    O'Ryan rises into frame now, like Nosferatu...

                         O'RYAN
               Because I don't wanna do this at 70 miles
               an hour. It could be dangerous.

    Speck finds the off-ramp. His breaths are shallow now.

                         SPECK
               Please, Mister - what do you want from
               me?

    O'Ryan's face: a knowing grin fans across it...

                                                      CUT TO:

    ...the face of VIRGIL RAY STARKEY, on a bulletin board.

5   INT. F.B.I. RESIDENT AGENCY - WICHITA FALLS - MORNING (SAME       5
    DAY)

    We're looking at the F.B.I.'s "Ten Most-Wanted List." Starkey
    is #7 on it. He's 40, white. His crime are listed as rape,
    murder, kidnapping.

    THOMAS MACKELWAY stares at Starkey's image. At the eyes...

    Mackelway is 34, bred for success - bred for stardom in fact,
    a whiz at everything he's ever attempted.

    So what the hell is he doing in Wichita Falls, Texas...?

    EIGHT AGENTS, in cubicles, with a ring of outer offices. Quiet
    phones, lousy take-out options, hardly a dream gig.

                         CHARLTON (O.S.)
               Got a spot set up for you, Tom.

    That's RICK CHARLTON: late 40's, thinning hair, friendly.
    Charlton heads around a corner. Mackelway follows.

                         CHARLTON (CONT'D)
               Ms. Potter's the nice girl you met at the
               desk. She puts a package together for all
               the new agents, things to know about the
               area, help with finding apartments and
               such. This one's yours:

    Charlton stops at a CUBICLE: Carpeted walls, formica desk. A
    corner of dull Hell. Mackelway eyes it, fighting dread.

                                                                 7.



                         CHARLTON (CONT'D)
               Not so different from Dallas, is it?

                         MACKELWAY
                   (fuck yes)
               No, Sir.

                         CHARLTON
               Good.

    An abandoned SPORTS PAGE tells us about that World Series, so
    we must be mid-October. Charlton heads out. Mackelway throws a
    briefcase on to the desk, setting up his world:

    A framed picture of himself and his BROTHER, ages 10 and 15,
    on a childhood camping trip. Address book, coffee-warmer,
    calendar, a baseball covered with autographs.

    He opens up a drawer, and casually tosses two bottles of
    BUFFERIN into the back of it.

    ...but first grabs four tablets from one of the bottles,
    and throws them down his throat, as:

                         GRIEVES (O.S.)
               Ya like Frito Pies?

    Mackelway turns. BILL GRIEVES stands here, holding a white
    grease-stained paper-bag. Grieves is Mackelway's age, not
    quite as ambitious. But solid, decent.

                         MACKELWAY
               I dunno. What are they?

    Grieves pulls out a greasy concoction that's wrapped up like a
    semi-burrito. Pure Texas. Tosses it to Mackelway:

                         GRIEVES
               Welcome to the minors.

    Grieves passes by with a faint smile, handing out lunch to a
    few other agents. Mackelway eyes the still-wrapped Frito Pie.
    God, get me outta here...

                                                      CUT TO:

6   INT. WICHITA FALLS F.B.I. OFFICE - LATER                          6

    A BRIEF MONTAGE: Mackelway, in his cubicle, watching as THOSE
    OTHER AGENTS take calls, strap on guns, head out on
    assignment. Men in motion.

                                                                 8.


    But Mackelway's land-locked, writing up an Auto-Theft report.
    It's drudgery, but he's meticulous about it, deleting the word
    "beige" and replacing it with "tan."

    His head is throbbing - not an unusual circumstance for him.
    But after lingering for a half-second on that "Most-Wanted
    List" again? Starkey? It's a wound...

7   INT. F.B.I. OFFICE - KITCHENETTE - MOMENTS LATER                  7

    Mackelway struggles with a COFFEE MACHINE that's unfamiliar to
    him. Filter, water, grounds, etc.

                         KATIE (O.S.)
               Here. Lemme do that.

    He turns. This is KATIE POTTER. She's 25, friendly, under-
    challenged by her job. Been here two years. In two seconds
    she's got the thing percolating. Of course.

                         KATIE (CONT'D)
               It takes some experience.

    He shrugs, not feeling too smooth.

                         KATIE (CONT'D)
               You're Mackelway, right?

                          MACKELWAY
               Mmm-hmm.

                         KATIE
               Fax came in for you. It's the room next
               door.

                         MACKELWAY
               Oh. Thanks.

    He rises, heads for the "fax room"...

8   INT. "FAX ROOM" - CONTINUING                                      8

    A former closet, converted into useful space. FIVE FAX
    MACHINES sit on stands, sharing a surge protector. One fax
    machine is printing. Mackelway approaches it.

    Six pieces of paper await him. The first is a TOP-SHEET,
    written by hand: "Attention: Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI
    Resident Agency - Wichita Falls." No sender named.

    He looks beneath the top sheet - at Page One of the fax.

                                                                 9.


    A young BOY stares back at him, his face photostatically
    copied. Across the top, also-handwritten: "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?"
    At the bottom of the sheet, typed, we read:

    "Jason Corey, Age 14. Ht. 5'1", Wt. 130, Eyes Brn, Hair Brn.
    Last Seen: Riverside, Ca. Date of Disappearance: 10-16-99."

    Mackelway eyes the face, then the vitals. No idea why this was
    sent to him. Then he looks at Page Two.

    A young WOMAN stares back at him this time. Another faxed
    photo. Another "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?" scrawled across the top of
    it. And, at the bottom of the sheet:

    "Anna Casitas, Age 22. Ht. 5'6", Wt. 125, Eyes Brn, Hair Blk.
    Last Seen: Macon, Ga. Date of Disappearance: 5-6-00."

    The other three faxes are more of the same: Pictures and
    vitals. Faces. Facts. "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?"

    He looks at the bottom of the transmissions, finds the fax
    number of the sender. Dials it. All he hears back is the loud
    grainy shriek of a dedicated fax line.

    He eyes the faxes again. It's not alarming, but it's odd. Then
    Charlton emerges from his office, shouting:

                         CHARLTON
               Mackelway! You gonna sit on your ass all
               day, or do you wanna do something?

    Mackelway's out of this room in an instant.

                                                       CUT TO:

9   EXT. REST STOP - OFF THE INTERSTATE - DAY                         9

    Your standard roadside rest-stop: a parking lot with weeds
    poking through it and bathrooms you wouldn't go near. Those
    STORMCLOUDS we saw earlier are CLOSER now...

    POLICE CARS and HIGHWAY PATROL MOTORCYCLES fill this site.
    Charlton's FBI SEDAN pulls up. He and Mackelway get out.

    Two men approach: SHERIFF HARRY DYLAN, 50; and his deputy, BUD
    GRANGER, a gangly, baby-faced pup.

                         DYLAN
               Afternoon, Rick.
                   (Charlton nods)
               Looks like a robbery/homicide. Body's
               over that way.

                                                                 10.


     He gestures toward a ravine, where a TOW TRUCK is currently
     lowering a winch toward an abandoned vehicle.

     It is Harold Speck's Buick, nose-down in the ravine, teetering
     on a rock, like the balanced scales of justice.

                          MACKELWAY
                Ya run the plates?

     Charlton eyes Mackelway: "Easy, Hot-shot." Mackelway nods,
     reminding himself to remember his new rank. Dylan hands a
     preliminary report to Charlton.

                          DYLAN
                Fella's name is Harold Speck. Traveling
                salesman, from Abilene.

     Charlton eyes the report, then hands it to Mackelway. The
     hierarchy is being made clear. Very.

     Mackelway turns: this ravine runs right up against a SIGN that
     reads "Welcome to Texas" on one side and "You are now leaving
     Oklahoma" on the other.

     A vehicle, left right on the state-line. Odd...

     Then, a NOISE: that Tow-Truck WINCH, grinding badly. It's just
     about to yank the Buick out of this ditch.

                          MACKELWAY
                    (it blurts out)
                Hey!

     Before Charlton can react, Mackelway is running across this
     weed-choked lot, zeroing in on the TOW-TRUCK DRIVER.

10   EXT. ATOP THE RAVINE - CONTINUING                                 10

     The Driver, JUMBO, is operating the winch from a hydraulic
     handle on the back of the truck. Mackelway barrels in:

                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                What the fuck're you doing?!

                          JUMBO
                What's it look like, Bud?

     Mackelway reaches past Jumbo and hits the "Stop" button
     himself. The winch shuts down. Mackelway turns. A handful of
     LOCAL COPS stand atop this ravine, watching.

                                                                 11.


                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                You guys ever heard of evidentiary
                procedure?

     No one replies. Charlton approaches. Mackelway tightens,
     expecting a reprimand for overstepping his bounds.

                          MACKWELWAY (CONT'D)
                Sorry, Sir. There wasn't time.

     Charlton eyes the car. Then Mackelway.

                          CHARLTON
                Did the right thing, Agent Mackelway.
                Let's have a look.

     Charlton starts down the embankment. Mackelway doesn't,
     hanging back as he eyes the TRACKS this Buick made before
     tumbling. Something about them...

     He pulls a small CAMERA from his pocket, a Minox. Snaps off a
     few photos of the scene - the Buick, the ravine, those tracks,
     some FOOTPRINTS alongside them.

     Then he heads down the 15-foot embankment.

11   EXT. RAVINE - CONTINUING                                          11

     It's an ugly sight. Speck is inches from us, but his head is
     facing in the other direction, twisted unnaturally.

     Mackelway kneels beside the open window, pulls out some
     gloves, puts them on. He will not lean on the car, or even
     breathe on it, his caution around evidence obvious.

                          CHARLTON (O.S.)
                What's that?

     Charlton is opposite him, outside the passenger-side window,
     pointing at the DRAWING that O'Ryan had tossed onto Speck's
     lap. It lies face down on the seat.

     But something's been FINGER-PAINTED on the back of it: A
     RED CIRCLE, with a SLASH through it.

     Charlton begins to reach for it, when:

                          MACKELWAY
                    (to stop him)
                Sir?

     Charlton stops. Mackelway indicates: "Gloves."

                                                            12.


Charlton eyes him. It's irritating being corrected by a guy
you outrank, especially when he's right.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Sort of a... stickler for procedure.

                     CHARLTON
           I imagine you would be.

That was a jab, but we don't know it yet. Charlton puts on his
gloves. Mackelway snaps off a few more shots with that Minox,
looking over the rest of this car, as:

                     GRANGER
               (aloud)
           Hey Jumbo. Toss me down a crowbar.

Granger's by the trunk. Before Mackelway can comment, Jumbo
has tossed a CROWBAR down from the top of the embankment: a
ten-pound hunk of iron, flying right at us.

Everybody ducks... as it CLANGS on the roof of the Buick.
Jumbo shrugs.

                     JUMBO
           You said toss it.

Mackelway shakes his head. "Shitkicker." Granger grabs the
crowbar. He's just about to open the trunk as:

                     MACKELWAY
           Hold it a second.

Granger pauses. Mackelway crosses to the trunk, and snaps off
a few shots with the Minox.

Something catches his eye, along the line of the TRUNK. He
kneels closer... An odd RESIDUE, crusty and hard, has formed a
thin line on top of the paint in a single post.

He takes out a VIAL, and scrapes some of the residue into it.
Then he sniffs it. Pauses...

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Smells like... clove.

He looks to Granger: now you can open the trunk.

                     DYLAN
               (re: Mackelway)
           Where the hell'd you find this guy?

                                                                 13.


                          CHARLTON
                Field Office. Dallas.

                          DYLAN
                    (impressed)
                Well now...
                    (Charlton shrugs)
                So what the hell's he doin' here?

     That one is left unanswered. Granger opens the trunk.
     Mackelway and the others look inside...

     There, they find restaurant supplies: napkin dispensers, salt-
     shakers, ketchup dispensers, a short-order wheel... And a
     fishing reel, tackle-box, a kid's bicycle helmet.

     Mackelway eyes it all, but his instincts tell him there's
     nothing significant here. So he returns to Speck's body.

     He leans in, lifts Speck's head a few inches away from the
     steering wheel. Gently.

     ...which is when we learn that Speck's EYELIDS have been torn
     off. It's gruesome, but Mackelway notes it calmly. Charlton
     leans in, gets a look.

                            CHARLTON
                Christ...

     Mackelway is expressionless. But something about these LIDLESS
     EYES draws him closer. He leans in, then BAM! We are rocketed
     into a series of dark, disjointed images:

12   EXT. A WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT                                        12

     Seems like we're standing in a field of TALL WHEAT; we can't
     say for sure. Everything's wet, wind-whipped.

     A MUZZLE FLASH... Someone just fired a gun. We slump hard to
     the ground. Then we look up.

     Mackelway stands over us, his face wet with rain. Then, just
     as quickly, those IMAGES VANISH and we are:

13   INT. UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - GRAHAM TEXAS - DAY                 13

     We start on the EYES OF O'RYAN. Cross-Dissolve to a pad of
     paper, on a DESK. Scrawled on the pad is a WAVY LINE. He holds
     the tip of that pen upon it, for a few seconds, as if
     expecting to get some kind of pulse from it.

     Here come those IMAGES again: wet wheat, a muzzle flash,
     Mackelway. Choppy, disjointed, dark. Then they cease...

                                                                 14.


     ...and O'Ryan begins to DRAW, hurriedly. Only half of his face
     is visible to us, but we can tell that his concentration is
     total.

     His pen continues its furious work, a spasm of activity, as
     the SOUNDS of that vision bleed in: the gun-shot, the rain,
     the wind. They're all alive in O'Ryan's mind...

     And that DRAWING takes shape quickly: The wheat field, the
     gun, Mackelway.

     Then, the pen is set down. The drawing is complete.

     O'Ryan eyes it calmly, then checks his watch, jotting down the
     exact time and date on to the drawing. Then he slips it into a
     folder marked, "MACKELWAY."

                                                       CUT TO:

14   EXT. SPECK'S HOME - ABILENE, TEXAS - ESTAB. DAY                   14

     Picket fence, a swing on the porch, a lawn that needs mowing.
     A LINE OF PEOPLE file in, each bringing food... and tissues to
     cry into.

15   INT. SPECK'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)             15

     Shocked faces. Food on unmatching trays. Speck's wife - JAN,
     40 and frayed - sits in a chair, immobile. FRIENDS and FAMILY
     mill about, tending to her.

     KIDS hover. Two of them, a 4-YEAR-OLD BOY and an 8-YEAR-OLD
     GIRL, sniff back tears as people offer condolences.

     But the focus here is Jan - her grief. She's shaking...

                          O'RYAN (O.S.)
                Mrs. Speck?

     She looks up. O'Ryan crouches down, to eye-level, one of fifty
     faces in here. Jan half-nods.

                          O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                Just wanted to offer my condolences.
                    (takes her hand)
                I didn't know him well but... I think
                Harold was a much more complex man than
                people realized.

     Jan is so raw that anything about Speck touches her now.

                                                                  15.


                          JAN
                    (through tears)
                He was, wasn't he?

                          O'RYAN
                I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

     She sniffs back a tear, thanks him with a smile. O'Ryan
     extends his hand to her. She takes it. He moves off.

     Beside her is a FRAMED PORTRAIT of Speck. We blow past it, and
     into the BLACK CREPE that is adorning the corner of the
     portrait's FRAME, and:

     BAM! We're rocketed back into a set of odd IMAGES again:

16   EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME                                  16

     This time, everything before us is a blur of gray. We hear
     that wet wind. We hear our own heavy BREATHING, as if we were
     running somewhere... a VOICE, rising above the wind, seems to
     be saying:

                            (O.S.)
                Please...

     The sound echoes oddly, as if bouncing off a satellite
     somewhere, or a distance of time and space.

     Then the sound and the soupy grayness VANISH. This vision just
     ended. When we pop back out of it, we're TIGHT on Mackelway...

                                                        CUT TO:

17   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - PARKING LOT - GAINESVILLE 10:30 P.M. 17

     Mackelway sits behind the wheel of his Chevy Yukon, parked
     between two big-rigs in the lot of the "All-American Diner."
     Sky looks black tonight. It rumbles...

     And that soupy gray vision we just heard and saw... It was all
     his.

     He pulls four more Bufferins out of a bottle in his pocket.
     Slugs them down. This headache is a constant. Then he gets out
     of the Yukon...

18   INT. ALL-AMERICAN DINER GAINESVILLE - CONTINUING                   18

     Mackelway enters, spots Charlton at a booth - sitting opposite
     a WOMAN, her back to us.

                                                               16.


19   INT. BOOTH - CONTINUING                                         19

     Mackelway approaches. The Woman doesn't turn.

                           CHARLTON
                Agent Mackelway. I was 'bout to introduce
                you, but I understand that won't be
                necessary.

     Mackelway doesn't get it... until the WOMAN turns. She is
     AGENT FRAN KULOK. 35, sharp, pretty when she allows herself to
     be. But with a guard that never comes down.

     Mackelway has some history with her, so he tries not to react.
     It takes some effort.

                          CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                Seems your former office has decided we
                might need some help on this one. So they
                sent out Agent Kulok.

                          FRAN
                Tom.

                          MACKELWAY
                Fran.

     That was terse, from both of them. Charlton takes note.

                          CHARLTON
                I guess we're skipping the tearful
                reunion. Have a seat, Tom.

     Mackelway sits opposite Fran. She folds her hands.

                          MACKELWAY
                How's things back at the ranch?

                          FRAN
                Movin' right along.

     That might've been a dig; Charlton can't tell.

                          CHARLTON
                Okay. Whadda we know?

                          FRAN
                Picked up a foot-print in the back seat
                of Speck's car, size-and-a-half bigger
                than Speck's.

     Just like that, Fran is piping up. Mackelway's unoffended.

                                                         17.


                       CHARLTON
           'Kay.

                     FRAN
           Wounds on Speck's throat indicate that he
           was strangled from behind... I think our
           guy waited for him in the backseat,
           sprung this on him once the car was
           moving.

She slides that FOURTH DRAWING to Charlton - giving us our
first look at it.

INSERT - THE DRAWING:

...a STEAMER-TRUNK, lined with plastic. Inside it are large
ZIPLOC BAGS. Inside the bags are BODY PARTS.

It's realized so accurately that it looks more like a
photograph. No wonder it horrified Speck so deeply.

THE BOOTH - RESUMING

Charlton eyes it without reaction.

                     FRAN (CONT'D)
           Lab picked up talcum traces on the edges
           of the paper, consistent with powdered
           gloves.
               (Charlton nods)
           So he gets the dropped in his lap, it
           spooks him, and the car winds up in the
           ravine.

Plausible enough, until:

                     MACKELWAY
           I don't think so, no. I think it was
           pushed.

                     FRAN
           How ya figure?

                     MACKELWAY
           The look of the tracks. Foot-prints near
           the embankment.

Without embellishing any further, he slides over the
PHOTOGRAPHS that he took this morning with the Minox: tire-
tracks, foot-prints. She eyes them.

Then she eyes Mackelway. Charlton notes the tension.

                                                           18.


                     CHARLTON
           Okay. So our guy likes to draw pictures
           of body parts and then spring 'em on
           people. What's that get us?
               (they're silent)
           That's what I thought.

There is plenty going unsaid here between Mackelway and Fran.
Charlton has no time for it.

                     CHARLTON
           Oh. 'Fore I forget. This came in for you:

He tosses a 9-by-12 ENVELOPE at Mackelway, who opens it. Six
sheets of paper slide out.

First one we see is the TOP SHEET of a FAX: same hand-written
inscription as the last one: "Attention, Agent Thomas
Mackelway, FBI Resident Agency, Wichita Falls."

Okay. This is twice now. He knows what will be under this top
sheet without even looking. But here's Page One:

A photo of a middle-aged African-American WOMAN. Across the
top of the photo, in hand-writing: "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?"

And typed on the bottom: "Tanya Green. Age 42. Ht. 5'9", Wt.
165, Eyes Blk, Hair Blk. Last Seen: Ames, Iowa. Date of
Disappearance: 3-22-97."

The following four sheets bring four more faces: men, women,
young, old. Four more HAVE YOU SEEN ME's.

But before he can think it through, he hears:

                     MANAGER (O.S.)
           It's about time.

They turn. That came from the NIGHT MANAGER: a humorless guy
named LES. He's looking at the front door, through which Dolly
has just entered. Pink cowboy boots tonight.

                     DOLLY
           Don't start in on me, Les. I couldn't get
           the pickup started and Harlan took the
           Dodge.

The Manager now throws a glance at the three feds in the
booth. Dolly stops short, taken aback.

                                                                 19.


                           DOLLY (CONT'D)
                 Holy Hell. My one shot at winding up on
                 "Cops" and I'm in my weekday boots!

                                                       CUT TO:

20    INT. DINER - BOOTH - LATER                                       20

      Dolly and Mel sit opposite Mackelway and Fran.

                           DOLLY
                 He was a quiet guy. Normal. Liked to read
                 fishing magazines. Not much of a tipper.
                 Is that a lousy thing to say?

                            FRAN
                 It's fine.

      Mel rolls his eyes.

                           MACKELWAY
                 What can you tell us about the other man?

                           MEL
                 Like I said, I never really saw him.
                 Harold came up, complainin' about the guy
                 - but time I turned, he was gone.

                    FRAN                      MACK
              (at Dolly:)               (at Dolly:)
          Could you de--            Did you get a--

     They each stop short, waiting for the other to yield. Finally
     Mackelway nods, "Go ahead."

                           FRAN
                 Can you describe him, Ma'am?

                           DOLLY
                 Sure. He was...

      Dolly pauses, her face scrunching a bit. Troubled...

                           DOLLY (CONT'D)
                 That's weird. Guy was in here better part
                 of an hour. We had a real pleasant
                 chat... But I can't remember a thing
                 about him. For the life of me. Couldn't
                 even tell you what color his eyes were.

      She shrugs apologetically.

                                                                 20.


                          FRAN
                Happen to see what he was driving?

                           DOLLY
                That one's easy. It's still in the lot.
                    (they perk up)
                The Bonneville out there with the awful
                paint job.

     She gestures to the lot, where an old PONTIAC BONNEVILLE sits,
     its paint stripped down to the primer. Bingo.

     Fran and Mackelway eye it, then one another.

                                                       CUT TO:

21   EXT. DINER - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER                          21

     Fran and Mackelway emerge, heading for the Bonneville.

                          MACKELWAY
                We ought to work out some kind of
                protocol.

                            FRAN
                For what?

                          MACKELWAY
                Interviews. Witnesses. Looks pretty
                silly, our talking over one another.

                          FRAN
                Fine. I'll handle them from now on.

     He doesn't argue. They come to a stop at that Bonneville,
     stripped down to its primer. Time to work...

     Two agents, all instinct. We see them study things, details,
     their minds always churning... Mackelway pulls out his Minox,
     snaps off a few more shots. Then:

                          MACKELWAY
                Trunk's ajar.

     She turns. Sure enough, the Bonneville's trunk is ajar.
     Mackelway approaches, cautiously.

     He doesn't have gloves on him, so he uses his jacket pocket to
     protect against prints. He opens the trunk.

     First thing he sees is that SYMBOL again: a circle-with-a-
     slash-through-it... staring right at him.

                                                                 21.


     But this time, it's been carved into somebody's back.

     Mackelway stares. So does Fran. Before them lies a body,
     stripped to the waist: a chunky middle-aged MAN. Dead.

     Mackelway sighs. Things just got tougher...

                                                      CUT TO:

22   INT. ARCHER COUNTY MORGUE - DAY                                   22

     Harold Speck lies on a table. A BESPECTACLED CORONER examines
     him. Victim #2, BARNEY FULCHER, lies on another, his ample
     frame yet to be examined.

     The lights are out, but that Coroner wears a FLUORESCENT HALO,
     with a MICROPHONE pinned to his gown. He speaks into it with a
     quiet monotone: anatomical terms, etc.

     Mackelway and Fran are here... watching. Mackelway is
     particularly focused on Fulcher's face. His EYELIDS, we now
     see, have also been torn off. Hmmmm...

                          FRAN
                Why eyelids?

                          MACKELWAY
                Huh?

                          FRAN
                No other signs of torture here. Why take
                somebody's eyelids off?

                          MACKELWAY
                So they can't blink.

     She sighs, aloud: "I know that already, Asshole." Coroner
     keeps his head down, speaking into that microphone.

                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                It's a metaphor - to make certain the
                victim sees... or to make certain that we
                see something.
                    (she's silent)
                Or maybe it's just a fuck-you.

     Coroner continues his monotone narration... then crosses to
     the sink.

     That puts him out of earshot. So:

                                                                  22.


                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                    (to Fran, quietly)
                I'm sorry about Don.

                          FRAN
                    (thrown)
                Huh?

                          MACKELWAY
                You're not wearing your ring anymore.

     That was an attempt at kindness. She knows that. Still, she
     eyes her left hand, self-consciously, while Mackelway loses
     himself in those lidless eyes of Fulcher's...

     Then there's a KNOCK AT THE GLASS WINDOW BEHIND THEM.

     They turn. Charlton stands on the other side of a GLASS
     WINDOW, in a VIEWING ROOM adjacent to this Morgue. He presses
     a piece of paper up against the glass.

     On it, in typed bold letters at the top, we read: "MATCHES
     ONE OF ONE." Below that we see that Circle-with-the-slash-
     through-it.

     This is a FAX, which Charlton's just received. He points
     further down on the fax at what look like little squiggles at
     first, until we move in to discover it is a hand drawn street
     map.

     The ink bleeds a bit due to a poor fax transmission. Those
     scrawled lines take us to "The Hope House," in Oklahoma City.
     At the bottom a scribbled name, "David Dyson," and a contact
     number.

     Moving closer to the glass, Mackelway nods. He just got a
     break...

                                                        CUT TO:

23   INT. GRAMMAR-SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - BOULDER, CO. - DAY                23

     A CHOIR of FIRST AND SECOND GRADERS stands before a school
     assembly. The rest of Boulder Elementary's student body fills
     the seats in here, along with FACULTY MEMBERS.

     Everybody's weeping. A framed picture of Barney Fulcher sits
     on a stand, with candles around it:

                          SINGING FIRST AND SECOND GRADERS
                A-may-zing Grace, How sweet the sound--

                                                                 23.


     In the back, some of the TOWNSFOLK have gathered for this
     assembly, touched. O'Ryan stands among them. No expression on
     his face at all...

                                                     CUT TO:

24   EXT. "HOPE HOUSE" - OKLAHOMA CITY - NIGHT                         24

     A three-story Victorian residence in decay, next door to a
     CHURCH/SOUP KITCHEN in the middle of Oklahoma City's Skid Row.
     Rain falls. The street is still.

     Mackelway approaches this halfway-house. A few lights shine
     within, and the blue glow of a tv. Upstairs can be heard the
     strident, off-key voice of somebody singing.

25   EXT./INT. HOPE HOUSE - DOORWAY - CONTINUING                       25

     The front door is open. Through a SCREEN DOOR, Mackelway can
     see an old-fashioned "foyer." He knocks. Waits.

     Two sounds dominate: the buzz from that tv, and the strident
     singing, which we realize is an a capela version of "La Vida
     Loca" audible through an open bedroom window.

     But no one's coming to answer the door, and it's wide open
     anyway... So Mackelway enters.

                          MACKELWAY
                Hello?

26   INT. HOPE HOUSE - ENTRY - CONTINUING                              26

     TV room is to his left. There, a single 35 year-old DRUNK/
     TRANSIENT (we'll call him "PIPER") sits, watching "Behind the
     Music" on VH1. Tonight's subject? Leif Garret...

     Piper doesn't look up, or acknowledge Mackelway at all. Rather
     he INCREASES THE TV VOLUME to drown out the singing upstairs,
     which seems to be intentionally off-key.

     Torn couches, stained carpet, cracked window. Posters and
     fliers on the walls. 10 BEDROOMS upstairs.

                          DYSON (O.S.)
                Agent Mackelway?

     Mackelway turns. Descending a creaking stairway is DAVID
     DYSON: 50, lean, with a friendly smile.

                                                      CUT TO:

                                                               24.


27   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER                      27

     We are staring at a BASEMENT WALL that has been covered, floor
     to ceiling, with 1,000 identical renderings of that same
     symbol: the CIRCLE-WITH-A-SLASH-THROUGH-IT.

     1,000 of them, in bright red paint, against pitch black
     enamel. Only a machine could have achieved this kind of
     repetition. Or a maniac.

     This basement is leaky, drafty, poorly lit. But it's also
     quiet: the sound of that awful singing upstairs has been MUTED
     by the basement door and the rain itself.

                          DYSON
                Benjamin spent hours down here.

     Mackelway takes it all in, every corner of this basement. He
     notes a row of standing GYM LOCKERS.

                          MACKELWAY
                    (re: lockers)
                Did he have access to those?

                          DYSON
                No. They're staff-only.

                          MACKELWAY
                Would you mind opening them for me?

     Dyson shrugs; he thinks it's a waste of time - but he'll do
     it. Mackelway follows him across the dank room.

                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                He was here... seven years you said?

                          DYSON
                Off and on. It's not uncommon for our
                guests to vanish for months at a time.

     Dyson works a combination lock on the first locker.

                          MACKELWAY
                I ran the name through our database, just
                to be sure. There's never been an Agent
                Benjamin O'Ryan in the Bureau.

                          DYSON
                No... but as elaborate fantasies go, it
                was one of my favorites.
                    (fondly)
                And he always seemed so sincere about it.

                                                          25.


Dyson half-chuckles; he always liked the guy... He throws open
the locker. Inside, nothing. Mackelway indicates the next
locker. Dyson works the combination.

                     MACKELWAY
           Is that what you called him? Benjamin?

                     DYSON
           It's what he wished to be called.

Locker #2 is opened - also empty. Only one locker left.

                     DYSON (CONT'D)
               (re: locker #3)
           That one's mine.

Mackelway shrugs: "Sorry, it has to be opened." Dyson sighs,
then works the combination. Mackelway waits.

Locker #3 is opened. Inside, nothing incriminating: a sweater,
some old junk, two trophies. Dyson eyes him: "See?" Mackelway
nods. Dyson shuts the locker.

Mackelway looks to that wall: 1,000 copies of the circle-with-
a-slash-through-it. No idea what they signify...

                     DYSON (CONT'D)
           He painted one of the walls in his room,
           too.

                     MACKELWAY
           Can I see it?

                     DYSON
           We've painted it over.

                     MACKELWAY
           Still, might be helpful.

Dyson heads for the stairs. They're wooden slats with more
basement-junk stored below: old sporting equipment, an old
vaccuum cleaner, broken chairs, rusted patio furniture.

Mackelway follows. They climb...

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Wait.

They stop. Something just caught Mackelway's eye, visible
beneath these stairs: a BOX, with a bucket of PAINT sticking
out of it...

                                                                26.


28   INT. BASEMENT - BENEATH THE STAIRS - CONTINUING                  28

     Mackelway climbs under the stairs, crouching down, pushing
     aside all of the aforementioned junk. He grabs the box.

     Sure enough, that bucket once held red paint - same color
     O'Ryan used to cover that wall. There's also a bucket of BLACK
     PAINT here. And some used brushes.

     Mackelway brings the box into the meager light. We get a look
     INSIDE IT now. So does Dyson.

     Inside, beneath the paint-buckets, we see a few TV GUIDES, a
     yo-yo, a football. Then a BOOK on TRIBAL RITUAL AND TRANCE.
     Mackelway grabs it, eyes it.

     He flips through a few pages - odd images: a TRIBESMAN with
     eyes rolling back in his head, strange rites, etc.

     Mackelway sets the book down. Then, amidst the other materials
     in this box, he spots a large folded MAP.

     He grabs it, begins to unfold it. We see that this map's been
     written on, in pen. Cities on it have been CIRCLED.

     But before we can get a good look at it, Mackelway spots
     something else, at the bottom of this box, a shocker:

     A photograph of himself.

     It takes him a second to realize what he's looking at. But
     there it is, a NEWSPAPER PHOTO, of Agent Thomas Mackelway.

     It is part of a FRONT-PAGE STORY, dated July of this year,
     concerning the trial and release...of Virgil Ray Starkey. #7
     on the F.B.I.'s Most-Wanted List...

     Dyson can't help but notice the picture of Mackelway.

     Mackelway stares. Suddenly we JUMP BACK IN TIME, NINE MONTHS,
     for a brief, choppy FLASHBACK.
                                                                      29
29   EXT. STREET - MATAMOROS - NIGHT - MACKELWAY'S FLASHBACK
     We're RUNNING, dashing between two buildings of chipped-adobe,
     hearing nothing but the sound of our own breathing and the
     thuds of our own heavy feet.

     This is Matamoros, Mexico, a shit-hole of a border town.
     Squalor and sin. We find a DRUNK MEXICAN TEEN. He nods: "This
     is the place," and sticks out his palm.

                                                              27.


30   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                          30

     Mackelway stares at that newspaper: Starkey - rapist,
     murderer, whose case was just thrown out of court - a stunning
     failure for all involved.

     ...as we RESUME MACKELWAY'S FLASHBACK - Matamoros again...

31   INT. "CLUB" - BACKSTAGE - RESUMING FLASHBACK                   31

     Bad-lighting, drunk patrons in a CIRCLE, and a DONKEY-SHOW
     taking place on a bare stage. Feels like we've stepped into
     some kind of evil carnival. It's dizzying.

     Among the crowd: Virgil Starkey, in an ugly drunken binge, the
     only guy in here who isn't cheering or laughing.

     Suddenly our GUN is pointed right at his head.

     Starkey freezes, caught. Some of the PATRONS around him find
     somewhere else to stand... But the show goes on.

32   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                          32

     That ARTICLE gives us more detail now, the reason Starkey's
     case was thrown out of court. It is this:

     The F.B.I. Agent on the case had made a mistake in
     "evidentiary procedure." Hence, Mackelway's picture.

     On his face, we GO BACK TO ANOTHER MEMORY: six months ago.

33   INT. COURTHOUSE - ANTEROOM - DAY - ANOTHER FLASHBACK           33

     Three months have passed since the arrest in Matamoros. Now
     Mackelway sits in this courthouse ANTEROOM, adjacent to a
     courtroom. Four sour PROSECUTORS surround him.

                          PROSECUTOR #1
                D'you understand how fucked we are?

                            MACKELWAY
                Yes, Sir.

                          PROSECUTOR #1
                Leaving a tissue sample in the care of a
                Mexican lab? Are you fucking kidding me?

                          MACKELWAY
                They assured me that they understood
                protocol.

                                                                 28.


                          PROSECUTOR #1
                Well guess what? They didn't. And this
                prick's gonna walk, ten murders or not.

     That registered.

34   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                             34

     Beneath this newspaper article are OTHER ARTICLES, all
     concerning Starkey: his crimes, his capture, all of it.

     Mackelway's memory just got stoked again:

35   INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - RESUMING FLASHBACK                    35

     Mackelway emerges from that courthouse anteroom, whipped.

     The hall's busy with MEDIA and other traffic. First face he
     sees is Fran, who sits on a bench, (wedding ring ON). Her eyes
     say how lousy she feels for him. It almost helps.

36   INT. COURTHOUSE BATHROOM - CONTINUING FLASHBACK                   36

     The door bursts open and Mackelway storms in. No need to look
     composed now; he's alone in here. He crosses to a paper-towel
     dispenser, SLUGS IT. Stares in the mirror.

     He's livid, embarrassed, frustrated - can barely look at his
     own reflection.

     Then he hears LAUGHTER, behind him. He turns.

     Out of the darkness of a badly-lit STALL, Virgil Starkey
     emerges, coming into view under a single light.

     Beside him is a GRIM COP, his chaperone. Starkey passes by
     Mackelway, almost snickering. Then he's gone. Mackelway shuts
     his eyes tight. His head is pounding. END FLASHBACK.

37   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                             37

     Mackelway stares... at a record of his deepest wound. But what
     the hell is it doing in the locker of a transient?

                                                       CUT TO:

38   INT. HOPE HOUSE - "O'RYAN'S ROOM" - MOMENTS LATER                 38

     Mackelway leans in, looking around. A bed. A small end-table.
     Bathroom. A window without bars.

                                                               29.


     From down the hall we hear the sound of a PHONE RINGING, then
     a FAX transmission. An old fax machine begins to whine
     noisily, creaking. It's a distraction.

     But Mackelway's focus is in this room. The walls have been newly
     painted. But there's a hint of barely-perceptible color
     beneath one of them. Rain from a LEAKY ROOF is causing some of
     the new paint to peel a bit.

     A BUCKET collects drops in the center of the room. The feeling
     in here is damp, mildewy, creepy. Mackelway remains in the
     doorway... then backs out.

                          DYSON (O.S.)
                I guess you fellas're never unaccounted
                for, huh?

39   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUING                                       39

     Mackelway turns, a bit startled. Dyson is approaching, FAX in
     hand.

                            MACKELWAY
                Huh?

     Dyson extends six pages. On the TOP-SHEET, written by hand,
     are the words: "Agent Thomas Mackelway, C/O Mr. David Dyson,
     Hope House" with a street address.

     And under that top sheet? Five more pages.

     Mackelway sighs, takes them from Dyson. Sure enough, he's
     staring at five more faces, five more fact sheets. Five more
     HAVE YOU SEEN ME's.

     But how would anyone know to send them here?

                          DYSON
                Anything urgent?

                            MACKELWAY
                      (doesn't look up)
                No.

     Dyson is glad to hear it.

                                                     CUT TO:

40   INT. HOPE HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER                         40

     Mackelway descends, having had quite enough of this place.
     Piper is where we left him, watching VH1 in the TV Room.

                                                         30.


Mackelway passes, eyeing those newly-faxed pages: five more
HAVE YOU SEEN ME'S... He reaches the door.

                        PIPER
              Ever seen a fifty-foot shark?

Mackelway stops, turns.

                        MACKELWAY
              I'm sorry?

                        PIPER
              Fifty-foot shark. Ever seen one?

                        MACKELWAY
              No.

                        PIPER
              Doesn't mean there aren't any.

Great. Mackelway reaches for the front door again. Then he
halts. Maybe this guy can be helpful. Mackelway turns:

                     MACKELWAY
           Did you know him?
               (Piper's silent)
           The guy who used to stay upstairs.
           "O'Ryan." Did you know him?

                     PIPER
           Why? Is he dead?

                       MACKELWAY
           I don't...

                     PIPER
           You said "Did." Is he dead?

                     MACKELWAY
           Oh. I mis-spoke. No, he's not dead...
               (a beat)
           You know him?

Piper nods.

Mackelway eyes him, then approaches, holding up a copy of that
image: the circle-with-slash-through-it.

                        MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
              He ever talk about this? A circle with a
              slash through it?

                                                                 31.


     Piper rises, crosses to us... leaning in unnecessarily close.
     It's unsettling.

                          PIPER
                That's not a circle. It's a zero.

                          MACKELWAY
                Oh. How do you know?

     Piper doesn't answer. Instead he simply starts whistling.

     But it's not a tune coming out of his mouth. It's that same
     sound that O'Ryan made: A WHISTLING WIND, blowing through a
     ghost town... Building, then falling again.

     Piper smiles, backing away, enjoying the theatricality of it,
     stifling a giggle...

     Then, suddenly, everything turns GRAINY, CHOPPY...

     We've jumped into a distorted, REMOTE POV of this same scene -
     as if watching it through a crystal ball, or a broken lens, or
     a distance of time and space...

     We see images, fragments: Piper, the tv, the sofa, Mackelway's
     face. Then all sound breaks up, and we are...

41   INT. MOTEL ROOM - SLEEPER, MISSOURI - CONTINUING                  41

     Start on O'Ryan's EYES. Then a pad of paper. The spasm of a
     pen, scrawling a LIST on to it: "Piper. TV. Whistling." We're
     in another non-descript MOTEL ROOM. $29 a night.

     He holds down the point of his pen on a wavy line beside that
     list of words, keeping it there for a few seconds, as if
     expecting to receive some kind of pulse from it.

     No more pulse. He has lost the "connection" that had somehow
     transported him. He notes his watch. Jots down the exact time.
     Slips the pad into that FOLDER: "Mackelway."

     Then he starts to DRAW - a hurried but accurate sketch of
     Mackelway and Piper, just as they stood during that
     conversation. The geography is fairly accurate.

     O'Ryan continues to draw. We CRANE OUT of this motel room, to
     find, on the street below:

42   EXT. A BAR - SLEEPER, MISSOURI - CONTINUING                       42

     A typical honky-tonk in a town called Sleeper, Missouri. Just
     across the street from O'Ryan's cheap motel...

                                                                32.


43   INT. BAR - SLEEPER, MISSOURI - CONTINUING                        43

     Low-lights, dust on the floor. Pool tables.

     LORETTA is a pretty 19-year-old who stands at the jukebox,
     weighing her choices. She's got a thick curtain of hair, which
     she wrangles with a CHIP-CLIP. It's a habit.

     She chooses a country-rock tune, then heads for the bar,
     walking to the beat. It's fun being 19 and beautiful.

44   AT THE BAR - CONTINUING                                          44

     The BARTENDER'S a stocky guy with a broad smile.

                          LORETTA
                    (re: song)
                How's that?

                          BARTENDER
                Little cute for my taste, but I can stand
                three minutes of it.

                          LORETTA
                I'll have a seven and seven, please.

                          BARTENDER
                Seven and seven. Got some i.d.?

     She half-laughs, as if she hasn't been carded in a decade, and
     throws that curtain of hair from one side to the other, re-
     fastening that chip-clip. It's her best move.

                          LORETTA
                It's in the car. No one's asked me for it
                for a couple years now.

                          BARTENDER
                If ya hurry, you'll still catch the end
                of the song.

     She eyes him: are you really carding me? He smiles: nothing
     personal, Sugar. So she heads for the door.

     ...on her way, she passes a booth. In it we find a familiar
     face - Virgil Ray Starkey...

     He remains still, as if he hadn't noticed her. But behind
     his eyes, something primal just took place. He rises, heads
     for the door.

                                                                 33.


45   EXT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER                                          45

     Loretta walks to her VW Bug. Starkey exits the bar. She
     doesn't notice. We TILT UP: the lights are off in O'Ryan's
     motel room...

46   EXT. AT LORETTA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER                             46

     It all happens pretty fast: That chip-clip hits the ground
     beside the open VW door. A battered PICK-UP speeds away,
     kicking up gravel.

                                                      CUT TO:

     ...Loretta's eyes, wide with terror and dread.

47   INT. STARKEY'S PICK-UP - MINUTES LATER                            47

     We're off-road. Missouri's woods can be seen through the
     windshield. And Starkey is staring at us. Pawing at us...

                          LORETTA
                Please, Mister...

     Starkey's hand shoots out, banging Loretta's head against the
     window, hard. That makes things start to swim. Starkey tears
     at her clothes, lowers himself on to her.

     She whimpers. WE CARRY THE SOUND OF IT INTO:

48   INT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - SAME                                 48

     This is where you go when you've just moved to Wichita Falls
     and money's tight: spotty shag carpet, chipped Formica kitchen
     table, scuffed blinds.

     ...and one sleepless agent, having one lousy night.

     Mackelway sits on the edge of his bed, almost able to hear
     Loretta's helpless cries. Some nights are like this. His head
     is POUNDING again. Down go four more Bufferin.

     Above him, covering the bedroom mirror, is the MAP he took
     from that Hope House basement. O'Ryan's map, UNFOLDED.

     It's HUGE: 6-feet-wide, 4-feet-tall, obscuring the mirror.

     As we glimpsed while still in that basement, this map his been
     written on, in pen. O'Ryan's notations cover it:
     Over a THUSAND CITIES on it have been CIRCLED, by hand, in
     RED. Each of those circled cities has a DATE written beside
     it, also in red: ("4/6," "5/19," "10-26," etc.)

                                                                 34.


     Mackelway studies it, his face working. Another of those
     WHIMPERS from Loretta seems to hang, suspended. Mackelway
     shakes it off, certain that he's imagining it.

     He won't sleep a wink tonight. We LEAVE HIM, returning to:

49   INT. STARKEY'S PICK-UP - RESUMING                                 49

     The attack continues, its terror unimaginable. Loretta sobs.
     It hurts. Starkey's too powerful to fight off. We stay on her
     face: dazed, her mind simply checking out.

     ...until a look of cognizance comes over her, brought on by a
     SHADOW that just passed by.

     Then the window behind Starkey simply EXPLODES.

     Glass flies everywhere, and TWO ARMS reach into the pick-up.
     They grab Starkey by the neck and yank him out of the pick-up,
     his back sliced open by shards. He screams.

     She can't resist coming to the window, where she sees:

50   EXT. WOODS - STARKEY'S PICK-UP - CONTINUING                       50

     Starkey lies, face up. Shocked. Squirming. Bleeding. Standing
     over him, looming large as a Grizzly... is O'Ryan. A long
     HUNTING KNIFE extends from his hand.

     But his tone, to our great surprise, is conversational:

                          O'RYAN
                Hey, listen, I'm sorta new in town. Ya
                know where I can find a good donkey show?

     Starkey has no idea how to respond to this maniac:

                          STARKEY
                Huh?

                          O'RYAN
                Oh. Forgot. Wrong country... In America
                animals have rights.
                    (pointedly)
                Don't they, Virgil?

                          STARKEY
                How the fuck should I know?

     O'Ryan half-smiles, then kicks Starkey right in the head.
     Loretta's eyes go wide. Another kick follows, to the ribs.
     Then one to the groin. Then:

                                                                 35.


                          O'RYAN
                    (at Loretta)
                Turn around.

     He said that without looking at her. But he can tell that she
     hasn't moved - too frightened. So he eyes her.

                          O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                    (again)
                Turn around!

     She turns away, lying face down on the seat, covering her
     head. No idea what kind of terror is to come next. We STAY
     WITH HER... able only to hear what follows:

     The sound is animal, awful - like a pig being gutted - a
     horrible SQUEAL, covering the GRUNTS coming from O'Ryan.

     In goes the knife again, prompting another agonized cry from
     Starkey. Loretta's crying too: from fear, shock... She keeps
     her face buried, shutting her eyes tight. The sounds of
     savagery fill the night.

     Then, one last gasp from Starkey... followed by an awful
     silence... and the assault is over.

     Loretta's too afraid to look up - certain that the maniac with
     the knife will be coming after her next.

     But then she hears FOOTSTEPS, trailing away. So she rises,
     peeking over the edge of the window. WE STAY ON HER FACE, as
     she sees what's become of her attacker.

     Her horrified SCREAM fills the woods...

51   INT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - RESUMING                   51

     Mackelway STARES out the window; seems like he just HEARD that
     scream. Of course, that'd be impossible. He looks to that map.
     His PHONE RINGS. He eyes it, unsurprised...

                                                       CUT TO:

52   EXT. WOODS OUTSIDE SLEEPER, MO. - LATER                           52

     Law enforcement VEHICLES surround the site. COPS, Grieves,
     CORONER'S GUYS taking pictures. Loretta is sitting on the back
     of an ambulance, being tended to.

     A COMPOSITE ARTIST sits beside her, trying.

                          LORETTA
                I don't think the eyes are right.

                                                          36.


                       COMPOSITE ARTIST
           Narrower?

                     LORETTA
           No, they were... I don't really know.

Composite Artist keeps trying, but his attempt doesn't look
anything like the face of O'Ryan.

Charlton, meanwhile, stands over the body, mind racing.

A Missouri Highway Patrol car pulls up. Mackelway steps out of
it. We follow him as he takes in the scene.

A FLASHBULB illuminates Starkey's CHEST; is got a zero-with-
a-slash-through-it. But Mackelway hasn't seen the guy's face
yet.

                       MACKELWAY
           Sir?
               (Charlton turns)
           We got an i.d. yet?

                     CHARLTON
           Mmm-hmm.
               (Mackelway waits)
           Might wanna find yourself a fender.
           You're gonna need to sit down.
               (Mackelway's still waiting)
           It's Virgil Ray Starkey.

Mackelway pales.

We stay on him for a moment as it registers. The man he
caught, and then lost, has killed again. No. God, no.

                     MACKELWAY
               (struggling for composure:)
           Starkey did this?
                     CHARLTON
           No. Starkey's the one on the ground.

Mackelway pauses, thinks he must've heard wrong. But he turns
toward the face, as ANOTHER FLASHBULB illuminates it, searing
the image into the darkness. Starkey. Dead. His eyelids ripped
away.

Mackelway stares, stunned. Can't fucking believe it.

                     MACKELWAY
               (breathless)
           My God...

                                                                  37.


     It's like looking at a ghost - a spectre that's been haunting
     him, dead now... Mackelway pulls out his Minox, starts
     photographing, moving in on those LIDLESS EYES...

                          GRIEVES
                Gonna make a wallet-size of that one?

                          CHARLTON
                Give him a break, Grieves.

     Mackelway doesn't comment. Just keeps snapping shots...

                                                        CUT TO:

53   INT. FBI OFFICE - MACKELWAY'S CUBICLE - MORNING                    53

     The number of HAVE YOU SEEN ME's has now grown, quite a bit.
     45 PAGES sit stacked on Mackelway's desk. 45 victims. He grabs
     the stack, rises.

     Heading for the Conference Room, he nearly bumps into Katie,
     the Receptionist, rounding a corner.

                          MACKELWAY
                'Scuse me.

     She smiles. He carries the HAVE YOU SEEN ME's into:

54   INT. FBI OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUING                     54

     A room has been dedicated solely to those three murders. On an
     erasure board are the words: The "O'Ryan" Room.

     On one wall is the MAP Mackelway took from Hope House: over a
     thousand CITIES circled by O'Ryan himself.

     Mackelway puts down the stack of HAVE YOU SEEN ME's. Picks up
     a box of YELLOW STICK-PINS, affixing them to the map - one for
     every faxed face.

     Here's "Jason Corey, Age 14." Last seen in "Riverside, Ca." on
     "10-16-99."

     Sure enough, O'Ryan had circled "Riverside, Ca." on this map.
     Next to it he'd written "10-16."

     Mackelway sticks a yellow pin in Riverside.

     Next, the fax concerning "Anna Casitas, Age 22." Last Seen?
     "Macon, Ga." on "5-6-00."

     Of course, O'Ryan had circled "Macon" too. Beside it he'd
     written "5-6." So Macon gets a yellow pin.

                                                         38.


Mackelway continues, as:

                     FRAN (O.S.)
           Got nothing on the last fax.

Mackelway turns. In comes Fran.

                     FRAN (CONT'D)
           Came from a business center at a Mariott
           in Dallas. Nobody saw who sent it.

Mackelway nods. Then they both turn... Charlton enters the
room.

                     CHARLTON
           Whadda we know about the map?

                      MACKELWAY
           It matches the faxes, Sir. Almost
           perfectly.

Charlton approaches the map: 1,242 cities, circled in red.
Mackelway continues with the yellow pins: one for every HAVE
YOU SEEN ME? (45 of them so far.)

Charlton eyes the stack. 45 HAVE YOU SEEN ME's... Then the
map: 1,242 cities. Each with a DATE beside it.

                     CHARLTON
           Why's Greenville in blue?

(Mackelway has put a yellow pin beside a dozen cities... but
tiny Greenville, Texas has a BLUE PIN beside it.)

                     MACKELWAY
           Only city where the date on the fax and
           the date on the map didn't correspond.

He pulls out a fax from the stack: a Korean boy named "Steven
Kim. Age 16. Last Seen: Greenville, Tx. Date of Disappearance:
8-7-98."

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Fax lists the date of disappearance as
           August 7. On the map he's written "10-
           26."

The DATE on O'Ryan's map reads "10-26" beside Greenville, Tx.
So Greenville gets the only blue pin on this map.

Charlton notes today's date: October 17...

                                                                39.


                          CHARLTON
                Any of these bodies been recovered?

                          MACKELWAY
                Two so far. Female, disappeared from
                Dayton, Ohio on April 12. And a male,
                Trenton, New Jersey, January 5th.

     On the MAP, Dayton's got "4/12" written beside it. Trenton has
     "1/5." Both have yellow pins in them.

                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                But both bodies were found over a
                thousand miles from where they'd last
                been seen. One in Montana, the other in
                Oregon. Got autopsy reports on both.

     Charlton looks to the table, where AUTOPSY REPORTS and AUTOPSY
     PHOTOS sit - two victims we've never seen before.

     We see the VICTIMS photographed face up, face down, waist and
     above, waist and below. Charlton gives the photos a cursory
     glance, nothing more.

     But we notice something, on one of the bodies: the male from
     Trenton - an odd BURN MARK on his lower left calf.

     Looks almost symmetrical, horizontal across the calf...

                          CHARLTON
                Either of the bodies have the zero on
                them?

                           MACKELWAY
                No, Sir.

     Charlton, frustrated, SHOVES THOSE AUTOPSY PHOTOS ASIDE. We
     look to that MAP, a handful of yellow pins in it...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     ...that same map, over a HUNDRED YELLOW PINS in it now.

55   INT. FBI OFFICE - "O'RYAN ROOM" - NIGHT                          55

     It's 8:30 at night. Mackelway is alone in here - staring at
     the map. He's been doing a lot of that lately.

     The stack of HAVE YOU SEEN ME's has grown as well. Every one
     of them corresponds to a yellow pin on the map.

                                                           40.


(Some of the HAVE YOU SEEN ME's have arrived via U.S. MAIL. We
see a stack of ENVELOPES in a box, each sealed in PLASTIC,
each stamped and addressed to Mackelway.)

Mackelway eyes the map, puzzling. Fran's right beside him.
Assorted papers and leads fill this room, including photos he
took himself with that Minox.

                      FRAN
           Why you?

                      MACKELWAY
           Huh?

                     FRAN
           He could be sending these to any agent in
           any office in the country... But he's
           sending them to you. Why?

Mackelway's been asking himself that same question lately.

                     MACKELWAY
           I don't know.

PHONE RINGS. She grabs it.

                     FRAN (INTO PHONE)
           This is Agent Kulok.
               (a beat)
           Who's calling?

She hears the answer, then covers the phone.

                     FRAN (CONT'D)
               (to Mackelway:)
           Do you know a professor named Daitz? Says
           he's from Tulane.

                     MACKELWAY
               (eagerly)
           Yeah. Criminal Psych. I've been trading e-
           mails with him.

                     FRAN (INTO PHONE)
           One moment, please...

She hands him the phone...

                                                 CUT TO:

                                                                 41.


56   EXT. TULANE UNIVERSITY - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT                     56

     A beautiful campus, quiet tonight. In its center lies a vast,
     expensive structure - the Behavioral Sciences Building. The
     place goes on forever.

57   INT. TULANE - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES BUILDING - SAME                 57

     Mackelway exits an elevator on the "B-1 Level." Corridors
     octopus their way from these elevators, confusing us...

58   INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER                            58

     Every door looks the same. Mackelway follows the numbers -
     can't believe how long these hallways are. Turns a corner.

     Air can be heard, moving through the corridor. But he has
     found the right number, at last.

     A tiny CARD fastened to a wall reads, "Dr. Emile Daitz,
     Professor Emeritus, Criminal Psychology." It also lists his
     office hours. Mackelway knocks at a door.

                          MACKELWAY
                Professor Daitz?

                          O'RYAN (O.S.)
                Yes?

     Mackelway opens the door. Looks inside.

     Here sits O'Ryan, looking as much like a tweedy professor as
     he can look. He rises, smiles warmly.

                          O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                Agent Mackelway. Come in...

                                                      CUT TO:

59   INT. DAITZ' OFFICE - LATER NIGHT                                  59

     A tiny, cramped hovel. Books, papers, and all of it jammed to
     overflowing. Mackelway sits across from O'Ryan...

                          O'RYAN
                    (as "Daitz:")
                ...The name of this theory was "Suspect
                Zero."
                    (Mackelway nods)
                The idea of Suspect Zero posits that if a
                serial killer were diabolical enough, he
                could traverse the country without ever
                being caught, killing randomly.

                                                         42.


There's a COLLECTION here in a glass case: ANCIENT WEAPONS -
crude knives, swords, blow-darts. Mackelway notes them.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Tell me, what makes a killer catchable?

                     MACKELWAY
           Patterns, repetition of behavior.

                     O'RYAN
           Now imagine a killer with no patterns, no
           tell-tale fetishes, no rituals, no hidden
           desire to be caught. A perfect vessel of
           evil, killing without ever leaving a
           single meaningful clue in his wake...
           He'd be immune to capture, wouldn't he?
           Your task forces, your forensics teams -
           they'd be helpless.

Mackelway looks over Daitz' bookshelf: volume after volume
about evil, the devil, the minds of sociopaths, the history of
serial-killers, ritual killers, tribal rites...

                     MACKELWAY
           Is that something you believe in,
           Professor? Evil?

                    O'RYAN
          As a citizen of the world, it's hard not
          to. Wouldn't you say?
              (Mackelway can't argue)
          Evil is all around us, I think - a part
          of the natural order of things. Like
          gravity. Like wind. A vast black wave,
          corrupting everything it touches. A virus
          invades a cell, causing it to
          dysfunction. Perfectly logical. But did
          it ever occur to you that something may
          have invaded that virus, something
          capable of using it to mutate so
          powerfully?

Mackelway pauses, considering that.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Just because something's invisible to us
           doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

Mackelway is silent: Something's off here. But he can't say
for sure just yet what it is...

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Have you ever seen a fifty-foot shark?

                                                         43.


That wasn't just the echo of a question he's heard before; it
was a red flag. A big one. Mackelway tightens.

                        MACKELWAY
           I'm sorry?

                     O'RYAN
           A shark, as we know, will only attack
           humans if he runs out of food. But
           biologists have theorized that for a
           shark of fifty feet the ocean would be an
           endless buffet. He'd never run out of
           food, so he'd have no need to come to the
           surface. Consequently, we would never see
           him. Do you follow?
               (Mackelway doesn't)
           We'll never see one. But that doesn't
           mean they don't exist. Hence Suspect
           Zero.

Mackelway eyes those books on evil, then those ancient
weapons... Casually, almost imperceptibly, he reaches for his
sidearm, as O'Ryan continues:

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Some of my colleagues think I'm
           fascinated with evil. I think the truth
           is just the opposite: evil is fascinated
           with us. What better vehicle could there
           be for creating havoc in the world - what
           better instrument - than Man? We're vain,
           we're stubborn, we're deceitful, we have
           an imagination that is limitless in its
           perversions. Of course Evil keeps trying
           to harness us. Wouldn't you?

The more he talks, the closer Mackelway comes to extracting
that gun...

Then, disturbing the silence, a KNOCK at the door.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Excuse me.

O'Ryan rises, goes to the door... as Mackelway unholsters his
gun. O'Ryan opens the door. Standing here is a COED, with a
backpack. She looks confused.

                     COED
           Oh. I'm sorry. I was looking for
           Professor--

                                                                44.


     Just like that, O'Ryan has bolted past the Coed, literally
     tossing her onto Mackelway, exploding into the hall.

     She screams. Mackelway grabs her, moves her aside as gently as
     time allows, then blows out of the room...

60   INT. BUILDING - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUING                   60

     O'Ryan turns a corner, vanishing. Mackelway follows.

61   INT. BUILDING - CORRIDOR CORNER - CONTINUING                     61

     Mackelway finds himself facing another endless corridor: One
     door after another, for what seems like a mile. But no O'Ryan.
     Then Mackelway spots an EXIT SIGN. A stairwell...

62   INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUING                                      62

     Mackelway enters. The stairs go six stories UP from here...
     and one story DOWN. A sub-basement.

     It's a guess. He descends, gun drawn.

63   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUING                                   63

     Mackelway emerges. "B-2" looks a lot like B-1: long and
     endless. We hear air moving around us, pipes carrying water,
     the wheezing of an old generator...

     And, on all sides of us, DOOES, a mile of them: maintenance
     offices, supply rooms, labs. He opens one - a janitor's
     supply. No one in here.

     Tries another door. Locked. A second. Locked. A third. Locked.
     Air sucks through a corridor around us. He thinks he hears
     footsteps around a corner. Runs at them.

64   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CORNER - CONTINUING                          64

     Nothing. No one. Just another vast corridor. More doors.

     Then, a sound. GLASS, shattering on the floor. He runs down
     the corridor, passing a long metal CAGE that houses this
     building's FIVE FURNACES. They're old and wheezy.

     It's dark behind them, shadowy. Not a bad place to hide.

     Farther down the corridor is another door - made of frosted
     glass. A sign on it reads "Neuropsychiatric Lab." That's where
     the sound came from... he thinks.

                                                                 45.


65   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - LAB - CONTINUING                              65

     Mackelway enters. The lab is dark. He throws on every light
     switch within reach... and finds himself standing over the
     shards of what used to be a GLASS BEAKER.

     So he's in the right place. He scans it: five rows of work-
     stations, ten microscopes per row, each with a sink beside it.
     Lining the walls are wide CABINETS.

     But there's also a MINI-LIBRARY down here: Four rows of
     BOOKSHELVES, housing medical journals. These are the "stacks" -
     perfect for hiding behind.

     He plunges in. Row #1. Doesn't see anyone. Then Row #2, Row
     #3, Row #4. Okay, the stacks check out...

     He walks along the rows of work-stations, scanning, crouching,
     nudging open cabinets. One has been opened:

     Bottles of SOLUTIONS sit inside it. And a JAR that's been
     unsealed: It's got GAUZE PADS in it...

     In the back of the room, an INSTRUCTOR'S DESK awaits. It's
     tall enough to hide beneath. Mackelway slinks around it.
     Kneels down, looking into darkness...

     Then, a NOISE. The FRONT DOOR of this lab just swung open...
     And O'Ryan just bolted out. Fuck.

66   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - CONTINUING                         66

     Mackelway emerges from the lab. Those furnaces whine beside
     him on the other side of that cage. But a GATE on that cage
     has been left ajar...

67   INT. "FURNACE ROOM" - CONTINUING                                  67

     Five furnaces, separated from the sub-basement corridor by
     steel mesh. Mackelway enters. A few meager BULBS burn.

     He moves amidst shadow and noise: the chugging of engines, the
     humming, the wheezing, a slight vibration to the floor beneath
     us. He walks along the edge of Furnace #1...

     ...and is assaulted, from above.

     O'Ryan falls on him, knocking Mackelway hard into the sharp
     CORNER of that furnace, then down to the ground. Mackelway's
     gun skids across the floor.

     And his mouth, suddenly, has been covered with gauze.

                                                                46.


     He wants to fight back... but suddenly he finds that his head
     is swimming. Something's on that gauze. The room is getting
     fuzzy.

     We see the belly of a furnace - flames, heat. Then our own
     BLOOD... (Mackelway's CHEST was torn open by the corner of
     that furnace.) Wait. Did we just see the glint of a KNIFE?

     O'Ryan is leaning over us, in utter control.

     Then O'Ryan's head turns, abruptly - at the sound of
     FOOTSTEPS. And we hear:

                          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                Hey! You! What're you doing down here!

     We turn, groggily. TWO JANITORS rush toward us, keys jangling.
     It's all foggy, wavy, distorted.

     We see O'Ryan RISE. Then everything goes black...

                                                      CUT TO:

68   INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING                                   68

     Mackelway's head is ringing. Feels like he can hear
     electricity in the walls around him. Slowly, he awakens. Above
     him are fluorescent lights. Monitors blink...

     Fran is here. So's Charlton. Mackelway tries to sit up. The
     shock of pain from his chest stops him.

                          FRAN
                How ya doin'?

     Mackelway half-nods. His chest is bandaged.

                          CHARLTON
                We're gonna need everything you can
                remember about this guy, Tom. Physical
                description, any kind of distinguishing
                characteristics.

     That was terse. Charlton looks pretty pissed-off.

                          MACKELWAY
                    (scratchy)
                Where is he?

                          CHARLTON
                The suspect fled. Couple janitors walked
                in on it.
                    (before Mack can ask:)
                          (MORE)

                                                         47.


                     CHARLTON (CONT'D)
           They're fine. But the description they
           gave of him wasn't worth a damn.

Mackelway nods.

                     CHARLTON (CONT'D)
           Case you're curious the real Professor
           Daitz is on sabbatical, out of the
           country. We can't find him.
               (Mackelway nods)
           Whose idea was it to meet there?

                       MACKELWAY
           His, Sir.

                     CHARLTON
           Uh-huh. Did he ask you to come alone?

                       MACKELWAY
           No, Sir.

                     CHARLTON
           But you figured you'd get a bigger pat on
           the head if you wrapped this whole thing
           up without any help - is that it?

The truth? Charlton has him pegged. But:

                     FRAN
           Sir, I'm the one who took the call. Agent
           Mackelway was acting under the assumption
           that I'd already checked the guy out.
           We're both to blame.

Hold it. That was a major exaggeration, if not an outright
lie. Mackelway eyes her, thrown. She's poker-faced.

Charlton, however, seems unmoved...

                     CHARLTON
           Did Agent Mackelway attend the interview
           unaccompanied?

                     FRAN
               (reluctantly)
           Yes, Sir.

                     CHARLTON
           Then whose fuck-up is it?

Mackelway eyes her: "Thanks for trying." She nods.

                                                                 48.


                          MACKELWAY
                    (at Charlton)
                It was... poor judgment, Sir.

                          CHARLTON
                You wanna work alone, start your own
                agency.

     Mackelway can do nothing but nod. Then, bailing him out,
     another COMPOSITE ARTIST enters, tools in hand. Charlton
     sighs, frustrated.

                          CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                    (re: Composite Artist)
                Let's get you two started.

     Composite Artist is ready to begin...

                                                       CUT TO:

69   INT. BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY                                         69

     A lively Sunday Service. Lots of Baptists, singing a rousing
     spiritual. Music and praise filling the room.

     We move along the pews, until we came to the very back row...
     There, one man sits. Alone. Quiet. O'Ryan.

     Odd expression on his face - it's as if he can't hear this
     rousing music, or feel the power of this place. People in the
     next row are stomping their feet. Music soars.

     But O'Ryan just drops his head, slowly... and begins to WEEP
     in the middle of this boisterous congregation.

     Outside, an 18-WHEEL TRUCK can be heard, rumbling by with
     great force. No one else in here seems to hear it.

     But O'Ryan shuts his eyes tight, grieving, sobbing...

70   EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - CONTINUING                     70

     That TRUCK has just thundered by, leaving a swirl of debris in
     its wake. We TILT UP from it... to find that those STORMCLOUDS
     once in the distance are upon us now.

     And they are pulsing with menace. Rain, wind, lightning,
     thunder. Like a black wave, about to descend...

71   INTERCUT WITH/INT. FBI OFFICE - "FAX ROOM" - SAME                 71

     One of those five FAX MACHINES begins to ring. Then it begins
     to PRINT.

                                                               49.


     It's a Sunday. No one's here... but we get a look at what's
     coming in. Same TOP-SHEET again: "Attention Agent Thomas
     Mackelway" etc.

     CONTINUE INTERCUT: this incoming fax, set against a few
     tableaus of Americana. Innocence...

72   EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM - SAME                        72

     A high school MARCHING BAND is out here, practicing.
     Cheerleaders work on their routines nearby.

     Then a LOUD WHISTLE SOUNDS. It's the BAND-LEADER, who is
     taking note of the weather gathering overhead. The music from
     the band ceases.

                          BAND-LEADER
                Everybody into the gym!

     The band-members start to move. LIGHTNING erupts overhead.

73   EXT. UNIDENTIFIED HOME - BACKYARD - SAME                        73

     An unnamed MOTHER emerges onto her back-porch, where her FIVE-
     YEAR OLD DAUGHTER is having a playdate with a FRIEND.

     This house borders a wooded area. That wind is starting to
     make the trees swirl.

                          MOTHER
                Girls, I want you to come in now.
                Startin' to rain.

     The girls sigh, disappointed, deciding instead to hide
     themselves inside the TENT they've erected out here.

     They giggle. The mother doesn't. CONTINUE INTERCUT:

74   INT. FBI OFFICE - "FAX ROOM" - RESUMING                         74

     That fax is now printing page after page. Photos with HAVE YOU
     SEEN ME? across the top and vitals across the bottom.

     But this time the transmission isn't stopping at five. There
     are at least TEN sitting in the tray. Maybe twenty. Faces.
     Eyes. Stats. Locations. Innocence violated...

75   EXT. PARK - SAME                                                75

     A SOCCER GAME's been called in the middle of the Second Half.
     PARENTS and their uniformed 12 YEAR-OLDS scatter.

     RAIN is pouring down now, blown sideways by that wind.

                                                                 50.


76   INT. THE 18-WHEELER - SAME                                        76

     That massive, gleaming beast that rumbled past the church now
     rolls right by this park - as all of those kids and their
     parents scramble for the shelter of their cars.

     The windshield wipers on this truck push water away, giving us
     a clear look at the wet suburban chaos.

77   INT. BAPTIST CHURCH - RESUMING                                    77

     The faithful in here keep singing, their voices full with
     praise - despite the heavy weather outside. They feel safe in
     here. We move along the PEWS...

     ...until we find O'Ryan's. He's not here anymore.

78   EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - SAME                                        78

     O'Ryan leans against the door of the church, pelted by that
     heavy rain.

     BAM! Here comes those IMAGES AGAIN:

79   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT - RESUMING                               79

     Tall wheat, whipped by wind and rain. A muzzle-flash. The
     sound of a body slumping hard to the ground.

     ...and Mackelway, looking over us. Then:

80   EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - RESUMING                                    80

     We're back with O'Ryan. He leans against the door, his
     torment constant.

     He walks away from the church, into that heavy rain.

81   INT. FBI OFFICE - "FAX ROOM" - RESUMING                           81

     The fax tray has overflown onto the floor - 200 more photos,
     200 more HAVE YOU SEEN ME's. Forgotten victims. We hear a last
     rumble from that 18-WHEELER. END INTERCUT...

                                                      CUT TO:

82   INT. FBI OFFICE - "O'RYAN ROOM" - LATE NIGHT                      82

     Now there are 800 YELLOW PINS stuck in this map - one for
     every single FAX or LETTER that's been received in the past
     weeks.

                                                                 51.


     800 faces. 800 HAVE YOU SEEN ME's, represented by 800 pins in
     800 cities. It's like a national plague.

     Mackelway sits, examining it soberly. His chest-wound is
     killing him. (We see a thick bandage beneath his shirt.)

     In his pocket now is a bottle of PRESCRIPTION PILLS. Percodan.
     He slugs one down without water, his eyes never straying from
     that map.

     Beside it is a COMPOSITE DRAWING from O'Ryan, taken from
     Mackelway's description. It's dead-on...

                                                      CUT TO:

83   EXT. LONGHORN DINER WICHITA FALLS - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING          83

     This is the lone source of light on an otherwise dark stretch
     of road. Mackelway's Yukon pulls up.

84   INT. LONGHORN DINER WICHITA FALLS - MOMENTS LATER                 84

     Hardly a sound in here. Mackelway stands at the register,
     paying for his TAKE-OUT. Another night with nothing but his
     thoughts for company. Great. Then:

                          A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                Agent Mackelway?

     It's Katie, the receptionist from his office - sitting by
     herself in a nearby booth. Mackelway smiles.

                          KATIE (CONT'D)
                Hi.

                                                      CUT TO:

85   INT. KATIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER NIGHT                    85

     Inexpensive, but furnished with all the touches that
     Mackelway's apartment lacks: flea-market stuff, lace, antique
     books, photos from other eras. Character.

     And candles. Lots of candles. They throw SHADOWS of Mackelway
     and Katie all over the walls.

     An odd MUSIC fills the room, coming from a BOOM-BOX on the
     floor. It's a rhythmic Navajo CHANT, with Native-American
     drums providing the pulse.

     It's eery, tuneless, but awfully authentic... and it fits the
     intensity of the moment: Mackelway and Katie, coupling madly,
     their eyes locked. She's breathless.

                                                                52.


     First time we've seen him shirtless since his injury in that
     furnace room. A FAT BANDAGE covers a quarter of his chest.
     Dried blood can be seen beneath it.

     There's an intensity in his eyes. The chanting, the candles,
     Katie's body, his wound... they've conspired to bring an
     intensity into his eyes. It's dark, primal.

     And he's been expressing it for an hour without relent...
     which is why Katie gasps one last gasp, then rolls to the edge
     of the bed, exhausted.

     She reaches for that boom-box, lowers the volume. The chanting
     dies down into silence. She catches her breath.

                          KATIE
                    (softly)
                I can't anymore.

     Mackelway eyes her, then reaches past her, and turns the
     VOLUME on that boom-box back UP. The chanting fills the room
     again.

     And just like that, he has pulled her back onto him, urgently.
     That primal side hasn't been sated yet...

                                                      CUT TO:

86   INT. KATIE'S APT. - BATHROOM - LATER NIGHT                       86

     Mackelway stands at the mirror, changing the dressing on that
     wound across his chest. He unwraps the gauze over that fat
     bandage soaked through with blood.

     He pulls the bandage off, giving us a better look at the deep
     gash. Dried blood, torn skin, bruising. Looks like hell. But
     Mackelway eyes it calmly.

     He slugs down some beer from a nearby bottle, then cleans the
     wound with some Hydrogen Peroxide... as Katie appears in the
     doorway. She eyes him.

                          KATIE
                Can't sleep?

     He shrugs, turns.

                          MACKELWAY
                What was that music?

                          KATIE
                It's Navajo. A song for dead warriors. I
                never played it for anybody before.

                          KATIE (CONT'D)
                    (a beat)
                Just had a feeling you'd like it.

                          MACKELWAY
                How?

                          KATIE
                I dunno. The way you stare when you think
                nobody's looking.

     She shrugs. Silence hovers...

                                                      CUT TO:

87   INT. KATIE'S APT. - BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN                            87

     4:30 a.m. Rain pounds the window and roof, a real storm out
     there. The boom box is still. The candles are down to their
     nubs. Katie continues to sleep. Mackelway too.

     Then his eyes SNAP OPEN.

     Something just hit him, something huge. One of those 4:30-in-
     the-morning ideas that has to be expressed. Now.

                                                      CUT TO:

88   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - 5 A.M.                                       88

     Mackelway stands outside Room 217 at a Mariott. He's just
     knocked on the door.

     Fran opens it, in a robe. Very confused. He looks manic.

                          FRAN
                What're you--

                          MACKELWAY
                I can't get a read on this guy.

     Two minutes ago, she was sound asleep.

                          FRAN
                Huh?

                          MACKELWAY
                Why is he sending us all this shit? I've
                got 800 pins in that map, 800 missing
                people. What's he telling us?

     She gets it now: he's on a combination of painkillers and lack
     of sleep. Or maybe she can sense where he's been...

                                                       54.


                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
               (rapid-fire)
           He kills a travelling salesman, then a
           school-teacher. Then Starkey? It doesn't
           connect.

                     FRAN
           You're a mess...

                     MACKELWAY
           I'm fine. I'm clear. I just didn't think
           this could wait. Fran, this guy is trying
           to point us at something. Starkey's part
           of it. But the other two don't connect.

                     FRAN
           Did you drive here?

                     MACKELWAY
           I'm fine! I just need somebody to think
           this through with me! He wanted to meet
           me. It's like he was interviewing me
           somehow. What is that? Then he kills
           Starkey. So what was he doing with Speck
           and Fulcher?

                     FRAN
           You wanna come in?

                     MACKELWAY
           No. No. You come out. Get dressed.

                     FRAN
           Out where?

                     MACKELWAY
           I dunno. Somewhere. We're right on the
           edge of this thing.

She studies him. A long beat.

                     FRAN
           I'm going back to bed. You're welcome to
           the couch if you want. I think you could
           do with some sleep.

He sags a bit. She reaches for his hand.

                     FRAN (CONT'D)
               (gently)
           Mack...

                                                                  55.


     Just like that, there is contact. Their hands. It surprises
     them both.

     He appreciates it, but now's not the time. So he smiles
     thinly, turns, and goes.

     She watches him vanish around a corner.

                                                        CUT TO:

     We've been to this house before. Suburbia.

     Mackelway sits in his car, at the curb, studying the place.
     Rain falls in sheets, wind blows. And there he is, all alone,
     six in the morning, staring at a house.

     That idea - the thought that snapped his eyes open - it's
     still working on him. Beside him is the DRAWING that was found
     in Speck's car:

     The rendering of a steamer-trunk, lined with plastic,
     containing body parts in plastic bags... Mackelway seems to be
     fixated on it now.

     A hand knocks on the front door. Jan Speck opens up.

                          JAN
                    (hoping for good news:)
                Agent Mackelway?

     Mackelway stands in the doorway, rain falling behind him.

                           MACKELWAY
                    (all business)
                Mrs. Speck. Just had a few more
                questions.

                                                        CUT TO:

91   INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                   91

     Mackelway sits at the WINDOW, looking over the backyard.
     Nothing special out here: some trees, a swing, a storm-cellar
     door.

     But he's staring at it, intently. We're not sure why.

                                                         56.


Behind him, Jan re-enters, purse over her shoulder, umbrella
in hand. She grabs his cup of coffee and saucer from the
coffee table.

                     JAN
           I'm sorry I don't have more time, Agent
           Mackelway. It's my PTA Day.

                     MACKELWAY
           It's fine. I should've called.

She smiles tightly: "I have to go now" and heads for the
kitchen. Once she's there, Mackelway turns to the BACK DOOR
and UNLOCKS IT, eyeing that storm-cellar outside...

She leaves the cup in the sink. He enters the kitchen.

                     JAN
           I hope I was of some help.

                     MACKELWAY
           You were. Thanks.

                     JAN
           A friend of mine said I'll feel like this
           one month for every year we were
           together. Sort of a grieving rule-of-
           thumb. Have you ever heard that?

                      MACKELWAY
               (gently)
           No. Sorry.

She half-smiles. He turns to the door. Turns back.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Oh. There was one other thing: Did he
           keep any kind of chemicals around the
           house? Acids, that sort of thing?

                      JAN
           No. Why?

He shrugs, dismissing it:

                     MACKELWAY
           It's nothing. Trace elements we found on
           his trunk. Any interest in chemistry?
           Maybe as a hobby?

Jan pauses for a moment, as if recovering a faint memory...
Then she shakes it off. He lets it go.

                                                                  57.


                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                Anyway, thank you. And thanks for the
                coffee. Next time I'll call first, I
                promise.

                          JAN
                No trouble at all.

                                                        CUT TO:

92   EXT. SPECK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                                 92

     Mackelway sits in his car. Through his windshield we see Jan
     as she backs out of the driveway.

     She pulls past us, giving Mackelway as friendly a wave as a
     grieving widow can give. He waves back.

     Then she's gone, disappearing around a corner.

     Mackelway pauses a beat, checking his rear-view mirror to be
     sure. Then he gets out of his car...

                                                        CUT TO:

93   EXT. SPECK'S HOUSE - SIDE GATE - MOMENTS LATER                     93

     Mackelway sneaks around the side of the house, pulling on a
     lever to unlatch the side-gate.

94   EXT. SPECK'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUING                         94

     He emerges into the tiny backyard, making a bee-line for that
     storm cellar door.

     He knows he shouldn't be doing this. It's beyond risky. But
     here he is, without a warrant.

     There's no lock on the cellar door. He reaches for it. Then he
     stops himself. Just noticed something:
     A NEIGHBOR-LADY, visible just over Speck's backyard fence, is
     looking right at him through her bedroom window.

     Fuck it. He enters the storm cellar.

95   INT. SPECK'S STORM CELLAR - CONTINUING                             95

     Seven steps, leading to a dusty cement floor. Mackelway looks
     around.

                                                                58.


     Facing him are the things a meticulous man would store in case
     of disaster: Cans of food, sternos, sleeping mats, drums of
     potable water.

     And long FOOT-LOCKERS. Two of them. That's where Mackelway's
     eyes go, instantly. He hurries to them.

     Throws one open. Nothing but sheets and blankets inside. He
     paws through it... finding nothing else.

     He throws the other trunk open. Inside? Pillows. Fuck.

     He slams it shut, looks to those cans of food, stacked on
     shelves. He approaches the shelves, jostling cans from their
     rows, making more noise than he ought to.

     But he finds nothing behind them... except more cans. He
     approaches those two huge drums of water, lugs them aside.
     Behind them is a tall CUPBOARD, locked.

     He pulls at the cupboard door, hard. It splinters.

     Inside, a rifle and some boxes of ammo... same as you'd find
     in every other storm-cellar in Texas.

     He pauses: Am I crazy...?

                                                      CUT TO:

96   EXT. SPECK'S BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER                            96

     He emerges from the storm-cellar, confused. Shuts the storm-
     cellar door.

     Then he turns. Something else just caught his eye:

     Above Speck's bedroom window is another window, a tiny one. An
     attic...

     He heads for that UNLOCKED BACK DOOR, and enters...

97   INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUING                    97

     He hurries toward the stairs, reaches them... then spots
     something through the Entry Hall window:

     On the street outside, pulling up to the curb... is a POLICE
     CAR. Sirens off. That Neighbor-Lady must've placed the call.
     And here's Mackelway, without a warrant. Shit.

     Two ABILENE COPS get out, approaching the house. Mackelway
     climbs the stairs.

                                                               59.


98    INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - STAIRS - CONTINUING                        98

      If he stays quiet, he might just pull this off.

99    INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - SECOND STORY - CONTINUING                  99

      A tiny hallway, with four doors. Up ahead, dangling from the
      ceiling, is a tiny rope which promises a set of hidden fold-
      out stairs... and an attic.

      Mackelway tugs on the rope. The fold-out stairs drop down out
      of the ceiling. Then he hears:

                           NEIGHBOR LADY (O.S.)
                 He's inside! He's inside! Went in through
                 the back!

      ...which means he has mere seconds before this all blows to
      hell. So he climbs up those fold-out stairs.

      The two ABILENE COPS now circle the house, entering through
      the back-porch door, just as Mackelway did.

      He pulls up the folding stairs. Maybe the guys'll do a half-
      assed search and then leave...

100   INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - ATTIC_- CONTINUING                        100

      Mackelway looks around: lots of dusty junk around here - old
      clothes, mementoes.

      ...and one more trunk. A steamer-trunk. Huge. And locked.
      Looks just like the one in that DRAWING rendered by O'Ryan...

      Mackelway races for it. Takes out his gun, uses the butt-end
      to bust the lock off. Throws it open.

      ...as we hear the sound of those fold-out steps, being tugged
      down from the second-floor hallway. And:
                           ABILENE COP #1 (O.S.)
                 Freeze, Asshole!

      The COP is just ten feet away, most of him still concealed by
      those steps - gun trained right on us.

      But Mackelway seems utterly untroubled.

                           MACKELWAY
                     (calmly)
                 It's okay, Fellas. FBI.

                                                                 60.


                             ABILENE COP #1
                 I'll bet.

      Mackelway drops his gun, kicks it toward the cop, who doesn't
      quite know what to make of that.

      Also confusing him is the odd smile playing its way across
      Mackelway's face. But we understand it now:

      The inside of that steamer-trunk is filled with BODY PARTS:
      bagged, stacked, and sealed in Ziplocs...

      Powdered LIME is sprinkled on them.

      Mackelway stares, at once satisfied and sickened. COP #1 can
      be heard, approaching across the attic floor. His gun is
      drawn...

      ...until he too sees what's in there.

                           ABILENE COP #1 (CONT'D)
                 Oh Jesus Christ...

                                                       CUT TO:

      ...a Grammar-School CLASS PICTURE: of Barney Fulcher and his
      2nd Graders, sitting on a mantle. We are...

101   INT. FULCHER'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - BOULDER - DAY                101

      That picture sits beside other photos, awards, plaques - all
      celebrating Fulcher's career in Colorado education.

      We turn away from that mantle, blowing through this modest
      Living Room, finding an open door - leading down to:

102   INT. FULCHER'S HOME - BASEMENT - CONTINUING                      102

      Down the steps we go, until we hear the HUM of an old FREEZER.
      We turn toward the sound.

      The freezer is open. A team of FORENSICS GUYS study it.

      Inside this freezer, frozen into a block of ice... are six
      female HANDS. No arms, no heads. Just six slender hands, each
      with a wedding band on the ring finger.

      Mackelway stands in the back of this basement, taking it all
      in. He looks to Charlton, who is expressionless.

                                                       CUT TO:

                                                              61.


102a EXT. FULCHER'S HOUSE - DUSK                                102a

     Close on Mackelway as he returns to his Yukon satisfied. He is
     pleased with himself. Out of nowhere, a firm hand grasps his
     right shoulder stopping him.

     Mackelway turns abruptly, finding himself sandwiched between
     his Yukon and Charlton, who is now in his face.

                          CHARLTON
                Listen to me Cowboy. You have any idea
                the kind of favors I had to pull with the
                Abilene cops to cover your ass?!

                          MACKELWAY
                Sir...

                          CHARLTON
                    (not allowing him to talk)
                Breaking and ENTERING the Speck house
                without a shred of evidence and NO
                WARRANT?!

                          MACKELWAY
                    (not going down without a
                     fight)
                The sample I took from Speck's bumper...
                It's crystallized sulfuric acid mixed with
                oil of Clove, the clove neutralizes the
                odor of the acid.

     Charlton shakes his head, he is not getting through.

                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                It was SPECK not his killer who was
                hiding something.

                          CHARLTON
                Ever ask yourself why a big shot agent
                from Dallas gets sent down to the
                Wichita Falls Field Office? I'll give
                you TWO WORDS... Hell I'll even write it
                down for ya.

     Charlton leans in to emphasize his point. He pulls out a pad
     and pencil from his breast pocket and writes what he says using
     Mackelway's chest as support. It's humiliating.

                          CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                "EVIDENTIARY PROCEDURE." Don't talk about
                it. Learn it.

                                                                 62.


      Those words just hang there, haunting Mackelway. Charlton
      tears off the sheet with those two words and stuffs them into
      Mackelway's hand.

                           CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                 Turns out you were right about this guy.
                 You were right about both of them. But
                 that doesn't change the fact that you
                 went about your business like a rookie.
                 Got it?

      Charlton turns, the buzz of a street lamp breaks the silence
      throwing a circle of light around the Yukon. Mackelway watches
      as Charlton puts on his headlights and drives away.

      A sudden gust of wind tears that piece of paper out of
      Mackelway's hand, he stares at it, as it disappears into
      darkness.

103   INT. FBI OFFICE - THE O'RYAN ROOM - EVENING                      103

      Everything yet known about the murders of Speck, Fulcher, and
      Starkey fills the wall space in here:

      We see O'Ryan's MAP: All those yellow pins... and the one blue
      one, (Greenville, Tx.) Also, that DRAWING: of the ghastly
      Ziploc bags inside a steamer trunk. Damn thing seems prescient
      now.

      Agents mill about, awaiting a conference.

                           GRIEVES
                     (passing by)
                 Nice job, Mack.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Thanks.

      A few OTHER AGENTS also pat him on the back. Fran's proud of
      him too - we can see it. In fact everyone in here seems to be
      giving Mackelway his due. It all feels good.

      Charlton enters.

                           CHARLTON
                 Seated please.

      The agents find seats around the table. Charlton takes his
      place at the head of it.

                                                                 63.


                           CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                     (to the assembled:)
                 Okay. We've got a serial killer of serial
                 killers.

      Fran scribbles something on a piece of paper: "What a genius!"
      Slides it over. Mackelway conceals the note, as:

                           CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                     (still grand-standing)
                 He's a transient with a history of mental
                 illness. He also happens to think he's a
                 former agent of this Bureau. And he is
                 pursuing something that he calls "Suspect
                 Zero." Anybody got anything intelligent
                 to say?

      Nobody's volunteering.   There's just silence.

                           CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                     (familiar refrain)
                 That's what I thought...

                                                       CUT TO:

104   OMIT                                                             104

105   EXT. WICHITA FALLS FBI OFFICE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT              105

      Mackelway exits the office, heading for his Yukon.

      Then he stops... because Katie is waiting out here, leaning
      against her Toyota Camry.

                           MACKELWAY
                     (fondly)
                 Hey.

                           KATIE
                 Somethin', huh? Guy with a wife and kids
                 keepin' bodies in his attic?

      He nods... but what is she doing out here?

                           MACKELWAY
                 Yeah.
                     (a beat)
                 You okay?

                           KATIE
                 Yeah. Just... Wondered if you could do me
                 a favor.

                                                                  64.


      Mackelway waits... as Katie hands over a manila envelope.
      Mackelway opens it.

      Inside, a photo of a heartbreakingly-sweet 22 year-old girl
      named KAREN SUMPTER, with an attached sheet listing her
      vitals: height, weight, age, etc.

      Another face. Another disappearance...

                            KATIE (CONT'D)
                 Her name's Karen Sumpter. We were
                 friends.
                     (almost reluctantly)
                 She disappeared last year. Nobody knows
                 where. She was a little wild, but not
                 like that.

      Her sadness is obvious. Mackelway nods.

                           KATIE (CONT'D)
                 Anyway, I know you're gonna be in on the
                 autopsies - of the girls they found over
                 at Speck's. Figured you might see if one
                 of 'em was...

      Her voice trails off. This is hard.

                           KATIE (CONT'D)
                 If it is, I'd like to be the one to
                 notify her folks. Out families've been
                 friends for years.

                           MACKELWAY
                     (gently)
                 Sure. Of course.

                           KATIE
                 Thanks... 'Night.

      Mackelway puts the envelope under his arm. She starts up the
      Camry. The sky rumbles. He eyes her.

      For some reason, she hasn't pulled away yet...

                                                 SMASH CUT TO:

106   INT. KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      106

      Candles. Shadows on the wall...and Mackelway and Katie, at it
      again, with the sounds of that eery Navajo CHANTING coming
      from the boom-box.

                                                                 65.


      Mackelway is studying her, staring into her eyes, her
      breathing. She's beginning to climax now... and those eyes go
      wider. We MOVE INTO THEM, and:

      We are abruptly SLAMMED, again, INTO ANOTHER SET OF THOSE ODD,
      DISJOINTED IMAGES from that unidentified place:

107   EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME - NIGHT                        107

      Wet wind in a blur of gray. The sound of our own heavy
      breathing. A voice rising above the wind, pleading:

                             (O.S.)
                 Please...

108   INT. KATIE'S BEDROOM - RESUMING                                  108

      She is utterly lost now. And that CHANTING seems to have
      gotten louder somehow.

      IMAGES FLICK at us now: culled from that BOOK on TRIBAL RITUAL
      AND TRANCE, found at the halfway house: a TRIBESMAN with eyes
      rolling back in his head, foaming at the mouth.

      Mackelway tries to shake it off, tries to keep his focus on
      Katie. He buries his head into her neck, as:

109   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT                                         109

      Tall wheat, wet wind. Then a MUZZLE FLASH, and a body slumping
      to the ground. And suddenly we are in:

110   INT. ANOTHER UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - NIGHT 110

      O'Ryan, at a desk. He has just "remote viewed" these images
      somehow. And they've left him rattled.

      It's time to get out of this room. Quickly.

                                                       CUT TO:

111   EXT. ROAD - DENTON, TEXAS - SAME (NIGHT)                         111

      A stolen, non-descript CHEVY pulls out of a motel room parking
      lot, on to the street.

112   INT. STOLEN CAR - DRIVING - CONTINUING                           112

      O'Ryan is behind the wheel, driving.

                                                                  66.


113   INT. STOLEN CAR - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER (DUSK)                  113

      The radio is BLASTING - anything to shake those images out of
      his head. Driving, unsettled... which may be why he doesn't
      notice that there's a SIREN wailing behind him.

      He looks in the rear-view. A TEXAS STATE TROOPER is on his
      tail. Shit. O'Ryan tightens, pulling over...

114   INT./EXT. STOLEN CAR - ROADSIDE - CONTINUING                      114

      The TROOPER approaches, noting the condition of the vehicle.
      He stands before O'Ryan's window. O'Ryan's face reveals no
      evidence at all of anxiety.

                            TROOPER
                 Evening.

                           O'RYAN
                 Evening, Officer.

                           TROOPER
                 See your license, Sir?

                           O'RYAN
                 'Course. Is there a problem?

      O'Ryan reaches into his back pocket, produces an I.D. Hands it
      over.

      Trooper eyes it. According to this i.d., we are now staring at
      "James Garvey" from Littleton, Colorado. But the Trooper
      doesn't seem too convinced.

                           TROOPER
                 See your registration, please?

                            O'RYAN
                 Sure.

      O'Ryan opens up the glove compartment, starts searching
      through it. But it's a stall, that's obvious.

                           TROOPER
                 Mind stepping out of the car, please?

      O'Ryan pauses. There is no way in hell he's going to let
      himself get deterred by a State Trooper. But he gets out.

115   EXT. ROADSIDE - CONTINUING                                        115

      Trooper eyes him with caution. O'Ryan holds his hands in front
      of his chest, keeping them visible to the guy.

                                                         67.


                     O'RYAN
           Officer, I am carrying something that
           could be construed as a weapon. I'd like
           to hand it over, voluntarily, so you
           won't think I'm trying to conceal
           anything. Would that be all right?

                     TROOPER
           What kind of weapon, Sir?

                     O'RYAN
           It's a hunting knife, right here on my
           hip.

Trooper notes the shape of that large, sheathed KNIFE - the
one O'Ryan butchered Starkey with - visible beneath O'Ryan's
shirt.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           I was on my way to the woods. My gear's
           in the trunk.
               (Trooper doubts it)
           Would you like me to hand it to you? I
           don't know what the procedure is for
           something like this.

                     TROOPER
           Take the weapon off your hip, place it on
           the ground, and kick it toward me.

                       O'RYAN
           Happy to.

O'Ryan takes the knife off his hip. The size of it gets some
attention from the Trooper.

                     TROOPER
           What exactly were you planning on
           hunting, Sir?

                     O'RYAN
           A fifty-foot shark.

No reply. O'Ryan drops the menacing knife to the ground and
kicks it toward the Trooper.

Trooper, slowly, kneels down to get it - never taking his eyes
off O'Ryan.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Ya know, I used to be in law enforcement
           too.

                                                                  68.


                           TROOPER
                     (kneeling)
                 That right?

                            O'RYAN
                 Mmm-hmmm. FBI. 'Course this was some
                 years ago.

      Trooper grabs the knife, straightens. Examines it.

                           O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                 Psy Ops. Classified.

                           TROOPER
                 Had anything to drink tonight, Sir? Under
                 medication of any kind?

      An 18-WHEEL TRUCK rumbles by, distracting O'Ryan... rendering
      him immobile for a moment.

                           TROOPER (CONT'D)
                 Sir?

                           O'RYAN
                 Oh. Sorry. Just found myself wondering
                 what was inside that truck.

                           TROOPER
                 Sir, I'm going to ask you to hand me the
                 keys to your vehicle, please.

                           O'RYAN
                 Of course.

      O'Ryan opens the car door. We steal a look INSIDE.

      ...he's got a GUN under the front seat.

      In a flash, that gun is in his hands and pointing right at the
      forehead of that Trooper.

      Trooper knows he's been had. And he knows that he's about to
      die...

                                                        CUT TO:

116   OMIT                                                              116

117   EXT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - DOORWAY - EVENING                    117

      Mackelway approaches, carrying a greasy bag: another Frito Pie
      and a soda. Fumbles with his keys... Then he notices
      something, waiting on his doorstep.

                                                               69.


      It's a thick FILE, roughly 150 pages, in a FOLDER. The word
      "MACKELWAY" is written across the front.

      He leans down, opens the folder. The light is spotty out
      here... but it's just strong enough to show us the expression
      on his face: a look of pure awe.

118   INT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - ENTRY - CONTINUING                118

      The door bursts open. The greasy bag and the soda fall to the
      floor. Mackelway hurries to a phone, clutching that file. He
      dials hurriedly.

119   INTERCUT WITH/INT. FRAN'S CAR - SAME                           119

      We're in a PARKING LOT outside a WAL-MART. Fran's just thrown
      a bag into her Ford Taurus. Her CEL-PHONE RINGS. She grabs it.

                           FRAN (INTO CEL)
                 Kulok.

                           MACKELWAY (INTO PHONE)
                 He really was FBI.

                           FRAN
                 Huh?

                           MACKELWAY
                 O'Ryan. He left his file on my doorstep.
                 Fran, he was FBI.

      He can barely believe it himself, but we get a look at what
      was in that file now; PAGES are splayed across Mackelway's
      coffee table:

      A copy of an FBI I.D. BADGE, xeroxed memoes, test scores,
      citations, evaluations, reports. The entire career of Special
      Agent Benjamin O'Ryan... in black and white.

                          FRAN
                That's impossible.

                          MACKELWAY
                I'm look at his whole history!
                Citations, letters of commendation, even
                his fucking test scores from Quantico.
                The guy was an agent.

                          FRAN
                I don't believe it.

                          MACKELWAY
                Listen to me--

                                                         70.


Then we hear a BEEP. Call-Waiting. Great.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Shit! Hold on.

That irritated her. Mackelway clicks over.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Yes?

                     O'RYAN (THRU PHONE)
           Read anything interesting lately?

Mackelway's eyes go wide.

                     MACKELWAY
           Where are you?

CLICK. O'Ryan's just hung up.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Shit!

He stares at the phone, then clicks over again, re-connecting
to Fran.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           That was him.

                     FRAN
           He called you at home?

                     MACKELWAY
           Yes.

BEEP. Call-Waiting again.

                     FRAN
           Jesus. Call me back.

Mackelway clicks over again without saying goodbye.

                     MACKELWAY (INTO PHONE)
           O'Ryan?

                     O'RYAN (THRU PHONE)
           I've found him, you know.

                     MACKELWAY
           Who?

                     O'RYAN
           Zero.

                                                          71.


                     MACKELWAY
           Zero's a myth. You made him up.

                     O'RYAN
           Myths don't kidnap little boys. Do they?

                     MACKELWAY
           Do you?

Sounds like O'Ryan just laughed... Then, another curve:

                     O'RYAN
           Was she pretty?

                     MACKELWAY
           Huh?

                     O'RYAN
           I could hear her moaning, right under the
           Navajo chanting. Whole thing was
           downright tribal. What's she look like?

That was unsettling. Very. Mackelway looks around feeling
violated, feeling "watched." He draws the blinds. Double bolts
the front door. Runs his hand under the window frame for any
kind of wire tapping.

But Mackelway won't allow himself to over-react. Not now, with
O'Ryan on the phone.

                     MACKELWAY
               (calmly)
           You tell me.

O'Ryan laughs. He liked that.

                     O'RYAN
           Fair enough. We'll stick to business:
           How'd ya like my old room?

                     MACKELWAY
           Huh?

                     O'RYAN
           "Hope House." You were there.

How the hell did he know that? It's unsettling.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Dyson re-paint it?
               (no reply)
           My room. Did he re-paint it?

                                                                  72.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Yeah. White.

                           O'RYAN
                 ...But you saw what was underneath, of
                 course.

                           MACKELWAY
                 No. Tell me about it.

                           O'RYAN
                 No. You tell me.

      CLICK. O'Ryan just hung up. Mackelway stares at the phone.

                                                        CUT TO:

120   INT. HOPE HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT (9 P.M.)                          120

      More rain falls outside. Lightning too. Mackelway waits here.
      Piper's in his usual spot in front of the TV. Dyson descends
      the stairs, a bit testy tonight.

                           DYSON
                 Welcome back.

      That had some edge. Mackelway doesn't reply.

                                                        CUT TO:

121   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM/HALLWAY - NIGHT            121

      Mackelway stands in the center of this room, Dyson in the
      doorway. That SINGER down the hall is at it again, off-key as
      ever. Tonight it's the "Gilligan's Island" theme-song.

                           DYSON
                 I'll be in my office.

      Dyson backs away, leaving the door ajar.

      Now Mackelway is alone - eyeing the tiny bed, sink, window,
      the leaky ceiling, the bucket, the peeling paint. This room is
      heaving with energy...

      He sits on the bed, checks his watch. 9:05 p.m.

      Opposite this bed is that WALL, re-painted in industrial
      white, with the hint of a shape underneath. It's what
      Mackelway's come here to investigate. INTERCUT WITH...

                                                                 73.


122   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - SAME                           122

      O'Ryan sits at a desk: eyes closed, writing pad at his wrist.
      On it, more of those unidentifiable lines become visible to
      us. They're called IDEOGRAMS.

      He holds the point of his pen down upon one of them, as if
      receiving information from it, and we jump back into:

123   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                123

      Mackelway. Sitting. Staring. Outside this room we hear that
      awful, toneless singing as it fills the hallway.

      Mackelway rises, approaching that re-painted wall. He pulls
      out his keys. Checks to see that no one's watching.

124   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                       124

      O'Ryan, his pen on that pad, his concentration total.

125   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                125

      We hear the singing, the TV, the rain, that bucket collecting
      drips. Semi-darkness... until MORE LIGHTNING throws a burst of
      white light against that wall.

      A faint shape becomes visible, just beneath the white paint.
      Then it vanishes again.

      Using his keys, he begins to scratch away at the white paint.
      It's an irrational thing to do - but in the context of the
      last few days it makes an odd kind of sense.

      Instantly, a hint of BLACK can be seen underneath...

126   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                       126

      O'Ryan, at that desk. Outside, he can hear an 18-WHEEL TRUCK
      rumble by. He doesn't allow it to distract him.

127   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                127

      Mackelway scratches more of the white paint off of that wall.
      More BLACKNESS appears beneath it. Then, a SOUND behind him.
      He turns.

      The door to this room just SHUT; someone outside must've
      pushed it. He keeps scratching at the paint.

      LIGHTNING rages outside. We PULL BACK, away from that wall,
      which gives us the opportunity to see something that Mackelway
      is too close to the wall to see for himself:

                                                                  74.


      There is indeed an image beneath that thin coat of white
      paint. It is the shape of a vast, black WAVE. A hand-painted
      image as large as this wall itself.

      Mackelway seems tiny by comparison, and the mere inch of black
      that he has uncovered so far seems infinitesimal.

      In fact, it almost look as if the wave is poised to swallow
      him whole... and he can't even see it.

      But we can. Must've taken O'Ryan days to paint something this
      large. A vast, black wave. Evil itself...

      And Mackelway, without meaning to, is about to unleash it.

128   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        128

      O'Ryan, somehow, seems to be sensing what is going on in that
      room. Or maybe he's just feeling the power of that wave, from
      memory. Or maybe he's just plain crazy.

      But he and Mackelway, on some unspoken psychic level, are
      feeding one another...

129   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 129

      Mackelway chips away at that white paint, moving rapidly,
      revealing more of the blackness underneath. We PUSH IN on it,
      moving past Mackelway and his frantic scraping.

      Then we're beneath that thin coat of white, and:

130   INT. INSIDE THE BLACK WAVE - UNDETERMINED TIME                    130

      Somehow, we've submerged into the wave itself. A black, tidal
      force of nature.

      And it is MOVING. Alive. We hear the SOUNDS of it: a sucking,
      a yawning, as if a tide were drawing back just before
      exploding forward.

      The sounds blend in with the wind, the rain, the drops in that
      bucket... Evil itself, on the move, gathering might. And we're
      along for the ride...

      The wave begins to roll forward now as if shot from a cannon.
      It is massive, powerful, dark. And we're right on its forward
      edge, as if surfing it somehow.

131   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        131

      O'Ryan reacts. Something just changed:

                                                                  75.


132   INT. INSIDE THE BLACK WAVE - RESUMING                             132

      The wave is rushing us forward with this speed and power of a
      tsunami.

      ...which is when we hear the laughter of a LITTLE BOY.

133   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        133

      O'Ryan just heard it too. Then new images come at him - but
      they are, at first, GRAINY, CHOPPY...

134   EXT. UNIDENTIFIED PLAY AREA - SAME                                134

      The sounds of that wave become fainter, receding to the
      background, giving way to that sound of laughter, and the
      squeaking of a PLAY-SET SWING.

      Like an old tv slowly gaining reception, the image takes a
      moment to crystallize before us. But then it sharpens:

      We're in the PLAY AREA of a TRUCK-STOP DINER, but it feels
      like we're looking at it through a broken lens. The images
      appear SPHERICAL to us, surrounded by darkness.

      Before us a 5-year old plays on a swing. Call him CHARLIE.

135   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 135

      Mackelway has scraped away more of the white paint now -
      enough to see the outline of the front edge of the black wave,
      its lip. He continues.

136   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        136

      O'Ryan tightens. We can't tell if he experiencing something
      from the past, the present, the future...

137   EXT. PLAY-AREA - RESUMING                                         137

      We WHIP AROUND quickly, getting a look into the diner itself.
      There, through a window, we see a WOMAN, presumably Charlie's
      mother. Her name's KATHLEEN, 40.

      Kathleen has her back turned to us, because she's busy
      diapering her nine month-old BABY at a table.

138   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        138

      O'Ryan, at his desk, seems to be getting all of this. And it
      is agitating him. There's perspiration on his forehead.

                                                               76.


139   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      139

      The sound of that wave is still a presence. Charlie looks up
      at us as he swings. His smile is pure, genuine.

      We whip around for another look at Kathleen. She's still busy
      with that diaper. Then we look back to Charlie.

140   INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING                                     140

      O'Ryan keeps his eyes shut, his focus total... but every part
      of him is becoming tense.

141   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING              141

      Mackelway is beginning to perspire from the effort. More of
      that wave is visible to him. But he doesn't step back to take
      that in.

142   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      142

      That swing is now EMPTY, dangling gently. And we're running
      we know not where.

143   INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING                                     143

      O'Ryan's foot starts to tap: anxiousness, discomfort.

144   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      144

      We run... toward a PARKING LOT. But we do so smoothly, without
      effort, as if being carried by that relentless black wave.

      Then, ANOTHER SOUND bleeds in. The BANGING of the Diner's back
      door, which leads on to that Play Area.

      And we hear a horrified yell:

                           KATHLEEN (O.S.)
                 Charlie?! Charlie, where are you, Honey?!
                     (fainter)
                 Charlie?! Honey, are you out here?!

      The sound begins to break up as if on a bad radio, being taken
      over by the sounds of that awful WAVE...

145   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING              145

      Mackelway suddenly stops... as if some electric charge had
      just shot through him, short-circuiting him into stillness. He
      begins to step away from the wall.

                                                                  77.


146   INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING                                        146

      O'Ryan has lost the "pulse" - the connection that had allowed
      him inside what we just witnessed.

      He rises, hurrying into a tiny bathroom. We STAY ON THAT
      WRITING PAD, trying to decipher these lines and squiggles -
      the ideograms - as we hear the sounds of O'Ryan, retching.

147   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 147

      Mackelway sits on the bed, looking at what he's just
      uncovered. An awesome sight. His head is pounding worse than
      ever... so he reaches for the Vicoden.

148   EXT. PLAY-AREA - RESUMING                                         148

      We've stepped out of that SUBJECTIVE POV now. Kathleen grabs
      her infant, distraught, as another massive 18-WHEEL TRUCK
      blows by us in the distance...

149   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        149

      O'Ryan washes his face, eyes his reflection in the mirror,
      scrutinizing himself.

150   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 150

      On the wall opposite Mackelway, that huge black wave is now
      entirely visible to him. Bits of chipped white paint litter
      the floor.

      A vast black wave. It fills the whole wall...

      Mackelway eyes his watch. It's one o'clock in the morning.
      He's been in here for four hours. That seems impossible.

                                                        CUT TO:

      ...a box, slamming down hard on a desk. We are:

151   INT. FBI OFFICE - O'RYAN ROOM - LATE NIGHT                        151

      2:30 a.m. Mackelway is in here by himself, angry. He reaches
      into that box. Inside? More pins. BLACK ONES. He crosses to
      the map.

152   CLOSE-UP: MACKELWAY                                               152

      He starts pulling out the YELLOW PINS we've grown accustomed
      to seeing on this map, replacing them with the BLACK ONES,
      tossing the discards onto the floor.

                                                                  78.


153   A SERIES OF DISSOLVES                                             153

      ...as Mackelway replaces pin after pin.

      ...Mackelway's face, as he backs away from that huge map.

154   INT. FBI OFFICE - O'RYAN ROOM - LATER NIGHT                       154

      Ten minutes have passed, but Mackelway has seen a revelation.
      We can read it on his face.

      He eyes the map... which has now been stuck with over 1,000
      BLACK PINS, one for each city with a HAVE YOU SEEN ME to its
      credit.

      And those black pins, seen from a distance, form a pattern we
      weren't expecting - something that never quite took shape when
      the pins were yellow.

      Looks like a big black WAVE. And that's just what it is.

      1,000 black dots conspiring to form the same exact shape that
      O'Ryan had painted onto the wall of his room - a massive wave
      of darkness, gathering strength.

      But this black wave is consuming America...

      Mackelway stares at it: awed, even a bit frightened. The thing
      seems vast, unstoppable... A black wave - pure malevolence,
      covering the states like a fog.

      One blue dot lies in its center: that blue pin, in the heart
      of Greenville, Texas. Then, piercing the silence:

                           CHARLTON (O.S.)
                 Got one of those pins in Denton yet?

      Mackelway turns. Charlton leans in the doorway.
                           CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                 O'Ryan was spotted there tonight. Took a
                 squad-car and a side-arm from a State
                 Trooper. 'Bout an hour later a five-year
                 old boy was abducted, roughly a mile up
                 the Interstate.

      It's 3 a.m. What's this guy doing here?

                           CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                 The vehicle was found in an abandoned
                 lot. We're establishing a perimeter
                 around the city now.

                                                         79.

                     MACKELWAY
               (knows already)
           But the Trooper wasn't hurt...

                     CHARLTON
           What makes you so sure?

                     MACKELWAY
           Professional courtesy.

Charlton's at a loss... until Mackelway gestures to the table,
where he has laid out O'Ryan's entire FBI File. Every memo,
citation, letter, i.d. picture. 150 pages.

Charlton eyes it, calmly. He's not going to let his jaw drop,
not with Mackelway watching. So he just nods.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Is that... possible, Sir? An agent can
           just be deleted?

                     CHARLTON
           Looks like it.

 Mackelway pauses. It's a depressing reality...

                     MACKELWAY
           I couldn't understand it before - pushing
           Speck's car onto the state line. Makes
           sense now. He wanted to make the case
           Federal. He's drawing us in.

                     CHARLTON
           Why would he do that?

                     MACKELWAY
           So we'd be paying attention when he found
           Suspect Zero.

                     CHARLTON
           Ya know what? I'm getting extremely tired
           of hearing that word. In fact, that's
           gonna be policy from now on. No Zero.
                     MACKELWAY
           Sir, profile the guy. He's straight outta
           Quantico. All he's doing is working a
           case, like we would. He's not kidnapping
           little kids - he's chasing the guy who's
           doing the kidnapping! Look at the map!

                                                       80.


                     CHARLTON
           What're you saying - that all these
           abductions are the work of one guy? Do
           you know how fucking insane that is?!
               (over Mackelway)
           Not let's try something that actually
           makes sense: He sends in these faxes,
           picks off three scumbags. For what?! So
           we'll think exactly what you're thinking
           right now - that we've got a friend out
           there, somebody willing to take out the
           garbage for the rest of us. And it's all
           horse-shit!

                     MACKELWAY
           What if it isn't? What if there really is
           a Zero out there and O'Ryan's the one guy
           who's got a shot at him?

                     CHARLTON
               (just blew his top)
           Fuck's sake, Mackelway - when did you
           start buying into this guy?!

A beat. Mackelway lets the silence hover.

                     MACKELWAY
               (quietly)
           He's smarter than we are.

                     CHARLTON
           Speak for yourself.

Charlton heads for the door.

                      MACKELWAY
           Sir? What if I told you I knew how to
           catch him?

Charlton stops. Turns.

                     CHARLTON
           Do you?

                     MACKELWAY
           And what if I told you that the way I'd
           catch him involved sitting in a dark
           room, with nothing in front of me but a
           pad of paper... until I'd tapped into
           some kind of... energy out there. The
           collective unconscious. Something. If I
           told you I thought I could target and
                     (MORE)

                                                            81.


                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           locate him, without ever leaving this
           building, what would you say?

                     CHARLTON
           I'd say you'd watched too many "X-Files."

                     MACKELWAY
           Y'ever heard of a project called
           "Icarus," Sir?

                     CHARLTON
           No.

Mackelway tosses over a few pages from O'Ryan's file.

                     MACKELWAY
           Agents, trained to "see" distant
           locations using nothing but the mind.
           They called it Remote Viewing.

Charlton eyes the pages without comment.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Army stole it from the Soviets. The
           Bureau stole it from the Army - used it
           to track serial killers.
               (a beat)
           Experimental program. O'Ryan was the
           first agent they recruited.

                     CHARLTON
           Good for him.

                     MACKELWAY
           Voodoo, right? Pure Bullshit.
               (Charlton's waiting)
           ...except, it worked. It's how he drew
           this:
Mackelway's referring to that DRAWING: a steamer-trunk, filled
with ghastly Ziploc bags:

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           He'd never been in that house before. He
           just saw what was in there - the Bureau
           taught him how... same one that deleted
           him. Same one that's trying to catch him
           now... Does anything about all this
           strike you as odd?

Charlton studies him, a long beat, measuring him... Then:

                                                                  82.


                           CHARLTON
                 I'm going to Denton at Oh-Six-Hundred.
                 You can take the day off.

      With that, he's gone - leaving Mackelway alone in here.
      Nothing to look at but that black wave... He hears Charlton,
      leaving the building.

      He slams another Vicoden, then hears a PHONE RING. Fuck it.
      He's not moving. Let Voice Mail get it.

      ...until he hears the sound of a FAX coming in.

      He rises. Follow him:

155   INT. FBI OFFICE - CUBICLES - CONTINUING                           155

      Mackelway hurries through the office, as the sound of that fax
      grows louder.

156   INT. "FAX ROOM" - CONTINUING                                      156

      He enters. The fax has spun out a single sheet. No top-sheet.
      That's odd...

      But here's another face, another victim, with the customary
      HAVE YOU SEEN ME? across the top.

      A young African-American boy: "Lloyd Simms, Age 9. Ht. 4'10",
      Wt. 67 lbs. Last Seen: Greenville, Texas. Date of
      Disappearance: 10-26-99."

      That's it. One face. The transmission ends. Mackelway eyes
      those vitals. They mean something. Greenville...

157   INT. FBI OFFICE - O'RYAN'S ROOM - RESUMING                        157

      He re-enters, and approaches that huge MAP. There's that wave
      of black pins, with the one BLUE PIN in its center;
      Greenville, with a "10-26" written beside it.

      Mackelway pulls out the lone blue pin, replaces it with a
      black one. Now the wave is complete. All black...

                                                        CUT TO:

158   INT. 18-WHEELER - CAB - MOVING - NIGHT                            158

      We've seen this truck before - several times in fact. It
      rumbles along the highway. We don't see who's driving, but we
      do see who's in the passenger seat:

                                                                 83.


      It's Charlie, five years-old, whose abduction we just
      witnessed. He sleeps fitfully.

      A MAN'S HAND can be seen, edging into frame - the DRIVER. He
      picks up a CASSETE, shoves it into the tape deck.

      And out comes the sound of "Barney the Dinosaur."

                           BARNEY (THRU DASHBOARD STEREO)
                 Oh silly songs get sillier/When you hear
                 them once again/And maybe you're hearing
                 an echo/Or maybe it's only a friend!

      The truck continues to rumble along.

                                                       CUT TO:

159   INT. FBI OFFICE - OUTSIDE THE O'RYAN ROOM - MORNING        159

      6 a.m. Fran pauses outside the O'Ryan Room... where Mackelway
      sleeps on a chair. Poor guy was here all night.

      She regards him... then her eyes find that MAP, and the gaping
      black wave across it. A horrible image...

      She studies Mackelway again, almost tenderly, until:

                           CHARLTON (O.S.)
                 Does he listen to you?

      She turns, startled. Here's Charlton, right behind her. And
      she's been caught... watching Mackelway sleep.

                           FRAN
                 I'm sorry?

                           CHARLTON
                 It's not a strength of his. I'm noticing
                 that lately.

      Truth is, she doesn't like Charlton. Or trust him...

                           FRAN
                 He's fine.

                           CHARLTON
                 I'm not so sure.
                     (a beat)
                 You oughtta sit him down, remind him how
                 a chain-of-command works.

                           FRAN
                 He's fine, Sir.

                                                               84.


                           CHARLTON
                 Talk to him.

      With that, he's gone. Fran watches as he heads for the Front
      Door... and exits.

      She looks back to Mackelway. He awakens with a start. Thinking
      no one's watching, he pops another Vicoden.

160   INT. O'RYAN ROOM - CONTINUING                                  160

      Fran enters, feeling slightly dirty from that exchange.
      Mackelway checks his watch as a few AGENTS exit the suite.

                           MACKELWAY
                 They going to Denton?

                             FRAN
                 Mmm-hmm.

                           MACKELWAY
                 But not you?

                           FRAN
                 Sitting in on two autopsies.

                             MACKELWAY
                 Oh.

      He rises. Heads for the door, stiff. She looks at those O'Ryan
      FBI DOCUMENTS NOW - her first time seeing them...

                             FRAN
                 You okay?

                             MACKELWAY
                 Yeah. Why?

                             FRAN
                 Nothing.

      She leaves it at that. He's about to exit, when:

                           MACKELWAY
                 Are they male or female?

                             FRAN
                 Huh?

                           MACKELWAY
                 The autopsies.

                                                           85.


                     FRAN
           Females - Logan, Utah; and Decatur,
           Alabama.

(Neither city is represented with black pins on that map.)

She slides over a packet of PHOTOS: two FEMALE VICTIMS,
photographed in separate morgues - face up, face down, waist
and above, waist and below, etc.

Mackelway eyes them, then leaves the room. We STAY WITH
FRAN... taking in that O'Ryan FBI file. It troubles her.

Mackelway returns, carrying the 9-by-12 envelope that Katie
gave to him.

                     FRAN (CONT'D)
               (re: O'Ryan's file)
           So is this what happens when an agent
           spins out? He gets deleted?

                     MACKELWAY
           Sometimes. The lucky ones get sent to
           Wichita Falls.

She breathes out an ironic laugh. He hands over the envelope,
opens it. Inside: that photo of Karen Sumpter. Mackelway
didn't pay much attention to it before.

Fran eyes the photo, then the vitals.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Friend of the Receptionist, missing for
           about a year now. I told her I'd let her
           know if the body ever turned up.

Fran doesn't look up from the photo.

                     FRAN
           The Receptionist.

                     MACKELWAY
           Her name's Katie.

She half-smiles: "You mean the one you've been fucking?" He
shrugs, confirming nothing - wishing Fran weren't quite so
smart. She puts the photo back into the envelope.

                     FRAN
           I see you got the blue pin out of
           Greenville.

                                                          86.


                     MACKELWAY
           Yeah. Last night. Kid named Simms.

That confused her.

                     FRAN
               (re: Sumpter)
           No. I meant her. The girl.

That confused him.

                     MACKELWAY
           What're you talking about?

                     FRAN
           Did ya look at her vitals?

She hands him the material on Karen Sumpter.

                     FRAN (CONT'D)
           Greenville, Texas. October 26.

He grabs the material, looks at it for the first time:

"Karen Sumpter, Age 25. Ht. 5'6", Wt. 110. Eyes Blu, Hair
Blnd. Last Seen: Greenville, Tx. Date of Disappearance: 10-26-
00."

Mackelway looks to the Conference Table - that huge stack of
faxes, all those helpless faces.

The one on top is the one that came in last night: Lloyd
Simms, Age 9. Ht. 4'10", Wt. 67 lbs. Last Seen: Greenville,
Texas. Date of Disappearance: 10-26-99.

At last, a pattern. A break.

Mackelway grabs the Simms fax, hurries out of the room.
Nearest Agent is Grieves. Mackelway hands him the fax.

                     MACKELWAY
           Need an address on this fax line.

Grieves has done this on fifty different faxes now; it never
yields their suspect, but:

                     GRIEVES
           'Kay.

Mackelway leans back in to the O'Ryan Room.

                     MACKELWAY
           O'Ryan's in Greenville.

                                                            87.


                     FRAN
           What makes you think so?

                     MACKELWAY
           That's where Zero is.
               (Fran's a blank)
           Lloyd Simms - October 26, '99. Karen
           Sumpter - October 26, 2000. Both
           disappeared from Greenville.
               (still no reply)
           Zero comes back to the same spot, once a
           year. Today's the 25th.

                     FRAN
           Wait. When did we establish that Zero was
           real?

                     MACKELWAY
           O'Ryan thinks so.

                     FRAN
           Do you?

That's the million-dollar question, and it hangs there.

Mackelway's about to answer... when he stops himself. Just
noticing something. That MORGUE PHOTO from Logan, Utah:

There's a BURN MARK on the lower left calf of the victim.
We've seen such a mark before, on another autopsy photo.

                     MACKELWAY
           I've seen this before.

                     FRAN
           Huh?

He doesn't answer, just hurries to a thick BOX OF OTHER
AUTOPSY FILES AND PHOTOS. Starts rifling through them...

...until he finds the one we've seen before. The body from
Trenton. He extracts it. Eyes it. A confirmation...

He lays the two PHOTOS side by side. Looks to Fran.

                     MACKELWAY
           Same burn-mark.
               (she leans in)
           I saw it before but it didn't register.

Fran eyes the photos. No doubt about it - they both have the
same burn mark on the lower left calf: a symmetrical, almost
horizontal stripe across the flesh.

                                                                   88.


                           FRAN
                 He burns them?

                            MACKELWAY
                 I dunno. Almost looks too symmetrical to
                 be a burn.
                     (re: Logan victim)
                 They're autopsying her this morning?

                           FRAN
                 Yeah.

      She gets the idea: "Find out where the hell this mark on the
      leg came from." Grieves enters.

                           GRIEVES
                 Fax number traces back to a Copy Center
                 on I-30. Greenville.
                     (Mackelway eyes his watch)
                 I called. They don't open for another
                 hour.

      Mackelway looks to Fran. She's not entirely sold yet... but
      she's getting there.

                                                         CUT TO:

161   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - EARLY MORNING                   161

      Mackelway plows along I-30.

      Ahead of him, one hell of an ugly STORM-FRONT seems to be
      waiting. Thick, black clouds. Mackelway's driving right into
      the teeth of them...

                                                         CUT TO:

162   EXT. "FAST-COPY" - ESTABLISHING - DAY                              162

      A copy-place, right off I-30. Mackelway's Yukon is parked in
      front.

163   INT. "FAST-COPY" - COUNTER - DAY                                   163

      Mackelway stands opposite a DAY-MANAGER: 30, harried, eyeing a
      copy of the composite drawing of O'Ryan.

                           DAY-MANAGER
                     (re: O'Ryan)
                 Naah. I never saw that guy in here.

                                                                89.


                           MACKELWAY
                 He sent a fax from this location 'bout
                 seven o'clock this morning.

                           DAY-MANAGER
                 We're closed at seven.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Are your faxes programmable? Could he
                 have paid last night to have it sent this
                 morning?

                           DAY-MANAGER
                 Sure. But that costs extra.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Were you here last night?

                           DAY-MANAGER
                 Nope. Haven't done nights since I got
                 promoted.

      Mackelway eyes the guy... then hears a CEL-PHONE ring.

                           MACKELWAY
                 'Scuse me.

      Mackelway grabs his cel, backing away from the counter.

                            MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                     (into cel)

164   INTERCUT WITH/INT. MORGUE - SAME                                164

      Fran is at a phone, in the Morgue. The Logan Utah BODY lies on
      the table.

                           FRAN
                 It's not a burn. It's a freezer-burn.
                           MACKELWAY
                 You're sure.

                           FRAN
                 There's crystallization in the blood
                 stream. The blood never clotted in the
                 wound. It's a freezer burn... I'm having
                 the other body shipped out - the guy from
                 Trenton. We'll see if he's got the same
                 thing.

      Mackelway pauses, thinking...

                                                                   90.


                           MACKELWAY
                 So... he keeps the bodies in a freezer,
                 then buries them...?

      That was a question. He can't do any better.

                           FRAN
                 I dunno. If he kept them in a freezer
                 they'd have marks like this all over.
                 Wouldn't they?

      Mackelway nods - that made sense. Shit.

      The noise of the Interstate doesn't make things any easier. A
      huge TRUCK rumbles by. 18 wheels.

      Mackelway eyes it, absently. Then a bolt hits him:

      On the side of the truck is a trademark: "EVER-FROST." This
      truck is hauling ice cream.

      Things just began to click.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Thanks, Fran.

      He has hit "End" before she can reply. Heads to his Yukon.

      Fran eyes the phone: that was odd...

                                                         CUT TO:

165   EXT. TRUCK STOP - GREENVILLE, TX. - ESTABLISHING - NOON            165

      A huge lay-out, with a diner, rest-stop, and gas station.

166   INT. DINER - GREENVILLE - SAME                                     166

      Mackelway sits at a table by a window. Watching. FIFTY MASSIVE
      TRUCKS in this lot - some refrigerated, most not.

      This Diner is big enough to seat 200: truckers, a few
      families, and folks who just like the buffet, (gravy covers
      just about every entree.)

      Mackelway's been here for hours. A WAITRESS comes by.

                           WAITRESS
                 You want some more breakfast, Honey, or
                 are we just rollin' right on into lunch?

                                                                 91.


                           MACKELWAY
                 Just some coffee, thanks. Might hit the
                 buffet in a bit.

                           WAITRESS
                 Meatloaf's lookin' good today.

      He smiles, thanks. She turns away. That leaves him alone
      again, scanning - not even sure he's in the right place.

      CEL-PHONE RINGS. He grabs it.

                           MACKELWAY (INTO PHONE)
                 Mackelway.

167   INTERCUT WITH/INT. FRAN'S CAR - DRIVING - SAME                   167

      She's driving, talking into the cel...

                           FRAN (INTO PHONE)
                 What're you doing?

                           MACKELWAY
                 Surveilling. What're you doing?

                           FRAN
                 Driving to Greenville.

                           MACKELWAY
                     (knows already)
                 Why would you be doing that?

                           FRAN
                 I think agents are safer when they have
                 some company. I can send along Katie if
                 you'd rather.

      Mackelway laughs. He appreciates a good jab.

                           MACKELWAY
                 I'm at the truck-stop we traced. Off the
                 I-30.

                           FRAN
                 I'm 'bout a half hour out.

                           MACKELWAY
                 I'll order some lunch for you. Hear the
                 meatloaf's good today.

      She half-smiles. She likes him, despite herself.

                                                                 92.


168   DINER - MACKELWAY - RESUMING                                     168

      He half-smiles, puts the cel-phone away. He likes her, despite
      himself.

      Then a MAN passes by him, a trucker. Let's call him VIC.

      All we see as he passes is the TATTOO on his forearm: a cobra.
      Keys jingle on his belt-hook. He wears a sleeveless down vest
      and a "God Bless America" cap.

      Mackelway turns, but Vic's already past us.

      Something about him attracts Mackelway's attention. The walk,
      the attitude. Something.

      So Mackelway is watching - without really knowing why - as Vic
      crosses the parking lot, heading for his rig. It's a beast.
      Vic climbs in, unaware that he's being watched.

      Mackelway looks away, chiding himself for allowing the guy to
      distract him. That WAITRESS comes by with more coffee.
      Mackelway smiles, looking absently out the window again.

      And sees a LITTLE BOY of 5, in the cab of Vic's rig...

      But this little boy is SCREAMING, struggling to get out of his
      car-seat, until Vic grabs the kid by the shoulders, roughly...
      all of this visible through the windshield.

      Mackelway locks in on the kid. Holy shit...

      Vic's rig pulls out. The kid pounds on his window. Looks like
      he's saying "Lemme out of here! I want my Mommy!" He might be
      little Charlie - we can't tell from here.

      But we can see that Vic is yelling at him: "Shut up!"

      And we can see that Vic's truck is refrigerated. He's hauling
      dairy products.

      On a normal day, Mackelway might shrug this off as
      coincidence. He might not be so vigilant.

      This isn't a normal day. He races for the door.

169   EXT. TRUCK-STOP - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER                    169

      Mackelway backs out in the Yukon, trying to keep a visual on
      Vic's truck.

      ANOTHER 18-WHEELER pulls in front of him, blocking his view
      entirely.

                                                                  93.


                           MACKELWAY
                 Dammit!

      He honks - loud - pulls around that other 18-wheeler, heading
      for the exit of the lot.

      Just spotted Vic's rig again.

170   EXT. ROAD/INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - CONTINUING                     170

      He follows Vic's rig out of the lot and onto a road
      approaching I-30. But there are three cars between them -
      Mackelway can't get a clean look at Vic's license plate.

      Vic approaches the Interstate. So do the three cars between
      them.

      Vic passes the Interstate on-ramp. The three cars turn on to
      it... putting Mackelway right on Vic's tail.

      He grabs his cel, dials. This truck has license plates from
      ten states.

                           MACKELWAY (INTO CEL)
                 This is Mackelway. I need a run down on a
                 plate. Texas: Delta-142-Romeo-Victor-
                 Alpha. Got that?

      He puts the cel down, but doesn't hang up. Vic just made a
      turn onto a VAST DIRT LOT.

      A huge BANNER overhead reads, "FOUNDERS DAY CARNIVAL!!!"

171   EXT. CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT - CONTINUING                          171

      There are several BIG-RIGS parked here, but the vast majority
      of the vehicles we see are garden-variety cars and SUV's. A
      few pick-ups.

      There are RIDES at this carnival: Pony rides, a ferris wheel,
      and a huge ring of Barbeques, each fired up and cooking. Must
      be a thousand people in attendance today.

      Vic parks his rig. Mackelway hangs back, watching:

      Vic gets out of the rig. From here we can see that that 5-year-
      old BOY is still stick in his car seat, and he is still
      screaming and flailing.

      Vic points a stern finger at the kid as if to say, "Behave or
      else." Then Vic disappears into the crowded carnival.

                                                                  94.


172   EXT. MACKELWAY - AT HIS CAR - RESUMING                            172

      He gets out of the Yukon, approaching Vic's truck. We CROSS
      THE LOT WITH HIM.

      He reaches Vic's truck, looks in the passenger window. There's
      the five year-old kid, tears streaming down his face. (We
      still can't tell if it's Charlie.)

      Mackelway reaches for the passenger-side door. It's locked. Of
      course. And he can't shoot his way in.

      He looks to the kid inside:

                           MACKELWAY
                 You okay?
                     (Kid's a blank)
                 Kid? You okay in there?

      The Kid doesn't respond - just seems spooked. Shit...
      Mackelway looks into the heart of that crowd. Vic's still
      visible to us, but he won't be for long.

                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                     (at the Kid)
                 I'll be back. Don't worry.

      Mackelway heads into the carnival.

173   EXT. CARNIVAL - CONTINUING                                        173

      He begins running now, past the table where ladies are selling
      TICKETS for the rides and games, past the Cotton-Candy Guy.

      Running... because we just lost sight of Vic.

      Mackelway hurries through that ring of barbeques, upsetting a
      tray or two. Then he stops. There's the ferris wheel. Was that
      Vic on the other side of it?

      Mackelway takes off.

174   EXT. FERRIS WHEEL - CONTINUING                                    174

      No Vic. But Mackelway thinks he sees the guy... heading back
      in the direction of the parking lot.

      He runs past the Pony rides, past a funhouse, past a popcorn
      machine, past those ladies selling tickets.

                                                                 95.


175   EXT. PARKING LOT - RESUMING                                      175

      He hits a bottleneck of people at the entrance. But he bursts
      through, runs into the dirt parking lot, around cars and big-
      rigs, then turns a corner and:

      ...runs smack into Benjamin O'Ryan.

      The shock is so total it takes each of them a moment to
      recover from it. But here he is. O'Ryan, five feet away.

      Mackelway's speechless, still trying to recalibrate himself. A
      second ago he was chasing a possible Zero. Now he's face to
      face with O'Ryan.

      And O'Ryan isn't running. In fact, he almost seems amused.

                           O'RYAN
                 Well, well... Must be quite a moment for
                 you. Congratulations.

      Mackelway still hasn't spoken, until:

                           MACKELWAY
                 What're you doing here?

                           O'RYAN
                 Waiting for you.

      ...which is when Mackelway realizes that he is standing right
      in front of Vic's rig.

      But he wasn't expecting what comes next:

      Vic has returned to the rig, with a WOMAN beside him. Turns
      out, she's his WIFE. Vic opens the passenger-side door,
      unclasps that five year-old kid from his seat.

                           FIVE YEAR-OLD
                 Mommy!

      The kid dives into the Woman's arms.

                           WOMAN
                 Morning, Baby!

                           VIC
                 I told you she'd be here.
                     (to Woman)
                 He's been a brat all morning.

                                                                  96.


      Mother hugs son... which means that Mackelway has misread
      things, badly.

      And O'Ryan is a witness to it - hence the grin.

                           MACKELWAY
                     (at O'Ryan)
                 Hands up.

      O'Ryan raises his hands. Mackelway reaches for his cuffs.

                                                        CUT TO:

176   EXT. CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER                       176

      O'Ryan's hands are cuffed in front of him. Mackelway leads him
      to the Yukon, opens a door for him, and puts him into the
      backseat. A few LOOKIE-LOU'S strain for a peek.

177   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - CONTINUING                               177

      Mackelway gets in, hits the ignition. Reaches for his cel-
      phone. Starts to dial.

                           O'RYAN
                     (disappointed)
                 Awfully conventional - don't ya think?

      Mackelway pauses.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Huh?

                           O'RYAN
                 Apprehend the fugitive, then call it in
                 for your pat on the head.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Sorry to disappoint you.

      Mackelway continues to dial.

                            O'RYAN
                 I'll get over it.
                     (flat)
                 But I'm not too sure that little boy
                 will.

      Bang. That just stopped Mackelway, mid-dial.

                                                               97.


                           MACKELWAY
                     (minor test)
                 What little boy?

                           O'RYAN
                 The one from the Diner, in Denton.

                           MACKELWAY
                 You know where he is?

                           O'RYAN
                 I can find him.

                           MACKELWAY
                 How?

                           O'RYAN
                 Same way I found Starkey, and Speck, and
                 Fulcher... and you.

      That rang a bell.

                           O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                 I need someplace quiet - someplace I can
                 concentrate... And your assurance that
                 once he's located, we go get him
                 together.

                           MACKELWAY
                 I can't do that.

                           O'RYAN
                 Then I can't help you.

      Mackelway, disgusted, pulls out of the lot.

178   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER               178

      Through sparse traffic, heading for an Interstate on-ramp.
                          O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                I'm talking about uncompromised justice.
                No trials. No lawyers. No hiccups in a
                chain of evidence that can set a monster
                free. You of all people should be able to
                appreciate the value of that.

                          MACKELWAY
                Where's the boy?

                          O'RYAN
                I won't be doing this much longer.
                Actually, this is the end of it. I've
                          (MORE)

                                                         98.


                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           come to accept that. But there is one
           last thing to--

                     MACKELWAY
               (anger rising)
           Where's the boy, O'Ryan?

                     O'RYAN
           Do we have an understanding?

Mackelway pulls the car over, under an I-30 overpass... and
out comes his gun, pointed right at O'Ryan's forehead.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Enough of this shit. Where's the boy?

O'Ryan can't help it. He's pleased.

                     O'RYAN
           Good. This is good. Sort of thing you'd
           never find in a procedural manual. It
           tells me I was right about you.

                     MACKELWAY
               (cocking the hammer)
           I will kill you, O'Ryan.

                     O'RYAN
           I know. But we have work to do first.

                     MACKELWAY
           Where's the Goddamn kid?!?!

Silence... Then that CEL-PHONE rings. Must be Fran.

                     O'RYAN
           Don't pick that up.

Mackelway eyes him: are you kidding? It rings again.

                    O'RYAN (CONT'D)
              (a panicked offer)
          This is the guy who put all those pins in
          that map of yours! And I can take you to
          him!

Ring #3. Mackelway grabs the phone.

                     MACKELWAY
           Fine. Where is he?
               (silence)
           Where is he?!?!

                                                                  99.


      Silence, punctuated by Ring #4. Then O'Ryan smiles... and
      points to his own forehead.

                           O'RYAN
                 Right here...

      Mackelway lets out a disgusted sigh.

                             MACKELWAY
                 Fuck you.

      He punches the "Talk" button, taking his eyes off O'Ryan for a
      split second.

      ...What follows is a blur:

      O'Ryan lunges forward like an animal, throwing his cuffed
      wrists over Mackelway's head, yanking Mackelway out of his
      seat with a violent tug. The gun falls.

      We POP OUTSIDE THE YUKON, pulling back... obscuring our view
      of what's going on inside that truck.

      That cel-phone continues to ring... We keep pulling back,
      under this sparsely-trafficked overpass, rain falling.

      The cel-phone stops ringing. CONTINUE PULLING BACK, taking in
      the expanse of highway - cars rolling by without a hint of the
      peril beneath them...

                                                       CUT TO:

179   INT. TRUCK-STOP - DINER - GREENVILLE - SAME (DAY)                 179

      Fran has just arrived. She scans the place. Doesn't see
      Mackelway. Great. She reaches for that cel-phone again...

                                                       CUT TO:

180   INT. A THIRD UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                      180

      Mackelway awakens. The room feels like it's swimming. His arms
      and legs are bound. His mouth has been GAGGED.

      And he is staring into his own REFLECTION.

      He lies on his side. A MIRROR has been propped on the floor,
      just inches from his face - leaving him with nothing to look
      at but himself.

      He strains against the ropes, but there's no give to them.
      He's helpless, powerless. And that mirror is forcing him to
      watch it all with perfect clarity.

                                                        100.


A few feet away, O'Ryan sits in a chair, calmly peeling the
skin off of an apple with that huge HUNTING KNIFE of his. A
CANDLE flickers on the floor by his feet.

                     O'RYAN
           Are you afraid?

There was a delight to that question - we can see it on
O'Ryan's face. Mackelway, of course, can't reply due to the
gag. But the answer's obvious.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
               (quoting himself, as Daitz:)
           "Imagine a killer with no patterns, no
           tell-tale fetishes, no rituals of any
           kind. No hidden desire to be caught. A
           perfect vessel of evil."

All Mackelway can see is his own reflection - the fear in his
eyes - bouncing off a mirror that's only inches away.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           And the name we give that killer... is
           Zero.
               (again:)
           Are you afraid?

Slowly, he lowers the knife into the flame of that candle on
the floor. It GLOWS. Good God...

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           It'd be customary at this point to start
           praying. I hear a lot of that. Haven't
           seen too many answers though. I wouldn't
           hold my breath waiting for another
           janitor to break in here and save you,
           either. You're alone.

Mackelway tries to speak. It's impossible.

O'Ryan pulls the GAG from his mouth, just long enough for
Mackelway to say:

                     MACKELWAY
           Where's the boy?

O'Ryan jams the gag back into his mouth, angrily.

                     O'RYAN
               (re: the mirror)
           My, my. Must be extremely satisfying to
           watch yourself say something so heroic.
           I'm almost envious.
                     (MORE)

                                                           101.


                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
               (casually)
           The boy's under the bed. In pieces. Are
           you afraid?

Mackelway absorbs that - watches himself absorb it - then
looks to that bed. Can't quite see what's under it...

O'Ryan eyes the flames as they dance over the blade.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           I know what you're thinking: "There is
           pain coming. Am I going to take it like a
           man?" Let me put you at ease: You won't.
           None of them do. Men, women, children.
           They all weep, they all beg. They pass
           out, they piss themselves. They attempt
           negotiation: You wouldn't believe how
           many men have lain right where you're
           lying right now - grown men, with wives
           and children back home - offering all
           kinds of sexual gratification in exchange
           for a five minute reprieve. It's
           pathetic. Are you afraid?
               (of course, no reply)
           Then there's that moment when they
           realize there's nothing left to be
           negotiated. They're just mine. And
           they're helpless. And the look in their
           eyes, the level of surrender... well,
           it's almost pornographic. I put this
           mirror here because I don't want you to
           miss it. Are you afraid?

With that, he lifts that hunting knife out of the flame. It is
RED-HOT. Even looking at it is painful.

But Mackelway can't look at anything else.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           How about now?

Just like that, that red-hot knife is an inch from Mackelway's
face. The heat alone makes his head jerk back. Wisps of smoke
rise from its edge.

And Mackelway is forced to watch his own reaction to it.

He struggles against these ropes, to no use. A guttural sound
comes out of him.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Are you afraid?

                                                           102.


O'Ryan's hand lashes out a bit, leaving the sizzling knife
just under Mackelway's chin. The anticipation of pain is
unbearable. And Mackelway is reading it in his own eyes...

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Hmmm? Agent Mackelway? Are you?

Two things hit at once: 1) This monster is about to torture me
to death. 2) Please, God, don't let me give him the
satisfaction of seeing me cry...

O'Ryan moves the blade again, this time an eighth of an inch
above Mackelway's right arm. The heat from it is so incendiary
that Mackelway's shirt begins to smoke.

                      O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Are you?

Mackelway's shirt is officially on fire now. The pain is
awful. He stares at his own reflection.

...as tears begin to flow from his eyes. He can't stop them.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
               (top of his lungs)
           Are you afraid?!

That bounces off the walls. Mackelway shuts his eyes tight -
can't watch this anymore.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
               (infuriated)
           Open your eyes! Open your eyes Goddammit
           or I'll cut the fucking lids off!!

Mackelway opens his eyes, forced to watch himself break. Deep
sobs shudder through him, as...

O'Ryan digs that red-hot blade into Mackelway's arm:
                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           ARE YOU AFRAID?!?!

Mackelway sees the answer in his own reflection: Yes, I am
terrified. He SHRIEKS, the sound muffled by that gag.

With his body able to do no more than spasm, he jerks his head
forward, smashing it into that mirror. THE MIRROR SHATTERS,
obliterating the image.

...and everything goes black.

                                                                 103.


      Then, MORE IMAGES SWARM AT US. We're helpless to beat them
      back:

180a EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME                              180a

      Out of a soupy darkness, a dreamlike spin on a location we've
      visited before: It is the wheat field that O'Ryan has Remote
      Viewed countless times. Only this time we see it through
      Mackelway's fever, or nightmare... We see the tall wheat, the
      wet wind - familiar images to us. All to the pounding Chant of
      the Navaho.

      But then OTHER IMAGES enter this world. They're jarring:

      -That TRIBESMAN, eyes rolling back, foaming the mouth,
      dancing around a fire in a frenzy. Then a curtain of wheat
      obscures him, revealing:
      -Fran, and Katie, giggling, crooking fingers as if inviting
      us. Looks like they're naked. But as we approach them, they
      seem to get farther away. Then that curtain of wheat that
      separates us from them reveals:
      -Charlton, extending a hand to us, warmly, congratulating us
      for something, a job well done, when:

      Mackelway himself is hunting through the wet wheat, gun drawn.
      He FIRES... Then looks to see who he's just shot.

      A body. He turns it over.

      ...and is staring at himself, lying dead on the ground in the
      mud and pouring rain. It is a moment of shock and horror,
      giving way as we...

181   FADE UP AGAIN...                                                  181

      ...on O'Ryan - at a desk, sitting upright, making notes on a
      pad. Calm. Businesslike. His back turned to us.

182   INT. THAT UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - LATER NIGHT                   182

      Time has passed. We don't know how much. Or maybe we're dead,
      or dreaming. It's hard to say...

      But there's O'Ryan, at a desk. Writing...

      Mackelway's eyes are open. His FOREHEAD has a bright red
      raspberry on it from smashing into that mirror.

      But the brain is functioning. It starts running through a
      check-list:

                                                           104.


I'm in the same motel room. I'm on a bed. I'm alive. There's
O'Ryan. Everything hurts. No, it's just my right arm. But it
is searing.

The check-list continues: my mouth is sore, but that GAG has
been removed.

And MY ARMS ARE UNBOUND. Legs too. Maybe I am dead.

Mackelway tries to move his hand. It takes some effort.
Everything's foggy. But he puts it before his face. Turns it.
Flexes it. Squeezes it. His hand... He stares at it.

Then he notices his SHOULDER. A fat BANDAGE has been wrapped
around it - covering up the source of that searing pain. Looks
as though a nurse had tended to it.

But this sure as hell isn't a hospital...

Then, O'Ryan turns, facing us. Mackelway recoils without
meaning to.

But O'Ryan's demeanor has changed. That look of possessed
malevolence - it's gone now. We can't imagine why.

                     O'RYAN
               (softly)
           Stand up.

Mackelway pauses, rewinding that one.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           It's over now. Can you stand?

Mackelway is still bracing for torture, or at least combat. So
he's a step behind.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           We really do have to go.

O'Ryan rises, crossing toward us. Even unbound, Mackelway is
expecting another onslaught... But all O'Ryan does is drop a
piece of paper onto Mackelway's lap.

It's another DRAWING: of a RANCH-HOUSE, with a windmill in the
background. Crude, but just specific enough. Mackelway's still
too unwound to speak...

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           This is where he'll be. With the boy.
               (a beat)
           Zero. He's coming home today. We're going
           to be there.

                                                        105.


Mackelway's starting to understand now. This was an act. An
initiation. That stuns him...

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           You're ready to come with me now. You've
           been in the pit. Stand up.

Mackelway eyes him - utter disbelief.

O'Ryan smiles warmly - like a Drill Sergeant at the end of
Basic: Sorry I was so hard on you but it had to be done... Can
we shake on it?

Instead, Mackelway simply EXPLODES:

It is a blur, faster than a blur, but Mackelway rises with an
animal roar, knocking O'Ryan flat on his back.

Then Mackelway is upon him.

All the helplessness, all the horror, the images of watching
himself in that mirror, the sounds of his own uncontrollable
sobbing... they ERUPT now into violence.

It is an overwhelming force. O'Ryan can't begin to fight it
off. Mackelway has one hand on O'Ryan's throat. The other hand
comes down like a sledgehammer.

One blow. Then another. The sounds coming out of Mackelway are
savage, barely human. He's out of control.

O'Ryan's eyes roll back. Mackelway now puts both hands around
this fucker's throat. He's going to kill him - right here.
He's going to squeeze the life from him.

This is a Mackelway we've never met before. His eyes are wild,
hateful - even as the last gasps of breath rasp their way out
of O'Ryan's throat.

Then Mackelway is distracted, for just a second. No. Less than
a second... by a glimpse of that SHATTERED MIRROR - his own
twisted image.

He looks away from it, refusing to be distracted, determined
to kill this guy.

...then those eyes drift back to the mirror again.

...and he sees his reflection: a hardened, crazed stranger. An
animal.

His hands, without warning, release their grip.

                                                                 106.


      O'Ryan gasps for air. His face has been bloodied. Mackelway
      rises, disgusted, removing a great weight from O'Ryan's chest.
      That makes breathing a little easier.

      Mackelway crosses to a tiny, cheap BATHROOM.

183   INT. MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - CONTINUING                           183

      Mackelway enters. There's a mirror in here too. That fat
      BANDAGE on his shoulder stares back at him.

      He tugs at it - doesn't unravel it, just yanks it off his arm -
      revealing a hideous wound.

      It's a ZERO, WITH A SLASH THROUGH IT.

      Now everything clicks: O'Ryan was branding him. Initiating him
      with that red-hot knife.

      Mackelway stares at the wound, his eyes lifeless. He splashes
      some water on his face, his mind still reeling.

      Then O'Ryan appears in the doorway. He too looks like hell -
      face bloodied, throat red, eyes watering. A long beat...

      Mackelway eyes him, incredulous. O'Ryan nods, then places that
      DRAWING of the Ranch-House on the sink. Mackelway eyes it.

      Then O'Ryan stuns him... by laying Mackelway's GUN atop the
      drawing, without a word.

      Mackelway eyes the gun, then grabs it and points it right at
      O'Ryan's face, just inches away.

      We're TIGHT on Mackelway's hand. It trembles with rage.

      But O'Ryan, looking right down the barrel, seems unafraid. In
      fact he smiles, utterly confident. Then:

                           O'RYAN
                     (re: gun)
                 Soon. I promise... But not yet.

      He eases Mackelway's hand down, thus lowering the gun. Then
      O'Ryan turns, grabs Mackelway's car keys, and heads for the
      front door.

      Mackelway stands, rigid. He raises the gun. Maybe I'll just
      shoot this fucker in the back.

      Then those IMAGES come at us again, out of nowhere:

                                                                 107.


184   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT                                          184

      Out of a gray, soupy swirl - coming slightly into focus: Wet
      wind, tall wheat, our own heavy BREATHING as we run... And
      that non-descript voice we heard echoing earlier becomes the
      sound of O'Ryan's voice, static-filled, wobbling:

                           O'RYAN (O.S.)
                 Please... I'm begging you.

      That was clear enough. A gun rises. We seem to be holding
      it...

      Then those images vanish, and we are jolted back to:

185   INT. MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - RESUMING                             185

      Mackelway tightens. O'Ryan's out the door. This VISION that
      keeps getting clearer and clearer... What the hell does this
      it mean?

      Down go two more Vicodens...

                                                       CUT TO:

186   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - NIGHT                          186

      A huge STORM devours scenery on both sides of us. O'Ryan
      drives. Mackelway sits, no expression at all on his face,
      still recovering from what happened in that room...

      Silence... Then:

                           MACKELWAY
                 Tell me about Icarus.

                           O'RYAN
                 Why?

                           MACKELWAY
                 Just... wanna know.

      O'Ryan eyes him. The sky is black.

                           O'RYAN
                 There were five of us. In the program.

      Mackelway's all ears...

                           O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                 We'd come in in the morning, have a cup
                 of coffee, talk about the Yankees. Then
                 you'd go to your room, with your pen and
                           (MORE)

                                                         108.


                       O'RYAN (CONT'D)
             your pad of paper, always alone, and
             you'd try to lock in. Son of Sam. John
             Wayne Gacy. Ted Bundy. He might be
             driving his car, or having a beer or
             brushing his teeth... or cutting
             someone's eyes out.

That was said flatly, matter-of-factly. It's chilling.

                        O'RYAN (CONT'D)
             If you did it right, you got all of it:
             The way it sounded. The way it smelled...
             Those people were looking up at you,
             begging you for mercy. It was like being
             God.
                  (a beat)
             ...except you're not. Because you can't
             do a thing for them. Can't make it stop.
             You're just watching, helpless.

He pauses.

                       O'RYAN (CONT'D)
             They wired us into this current, the five
             of us: darkness, the pit itself. We were
             plugged right into it. But nobody taught
             us how to shut it off...
                 (thinking back...)
             We were just men. And we saw things men
             shouldn't see. Agony, torture, evil - and
             it never shut off. Even now, it's still
             there.

                       MACKELWAY
             They all wind up like you? The other
             agents?

                       O'RYAN
             No. They're dead now.

Oh. Mackelway doesn't reply...

                       O'RYAN (CONT'D)
             They broke down. Then they opted out.
                 (Mackelway's a blank)
             Killed themselves... After a while, those
             conversations about the Yankees became
             impossible. Ya see?

Mackelway lets that sink in, as he stares at passing head-
lights. Then:

                       MACKELWAY
             I'm sorry.

                                                                   109.


      O'Ryan shrugs. He appreciates it. The windshield wipers beat
      back rain...

                                                         CUT TO:

187   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - LATER NIGHT                      187

      O'Ryan continues to drive. Silence hangs. Then:

                           O'RYAN
                 We're here.

      Mackelway sits up. O'Ryan pulls over at:

188   EXT. RANCH-HOUSE - GREENVILLE, TEXAS - CONTINUING                   188

      We've seen this place before. That is, we've seen it in
      O'Ryan's DRAWING, which lies on the dashboard before us: A
      ranch-style house with a WINDMILL in the backyard.

      O'Ryan pulls over. Rain pounds on the roof and hood. Wind
      blows. Mackelway studies the house. Then his eyes shift
      briefly to the drawing.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Can't bring you in with me. You know
                 that.

      O'Ryan shrugs, then raises his hands: "Cuff me."

      The CUFFS are lying on the floor in the back seat. Mackelway
      reaches back, to grab them... a golden opportunity for O'Ryan
      to club the guy.

      But O'Ryan remains still. Mackelway grabs them. Then he stops.
      Simply has to ask:

                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                 Those faxes, the Have-You-Seen-Me's...
                 How many of 'em is he actually
                 responsible for?

      O'Ryan lays it right out:

                           O'RYAN
                 All of 'em.

      Mackelway nods, sobered. Cuffs O'Ryan to the steering wheel
      and approaches the house.

                                                                 110.


189   EXT. RANCH HOUSE - WALKWAY - CONTINUING                           189

      The place is in some disrepair: untended lawn, chipping paint,
      etc. Mackelway looks through the kitchen window.

      No one's visible. He walks around the side of the house.

190   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - RESUMING                                 190

      O'Ryan watches as Mackelway vanishes. This is a moment of
      opportunity. With his free hand, he reaches into his pocket,
      grabbing a lighter.

191   EXT. RANCH HOUSE - SIDE - CONTINUING                              191

      Mackelway moves cautiously, being pelted by rain. But now he
      can see inside the Living Room of this home:

      It's a bit of a time warp: plastic on the furniture, an old
      radiator, pictures on the mantle in antique frames.

      And an OLD LADY, leaning over a record player.

      Tough to hear what's playing - we're outside, and that storm
      is pounding - but it sounds like Glenn Miller. There's also an
      old tv in here: "Wizard of Oz" is on it.

      The lady is 70, frail, thin. She also happens to be BLIND.
      Cataracts on her eyes. Her name's DELIA. Mackelway watches
      her... as she exits the room, heading for the kitchen.

      He moves to another window.

192   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - RESUMING                                 192

      O'Ryan, keeping his eyes on that house, now lights the
      lighter... and holds the flame up to the CHAIN connecting his
      hand-cuff to the one on the steering wheel.

      The chain begins to heat up...

193   EXT. SIDE OF THE HOUSE - RESUMING                                 193

      Mackelway watches as Delia makes her way into the kitchen.

      It, too, is from another era: the dishwasher stands in the
      center of the floor, connected to the sink with a long hose.
      The refrigerator, the table, the toaster - all old.

      The oven is an antique too. Delia crosses to it, grabs a
      towel, opens it... and pulls a CAKE from it.

                                                              111.


      She brings the cake to the kitchen table, moving well for a
      lady who can't see. On the table is an old-fashioned baker's
      frosting tube.

      She grabs it, using her hands to orient herself... and begins
      to write on the cake, in frosting. Slowly.

      Mackelway can't see the top of that cake, but we can. The
      first letters, in beautiful cursive, read: "Happy Bir..." It's
      a work in progress.

194   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - RESUMING                              194

      O'Ryan has that handcuff chain GLOWING now. We don't know if
      he'll have time to break the thing... until:

      The passenger-side door is opened, abruptly.

                           MACKELWAY
                 It's his birthday, isn't it?

      O'Ryan turns. Here's Mackelway, who now gets an eyeful of what
      O'Ryan's doing with that lighter.

      O'Ryan pockets it, a bit sheepishly. Mackelway decides to
      ignore the whole thing...

                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                 He comes home on his birthday.

      O'Ryan nods. Then Delia's front door swings open.

                           DELIA (O.S.)
                     (aloud, delighted)
                 Darling?! That you?!

195   EXT. RANCH HOUSE - ENTRY - CONTINUING                          195

      Delia stands in the open doorway: an old blind lady, talking
      to the dark rainy street. That confuses them.

      ...until we hear the rumble of an 18-WHEEL TRUCK.

      It turns a corner onto this street. Mackelway turns now...

      We've seen this truck before. A monstrous, rolling beast. And
      Mackelway straightens, reaching for his sidearm. Behind him,
      Delia smiles excitedly, almost dancing.

      But that smile soon leaps from her face... as she hears the
      sound of that 18-wheeler, BRAKING ABRUPTLY, its tires locking-
      up on the wet road.

                                                                 112.


      Mackelway gets a look at the DRIVER now - a wiry, sinewy man
      of 35... Let's call him ZERO.

      Their eyes lock - until Zero throws his rig into gear again
      and begins to rumble down the street.

                           DELIA (CONT'D)
                     (confused)
                 Daryl? Honey?

      No answer. That truck is rumbling away. Mackelway turns,
      racing for the Yukon, leaving Delia at the door.

196   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - CONTINUING                               196

      Mackelway jumps in to the Yukon, unlocking those cuffs.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Drive.

      He accidentally burns himself on the super-heated chain.

                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                     (re: burn)
                 Fuck!

      Cuffs are unlocked now. O'Ryan starts up the Yukon.

197   EXT. GREENVILLE STREETS - DRIVING - CONTINUING                    197

      O'Ryan drives, pursuing the big-rig. Mackelway gets on his cel-
      phone, dials. Rain falls in SHEETS all around them.

                           MACKELWAY (INTO CEL-PHONE)
                     (urgently)
                 This is Mackelway! I'm travelling north
                 on... Grove Road, approaching I-30 in
                 Greenville. Request immediate back-up.
                 Pursuing a suspect in a refrigerated
                 truck, Texas license plate Alpha--

      The Yukon swerves hard to the right, narrowly avoiding the
      tail end of Zero's rig as he swings it into our path.
      Mackelway drops the phone. Grabs it again.

                           MACKELWAY (PHONE, CONT'D)
                 Alpha-4-5-2-Tango-Foxtrot-Alpha.

      Zero does it again - swinging the rear of his rig across the
      road, forcing O'Ryan to swerve hard. The Yukon gets shoved on
      to a curb, then clunks down to the street again.

                                                                 113.


      Then Zero jams on the brakes. Mackelway's eyes go wide.

                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                     (at O'Ryan)
                 Brakes!

      O'Ryan jumps on the brakes. The Yukon screeches to a stop,
      throwing itself into a sideways slide. It bangs, passenger
      side first, into the rear of the truck, breaking a window.

      Mackelway ducks out of the way of breaking glass. Then the rig
      pulls away again. O'Ryan follows.

198   THE CHASE - CONTINUING                                            198

      Zero's rig turns hard onto a SERVICE ROAD, running parallel to
      the Interstate. Mackelway is locked in on that truck.

                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                     (into cel-phone again)
                 Travelling due west now. Don't see a
                 name. It's a service road, running
                 parallel to the--

      Then Mackelway freezes, mid-word. He just saw something that
      made his jaw drop:

      On the other side of this road is a field of TALL WHEAT.

      Time seems to stop. His blood feels like it just congealed.
      Tall wheat in a wet wind. He has been here before. He has seen
      it before.

      And so has O'Ryan...

      Mackelway just stares, slack-jawed, as that wheat whips past
      them. The feeling is so unsettling that for a moment he
      forgets about Zero, and the rig, and the kid...

      Everything has just crystallized in a horrible way. He knows
      that he is going to wind up in that wheat field, somehow, with
      O'Ryan.

      And O'Ryan will be begging him for mercy. "Please..."

      O'Ryan guns the Yukon, attempting to cut in front of the rig.
      Zero swings wide, sending the Yukon into a curb this time.
      That shreds their front tire.

      ...which means that in one minute this car is going to be
      undriveable. So if they don't stop Zero from hitting that
      Interstate - now - Zero will be gone.

                                                              114.


                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                     (absently)
                 What're you...

                           O'RYAN
                 Can't let him hit the Interstate.

      Mackelway braces himself, as O'Ryan guns his car up the left
      side of the rig, shredded tire and all. Then:

      He pulls right in front of the rig. At about 60 m.p.h. And he
      jams on the brakes.

      Zero swerves, out of instinct. It throws the rig into a
      vicious JACK-KNIFE. The van whips around in front of the cab,
      swatting the Yukon away like a fly.

      We're inside the Yukon as it rolls, Mackelway and O'Ryan look
      like tinker toys.

      The torque pulls Zero's rig onto its side, sliding hard. Metal
      hits concrete, sending up a shower of SPARKS.

      The Yukon winds up in a ditch alongside the service road,
      upside down. Mackelway, alive and awake, strains to look out
      the busted windshield.

      What he sees is hard to discern - but it looks like Zero's rig
      is lying flat on its side.

      And, of course, he is mere yards from that wheat field...

199   EXT. SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUING                                 199

      The rig's cab lies driver's-side down. But the passenger-side
      door pops open. And Zero pokes through it, his eyes
      immediately scanning that TALL WHEAT. Rain pours.

      Mackelway's watching. O'Ryan, who blacked out for a second now
      opens his eyes, getting the picture in a hurry.

      Zero leaps to the ground, rolls, and rises. Only thing in his
      hand is a TIRE IRON. Carrying it, he sprints into the wheat
      field - vanishing.

      Mackelway bursts out of the Yukon, in pursuit. O'Ryan's door
      is stuck. Mackelway doesn't stop to help him - just barrels
      across the street.

      Just then - a STATE RANGER CAR arrives.

                                                                 115.


                            MACKELWAY
                      (over his shoulder, running)
                 Get the van open! He's got a kid in the
                 van!

      STATE RANGER hurries out of his squad car. Mackelway sprints
      into the tall wheat.

      O'Ryan, with a grunt, gets his door open. Now he too
      disappears into that Wheat Field.

200   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - CONTINUING                                     200

      Tall wheat in a stiff wet wind, and not a drop of moonlight to
      guide us. Mackelway plunges in, gun drawn. No idea where he's
      going.

      ...except he's been here before. He's seen it. And there is a
      feeling of inevitability to all this; it's haunting.

      He's practically blind in here. Can't see five feet in front
      of him. Nothing but the sound of his own breathing.

      That, too, was presaged. Those visions...

201   EXT. ZERO'S TOPPLED RIG - CONTINUING                              201

      It's locked. Ranger pulls out his handgun and blows the lock
      away.

202   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING                                       202

      Mackelway keeps running, deaf and blind.

      O'Ryan is running nearby, but they can't see or hear one
      another.

203   INT. THE TOPPLED RIG - REFRIGERATED VAN - RESUMING                203

      200 sides of beef lie on their sides. Ranger plunges in.

      Then the Ranger spots, in the back of the van, a FALSE-WALL
      that used to hide a secret compartment.

      The crash has collapsed part of the false-wall. Frozen air
      blows out in wisps. He climbs over those carcasses, fast as he
      can...

204   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING                                       204

      Mackelway keeps going, running blind.

                                                                116.


      Then, another sound, up ahead. Sounds like the noise of
      someone stumbling. Mackelway stops. Listens.

      Silence. The sound does not repeat itself.

      He continues along, step by cautious step now.

205   INT. TOPPLED RIG - REFRIGERATED VAN - RESUMING                   205

      Ranger gets over the last of the carcasses, pulling himself up
      to the now-open compartment.

      First thing we see is a REFRIGERATION ROD, the one that was
      responsible for those freezer burns.

      Then we see Charlie, bound. He's trembling with cold, but he's
      alive. His leg presses up against the rod.

206   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING                                      206

      Mackelway, inching along, heart pounding. He hears a noise to
      his left. Whips around, gun poised.

      But it's nothing. He sighs. The wheat almost sounds like it's
      laughing at him.

      Then that TIRE IRON lashes out, from the right.

      It catches Mackelway with horrific force, shattering his wrist
      and sending that gun flying into the wheat.

      Before Mackelway can react, Zero is upon him...

207   EXT. THE TOPPLED RIG - RESUMING                                  207

      Fran's Ford skids to a stop outside the van.

      ...just as the Ranger brings Charlie out of the rig. The kid
      is shaking, traumatized. He begins to cry...

      Fran gets the idea. She hurries over.

208   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING                                      208

      Mackelway and Zero wrestle, surrounded and obscured by all of
      that wheat... Zero is a monster, and he's got that tire iron.
      Mackelway has a busted wrist. Hardly a fair fight.

      But Mackelway is battling: kicking, clawing, getting in as
      many shots as he can. His shirt rips away from his body,
      exposing that brand-mark. They roll back and forth. Until:

                                                        117.


                       O'RYAN (O.S.)
                 (calmly, firmly)
           Up.

Zero freezes. Mackelway too. They turn to find:

O'Ryan... who stands here, Mackelway's gun in hand.

                       O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Up.

Mackelway's relief is total. He pushes Zero away, rising. Zero
pulls himself off the ground, chagrinned.

                     ZERO
               (re: Mackelway)
           Glad you're here, Man. Guy was about to
           kill me.

O'Ryan, without ceremony, puts a bullet through Zero's left
palm. That got Mackelway's attention.

Zero howls with pain, his palm gushing. The TIRE-IRON falls to
the ground. Mackelway approaches O'Ryan.

                     MACKELWAY
           I'll take it from here.

He extends his good hand to O'Ryan: "The gun." O'Ryan pauses.
Then...

                     O'RYAN
           Are you going to shoot him?

                     MACKELWAY
           Give me the gun, O'Ryan.

                     ZERO
           Hey, I just surrendered.

                      O'RYAN
           Shut up.

                     ZERO
           I surrendered! That's it!

                       O'RYAN
           SHUT UP!!!

O'Ryan wheels around, aiming the gun right at Zero's face.
That shuts the guy up in a hurry.

                                                        118.


From that service road now, we hear a line of SIRENS,
approaching from a distance. Unit after unit.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
               (quietly now)
           Look at him, Mack. He's not human
           anymore. Go dig up that old lady's
           backyard - you'll find bodies there...
           Maybe hundreds of them. Of course, ya
           gotta get a warrant first, chain of
           custody's gotta be followed. One breach,
           and he walks.
               (no reply)
           My way, he's eliminated; the world is rid
           of him. It's a lot closer to justice than
           having some Prosecutor tell you you've
           left a tissue sample in the wrong lab.
           Isn't it?

                     MACKELWAY
               (that stung)
           Give me the fucking gun!

O'Ryan turns, studies him.

...and hands him the gun. Just like that.

Mackelway eyes it. O'Ryan doesn't say a word, just crosses
back to Zero, and grabs that TIRE-IRON off the ground.

O'Ryan's now standing right behind Zero, as:

                     O'RYAN
               (at Mackelway)
           You have to understand: none of this was
           arbitrary. We were chosen, you and I.
WHAP! O'Ryan just swung that tire-iron into Zero's rib cage.
We hear bones crack, and air rushing from the guy's lungs. He
drops to his knees, gasping.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           I saw us here. You did too.
THUMP! Another violent swing of that tire-iron, busting up the
other side of Zero's torso. Now both sides of his rib-cage
have shattered. Breathing is almost impossible.

Mackelway tightens. His head just began to throb...

                     MACKELWAY
           Okay. You made your point.

                                                        119.


                     O'RYAN
           Bullshit! If I'd made my fucking point
           you would've shot him yourself by now!

Another swing of that tire-iron, across the back of Zero's
neck. He crumbles, face down.

Fuck it. Mackelway crosses to O'Ryan and puts that gun right
up against the back of O'Ryan's head.

                      MACKELWAY
           Enough!

Then, an odd thing... O'Ryan simply smiles.

Something about having that gun pointed right at him - it's a
relief.

                      MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Drop it.

                      O'RYAN
           Or what?

                     MACKELWAY
           Just drop it.

                     O'RYAN
           Would you shoot me?

That's something Mackelway doesn't want to consider.

                     MACKELWAY
           Put it down.

                     O'RYAN
               (calmly)
           I want you to think for a second. About
           your destiny. Who you are. You're cursed,
           like I am - except you keep running from
           it.
               (Mackelway's silent)
           You hear things. You see things. That's
           why you can't sleep, why your head always
           aches.

He turns. They are face to face. Nothing but that gun between
them.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           ...and it's why you are going to let me
           kill this animal. And then you're going
           to kill me.

                                                         120.


That threw Mackelway badly. O'Ryan seizes the moment -
wheeling around...

He takes one last swing at Zero, like a lumberjack. The tire-
iron impacts Zero's skull with a dull THUD, cracking it. He is
dead.

Mackelway's eyes go wide. Whole thing has been a blur.

O'Ryan releases the tire-iron... and drops to his knees like a
man awaiting execution, his back to Mackelway.

Mackelway is silent. Stunned. The blood from Zero's caved-in
skull finds its way to O'Ryan's knees.

But O'Ryan remains peaceful. Calm. Ready.

                     MACKELWAY
           Get up.

                     O'RYAN
           I can't do that, Mack. I've seen all this
           already. For months now.

                     MACKELWAY
           Get up.

                     O'RYAN
           Every time, we're in this field: same
           wind, same rain. And you...

He puts a finger to his head, pretending it's a gun. Then he
pretends to pull the trigger. Mackelway gets the idea.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           It's okay. I want you to. I'm begging you
           to.

Mackelway doesn't know what to do. Then, making matters worse:

                     FRAN (O.S.)
               (aloud)
           Mack?

She's about a hundred yards away... but she'll be here soon
enough. That puts some heat under O'Ryan:

                     O'RYAN
           I'm tired, Mack.

                     FRAN (O.S.)
           Can you hear me?

                                                        121.


She's 90 yards out now...

                     O'RYAN
           Pull the trigger...
               (no reply)
           I'm not going to jail. Now pull the
           fucking trigger!

Mackelway's frozen. O'Ryan knows it.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Fucking coward.

O'Ryan rises now, facing Mackelway.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Some things are not up to us to decide.
           They just exist. They're inevitable. This
           field. This rain. This moment. It has all
           already happened. You know that. You've
           seen it too.

He shoves Mackelway in the chest.

                     FRAN (O.S.)
           Mack?

She's 70 yards out now...

                     O'RYAN
           Shut it off for me.

                     MACKELWAY
           I'm not going to kill you, O'Ryan.

                     O'RYAN
           Of course you will. I've seen it.

                     MACKELWAY
           You saw wrong!

                     O'RYAN
               (incredulous)
           That's impossible.

                     FRAN (O.S.)
           Mack? Can you hear me?

50 yards out now. Maybe close enough to hear O'Ryan's voice...

                     O'RYAN
               (rambling, unraveling)
           You don't understand. Those fucking faces
                     (MORE)

                                                        122.


                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           on that map. They call to me. I see their
           eyes in the dark - they're staring at me:
           "How did you let this happen to me?" But
           that's the thing about them - they're
           like pictures. They never blink. They
           just...stare, and always at me. That's my
           destiny, do you see? I didn't help them
           when they needed me and this is my
           penance. Fine. I ACCEPT IT. But I'm
           opting out now, ya get it? I can't stand
           this anymore! I wanna close my eyes for
           once and see something other than
           torture.
               (Mackelway's expressionless)
           It's not a bad start, Mack. We've made
           the world a little safer now. Speck,
           Fulcher, Starkey, now Zero. We've made
           justice. But I get some too. You have to
           end all this for me. That's why you're
           here. It's your destiny.

                     MACKELWAY
           Stop telling me about my fucking destiny!

                     O'RYAN
               (again)
           But I've seen it!

                    MACKELWAY
          Open your eyes, O'Ryan! Here I am,
          standing here. I'm not shooting you.
          Doesn't that fucking tell you something?
          You're a guy with a skill. Period. They
          taught you more than they should've. I'm
          sorry about that... But you're not God.
          You can't see everything.
                      O'RYAN
           Yes I can! And you can too! That's why I
           chose you!

                     FRAN (O.S.)
           Mack?

Mackelway's not budging. O'Ryan can see that.

                     O'RYAN
               (re: tire-iron)
           Fine. I'll make it easy for you:

O'Ryan picks up that tire-iron. Mackelway sees what's coming.
O'Ryan swings the tire-iron as Mackelway backs out of its
range.

                                                           123.


                     MACKELWAY
           Put the fucking thing down, O'Ryan.

O'Ryan keeps pursuing. Another swing. Mackelway keeps backing
up. The swing misses.

                     O'RYAN
           Look. It's perfect. Won't even need a
           hearing this way. You apprehended the
           suspect in the commission of a murder.
           Then he turned on you and you fired in
           self-defense.

O'Ryan isn't letting up. And Mackelway can't quite fire.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           These things are bigger than you -
           haven't you seen that yet? Destiny.
           Justice. Mercy. They're vast. We're just
           puppets!

                     MACKELWAY
           I'm not going to kill you!

                     O'RYAN
           You don't get to decide that!

                       MACKELWAY
           Yes I do!

O'Ryan takes one more swing, as:

                       FRAN (O.S.)
           FREEZE!!!

Silence. Mackelway turns. So does O'Ryan.

There's Fran, emerging from the tall wheat, gun trained right
on O'Ryan. His shock is total.

                       FRAN (CONT'D)
           Drop it.

O'Ryan doesn't move at first. Then, slowly, an ironic smile
snakes its way across his lips.

                     O'RYAN
               (at Mackelway, surprised)
           It's funny. I never saw anyone else out
           here. Did you?
Mackelway doesn't answer. He can't. O'Ryan eyes him.

                                                               124.


                          O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                Do it, Mack. Please.
                    (Mackelway's silent)
                Please. I'm begging you.

     There it was: the very thing Mackelway's been hearing all this
     time, the exact words. Unsettling as hell.

     ...and we begin to INTERCUT: images of this moment with images
     from those "VISIONS" that have been hinting at this very
     wheatfield since Page One...

208a INTERCUT WITH/EXT. WHEATFIELD "FANTASY" - SAME               208a

     Tall wheat, wet wind, O'Ryan's voice: "I'm begging you..."

     ...Mackelway snaps himself out of the vision.

                           MACKELWAY
                I can't.

     That was almost an attempt to make those images stop, to deny
     its awful, inevitable conclusion.

                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                I'm not you.

                           O'RYAN
                Yet.

     Two men, neither of them flinching... until O'Ryan nods - as
     if to say "Good-bye."

     ...more of that vision interrupts now: a gun, rising...

     O'Ryan rears back and swings that tire-iron right at
     Mackelway's head.

     Fran has no choice. She fires.

     O'Ryan is hit right between the shoulder blades. The tire-iron
     hits Mackelway in the shoulder. O'Ryan crumbles to the ground,
     landing face up.

     ...a body slumping to the ground. O'Ryan... Mackelway stands
     over him...

     Now, real-life again, Mackelway stands over O'Ryan, just as
     O'Ryan had always envisioned it. That makes him smile, even as
     he's dying.

                                                                  125.


                           O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                     (weak)
                 Thank you.

      Then he dies, eyes open. Mackelway looks to Fran...

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

209   EXT. SERVICE ROAD - DAWN                                           209

      Hours have passed. Dozens of LAW ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES have
      arrived. Sherrifs, Feds. Zero's rig remains on its side.

      Mackelway sits nearby on a CURB, his shattered wrist is in a
      SLING. Up above, the CLOUDS have parted. Morning sun streaks
      through. No more rain. Fran sits beside him.

      At their feet, in the gutter of this service road, lies a
      discarded MILK CARTON, covered with dust. The face under the
      "Have You Seen Me?" is unknown to us.

      Kathleen is nearby, holding Charlie tight. Cops surround them.

      An UNMARKED SEDAN arrives. Charlton hurries out of it, making
      a bee-line for Mackelway.

                            CHARLTON
                 Nice work.
                     (Mackelway half-nods)
                 Where is he?

                           MACKELWAY
                 Sir?

                           CHARLTON
                 O'Ryan. Where is he?
      Mackelway rises, studies Charlton. There's nothing to say.

      So he extends a hand to Fran. She takes it, rising to her
      feet. They leave Charlton behind...

      We PULL AWAY from them, craning up, taking in this expanse of
      tall wheat, TILTING UP to that morning sun.

                                             MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

      ...an AFTERNOON SUN now - blazing white hot. TILT DOWN...

                                                                126.


210   EXT. DELIA'S RANCH-HOUSE - DAY                                   210

      We're some distance away. HEAT RISES off parched Earth,
      lending a vaporous screen to everything. But we can make out
      the shapes of men in HAZ-MAT SUITS.

      Delia's backyard is being torn up by a BACK-HOE. Looks like a
      war-zone: BODIES, wrapped in cloth, being exhumed from the
      ground. Dozens of them...

      But there's plenty of soil yet to be turned... Might be
      HUNDREDS unearthed by the time these guys are through. We...

                                                  FADE OUT...

                                               18th DECEMBER, 2006
                                                                   PAGE 1.



1   INT. DARK CHAMBER -- NIGHT                                     1

    Foreboding organ music is heard...

    We are looking down at a rough brick floor ... is it an
    alley? ... a cobblestone street? ... a warehouse? a factory?
    ... we're not sure...

    The flickering glow of flame is the only illumination...

    The ominous organ music continues as...

    From the bottom of the frame...

    A dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up
    the frame, defying gravity ... the flickering flame reflected
    in the blood...

    Finally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame.

    SUDDENLY--

    A shrill factory whistle blows--

    ENORMOUSLY LOUD -- blood-chilling and spine-shattering --
    the whistle is a bizarre combination of sound: a factory
    whistle; a hog being slaughtered; a dog snarling; a roaring
    inferno; a human scream--

    And a man's face appears, upside down, reflected in the pool
    of blood.

    He is THE GENTLEMAN, a slender dandy in pearl grey gloves and
    matching waistcoat. A cold and superior aristocrat.

    The camera slowly revolves -- the Gentleman becoming right
    side up as--

                           GENTLEMAN
                 Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd.
                 His skin was pale and his eye was odd.
                 He shaved the faces of gentlemen
                 Who never thereafter were heard of again.
                 He trod a path that few have trod,
                 Did Sweeney Todd,
                 The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

    We cut from the blood to see the Gentleman standing before
    us. Strangely impassive.

    We are in an eerie dark chamber, unclear, a low ceiling, a
    world of silhouettes and shadows.


                                                         (CONTINUED)
                                                                   PAGE 2.
1   CONTINUED:                                                     1

    Another figure emerges from the miasma of shadows, into the
    hellish flickering of flame: THE BANKER. He is large, rotund
    and sleek. Impressive muttonchops.

                           BANKER
                 He kept a shop in London town,
                 Of fancy clients and good renown,
                 And what if none of their souls were saved?
                 They went to their maker impeccably shaved...

    More FIGURES begin to emerge from the shadows, joining the
    Gentleman and the Banker as...

                           BANKER
                 By Sweeney,
                 By Sweeney Todd,
                 The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

    Although prosaic in appearance these figures are, in fact,
    GHOSTS.

                           GHOSTS
                 Swing your razor wide, Sweeney!
                 Hold it to the skies!
                 Freely flows the blood of those
                 Who moralize!

    As they continue, the new figures become more distinct...

    THE GENERAL, a tough, leather-skinned military man in a
    crimson imperial uniform...

                           GENERAL
                 His needs were few, his room was bare:

    THE PRIEST, a lean, severe man with pale skin in clerical
    attire...

                           PRIEST
                 A lavabo and a fancy chair...

    THE TOURIST, a small, meek man with glasses in an ill-fitting
    suit...

                           TOURIST
                 A mug of suds and a leather strop,
                 An apron, a towel, a pail and a mop...

    THE STUDENT, a dashing young man from Oxford with luxurious
    long hair...




                                                          (CONTINUED)
                                                                 PAGE 3.
1   CONTINUED: (2)                                               1

                        STUDENT
              For neatness he deserves a nod,
              Does Sweeney Todd...

                        GENTLEMAN
              The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

    The ghosts are a bit more insinuating now as they move around
    this mysterious world...

                        GHOSTS
                  (variously)
              Inconspicuous Sweeney was,
              Quick and quiet and clean `e was.
              Back of his smile, under his word,
              Sweeney heard music that nobody heard.
              Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned,
              Like a perfect machine 'e planned,
              Sweeney was smooth, Sweeney was subtle,
              Sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle...

    The specters are becoming more insistent, their strange
    impassivity giving way to accusation as the flickering red
    flame becomes an inferno--

                        GHOSTS
                  (variously)
              Sweeney was smooth, Sweeney was subtle,
              Sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle.
              Inconspicuous Sweeney was,
              Quick and quiet and clean 'e was,
              Like a perfect machine 'e was,
              Was Sweeney!
              Sweeney!
              Sweeney!
              Sweeeeeneeeeey!
    On this explosive note we revolve -- away from the ghostly
    Furies--

    To discover--

    SWEENEY TODD. Standing before us. An unclear figure,
    silhouetted in blazing red flames.

    We slowly push in on him as:

                        GHOSTS
              Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd.
              He served a dark and a vengeful god.
              What happened then--



                                                      (CONTINUED)
                                                                   PAGE 4.
1   CONTINUED: (3)                                                1

                        GENTLEMAN
              Well, who's to say?

                        BANKER
              And he wouldn't want us to give it away,

                        GHOSTS
                  (variously)
              Not Sweeney,
              Not Sweeney Todd,
              The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

    On this note, we push in tight on the figure of Todd...

    Music and the clanging of a clock tower bell are heard as we
    slowly begin pulling back and are imperceptibly transported
    to...

2   EXT. SHIP -- THAMES -- ALMOST DAWN                             2

    ANTHONY, a young sailor of about 20, is standing at the rail
    of a ship. We see the obscure shape of rigging and sails
    behind him. The cries of sailors echo.

    Behind him stand the GENTLEMAN and the BANKER. They are
    looking past Anthony, looking at something. They move away as
    Anthony peers through the fog, straining to see...

    London.

    Gradually, as the ship approaches, the towering spires and
    mountainous rooftops of the city begin to stand out in
    relief, to emerge through the fog like a tiger creeping
    toward its prey.

    Music continues as Anthony takes in the dreadful and
    magnificent spectacle of the 19th Century metropolis. The
    gnarl of rooftops. The labyrinth of streets and alleys. The
    black trails of smoke reaching up like skeletal fingers from
    a thousand chimneys.

    London. Sulfurous London.

    Anthony is awestruck.

                        ANTHONY
              I have sailed the world, beheld its wonders
              From the Dardanelles
              To the mountains of Peru,
              But there's no place like London--!

    Then--


                                                         (CONTINUED)
                                                                  PAGE 5.

    Sweeney Todd steps to Anthony's side, grimly interrupting--

                           TODD
                 No, there's no place like London.

                           ANTHONY
                 Mr. Todd...?

                           TODD
                 You are young.
                 Life has been kind to you.
                 You will learn.

    Todd's glares forward, his haunted gaze never leaving the
    approaching city.

3   EXT. DOCKS -- DAWN                                             3

    Music continues as Todd stands very still and takes in the
    shadowy figures on the docks.

    Anthony seems almost lost at his side, overwhelmed by the
    scale and aura of the city.

                           ANTHONY
                 Lord ... takes your breath away,
                 doesn't it?

    Todd shudders violently, almost snarling.

                            TODD
                 There's a hole in the world
                 Like a great black pit
                 And the vermin of the world
                 Inhabit it
                 And its morals aren't worth
                 What a pig could spit
                 And it goes by the name Of London.
                 At the top of the hole
                 Sit the privileged few
                 Making mock of the vermin
                 In the lower zoo,
                 Turning beauty into filth and greed.
                 I too
                 Have sailed the world, and seen its wonders
                 For the cruelty of men
                 Is as wondrous as Peru,
                 But there's no place like London!

    Anthony looks at his friend, mystified by his grim reaction
    to the city.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                           TODD
                 I beg your indulgence, Anthony ... My
                 mind is far from easy. In these once
                 familiar streets I feel shadows
                 everywhere...

                           ANTHONY
                 Shadows...?

                           TODD
                 Ghosts.

    Anthony looking at him, questioning. Todd continues quietly:

                           TODD
                 There was a barber and his wife,
                 And she was beautiful,
                 A foolish barber and his wife,
                 She was his reason and his life,
                 And she was beautiful,
                 And she was virtuous.
                 And he was...
                     (a breath)
                 Naive.

    Anthony watches, rapt, as Todd remembers...

4   EXT. FLOWER MARKET -- FLASHBACK -- DAY                         4

    ...Fifteen years before.

    Todd walks with his beautiful wife LUCY through a crowded
    flower market, a colorful explosion of blossoms. Lucy carries
    their one-year-old baby, JOHANNA.

    Todd is almost unrecognizable to us, content and smiling.
    Chatting with his wife. Happy.

                           TODD (V.O.)
                 There was another man who saw
                 That she was beautiful,
                 A pious vulture of the law,
                 Who with a gesture of his claw
                 Removed the barber from his plate.
                 Then there was nothing but to wait
                 And she would fall,
                 So soft,
                 So young,
                 So lost,
                 And oh, so beautiful!

                                                                   PAGE 7.

    During the above, JUDGE TURPIN, an elderly man with a
    saturnine demeanor, eyes Lucy through the luxurious bunches
    of flowers. He stalks her, desiring her.

    With the Judge is his nefarious creature, BEADLE BAMFORD. The
    Beadle is a large man, his florid nature and pink, powdered
    face never quite disguising his lethality.

    The Judge whispers to the Beadle, indicating Todd. Then the
    Beadle and several policemen sweep in and drag Todd off. The
    Judge moves in on Lucy like a predator.

    And we return to...

5   EXT. DOCKS -- DAWN                                             5

    Music continues.

                           ANTHONY
                 And the lady, sir ... did she succumb?

                           TODD
                 Oh, that was many years ago...
                 I doubt if anyone would know.

    A quiet beat.

                           TODD
                 I owe you my life, Anthony. If you
                 hadn't spotted me, I would be lost on
                 the ocean still ... Thank you.

    Todd picks up his duffel bag, preparing to go.

                           ANTHONY
                 Will I see you again?
                           TODD
                 You might find me, if you like, around
                 Fleet Street.

                           ANTHONY
                 Until then, my friend.

    He offers his hand. Todd takes it and shakes.

    Then Todd quickly turns and goes.

    Anthony stands for a moment, saddened by the mysterious pall
    that hangs over his friend.
                                                                   PAGE 8.



6   EXT. STREET -- MORNING                                         6

    Todd strides along, deep in thought. The emotions roiling
    within him finally seethe out in a dark mutter:

                        TODD
              There's a hole in the world
              Like a great black pit
              And it's filled with people
              Who are filled with shit
              And the vermin of the world
              Inhabit it...

    He disappears down the street as the music THUNDERS--

7   EXT. LONDON ASSAULT -- DAY                                     7

    --We ZOOM ahead of Todd -- cutting through the city at
    lightning pace down twisting alleys and up crowded boulevards
    -- into tunnels and over bridges -- slashing through London
    at breakneck speed -- the insane explosion of music sending
    us hurtling to--

8   EXT. THE PIE SHOP -- DAY                                       8

    Fleet Street.

    We see the exterior of Mrs. Lovett's pie shop. It is tatty
    and unloved by all. Yet it has a strange, ghostly presence to
    it. Imposing and dead at the same time.

    There is an exterior staircase leading up to a darkened
    second floor room with a window overlooking the street.

    The music slows and continues as we see Todd, standing in
    front of the shop, considering it deeply.
    The GENERAL we saw before passes, glancing at Todd. Here and
    then gone.

    Todd finally strides to the shop and enters...

9   INT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                           9

    Behind the dusty counter is...

    MRS. LOVETT, a venal, vigorous and slatternly woman in her
    40's.

    She is currently busy chopping a loathsome mess of suet with
    a wicked looking knife, her greasy hair hanging down over her
    face.

9   CONTINUED:                                                    9

    The moment Todd enters -- and the bell at the door sounds --
    her head snaps up and her eyes are on him like a bird of
    prey:

                           MRS. LOVETT
                 A customer!

    Todd is startled, starts to go--

                             MRS. LOVETT
                 Wait! What's yer rush?
                 What's yer hurry?
                      (She sticks the knife into
                       the counter)
                 You gave me such a--
                      (Wipes her hands on her
                       apron) )
                 Fright. I thought you was a ghost.
                 Half a minute, can'tcher?
                 Sit!
                 Sit ye down!
                      (An order)
                 Sit!
                      (He obeys)
                 All I meant is that I
                 Haven't seen a customer for weeks.
                 Did you come here for a pie, sir?
                      (Todd nods. She flicks a
                       bit of dust off a pie
                       with a rag)
                 Do forgive me if me head's a little vague--
                 Ugh!
                      (She plucks something off
                       the pie, examines it)
                 What is that?
                 But you'd think we had the plague--
                      (She drops it on the floor
                       and stamps on it)
                 From the way that people--
                      (She flicks something off
                       the pie with her finger)
                 Keep avoiding--
                      (Spotting it moving)
                 No, you don't!
                      (She smacks it with her
                       hand)
                 Heaven knows I try, sir!
                      (Lifts her hand, looks at
                       it)
                 Tsk!
                      (She wipes it on the edge
                       of the counter)
                 But there's no one comes in even to inhale--

              Tsk!
                  (She blows the last dust
                   off the pie as she brings
                   it to him)
              Right you are, sir. Would you like a drop of ale?
                  (Todd nods)
              Mind you, I can't hardly blame them--
                  (Pouring a tankard of ale)
              These are probably the worst pies in London.
              I know why nobody cares to take them--
              I should know,
              I make them.
              But good? No,
              The worst pies in London--
              Even that's polite.
              The worst pies in London--
              If you doubt it, take a bite.
                  (He does. It's horrible)
              Is that just disgusting?
              You have to concede it.
              It's nothing but crusting--
              Here, drink this, you'll need it--
                  (She gives him the ale)
              The worst pies in London.

    During the following, she slams lumps of dough on the counter
    and rolls them out, grunting frequently as she goes:

                        MRS. LOVETT
              And no wonder with the price of meat
              What it is--
                  (Grunt)
              When you get it.
                  (Grunt)
              Never
                  (Grunt)
              Thought I'd live to see the day
              Men'd think it was a treat
              Finding poor

              Animals

              Wot are dying in the street.
              Mrs. Mooney has a pie shop,
              Does a business, but I noticed something weird--
              Lately all her neighbors' cats have disappeared.
                  (Shrugs)
              Have to hand it to her--
              Wot I calls
              Enterprise,
              Popping pussies into pies.
              Wouldn't do in my shop--
              Just the thought of it's enough to make you sick.

               And I'm telling you them pussy cats is quick.
                   (Leans on counter,
                    exhausted)
               No denying times is hard, sir -- Even harder than
               The worst pies in London.
               Only lard and nothing more--
                   (As Todd gamely tries
                    another mouthful)
               Is that just revolting?
               All greasy and gritty,
               It looks like it's molting,
               And tastes like--
               Well, pity
               A woman alone
               With limited wind
               And the worst pies in London!
                   (Sighs heavily)
               Ah sir,
               Times is hard. Times is hard.

     She finishes one of the crusts with a flourish as the music
     ends.

     Todd, meanwhile, is gulping at his ale, trying to wash down
     Mrs. Lovett's hideous creation.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Trust me, dearie, it's going to take
               more than ale to wash that taste out.
               Come with me and we'll get you a nice
               tumbler of gin.

     She leads him through the curtains at the back of the pie
     shop and into...

     ... Her parlor is a wonder of seedy faux-middle class
     Victoriana. Little knickknacks, dusty plants and dingy
     doilies. There is a threadbare mauve sofa in front of a
     comfortable fire.

     A faded picture postcard of the seaside hangs on a wall.

     She goes to a sideboard and pours him a huge glass of gin as:

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Isn't this homey now? Me cheery
               wallpaper was a real bargain too, it
               being only partly singed when the

     She hands him the gin. He gulps it down, washing the taste of
     her pie out of his mouth.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  There's a good boy, now you sit down
                  and warm your bones, you look chilled
                  through.

     He sits before the fire:

                            TODD
                  Isn't that a room over the shop? If
                  times are so hard, why don't you rent
                  it out?

     She glances up at the roof, considering the room over them.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Up there? Oh, no one will go near
                  it...

     She turns to him, something a little intense and probing
     about her gaze.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  People think it's haunted.

                             TODD
                  Haunted?

     She holds his gaze.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  And who's to say they're wrong? ...
                  You see, years ago, something happened
                  up there. Something not very nice...
     The flickering flame from the fire begins to cast a more
     intense red glow on her face...

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  There was a barber and his wife,
                  And he was beautiful,
                  A proper artist with a knife,
                  But they transported him for life.
                      (Sighs)
                  And he was beautiful...

     The music continues as she looks at him, again with that
     rather intense gaze:

               Barker, his name was -- Benjamin
               Barker.

                         TODD
               Transported? What was his crime?

                         MRS. LOVETT
                   (with an edge)
               Foolishness.

     She turns again to the fire, the red glow bathing her face as
     she remembers...

11   INT. BARBER SHOP -- FLASHBACK -- DAY                          11

     Lucy is pacing, holding Baby Johanna to her closely. Lucy is
     distraught, strained, tears in her eyes.

     As Lucy paces we notice the room is full of dead and dying
     flowers: dozens of dried bouquets tossed aside and ignored.

                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
               He had this wife, you see,
               Pretty little thing,
               Silly little nit
               Had her chance for the moon on a string--
               Poor thing. Poor thing.

     Lucy moves to the window, looks out. She sees Judge Turpin
     and the Beadle waiting below. The Judge holds yet another
     bouquet.

                          MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
               There was this Judge, you see,
               Wanted her like mad,
               Every day he'd send her a flower,
               But did she come down from her tower?
               Sat up there and sobbed by the hour,
               Poor fool.

     Lucy moves away from the window, sobbing.

                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
               Ah, but there was worse yet to come,
               Poor thing.
                                                                   PAGE 14.



12   EXT. EXCLUSIVE STREET -- FLASHBACK -- EVENING                 12

     The Beadle is leading a nervous Lucy along an exclusive
     street of dark stone mansions, grand but somehow menacing.
     Lucy is wearing her best dress.

                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
               The Beadle calls on her, all polite,
               Poor thing, poor thing.
               The Judge, he tells her, is all contrite,
               He blames himself for her dreadful plight
               She must come straight to his house tonight!
               Poor thing, poor thing.

13   INT. TURPIN'S MANSION -- BALLROOM -- FLASHBACK -- NIGHT       13

     The Beadle ushers Lucy into a ballroom. She is shocked to see
     a fancy-dress ball in progress.

     Masked couples swirl around the ballroom, their number
     sinisterly multiplied by the distorting mirrors that frame
     the room. The hanging chandeliers, draped in red cloth, cast
     a disquieting incarnadine glow on the proceedings...

                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
               Of course, when she goes there,
               Poor thing, poor thing,
               They're having this ball all in masks.

     Lucy wanders lost through the swirling dancers, they buffet
     her, confusing her...

                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
               There's no one she knows there,
               Poor dear, poor thing,
               She wanders tormented, and drinks,
               Poor thing.
               The Judge has repented, she thinks,
               Poor thing.
               "Oh, where is Judge Turpin?" she asks.

     The Beadle finds Lucy again and graciously gives her his arm,
     leading her through the party. She is thankful for the
     salvation he provides. He brings her to Judge Turpin.

     The Judge descends on Lucy, raping her. The other guests
     crowd around ravenously, enjoying the spectacle. A feverish
     nightmare.

                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
               He was there, all right--
               Only not so contrite!
               She wasn't no match for such craft, you see,

                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                                    PAGE 15.

                  And everyone thought it so droll.
                  They figured she had to be daft, you see,
                  So all of `em stood there and laughed, you see,
                  Poor soul!
                  Poor thing!

                            TODD (V.O.)
                  NOOOOOOOO...!

     Todd's wild howl shatters the memory and tears us back to--

14   INT. PARLOR -- DAY                                             14

     --Todd is bolting up from the sofa, tormented--

                            TODD
                  ..... NOOOOOO!

     He stands for a terrible beat.

                            TODD
                  Would no one have mercy on her?

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  So it is you -- Benjamin Barker.

                            TODD
                  Where's Lucy?! Where's my wife?!

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  She poisoned herself. Arsenic from the
                  apothecary on the corner. I tried to
                  stop her but she wouldn't listen to
                  me. And he's got your daughter.

                            TODD
                  He? Judge Turpin?

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Adopted her like his own.

     Todd absorbs this sickening news.

                            TODD
                  Fifteen years of sweating in a living
                  hell on a false charge. Fifteen years
                  dreaming that I might come home to
                  find a loving wife and child...

     A beat as he stares into the fire, madness and purpose
     creeping in.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Well, I can't say the years have been
                  particularly kind to you, Mr. Barker,
                  but you still--

                            TODD
                  No, not Barker. That man is dead. It's
                  Todd now. Sweeney Todd ... And he will
                  have his revenge.

     He continues with a chilling and quiet resolve as he stares
     with unblinking eyes into the fire:

                            TODD
                  Judge Turpin and the Beadle will pay
                  for what they did.

     A beat. He finally turns to her.

                            TODD
                  First I must have my shop back.

15   EXT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                           15

     They emerge from the pie shop. She begins to scale the
     exterior staircase to the darkened second floor room. He
     hesitates.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Come along...

     She continues up, he slowly follows.

16   INT. BARBER SHOP -- DAY                                        16

     A macabre shroud of dust and spider's webs. Furniture covered
     in sheets. A broken mirror on one wall.

     We hear footsteps approaching and then Mrs. Lovett enters.
     The door creaks like a living thing.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Not to worry, a touch of oil will put
                  that right.
                      (she turns back to Todd)
                  ... Nothing to be afraid of, love,
                  come in.

     She moves into the room. But Todd hesitates at the door,
     looking into the room.

     For him this is a truly haunted place.

     Meanwhile, she kneels and pries loose a floorboard.

     Underneath there is a hidden area. Within that, something
     covered with a velvet cloth. She removes it and carefully
     unwraps it. Her touch is particularly gentle and respectful.

     We discover it is a fine leather case. She looks at it for a
     beat. Then turns to him, dusting it off.

                            TODD
                  I don't believe it...

     He finally steps into the room, drawn toward the case.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  When they came for the girl, I hid
                  'em. I thought, who knows? Maybe the
                  silly blighter'll be back again.
                  Cracked in the head, wasn't I?

     Haunting music begins as she opens the case...

     And we see it contains a beautiful set of razors.

     He stands for a long moment, gazing down at his beloved
     razors.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Those handles is chased silver, ain't
                  they?

                            TODD
                  Silver, yes...

                  These are my friends,
                  See how they glisten.
                      (He picks up a small
                       razor)
                  See this one shine,
                  How he smiles in the light.
                  My friend, my faithful friend.
                      (Holding it to his ear,
                       feeling the edge with his
                       thumb) )
                  Speak to me friend,
                  Whisper, I'll listen.
                      (Listening)
                  I know, I know--
                  You've been locked out of sight
                  All these years--
                  Like me, my friend.
                  Well, I've come home
                  To find you waiting.

               And we're together,
               And we'll do wonders,
               Won't we?

     Mrs. Lovett leans over him, in her own kind of trance as
     well. They now sing simultaneously:

                         TODD
                   (Picking out a larger
                    razor)

               Come, let me hold you.

               Now, with a sigh
               You grow warm
               In my hand,
               My friend,
               My clever friend.
                   (Putting it back)
               Rest now, my friends.
               Soon I'll unfold you.
               Soon you'll know splendors

               You're warm
               In my hand.
               You've come home.
               Always had a fondness for you,
               I did.

               --My lucky friends.

               Never you fear, Mr. Todd,
               You can move in here, Mr. Todd.
               Splendors you never have dreamed

     The music continues quietly as Todd stares at one of his
     razors.

                         TODD
               Leave me now...

     She goes. Todd finally picks up his biggest razor and slowly
     opens it, looks at it.

                         TODD
               At last my arm is complete again.

     And he remains standing. Exalted.

     Then--

     In the shattered mirror on the wall he suddenly sees--

     The distorted reflections of the Gentleman, the Banker, and
     the General, looking at him--

                         GHOSTS
               Lift your razor high, Sweeney!
               Hear it singing, "Yes!"
               Sink it in the rosy skin
               Of righteousness!

     Todd turns to them...

                         GHOSTS
                   (variously)
               His voice was soft, his manner mild.
               He seldom laughed but he often smiled,
               He'd seen how civilized men behave.
               He never forgot and he never forgave,
               Not Sweeney,
               Not Sweeney Todd,
               The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

     Todd pulls a sheet off Baby Johanna's cradle. A cloud of dust
     rises.

     The ghosts disappear in the cloud of dust and Todd stands
     alone, staring at the cradle, holding his razor.
                                                                   PAGE 20.



17   EXT. EXCLUSIVE STREET -- DAY                                  17

     Anthony, now out of his sailor's uniform, is walking along
     the sidewalk near the Judge's mansion, absorbed in a copy of
     Baedeker's London.

     He stops, lost, trying to get his bearings, studying his map.

     Then an unusual sound emerges through the normal cosmopolitan
     bustle. It is the sound of a woman humming. He looks up to
     see...

     JOHANNA, a 16-year-old girl with golden hair, beautiful and
     hauntingly sad. She sits at her window above, behind bars,
     humming to herself as she does needlepoint.

     Anthony watches her, absolutely mesmerized.

     Johanna notices a Bird Seller passing. He carries a long,
     wooden pole with little bird cages attached.

                         JOHANNA
               Green finch and linnet bird,
               Nightingale, blackbird,
               How is it you sing?
               How can you jubilate,
               Sitting in cages,
               Never taking wing?
               Outside the sky waits,
               Beckoning, beckoning,
               Just beyond the bars.
               How can you remain,
               Staring at the rain,
               Maddened by the stars?
               How is it you sing
               Anything?
               How is it you sing?

     Then ... she sees Anthony on the sidewalk below.

     Music continues. There is a long look between them. Her
     intense, melancholy expression moves him.

     She continues singing, the strange anguish and yearning of
     her words seem intended only for him...

                         JOHANNA
               My cage has many rooms,
               Damask and dark.
               Nothing there sings,
               Not even my lark.
               Larks never will, you know,
               When they're captive.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                                     PAGE 21.
17   CONTINUED:                                                     17

                  Teach me to be more adaptive.

                  Green finch and linnet bird,
                  Nightingale, blackbird,
                  Teach me how to sing.
                  If I cannot fly,
                  Let me sing.

     Then she turns away quickly, alarmed, when someone enters her
     room. She looks terrified.

     Below, Anthony is concerned for her. He sees her move from
     the window.

     He is craning to see better when a BEGGAR WOMAN -- a filthy
     tendril of a woman, her foul clothes of rags like a second
     skin -- suddenly thrusts her arm up from the curb, imploring:

                            BEGGAR WOMAN
                  Alms! ... Alms! ...
                  For a miserable woman
                  On a miserable chilly morning...
                      (Anthony drops a coin into
                       her hand)
                  Thank yer, sir, thank yer.

                            ANTHONY
                  Ma'am, could tell me whose house this
                  is?

                            BEGGAR WOMAN
                  That's the great Judge Turpin's house
                  that is.

                            ANTHONY
                  And the young lady who resides there?
                            BEGGAR WOMAN
                  That's Johanna, his pretty little
                  ward. Keeps her snug, he does, all
                  locked up ... So don't you go
                  trespassing there or it's a good
                  whipping for you -- or any other young
                  man with mischief on his mind...

     She suddenly leers into a lewd and demented assault:

                            BEGGAR WOMAN
                  'Ow would you like a little muff, dear,
                  A little jig jig
                  A little bounce around the bush?
                  Wouldn't you like to push me parsley?


                                                            (CONTINUED)
                                                                   PAGE 22.
17   CONTINUED: (2)                                               17

               It looks to me, dear,
               Like you got plenty there to push.

     She grabs at Anthony's crotch -- Anthony starts back -- she
     turns away, instantly plaintive again, and appeals to other
     pedestrians as she goes:

                         BEGGAR WOMAN
               Alms! ... Alms!...
               For a desperate woman...

     Anthony considers the mansion. He sees a figure standing at a
     window, unclear behind the shutters, watching him.

     He sits on a bench outside the mansion and sings quietly:

                         ANTHONY
               I feel you,
               Johanna,
               I feel you.
               I was half convinced I'd waken,
               Satisfied enough to dream you.
               Happily I was mistaken, Johanna!
               I'll steal you,
               Johanna,
               I'll steal you...

     Then the figure disappears from the window above. Anthony
     stands, waits. Then the doors to the mansion swing open...

     Anthony is expecting Johanna...

     But it is Judge Turpin, the predator we met in Todd's
     flashback, who steps into the doorway.

     He seems a different man now. Paternal and warm, he smiles
     and beckons to Anthony.

     Anthony hesitates, unsure. The Judge beckons again. Again the
     warm smile.

                         JUDGE
               Come in, lad. Come in...

     Anthony goes into the mansion.

18   INT. TURPIN'S MANSION -- LIBRARY -- DAY                       18

     Judge Turpin leads Anthony into the dark library, filled with
     books. Anthony is looking around for Johanna. He is wary,
     this is all very strange.



                                                       (CONTINUED)
                                                                    PAGE 23.
18   CONTINUED:                                                    18

                            JUDGE
                  ... you were looking for Hyde Park,
                  you say?

                            ANTHONY
                  Yes, it's terribly large on the map
                  but I keep getting lost...

                            JUDGE
                  Sit down, lad, sit down.

     Anthony sits, uncomfortable, as the Judge pours two snifters
     of brandy.

                            ANTHONY
                  It's embarrassing for a sailor to lose
                  his bearings, but, well, there you
                  are.

     Then...

     The large form of the Beadle appears from the shadows. No
     introduction is made. Anthony glances to him, uneasy.

                            JUDGE
                  A sailor, eh?

                            ANTHONY
                  Yes, sir. The "Bountiful" out of
                  Plymouth.

                            JUDGE
                      (handing him a snifter of
                       brandy)
                  A sailor must know the ways of the
                  world, yes? ... Must be practiced in
                  the ways of the world ... Would you
                  say you are practiced, boy?

                            ANTHONY
                  Sir?

     The Judge moves to consider some beautiful volumes, bound in
     the richest leather. He runs a finger along the spines of the
     books; his large library of pornography.

                            JUDGE
                  Oh, yes ... such practices ... the
                  geishas of Japan ... the concubines of
                  Siam .. the catamites of Greece ...
                  the harlots of India ... I have them
                  all here ... Drawings of them ....

                         JUDGE (cont'd)
                   (he turns again to
                    Anthony)
               ... All the vile things you've done
               with your whores.

     Anthony is speechless. The Judge just smiles at him amiably.

                         JUDGE
               Would you like to see?

                         ANTHONY
                   (standing)
               I think there's been some mistake--

                         JUDGE
               Oh, I think not. You gandered at my
               ward, Johanna ... You gandered at her
               ... Yes, sir, you gandered.

     The Beadle moves behind Anthony.

                         ANTHONY
                   (glancing nervously back
                    at the Beadle)
               I meant no harm--

                         JUDGE
               Your meaning is immaterial. Mark me:
               if I see your face again on this
               street, you'll rue the day your bitch
               of a mother gave you birth.

     Anthony is stunned. The Judge proceeds with shocking venom:

                         JUDGE
               My Johanna isn't one of your bloody
               cock-chafers! My Johanna is not to be
               gandered at!

     He nods to the Beadle -- the Beadle instantly grabs Anthony
     and brutally hauls him out.

19   EXT. MANSION -- ALLEY -- DAY                                  19

     The Beadle drags Anthony through a rear door of the mansion
     and flings him into a filthy alley.

     Anthony pulls himself up. Stunned.

                         BEADLE
               Hyde Park is that way, young sir ... A
               right and then a left, then straight
               on, you see? ...

                      (points)
                  ... Over there.

     Flustered, Anthony turns to look--

     The instant Anthony's back is turned, the Beadle swings his
     lethal billyclub and SLAMS him from behind brutally, in the
     kidneys -- Anthony's knees buckle--

     The Beadle then SLAMS Anthony across the back of the neck --
     Anthony falls hard--

     The Beadle then uses one dainty foot to roll Anthony over--
     Anthony gazes up at him, panting for breath, in agony--

                            BEADLE
                  You heard Judge Turpin, little man.

     He presses the end of his billyclub into Anthony's forehead,
     grinding it hard--

                            BEADLE
                  Next time it'll be your pretty brains
                  all over the pavement.

     With that, the Beadle returns to the mansion and slams the
     door.

     Anthony slowly pulls himself to his knees, doubled over,
     coughing up blood.

     A long beat as Anthony gets his breath, wiping blood from his
     face.

     Still doubled over, he sings with burning intensity:
                            ANTHONY
                  I'll steal you,
                  Johanna,
                  I'll steal you!
                  Do they think that walls can hide you?
                  Even now I'm at your window.
                  I am in the dark beside you,
                  Buried sweetly in your yellow hair.

     He pulls himself up, every movement is agony. He makes his
     way down the alley, leaning on the wall for support.

20   EXT. EXCLUSIVE STREET -- DAY                                   20

     The music swells as Anthony emerges from the dark alley into
     the bright sunlight. He makes his way along the sidewalk:

                  I feel you, Johanna,
                  And one day I'll steal you.
                  Till I'm with you then,
                  I'm with you there,
                  Sweetly buried in your yellow hair...

     The soaring music continues as Anthony stops at a park across
     the street from Turpin's mansion, bravely gazing up at
     Johanna's window.

21   EXT. STREET LEADING TO ST. DUNSTAN'S MARKETPLACE -- DAY        21

     Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett are moving quickly, she
     struggles to keep up with his long, loping stride. He carries
     his razor case, she carries a shopping basket.

                            TODD
                  He's here every Thursday?

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Like clockwork. Eyetalian. All the
                  rage he is.

                            TODD
                  Not for long.

22   EXT. ST. DUNSTAN'S MARKETPLACE            DAY                  22

     They round a corner and move into the bustling marketplace. A
     steady mercantile hum as the cries of merchants and wandering
     coster-mongers fill the air.

     Todd and Mrs. Lovett move toward a hand-drawn caravan
     dominating one corner of the marketplace. It is painted like
     a Sicilian donkey cart and on its side a sign declaims:
     "Signor Adolfo Pirelli -- Haircutter to His Royal Majesty the
     King of Naples."

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Oh Mr. T., do you really think you can
                  do it?

                            TODD
                  By tomorrow they'll all be flocking to
                  me like sheep to be shorn--

     He stops abruptly when he sees--

     The Beadle casually strolling through the crowd. Todd is
     transfixed, his ancient enemy so close.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                      (seeing the Beadle,
                       pulling his arm)
                  Come along now, dear, he might
                  recognize you--

                            TODD
                  I will do what I have vowed to do ...
                      (he continues to glare at
                       the Beadle, his voice
                       low)
                  ... Come closer, my friend, closer...

     Then, TOBY -- a 13-year-old boy, a bit small for his age,
     malnourished and consumptively pale -- emerges from Pirelli's
     caravan. He bangs on a tin drum, drawing customers.

     A crowd begins to gather at the caravan as:

                            TOBY
                  Ladies and gentlemen!
                  May I have your attention, perlease?
                  Do you wake every morning in shame and despair
                  To discover your pillow is covered with hair
                  Wot ought not to be there?
                  Well, ladies and gentlemen,
                  From now on you can waken at ease.
                  You need never again have a worry or care,
                  I will show you a miracle marvelous rare,
                  Gentlemen, you are about to see something wot rose
                  from the dead!
                      (A woman gasps, he smiles
                       and wiggles a finger no)
                  On the top of my head.

     He dramatically doffs his cap, revealing mountains of hair
     which cascade to his shoulder.

                            TOBY
                  'Twas Pirelli's
                  Miracle Elixir,
                  That's wot did the trick, sir,
                  True, sir, true.
                  Was it quick, sir?
                  Did it in a tick, sir?
                  Just like an elixir
                  Ought to do!
                      (To a Bald Man)
                  How about a bottle, mister?
                  Only costs a penny, guaranteed.

               You can have my oath, sir,
               'Tis unique.
                   (Applies the bald man's
                    hand to the wet spot)
               Rub a minute,
               Stimulatin', i'n it?
               Soon you'll have to thin it
               Once a week!

     More customers are stepping up and buying bottles.

     Todd opens a bottle of the Elixir, takes a whiff. Disgusting.
     He smiles to Mrs. Lovett, his plan falling into place.

                         TODD
                   (loudly, to Mrs. Lovett)
               Pardon me, ma'am, what's that awful stench?

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Are we standing near an open trench?

                         TODD
                   (to a woman in the crowd)
               Must be standing near an open trench!

     The crowd responds to Todd and Mrs. Lovett, looking askance
     and sniffing at the bottles. Toby nervously tries to distract
     them:

                         TOBY
               Buy Pirelli's Miracle Elixir:
               Anything wot's slick, sir,
               Soon sprouts curls.
               Try Pirelli's!
               When they see how thick, sir,
               You can have your pick, sir,
               Of the girls!

               Want to buy a bottle, missus?

                         TODD
                   (sniffing bottle of
                    Elixir)
               What is this?

                         MRS. LOVETT
                   (sniffing another
                    customer's bottle)
               What is this?

                         TODD
               Smells like piss.

                         TODD
               This is piss. Piss with ink.

     The music speeds up -- Toby is getting desperate:

                         TOBY
               Let Pirelli's
               Activate your roots, sir--

                         TODD
               Keep it off your boots, sir--
               Eats right through.

                         TOBY
               Yes, get Pirelli's!
               Use a bottle of it!
               Ladies seem to love it--

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Flies do too!

     Suddenly, the curtains on the caravan are dramatically flung
     wide to reveal--

     PIRELLI, a flamboyant Italian with a velvet suit, thick wavy
     hair and a dazzling smile. Pirelli poses splendidly for a
     moment. Then:

                         PIRELLI
               I am Adolfo Pirelli,
               Da king of da barbers, da barber of kings,
               E buon giorno, good day,
               I blow you a kiss!
                   (he does so)
               And I, da so-famous Pirelli,
               I wish-a to know-a
               Who has-a da nerve-a to say
               My elixir is piss!
               Who says this?!

                          TODD
               I do.
                   (Todd moves forward
                     boldly.)
               I am Mr. Sweeney Todd of Fleet Street.
               I have opened a bottle of Pirelli's
               elixir, and I say to you that it is
               nothing but an arrant fraud, concocted
               from piss and ink.


                                                         (CONTINUED)
                                                                   PAGE 30.
22   CONTINUED: (4)                                              22

     The crowd gasps. Pirelli is about to respond, outraged, but
     Todd continues--

                         TODD
               And furthermore --   "signor" -- I have
               serviced no kings,   yet I wager I can
               shave a cheek with   ten times more
               dexterity that any   street mountebank.

     He snaps open his razor case and holds it up for the crowd to
     see, turning to display the wondrous razors:

                         TODD
               You see these razors?

                         MRS. LOVETT
                   (to the crowd)
               The finest in England.

                         TODD
                   (glaring at Pirelli)
               I lay them against five pounds you are
               no match for me. You hear me, sir?
               Either accept my challenge or reveal
               yourself as a sham.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Bravo, bravo.

     The crowd is enjoying this now, whispering eagerly about the
     bold challenge. In the crowd, we see a quick flash of the
     meek TOURIST we saw earlier.

     Pirelli studies the razors for a moment and then turns to the
     crowd with a confident smile:
                         PIRELLI
               You hear zis foolish man? Watch and
               see how he will regret his folly!

     Music begins as Todd moves into action, preparing the
     challenge:

                         TODD
               Friends, who's for a free shave?

     Two men step forward. A plain wooden chair is brought for
     Todd as he moves into the boldest part of this plan...

     He carefully turns to ... The Beadle.

                         TODD
               Will Beadle Bamford be the judge?

                                                         (CONTINUED)
                                                                PAGE 31.
22   CONTINUED: (5)                                            22

     Mrs. Lovett's eyes shoot to Todd, alarmed--

     The Beadle moves toward Todd ....

     Todd smiles amiably, but quivers internally at being so
     dreadfully close to his prey...

     Mrs. Lovett watches, concerned. Will the Beadle recognize the
     features of Benjamin Barker...?

     Apparently not.

     The Beadle stops right before Todd and smiles.

                         BEADLE
               Glad, as always, to oblige my friends
               and neighbors
                   (to the crowd)
               ... Let the challenge commence!

     One man sits in Todd's plain chair as the other moves to an
     elaborate chair on Pirelli's caravan. Pirelli shakes out a
     fancy bib with a flourish and covers his man. Toby prepares
     Pirelli's ornate shaving supplies as Todd takes a plain towel
     and tucks it around his man's neck.

                         BEADLE
               Ready?

                         PIRELLI
               Ready!

                         TODD
               Ready.

                         BEADLE
               The fastest, smoothest shave is the
               winner.

     He blows his shrill whistle. Agitated music begins.

     Pirelli strops his razor quickly, Todd in a leisurely manner.
     Pirelli keeps glancing at Todd in various paranoid ways
     throughout, frightened of Todd's progress. He starts whipping
     up lather rapidly:

                         PIRELLI
                   (while mixing furiously)
               Now, signorini, signori,
               We mix-a da lather
               But first-a you gather
               Around, signorini, signori,
               You looking a man

22   CONTINUED: (6)                                               22

               Who have had-a da glory
               To shave-a da Pope.
               Mr. Sweeney-so-smart--
                   (Splatters the customer
                     with shaving cream)
               Oh, I beg-a you pardon -- 'll
               Call me a lie, was-a only a cardinal--
               Nope!
               It was-a da Pope!

     Unexpectedly, Todd still shows no signs of starting to shave
     his man. He merely watches Pirelli's performance. Mrs. Lovett
     looks at him nervously, wishing he would get on with it.

     Pirelli, now feeling he can take his time, sings lyrically as
     he lathers and shaves with rhythmic scrapes and elaborate
     gestures of wiping the razor.

                         PIRELLI
               To shave-a da face,
               To cut-a da hair,
               Require da grace
               Require da flair,
               For if-a you slip,
               You nick da skin,
               You clip-a da chin,
               You rip-a da lip a bit
               Beyond-a repair!

     Todd strops his razor slowly and deliberately -- shoop,
     shoop, shoop -- disconcerting Pirelli and drawing the crowd's
     attention.

                         PIRELLI
               To shave-a da face
               Or even a part
               Widout it-a smart
               Require da heart.
               Not just-a da flash,
               It take-a panache,
               It take-a da passion
               For da art.

     Todd is unconcerned. He just continues to slowly strop his
     razor -- shoop, shoop, shoop -- which flusters Pirelli.

                         PIRELLI
               To shave-a da face,
               To trim-a da beard,

     While Pirelli holds this note elaborately, Todd, with a few
     deft strokes, quickly lathers his man's face, shaves him and
     signals the Beadle to examine him.

                         BEADLE
                   (blowing whistle)
               The winner is Todd.

     Pirelli deflates.

                         MRS. LOVETT
                   (feeling the customer's
                    cheek)
               Smooth as a baby's arse! -- (to Todd) -
               - Well done, dear!

     The crowd laughs and applauds Todd as Pirelli goes to him:

                         PIRELLI
                   (a profound bow)
               Sir, I bow to a skill far defter than
               my own.

                         TODD
               The five pounds.
     Pirelli produces a distinctive chatelaine purse and removes a
     five pound note, gives it to Todd:

                         PIRELLI
               Here, sir. And may the good Lord smile
               on you --
                   (a quick stab of a smile)
               -- Until we meet again.

     He bows his head quickly and then moves away, beckoning to
     Toby:

                            PIRELLI
               Come, boy.

                         TOBY
               We're pulling out, sir?

                                                         (CONTINUED)
                                                                   PAGE 34.

     Without warning, Pirelli SLAPS Toby viciously across the face
     --Toby almost falls--

                         PIRELLI
                   (snarling)
               We're pulling out, yes. Quickly.

     Mrs. Lovett has observed all of this as she moves away with
     Todd, who is making his way inexorably toward the Beadle.

     Some eager customers surround Todd, among them is the
     TOURIST.

                         EAGER CUSTOMER
               Mr. Todd, sir, do you have an
               establishment of your own?

     Mrs. Lovett is on him like a hawk:

                         MRS. LOVETT
               He certainly does. Sweeney Todd's
               Tonsorial Parlor -- above my meatpie
               emporium in Fleet Street.

     Todd has led them right to the Beadle:

                         TODD
               I thank you for your honest
               adjudication, sir. You are a paragon
               of integrity.

                         BEADLE
               Well, I try to do my best for my
               friends and neighbors ... Your
               establishment is in Fleet Street, you
               say?
                           TODD
               Yes, sir.

                         BEADLE
               Then, Mr. Todd, you will surely see me
               there before the week is out.

                         TODD
               You will be welcome, Beadle Bamford,
               and I guarantee to give you, without a
               penny's charge, the closest shave you
               will ever know.
                                                                   PAGE 35.



23   EXT. STREET -- DAY                                            23

     Todd and Mrs. Lovett are walking away from the marketplace.
     She chatters happily:

                         MRS. LOVETT
               ... Like to give me a coronary right
               there! What if he had recognized you!
               Lord, my heart was beating a mile a
               minute, just like a little finch it
               was. Aren't those lovely birds now?
               Always so twittery and happy...

     She continues chattering...

     But Todd is not listening.

     His eyes dart to the side to see--

     The Gentleman is walking next to him, whispering, subtle,
     insinuating...

                         GENTLEMAN
               Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned.
               Like a perfect machine 'e planned...

     The Banker moves in next to the Gentleman...

                         BANKER
               Barbing the hook, baiting the trap,
               Setting it out for the Beadle to snap...

     The General joins them...

                         GENERAL
               Slyly courted 'im, Sweeney did,
               Set a sort of a scene 'e did...

                          GENTLEMAN, BANKER AND GENERAL
               Laying the trail, showing the traces,
               Letting it lead to higher places...
               Sweeney...

     The last word echoes ... And then they are gone ...
     disappearing from Todd's mind ... swallowed up by the crowd
     of pedestrians...

     Todd looks to Mrs. Lovett and she continues chattering:




                                                          (CONTINUED)
                                                                   PAGE 36.
23   CONTINUED:                                                23

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  ... Suppose it's just me gentle heart,
                  but I do hate to see a boy treated
                  like that, no better than your Aunt
                  Doreen's dog -- Mr. Todd, are you
                  listening to me?

                               TODD
                  Of course.

     But then his eyes dart again -- looking for the specters. He
     only sees strangers.

24   INT. JOHANNA'S ROOM -- MORNING                                24

     Johanna sits, framed by the window, quietly cutting out
     silhouettes. Aimless Victorian handicrafts.

     But we see there are tears in her eyes.

     She steals a glance across the room. We see a small hole in
     the wallpaper. Through this hole, the Judge is watching her
     from another chamber. Lascivious. Perverse.

     Johanna finally stands and casually glances out from between
     the shutters at her window. She sees...

     Anthony, standing at the park across the street, keeping up
     his lonely vigil, gazing up at the mansion.

     She watches him for a moment and then makes her decision. She
     moves to a table and opens a drawer. Reaches in and removes
     something...

25   EXT. TURPIN'S MANSION -- MORNING                              25
     Anthony sees a figure at the shutters -- then hears a
     clinking sound. Metal on pavement.

     He quickly moves across the street and looks...

     A key, dropped from above.

     He looks up to the shutters and smiles, then snatches up the
     key and hurries off.

26   INT. JOHANNA'S ROOM -- MORNING                                26

     Peering through the shutters, Johanna watches him go.

     We linger on her face and then dissolve to another face, also
     watching...
                                                                  PAGE 37.



27   INT. BARBER SHOP -- MORNING                                  27

     ... Her father.

     Todd's face, staring out the window, intense and brooding.
     Seething with discontent.

     Mrs. Lovett chatters as she moves around behind him:

                         MRS. LOVETT
               ... It's not much of a chair, I'll
               grant, but it'll serve. Was me poor
               Albert's chair. Sat in it all day long
               he did, after his leg give out from
               the gout, poor dear.

     He moves from the window and paces like a caged tiger in the
     small barber shop.

     Though it has been cleaned, it is still a spartan room. A
     tatty parlor chair. A large chest. A few counters with meager
     bottles of tonsorial supplies. And his gleaming razors,
     always waiting.

                         TODD
               Why doesn't the Beadle come? "Before
               the week is out," that's what he said.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               And who says the week's out? It's only
               Tuesday.

     Todd moves away from her, she pursues, trying to calm and
     soothe him...

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Easy now.
               Hush, love, hush.
               Don't distress yourself,
               What's your rush?
               Keep your thoughts
               Nice and lush.
               Wait.
                   (he continues to pace)
               Hush, love, hush.
               Think it through.
               Once it bubbles,
               Then what's to do?
               Watch it close.
               Let it brew.
               Wait.

     He does not respond. She dares to move closer...

                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                                  PAGE 38.
27   CONTINUED:                                                   27

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  I've been thinking, flowers--
                  Maybe daisies--
                  To brighten up the room.
                  Don't you think some flowers,
                  Pretty daisies,
                  Might relieve the gloom?
                  Ah, wait, love, wait.

     Todd sourly tosses himself into the chair, he picks up his
     largest razor and looks at it intensely:

                             TODD
                       (to razor)
                  And the Judge? When will we get to
                  him?

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Can't you think of nothing else?
                  Always broodin' away on yer wrongs
                  what happened heaven knows how many
                  years ago...


                  Don't you know,
                  Silly man,
                  Half the fun is to
                  Plan the plan?
                  All good things come to
                  Those who can
                  Wait.

     Her gentle words have calmed him considerably. She moves even
     closer. Risks touching him softly...

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Gillyflowers, maybe,
                  `Stead of daisies...
                  I don't know, though...
                  What do you think?


     Then Todd tilts the razor in his hand--

     SUDDENLY -- the face of the GENTLEMAN -- a flash -- reflected
     in the razor--

     Then--

     A bell rings from outside the shop -- the effect is electric
     -- Todd bolts up, senses alert -- Mrs. Lovett spins to the
     door--


                                                        (CONTINUED)

27   CONTINUED: (2)                                               27

     Todd holds his razor open as he moves strategically toward
     the door--

     We hear footsteps ascending the stairs outside quickly--

     Then--

     Anthony enters, breathless--

                         ANTHONY
               Mr. Todd! Thank God I've found you --
                   (Todd turns, closing the
                    razor, as Anthony sees
                    Mrs. Lovett)
               ... Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me...

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Mrs. Lovett, sir.

                         ANTHONY
               A pleasure, ma'am --
                   (continues to Todd)
               -- You see, there's a girl who needs
               my help -- such a sad girl, and
               lonely, but beautiful too and--

                         TODD
               Slow down, Anthony.

                         ANTHONY
                   (takes a breath)
               Yes, I'm sorry ... This girl has a
               guardian so tyrannical that he keeps
               her locked away. But then this morning
               she dropped this ...
                   (produces the key)
               ... It must be a sign that Johanna
               wants me to help her -- that's her
               name, Johanna -- and Turpin that of
               her guardian. A judge of some sort...

     Todd and Mrs. Lovett exchange a quick glance as Anthony
     continues:

                         ANTHONY
               ... I've met him, Mr. Todd, and he is -
               - unnatural ... Once he goes to court,
               I'm going to slip into the house and
               release her -- and beg her to come
               away with me. Tonight.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Oh, this is all terribly romantic.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
                                                                  PAGE 40.
27   CONTINUED: (3)                                               27

                          ANTHONY
                Yes, but -- you see -- I don't know
                anyone in London --
                    (to Todd)
                -- and I need somewhere safe to bring
                her till I've hired a coach to take us
                to Plymouth.

     He looks at Todd deeply:

                           ANTHONY
                If I could keep her here, just for an
                hour or two, I would forever be in
                your debt.

     Todd stares at him, his mind racing to figure out how this
     new twist might aid in his plans.

     It is Mrs. Lovett who smoothly replies:

                          MRS. LOVETT
                Bring her here, dear.

                          ANTHONY
                Thank you, ma'am ...
                    (to Todd)
                ... Mr. Todd?

     A beat.

                          TODD
                The girl may come.

                          ANTHONY
                    (taking his hand)
                Thank you, my friend.
     He goes.

                          MRS. LOVETT
                Seems like the fates are favoring you
                at last, Mr. T.
                    (Todd grunts, unhappy)
                What is it, love? You'll have her back
                before the day is out.

                          TODD
                For a few hours? Before he carries her
                off to the other end of England?

               Oh, him? Let him bring her here and
               then, since you're so hot for a little
               --
                   (makes a throat-cutting
                    gesture)
               -- that's the throat to slit, dear.

     Todd moves again to his post at the window, he stares out,
     deep in thought.

     Meanwhile, she happily moves around the shop, straightening
     things up and trying to make it all a bit more cozy:

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Poor little Johanna. All those years
               without a scrap of motherly affection.
               Well, we'll soon see to that...

                         TODD
                   (alert, sees something)
               What's this?

     Mrs. Lovett joins him at the window. Below, they see Pirelli
     approaching with Toby in tow.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Look at that face, he's up to
               mischief.

                         TODD
               Go -- keep the boy below with you.

     She nods and scurries out. We go with her...

28   EXT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                          28
     ... Mrs. Lovett quickly moves down the steps outside the
     barber shop to greet Pirelli and Toby as they are about to
     ascend.

     We see a new sign on the stairs: "Sweeney Todd's Tonsorial
     Parlor."

                         PIRELLI
               Signora, is Mr. Todd at home?

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Plying his trade upstairs, don'tcher
               know ...

                    staircase, blocking their
                    way, looking at Toby)

                  ... Would you look at it, now! Don't
                  look like it's had a kind word since
                  half past never!

                              TOBY
                  Ma'am...?

                            MRS. LOVETT
                      (to Pirelli)
                  You wouldn't mind if I gave him a nice
                  juicy meat pie, would yer?

                            PIRELLI
                      (impatient)
                  Yes, yes, whatever you like.

     Pirelli climbs the stairs, as she takes Toby by the hand and
     leads him toward the pie shop door:

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Come with me now. Your teeth is
                  strong, I hope?

     They go into the pie shop.

     Todd is standing, arms folded. Waiting. Pirelli enters.

     Todd shakes his head, amused, and begins to turn away when
     Pirelli says:

                            PIRELLI
                  ... Mr. Benjamin Barker.

     Todd freezes.

30   INT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                           30

     Mrs. Lovett hands Toby one of her grisly pies, he devours
     eagerly.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  That's my boy, tuck in.

     But her attention is almost entirely on the roof above ...
     the muffled voices .... the sound of shoes walking...

     Her eyes keep darting up as she chatters distractedly with
     Toby:

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Like to see a man with a healthy
                  appetite. Reminds me of my dear
                  Albert, like to gorge himself to
                  bloatation, he did. He didn't have
                  your nice full head though--

                            TOBY
                  To tell the truth --
                      (he pulls off the wig
                       which covers his own
                       short-cropped hair)
                  -- it gets awful hot.
31   INT. BARBER SHOP -- DAY                                        31

     Pirelli is expansively strolling around the shop, taking it
     all in, savoring every second:

                            PIRELLI
                  ... yes, this will do very nicely ...
                  You don't remember me. Well, why
                  should you? I was just a down and out
                  Irish pug you hired for a couple of
                  weeks -- sweeping up hair and the like
                  --
                      (He picks up one of Todd's
                       razors)
                  But I remember these -- And how could
                  I ever forget you, Benjamin Barker?

                            PIRELLI (cont'd)
                  I would sit right there and watch you,
                  and dream of the day I could be a
                  proper barber meself ... You might say
                  you were an inspiration to me.

     Todd glares at him.

                            PIRELLI
                  So, do we have a deal, or should I run
                  down the street for me pal Beadle
                  Bamford? What do you say to that now,
                  Mr. Sweeney T--?

     Without a word of warning--

     Like a thunderbolt--

     Todd is on him.

     He leaps across the shop and brutally grabs Pirelli by the
     neck -- violently strangling him -- Pirelli is surprisingly
     strong and puts up a desperate struggle -- they thump
     awkwardly around the shop--

32   INT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                            32

     Mrs. Lovett hears the muffled sounds of the struggle above.
     She nervously begins to shift and clang some things around as
     she cleans the counter, trying to cover the sound,
     chattering:

                             MRS. LOVETT
                  My my my, always work to be done. Spic-
                  and-span, that's my motto. Cleanliness
                  is next to whatever-it-is. So, ah, how
                  did you end up with that dreadful
                  Eyetalian?

                            TOBY
                      (still eating happily)
                  Got me from the workhouse 'e did. Been
                  there since I was born. Got no mum,
                  got nobody. A wasted soul, that's what
                  I am --
                      (a sudden, urgent thought)
                  -- Oh God! He's got an appointment
                  with his tailor--

     He bolts up, clearly terrified of Pirelli--

                            TOBY
                  If he's late, he'll blame me--!

     But he is gone--

33   EXT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                           33

     Toby vaults up the stairs to the barber shop--

34   INT. BARBER SHOP -- DAY                                        34

     Todd is standing calmly when Toby bursts in--

                            TOBY
                  Signor, you got an appointment...

     He stops when he realizes Pirelli is nowhere to be seen.

                            TODD
                  Signor Pirelli has been called away.
                  You better run after him.

                            TOBY
                  Oh no, sir. I better wait for him here
                  or it'll be a lashing. He's a great
                  one for the lashings.

     He moves past Todd to the large chest and sits--

     Only now do we see one of Pirelli's hands protruding from the
     chest, dangling limply.

     Toby doesn't notice it. Todd at this moment, however, does.
     He smiles nervously.

                            TODD
                  So, hmmm, Mrs. Lovett gave you a pie,
                  did she?

                            TOBY
                  She's a real lady. Model of all true
                  Christian virtue.

     Then Pirelli's hand ... twitches.

     Toby doesn't notice. Todd does, stares at it anxiously.

                            TODD
                  That she is ... that she is. But if I
                  know a growing boy, there's still room
                  for some more pie, eh?

                            TOBY
                  I'd say, sir -- (pats his stomach) --
                  An aching void.

     Pirelli's hand begins to twitch more desperately now,
     perilously close to where Toby's hand rests...

                            TODD
                  Then why don't you run downstairs and
                  wait for your master there? There'll
                  be another pie in it for you, I'm
                  sure...

     Pirelli's hand is twitching closer to Toby's now...

                            TOBY
                  No, I should stay here.

                              TODD
                      (a   sudden inspiration)
                  I know   -- why don't you tell Mrs.
                  Lovett   I said to give you a nice big
                  tot of   gin?

                            TOBY
                      (leaps up)
                  Gin, sir?! Thanking you kindly, sir!
                  You're a Christian indeed!

     He races out happily and clatters down the stairs.

     A beat as Todd gets his breath.

     Then he goes to the trunk, leans down to open it, the camera
     follows him down and up again, when he rises--
     The GENTLEMAN is standing right behind him!

     Todd turns.

     The Gentleman's face is completely impassive. He is not
     spectral. He does not disappear. He just stands there.

     Todd looks at him.

     Then the Gentleman's eyes slowly move to a counter...

     Todd follows his look to see...

     His largest razor.

     A long beat as Todd looks at the razor.

     The point of no return.

     Todd strides to the razor and he snaps it open with a sharp,
     quick flick of his wrist--

     Then he moves to the chest and--

     With great ferocity he hauls Pirelli up--

     Pirelli's eyes snap open--

     And Todd SLASHES his throat--

     The piercing factory whistle SCREAMS--

     Todd remains standing over Pirelli as the painful whistle
     echoes into music...

     We see that the Gentleman is still standing there, watching
     Todd...

                         GENTLEMAN
               His hands were quick, his fingers strong.
               It stung a little but not for long.

     The dashing Oxford Student is now leaning against a wall,
     arms folded, looking at Todd...

                         STUDENT
               And those who thought him a simple clod
               Were soon reconsidering under the sod...

     The Tourist stands by the window...

                         TOURIST
               Consigned there with a friendly prod
               From Sweeney Todd,
               The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

                         GENTLEMAN, STUDENT AND TOURIST
               See your razor gleam, Sweeney,
               Feel how well it fits
               As it floats across the throats
               Of hypocrites.

     The last word echoes to silence as we cut to:

     A high-angle shot of the room.

     The ghosts are gone.

     Todd stands alone over Pirelli's body. Blood dripping from
     his razor. Drip. Drip. Drip.
                                                                   PAGE 48.



35   INT. OLD BAILEY -- DAY                                        35

     Judge Turpin lurks over the proceedings.

     He sits, the personification of power, very high at the
     bench. He glares down a wasted wretch of a BOY. The Beadle
     stands next to the boy.

                         JUDGE
               This is the second time, sir, that you
               have been brought before this bench.
               Though it is my earnest wish to ever
               temper justice with mercy, your
               persistent dedication to a life of
               crime is an abomination before God and
               man.

     He places a black cloth on his head:

                         JUDGE
               I therefore sentence you to hang by
               the neck until you are dead and may
               the Lord have mercy on your soul.

     The wretched boy collapses in sobs. The Beadle is pleased
     with the verdict.

     The Judge removes the black cloth and tosses it casually on
     his desk:

                         JUDGE
               This court is adjourned.

36   EXT. -- STREET -- OUTSIDE THE OLD BAILEY -- DAY               36

     The Judge and the Beadle walk away from the impressive
     edifices of the Old Bailey.

                         BEADLE
               Thank you, your Honor. Just the
               sentence we wanted.

                         JUDGE
               Was he guilty?

                         BEADLE
               Well, if he didn't do it, he's surely
               done something to warrant a hanging.

                         JUDGE
                   (quietly)
               What man has not?

                            BEADLE
                  Sir?

                            JUDGE
                  No matter -- Come, walk home with me.
                  I have news for you, my friend. In
                  order to shield her from the evils of
                  this world, I have decided to marry my
                  dear Johanna.

                            BEADLE
                  Ah, sir, happy news indeed.

                            JUDGE
                  Strange, though, when I offered myself
                  to her she showed a certain ...
                  reluctance.

     The Beadle proceeds with exquisite and obsequious delicacy:

                            BEADLE
                  Excuse me, my lord,
                  May I request, my lord,
                  Permission, my lord, to speak?
                  Forgive me if I suggest, my lord,
                  You're looking less than your best, my lord,
                  There's powder upon your vest, my lord.
                  And stubble upon your cheek,
                  And ladies, my lord, are weak.

     As they round a corner, the Judge feels his chin:

                            JUDGE
                  Stubble, you say? Perhaps at times I
                  am a little overhasty with my morning
                  ablutions...
                            BEADLE
                      (cheerily)
                  Fret not though, my lord,
                  I know a place, my lord,
                  A barber, my lord, of skill.
                  Thus armed with a shaven face, my lord,
                  Some eau de cologne to brace my lord
                  And musk to enhance the chase, my lord,
                  You'll dazzle the girl until
                  She bows to your every will.

                            JUDGE
                  A barber, eh? Take me to him.

                 I am honored, my lord. His name is

                 very last word in barberin'.

     They head off.

37   INT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                          37

     Mrs. Lovett is pouring Toby a glass of gin, not his first.

     He gulps down the gin between ravenous bites of another meat
     pie as she nervously glances up to the ceiling, wondering
     what the hell is going on up there.

                           MRS. LOVETT
                 You ought to slow down a bit, lad.
                 It'll go to your head.

                           TOBY
                 Weaned on the stuff, I was. They used
                 to give it to us at the workhouse,
                 so's we could sleep. Not that you'd
                 ever want to sleep in that place,
                 ma'am. Not with the things wot happen
                 in the dark.

                           MRS. LOVETT
                 That's nice, dear ... I think I'll
                 just pop in on Mr. Todd for a tick.
                 You'll be all right here?

                           TOBY
                 Leave the bottle.

     She goes.
38   INT. BARBER SHOP -- DAY                                       38

     Mrs. Lovett enters. Todd is methodically cleaning his razor.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                 Gawd, the lad is drinking me out of
                 house and home, how long until Pirelli
                 gets back?

                           TODD
                 He won't be back.

                           MRS. LOVETT
                     (instantly suspicious)
                 Mr. T., you didn't!


                                                          (CONTINUED)

     He casually points the razor toward the chest.

     She lifts the lid and sees Pirelli's body at the bottom of
     the chest.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                      (spinning on Todd)
                  You're barking mad! Killing a man wot
                  done you no harm!

                            TODD
                  He recognized me from the old days. He
                  tried to blackmail me -- half my
                  earnings.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                      (relieved)
                  Oh well, that's a different matter!
                  For a moment there I thought you'd
                  lost your marbles!

     She looks into the chest again.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Ooooh! All that blood! Enough to make
                  you come all over gooseflesh, ain't
                  it? Poor bugger. Oh, well.

     She starts to close the chest, then has an idea.

     She reaches in and rummages around the body. Pulls out
     Pirelli's chatelaine purse, then drops the lid of the chest.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                      (looking through purse)
                  Three quid! Well, waste not, want not,
                  I always say...
                      (she tucks the purse into
                       her dress)
                  ... Now what are we going to do about
                  the boy?

                            TODD
                  Send him up.

     She stops, looks at him.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Oh, we don't need to worry about him,
                  he's a simple thing. I'll pawn him off
                  with some story.

                   (cold)
               Send him up, woman.

                         MRS. LOVETT
                   (quickly)
               Now, Mr. T., surely one's enough for
               today. Don't want to indulge yourself,
               after all ...
                   (she busily starts to
                    straighten up the room)
               ... 'Sides, I was thinking about
               hiring a lad to help around the shop,
               me poor knees not being what they used
               to be.

     Todd sighs and moves to his familiar post at the window:

                         TODD
               Anything you say.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               'Course we'll have to stock up on the
               gin, the boy drinks like a Barbary
               sailor--

     Todd suddenly gasps -- a great, shocking intake of breath as
     his whole body tenses like iron--

     Mrs. Lovett spins to him--

                            TODD
               The Judge.

     Mrs. Lovett hurries to the window--
     Below, they can see the Judge and the Beadle approaching.
     They see them exchanging a few words and then the Beadle
     moves off as the Judge approaches the shop--

     Todd whispers, his eyes blazing:

                         TODD
               Justice ... Justice.

     Mrs. Lovett gives him a quick kiss and then very quickly
     leaves. A beat as Todd prepares himself.

     He turns from the window and looks around the shop, shifting
     nervously. Now that his great moment of revenge is at hand,
     he doesn't quite know what to do with himself.

     He snatches up his large razor, coils by the door, ready to
     attack. No. He wants to savor this. He quickly moves and puts
     the razor down.

     Finally he just stands. All his demons settling into a
     bizarre sort of calm.

     He hears the Judge's footsteps approaching on the stairs.
     Then the Judge enters.

                           JUDGE
               Mr. Todd?

     Todd slowly turns:

                         TODD
               At your service ... An honor to
               receive your patronage, my lord.

                         JUDGE
               You know me, sir?

                         TODD
                   (a polite bow)
               Who in this wide world is not familiar
               with the honored Judge Turpin?

     The Judge grunts and glances around the shop:

                         JUDGE
               These premises are hardly
               prepossessing and yet the Beadle tells
               me you are the most accomplished of
               all the barbers in the city.

                         TODD
               That is gracious of him, sir ...
                   (indicates for the Judge
                    to sit)
                ... Sit, if you please, sir. Sit.

     The Judge settles into the parlor chair as music begins...

                         TODD
               And what may I do for you today, sir?
               A stylish trimming of the hair? A
               soothing skin massage?

                         JUDGE
               You see, sir, a man infatuate with love,
               Her ardent and eager slave.
               So fetch the pomade and pumice stone
               And lend me a more seductive tone,

               A sprinkling perhaps of French cologne,
               But first, sir, I think -- a shave.

                         TODD
               The closest I ever gave.

     He whips a sheet over the Judge, then tucks the bib in. The
     Judge hums, flicking imaginary dust off the sheet; Todd
     whistles gaily.

                         JUDGE
               You're in a merry mood today, Mr.
               Todd.

                         TODD
                   (mixing lather)
               'Tis your delight, sir, catching fire
               From one man to the next.

                         JUDGE
               'Tis true, sir, love can still inspire
               The blood to pound, the heart leap higher.

                         BOTH
               What more, what more can man require--

                         JUDGE
               Than love, sir?

                         TODD
               More than love, sir.

                            JUDGE
               What, sir?

                            TODD
               Women.

                         JUDGE
               Ah yes, women.

                         TODD
               Pretty women.

     The Judge hums jauntily, Todd whistles and starts stropping
     his razor rhythmically. He then lathers the Judge's face.

     Still whistling, Todd stands back to survey the Judge, who is
     now totally relaxed, eyes closed.

     Todd goes to his razor and picks it up, sings to it gently:

               Now then, my friend.
               Now to your purpose.
               Patience, enjoy it.
               Revenge can't be taken in haste.

                         JUDGE
                   (opening his eyes)
               Make haste, and if we wed,
               You'll be commended, sir.

                          TODD
               My lord...
                   (Goes to him)
               And who, may it be said,
               Is your intended, sir?

                          JUDGE
               My ward.

     A shocked tremor through Todd -- as the Judge closes his eyes
     again and settles in comfortably...

                         JUDGE
               And pretty as a rosebud.

     The music rises...

                         TODD
               Pretty as her mother?

                         JUDGE
                   (mildly puzzled)
               What? What was that?

                         TODD
               Oh, nothing, sir. Nothing. May we
               proceed?

     The music builds as he steps behind the Judge-- his razor
     ready -- we are sure the great moment has come -- the music
     still builds -- Todd finally puts the razor at the Judge's
     throat--

     Then--

     With an easy flick of his wrist, he just begins to shave the
     Judge, as:

               Pretty women.

               Sitting in the window or
               Standing on the stair,
               Something in them
               Cheers the air.

               Pretty women...

                         JUDGE
               Silhouetted...

                         TODD
               Stay within you...

                         JUDGE
               Glancing...

                         TODD
               Stay forever...

                         JUDGE
               Breathing lightly...

                         TODD
               Pretty women...

                         BOTH
               Pretty women!
               Blowing out their candles or
               Combing out their hair...

     They sing simultaneously:
                         JUDGE
               Then they leave...
               Even when they leave you
               And vanish, they somehow
               Can still remain
               There with you,
               There with you.

                          TODD
               Even when they leave,
               They still
               Are there.
               They're there.

                         BOTH
               Ah,
               Pretty women...

                  At their mirrors...

                            JUDGE
                  In their gardens...

                            TODD
                  Letter-writing...

                            JUDGE
                  Flower-picking...

                            TODD
                  Weather-watching...

                            BOTH
                  How they make a man sing!
                  Proof of heaven
                  As you're living--
                  Pretty women, sir!

     The music approaches a feverish crescendo as Todd prepares to
     finally kill the Judge and they sing simultaneously:

                              JUDGE
                  Pretty   women, yes!
                  Pretty   women, sir!
                  Pretty   women!
                  Pretty   women, sir!

                            TODD
                  Pretty women, here's to
                  Pretty women, all the
                  Pretty women--

     Just as the music reaches a climax, Todd raises his arm in a
     huge arc and is about to slash the Judge's throat when--

     Suddenly--

     Anthony bursts in--

                            ANTHONY
                  Mr. Todd! I've seen Johanna! She said
                  she'll leave with me tonight--!

     The Judge jumps up, away from Todd--

                            JUDGE
                  You! -- There is indeed a higher power
                  to warn me thus in time--

     He tears off the sheet as he advances savagely on Anthony:

                                                           (CONTINUED)
                                                                   PAGE 58.
38   CONTINUED: (8)                                               38

                           JUDGE
                 Johanna elope with you? Deceiving
                 slut! -- I'll lock her up in some
                 obscure retreat where neither you nor
                 any other vile creature shall ever lay
                 eyes on her again--!

     He spins with venom to Todd:

                           JUDGE
                 And as for you, barber, it is all too
                 clear what company you keep. Service
                 them well and hold their custom -- for
                 you'll have none of mine.

     He strides out.

     Todd stands, frozen.

                           ANTHONY
                 Mr. Todd -- you have to help me --
                 I've talked to Johanna and--!

     Todd suddenly turns on him with a ferocious ROAR:

                           TODD
                 OUT! OUT, I SAY!

     Utterly stunned at his friend's ferocity, Anthony backs away,
     leaves the shop.

     Music begins, very agitated, as Todd stands motionless.

     In shock.

     His mind cracking apart.
     Mrs. Lovett hurries in:

                           MRS. LOVETT
                 All this shouting and running about,
                 what's happened--?

                           TODD
                 I had him -- and then--

                           MRS. LOVETT
                 The sailor busted in, I know, I saw
                 them both running down the street and
                 I said--

     Todd interrupts wildly:

38   CONTINUED: (9)                                              38

                          TODD
               I had him!
               His throat was bare
               Beneath my hand--!

                         MRS. LOVETT
               There, there, dear. Don't fret--

                         TODD
                   (spins on her violently)
               No, I had him!
               His throat was there,
               And he'll never come again!

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Easy now.
               Hush, love, hush.
               I keep telling you--

                         TODD
               When?!

                         MRS. LOVETT
               What's your rush?

                         TODD
               Why did I wait?
               You told me to wait!
               Now he'll never come again...

     The music becomes ferocious as Todd's wrenching insanity,
     always close to the surface, finally explodes:

                         TODD
               There's a hole in the world
               Like a great black pit
               And it's filled with people
               Who are filled with shit
               And the vermin of the world
               Inhabit it--
               But not for long!

     He suddenly looks to Mrs. Lovett -- she starts back --
     alarmed by the pure madness in his eyes--

                         TODD
               They all deserve to die!
               Tell you why, Mrs. Lovett,
               Tell you why:
               Because in all of the whole human race, Mrs. Lovett
               There are two kinds of men and only two.
               There's the one staying put
               In his proper place

38   CONTINUED: (10)                                           38

               And the one with his foot
               In the other one's face--
               Look at me, Mrs. Lovett,
               Look at you--

     He suddenly lurches and grabs Mrs. Lovett tightly--

                         TODD
               No, we all deserve to die!
               Even you, Mrs. Lovett,
               Even I.
               Because the lives of the wicked should be--
                   (slashes at the air
                    violently)
               Made brief.
               For the rest of us, death
               Will be a relief--
               We all deserve to die!

     He clutches her to him very tightly as he suddenly keens, a
     howl of pure agony:

                         TODD
               And I'll never see Johanna,
               No, I'll never hug my girl to me--

     He hurls Mrs. Lovett away from him--

                           TODD
               Finished!

     We suddenly slash to--

39   EXT. STREET -- DAY                                            39

     --In Todd's mind.
     We are moving with him as he stalks relentlessly, holding his
     razor, striding down a busy street like a tiger.

     The many pedestrians he passes don't even notice him. He is
     invisible to them, a wolf among the sheep, as he beckons--



                         TODD
               All right! You, sir,
               How about a shave?
               Come and visit
               Your good friend, Sweeney--!

40   EXT. ANOTHER STREET -- DAY                                 40

     Todd continues to stride, beckoning to another man:

                         TODD
               You, sir, too, sir--
               Welcome to the grave!
               I will have vengeance,
               I will have salvation!

41   EXT. ANOTHER STREET -- DAY                                 41

     Todd continues to stride, beckoning to another man:

                         TODD
               Who, sir? You, sir?
               No one's in the chair--
               Come on, come on,
               Sweeney's waiting!
               I want you bleeders!

42   EXT. ANOTHER STREET -- DAY                                 42

     Todd continues to stride, beckoning to another man:

                         TODD
               You, sir -- anybody!
               Gentlemen, now don't be shy!
               Not one man, no,
               Nor ten men,
               Nor a hundred
               Can assuage me--
               I will have you!

43   EXT. ANOTHER STREET -- DAY                                 43
     Todd continues to prowl...

                         TODD
               And I will get him back
               Even as he gloats.
               In the meantime I'll practice
               On less honorable throats--

44   EXT. ANOTHER STREET -- DAY                                 44

     Todd suddenly falls to his knees, keening in anguish--

                         TODD
               And my Lucy lies in ashes
               And I'll never see my girl again,
               But the work waits, I'm alive at last

                      (a final exalted cry)
                  And I'm full of JOOOOOOY!!

     He raises his razor high on the soaring last note as we pull
     back ... our view is suddenly obscured by a strange, frenzied
     fluttering of black wings ... We continue to pull back ... We
     discover the black wings are pigeons, thousands of them,
     flying up in a great cloud...

     We continue to pull back to finally discover that Todd is
     kneeling in the heart of a church square...

     Empty but for him.

     As his cry ends we slash back to--

45   INT. BARBER SHOP -- DAY                                      45

     -- Todd is kneeling, sweat pouring through his clothes,
     panting for air.

     Mrs. Lovett stands, looking down at him intently.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  That's all very well, but what are we
                  going to do about --
                      (kicks the chest)
                  -- the dear departed?

     Todd remains kneeling, motionless. She goes to him, firm:

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Listen! Do you hear me? Get a hold of
                  yourself!

     She slaps his cheek -- he looks up at her, barely seeing her.
                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Oh, you great useless thing, come on--

     She hauls him up and drags him out...

46   INT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                         46

     She pulls him in.

                              MRS. LOVETT
                  Sit down.

     He thumps down, still in his own dark world.

     She quickly glances around for Toby and then goes into her
     parlor...
                                                                   PAGE 63.



47   INT. PARLOR -- DAY                                            47

     She discovers Toby is asleep on the sofa before the fire.

     She quickly snatches up a bottle of gin from the sideboard
     and returns to the pie shop...

48   INT. PIE SHOP DAY                                             48

     She pours Todd a tumbler of gin, hands it to him:

                         MRS. LOVETT
               There, drink it down -- all the way --
               that's right ...
                   (he does so)
               ... Now, we got a body molderin' away
               upstairs, what do you intend we should
               do about that?

                         TODD
               Later on, when it's dark, we'll take
               him to some secret place and bury him.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Well, yes, of course, we could do
               that. I don't suppose he's got any
               relatives going to come poking around
               looking for him...

     A chord of music. A beat. An idea. He looks at her
     uncomprehendingly.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Well, you know me, sometimes bright
               ideas just pop right into my head, and
               I keep thinking...
               Seems a downright shame...

                          TODD
               Shame?

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Seems an awful waste...
               Such a nice plump frame
               Wot's-his-name
               Has...
               Had...
               Has...
               Nor it can't be traced.
               Business needs a lift--
               Debts to be erased--
               Think of it as thrift,

                                                                     PAGE 64.

                  As a gift...
                  If you get my drift...
                      (Todd has no idea what she
                       is talking about)
                  No?
                      (She sighs)
                  Seems an awful waste.
                  I mean,
                  With the price of meat what it is,
                  When you get it,
                  If you get it--

     Todd suddenly understands:

                            TODD
                  Ah!

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Good, you got it.
                      (She warms to the idea)
                  Take, for instance,
                  Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop.
                  Business never better, using only
                  Pussycats and toast.
                  And a pussy's good for maybe six or
                  Seven at the most.
                  And I'm sure they can't compare
                  As far as taste--

                            TODD
                  Mrs. Lovett,
                  What a charming notion,

     The music builds as they sing simultaneously:

                            TODD
                  Eminently practical and yet
                  Appropriate as always.
                  Mrs. Lovett, how I've lived without you
                  All these years I'll never know!
                  How delectable!
                  Also undetectable.

                  How choice!
                  How rare!

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Well, it does seem a
                  Waste...
                  It's an idea...
                  Think about it...
                  Lots of other gentlemen'll
                  Soon be coming for a shave,

               Think of
               All them
               Pies!

     A triumphant waltz theme begins:

                         TODD
               For what's the sound of the world out there?

                         MRS. LOVETT
               What, Mr. Todd,
               What, Mr. Todd,
               What is that sound?

                         TODD
               Those crunching noises pervading the air?

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Yes, Mr. Todd,
               Yes, Mr. Todd,
               Yes, all around--

                         TODD
               It's man devouring man, my dear,

     They sing simultaneously:

                         TODD
               And who are we
               To deny it in here?

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Then who are we
               To deny it in here?
     Music continues under:

                         TODD
               Ah, these are desperate times, Mrs.
               Lovett, and desperate measures are
               called for.

     She goes to the counter and comes back with an imaginary pie:

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Here we are now, hot out of the
               oven...

     She holds the imaginary pie out to him with a sly and wicked
     smile.

               What is that?

                         MRS. LOVETT
               It's priest.
               Have a little priest.

                         TODD
               Is it really good?

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Sir, it's too good,
               At least.
               Then again, they don't commit sins of the flesh,
               So it's pretty fresh.

                         TODD
                   (looking at it)
               Awful lot of fat.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Only where it sat.

                         TODD
               Haven't you got poet
               Or something like that?

                         MRS. LOVETT
               No, you see the trouble with poet
               Is, how do you know it's
               Deceased?
               Try the priest.

                         TODD
                   ("tasting" it)
               Mmm. Heavenly.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Not as hearty as bishop, perhaps, but
               not as bland as curate, either.

     Mrs. Lovett presents another imaginary pie:

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Lawyer's rather nice.


                         TODD
               If it's for a price.

               Order something else, though, to follow,
               Since no one should swallow
               It twice.

                         TODD
               Anything that's lean.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Well, then, if you're British and loyal,
               You might enjoy Royal
               Marine.
               Anyway, it's clean.
               Though, of course, it tastes of wherever it's been.

                         TODD
                   (looking past her to
                    imaginary oven)
               Is that squire
               On the fire?

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Mercy no, sir,
               Look closer,
               You'll notice it's grocer.

                         TODD
               Looks thicker.
               More like vicar.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               No, it has to be grocer -- it's green.

     Todd laughs as the glorious waltz theme returns:

                         TODD
               The history of the world, my love--

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Save a lot of graves,
               Do a lot of relatives favors...

                         TODD
               --Is those below serving those up above.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Everybody shaves,
               So there should be plenty of flavors...

                         TODD
               How gratifying for once to know--

                    above)
               --That those above will serve those down below!

     The music continues under:

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Since marine doesn't appeal to you,
               how about rear admiral?

                         TODD
               Too salty. I prefer general.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               With or without his privates? --
               "With" is extra.

     Todd chortles as Mrs. Lovett offers another pie with a
     particular, flamboyant panache:

                         TODD
               What is that?

                         MRS. LOVETT
               It's fop.
               Finest in the shop.
               Or we have some shepherd's pie peppered
               With actual shepherd
               On top.
               And I've just begun.
               Here's a politician -- so oily
               It's served with a doily--
               Have one?

                         TODD
               Put it on a bun.
                   (She looks at him
                    quizzically)
               Well, you never know if it's going to run.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Try the friar.
               Fried, it's drier.

                         TODD
               No, the clergy is really
               Too coarse and too mealy.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Then actor--
               That's compacter.

               Yes, and always arrives overdone.

                    purposeful)
               I'll come again when you
               Have Judge on the menu...

     The music vamps deliciously as:

                         MRS. LOVETT
               True, we don't have Judge -- yet --
               but would you settle for the next best
               thing?

                         TODD
               What's that?

     She offers him a butcher's cleaver:

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Executioner.

     He takes the cleaver, feels the heft of it. Feels good.

     Then he picks up her wooden rolling pin, hands it to her, as
     the music builds into the triumphant waltz:

                         TODD
               Have charity towards the world, my pet--

               We'll take the customers that we can get.
                         MRS. LOVETT
               High-born and low, my love.

                         TODD
               We'll not discriminate great from small.
               No, we'll serve anyone--

                         MRS. LOVETT
               We'll serve anyone--

                         BOTH
               And to anyone
               At all!

49   INT. JOHANNA'S ROOM -- EVENING                                49

     Small, white hands ... removing some clothes from a drawer
     ... putting them into a portmanteau ... locking the case...

     Johanna, wearing traveling clothes, is packing to leave when
     a voice surprises her:

                         JUDGE
               So it's true.

     She turns. The Judge stands in the doorway.

                         JOHANNA
               Sir ... A gentlemen knocks before
               entering a lady's room.

                         JUDGE
               Indeed he does ... But I see no lady.

     He enters, dangerously quiet. And terrifically hurt.

                         JUDGE
               I told myself the sailor was lying ...
               I told myself this was a cruel fiction
               ... That my Johanna would never betray
               me. Never hurt me so.

     He moves toward her. She stands her ground.

                         JOHANNA
               Sir ... I will leave this place.

                         JUDGE
               I think that only appropriate. Since
               you no longer find my company to your
               liking, madam, we shall provide you
               with new lodgings.

     He stands very close to her. Still she holds her ground.

                         JUDGE
               Until this moment I have spared the
               rod ... And the ungrateful child has
               broken my heart. Now you will learn
               discipline...

     The large form of the Beadle fills the doorway. She glances
     to him, disquieted.

                            JUDGE
                  When you have learned to appreciate
                  what you have, perhaps we shall meet
                  again. Until then ... Think on your
                  sins.

     He nods to the Beadle -- the Beadle surges forward and grabs
     Johanna brutally--

     She screams and fights like a tiger -- to no avail--

     The Beadle covers her mouth with one of his huge hands and
     hauls her out--

50   EXT. TURPIN'S MANSION -- EVENING                               50

     Anthony is racing toward the front of mansion when he sees--

     A hansom cab is just pulling away -- Johanna's terrified face
     looking at him through the window--

                             ANTHONY
                  JOHANNA!

     Anthony sees the Beadle pulling her away from the window as
     the carriage clatters off--

     Judge Turpin stands on the steps of the mansion -- Anthony
     goes to him in a murderous rage:

                            ANTHONY
                  Where are you taking her?! Tell me or
                  I swear by God--!

     The Judge spins and roars -- a hellish howl that echoes--
                            JUDGE
                  WOULD YOU KILL ME, BOY?! HERE I STAND!

     Anthony's eyes burn into the Judge -- but he is no killer.

     He turns and races after the hansom cab. It rounds a corner
     and is gone.

     The Judge watches as Anthony pursues the cab, disappearing
     around the corner.

     And we fade to...

51   EXT. FLEET STREET -- DAY                                       51

     ...The face of the Beggar Woman.


                                                           (CONTINUED)
                                                                   PAGE 72.

     She sits, crouched on her haunches, peering up from under her
     few greasy locks of hair.

     She is watching something intently. A few pedestrians move
     quickly down the sidewalk past her, excited. They chatter
     back and forth eagerly...

     The Beggar Woman uncoils and follows...

     And we finally see what the Beggar Woman has been watching so
     intently...

52   EXT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                          52

     Mrs. Lovett's wretched establishment has been transformed!

     She has created a modest outdoor eating garden with tables,
     surrounded by glowing Chinese lanterns. A fresh coat of
     paint, a few bushes in pots and birds in cages add to the
     feeling of upward mobility.

     A new sign hangs proudly over the entrance to the pie shop:
     "MRS. LOVETT'S WORLD FAMOUS MEAT PIES!" And then in smaller
     letters: "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE."

     The eating garden is already crowded, the benches at the
     tables are filled and other customers stand and mill about.

     All eating, eating, eating...

     ...The most delicious looking meat pies you could ever
     imagine. Crispy crust. Thick, luxurious gravy. Tart and tangy
     meat.

     The customers take great, hungry mouthfuls; the steaming
     gravy oozing down greedy faces.
     Chomp. Chomp. Chomp.

     The Beggar Women stands across the street, ravenously hungry.
     She finally gets the nerve to approach when--

     Toby -- wearing a spiffy new outfit with apron -- bursts from
     the shop and circulates through the customers:

                            TOBY
                  Ladies and gentlemen,
                  May I have your attention, perlease?
                  Are your nostrils aquiver and tingling as well
                  At that delicate, luscious ambrosial smell?
                  Yes they are, I can tell...



                                                          (CONTINUED)
                                                                      PAGE 73.
52   CONTINUED:                                                      52

     He moves through the greedily eating customers in the outdoor
     garden and toward the street as:

                            TOBY
                  Well, ladies and gentlemen,
                  That aroma enriching the breeze
                  Is like nothing compared to its succulent source,
                  As the gourmets among you will tell you, of course.

     He arrives at the street and drums up some more business:

                            TOBY
                  Ladies and gentlemen,
                  You can't imagine the rapture in store--
                      (Indicating the pie shop)
                  Just inside of this door!
                  There you'll sample
                  Mrs. Lovett's meat pies,
                  Savory and sweet pies,
                  As you'll see.
                  You who eat pies,
                  Mrs. Lovett's meat pies
                  Conjure up the treat pies
                  Used to be!

     Just then Mrs. Lovett sweeps from the pie shop with a tray of
     hot, steaming pies.

     Like her shop, she has been transformed as well. She wears
     her somewhat gauche notion of a "fancy dress." Buckets of
     decolletage. And her hair has been dyed a rather unique
     aubergine color.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Toby!
                            TOBY
                  Coming!
                      (pushing past a customer)
                  'Scuse me...

                             MRS. LOVETT
                      (indicating a beckoning
                       customer)
                  Ale there!

                            TOBY
                  Right, mum!

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Quick, now!



                                                             (CONTINUED)
                                                                PAGE 74.
52   CONTINUED: (2)                                             52

     The customers suddenly exclaim their joy through awkward
     mouthfuls of pie:

                         CUSTOMERS
               God, that's good!

     Toby scurries inside to get a jug of ale, whisks back out and
     starts filling tankards as Mrs. Lovett circulates grandly.

     She is a bundle of activity -- serving pies, collecting
     money, giving orders, addressing the patrons individually and
     with equal buoyant insincerity:

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Nice to see you, dearie...
               How have you been keeping?...
               Cor, me bones is weary!
               Toby--!
                   (Indicating a Customer)
               One for the gentleman...
               Hear the birdies cheeping--
               Helps to keep it cheery...

     She spots the Beggar Woman approaching and responds with
     unusual ferocity:

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Toby!
               Throw the old woman out!

                         CUSTOMERS
               God, that's good!

     Toby shoos the Beggar Woman away, but she soon comes skulking
     back.
                          MRS. LOVETT
                   (continuing to customers)
               What's your pleasure, dearie?...
               No, we don't cut slices...
               Cor, me eyes are bleary!...
                   (As Toby is about to pour
                     for a drunken customer)
               Toby!
               None for the gentleman!...
               I could up me prices--
               I'm a little leery...
               Business
               Couldn't be better, though--

                         CUSTOMERS
               God, that's good!

                 Knock on wood.

     She does.

53   INT. BARBER SHOP -- DAY                                       53

     Music continues as Todd works busily. Sawing, drilling,
     screwing, hammering. Doing something we cannot see to his
     barber chair. Making adjustments, tinkering, building,
     feverish. Happy.

54   EXT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                          54

     Mrs. Lovett continues to circulate:

                            MRS. LOVETT
                 What's your pleasure, dearie?
                     (Spilling ale)
                 Oops! I beg your pardon!
                 Just me hands is smeary--
                     (Spotting a freeloader
                       trying to sneak out
                       without paying)
                 Toby!
                 Run for the gentleman!

     Toby catches him, collects the money, as Mrs. Lovett turns to
     another customer:

                           MRS. LOVETT
                 Don't you love a garden?
                 Always makes me teary...
                     (Looking back at the
                      freeloader)
                 Must be one them foreigners--
                           CUSTOMERS
                 God, that's good that is delicious!

                           MRS. LOVETT
                 What's my secret?
                     (To a woman)
                 Frankly, dear -- forgive my candor--
                 Family secret,
                 All to do with herbs.
                 Things like being
                 Careful with your coriander,
                 That's what makes the gravy grander--!

     The customers are getting more rabid now -- stuffing in the
     gorgeous meat pies in great fistfuls--

     Music continues as Todd makes the final adjustments to his
     chair. He stands back. Seems delighted with the results of
     his tinkering. The ratty old parlor chair has been
     transformed into a sleek, Victorian barber chair -- with
     unique refinements.

     He leaves the barber shop...

56   EXT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                          56

     Todd stands at the top of the stairs, watching the street
     hungrily. As, below, Mrs. Lovett smiles to another customer:

                             MRS. LOVETT
                  Incidentally, dearie,
                  You know Mrs. Mooney.
                  Sales've been so dreary--
                      (She spots the Beggar
                        Woman again)

                        customer, about Mrs.

                      (To the customer as Toby
                        shoos the Beggar Woman
                        away again)
                  Lookin' sort of beery--

     She hangs up a "Sold Out" sign.

                            MRS. LOVETT AND TOBY
                  Come again tomorrow--!

     She spots a man in need of a shave approaching:

                              MRS. LOVETT
                  Hold it--

                  Bless my eyes--!

     She sees the man going up to the barber shop. Todd is still
     standing at the top of the stairs. He smiles secretly to Mrs.
     Lovett as he ushers the man in.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Fresh supplies!

     The man goes into the barber shop as she happily takes down
     the "Sold Out" sign and turns again to the customers:

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  How about it, dearie?

     Mrs. Lovett then spots the Beggar Woman approaching again,
     she spins to Toby with truly shocking viciousness:

               Toby!
               Throw the old woman out!

     Mrs. Lovett watches intently as Toby leads the Beggar Woman
     away.

     The Customers, meanwhile, are building to a pure frenzy of
     mastication -- chewing and gulping and snapping at the
     heavenly pies:

               Pies such flavor
               God, that's good!!

     The music comes to a rousing conclusion as Mrs. Lovett stands
     at the door to her shop. Triumphant.

57   INT. BARBER SHOP -- NIGHT                                     57

     Todd is alone. He sits in the barber chair, smoking a pipe.
     He is holding an old Daguerreotype; creased, stained and
     bleached-out.

     The image shows his wife, Lucy, smiling and holding Baby
     Johanna. The child's features are almost completely obscured
     by a stain on the picture.

     He looks at it deeply.

     Then church bells echo in the distance...

58   EXT. MAYFAIR -- NIGHT                                         58

     ... The church bells continue as we discover Anthony,
     searching through the streets for Johanna. We see him in long
     shot as he moves through the contours of the city.


                                                       (CONTINUED)
                                                                 PAGE 79.

     He starts his search in a luxurious area of wealth. His
     journey through the city will take him lower and lower, into
     the darkest corners of London.

                             ANTHONY
                  I feel you, Johanna,
                  I feel you.
                  Do they think that walls can hide you?
                  Even now I'm at your window.
                  I am in the dark beside you,
                  Buried sweetly in your yellow hair,
                  Johanna...

     He continues walking...

59   INT. BARBER SHOP -- NIGHT                                   59

     ...Todd gazes quietly at the Daguerreotype:

                               TODD
                  Johanna...

                  And are you beautiful and pale,
                  With yellow hair, like her?
                  I'd want you beautiful and pale,
                  The way I've dreamed you were...

60   EXT. DOCKS -- NIGHT                                         60

     ...We see the figure of Anthony, walking along the docks.

                               TODD (V.O.)
                  Johanna...

                               ANTHONY
                  Johanna...
61   INT. BARBER SHOP -- DAY                                     61

     ...Todd shaves a customer. We recognize the customer
     instantly: it is the GENTLEMAN.

     The Daguerreotype now rest on the counter.

     Todd remains wistful, detached, dream-like.

                            TODD
                  And if you're beautiful, what then,
                  With yellow hair, like wheat?
                  I think we shall not meet again--
                      (He quietly slits the
                       Gentleman's throat)
                  My little dove, my sweet...
                                                                   PAGE 80.



62   EXT. SPITALFIELDS MARKET -- DAY                               62

     ...We see the figure of Anthony, walking past hanging
     carcasses of the busy meat market.

                            TODD (V.O.)
               Johanna...

                          ANTHONY
               I'll steal you,
               Johanna...

63   INT. BARBER SHOP -- DAY                                       63

     ...The dead Gentleman is slumped in the chair.

                         TODD
               Goodbye, Johanna,
               You're gone, and yet you're mine.
               I'm fine, Johanna,
               I'm fine!

     He pulls a lever on the newly adjusted chair -- the chair
     becomes a slide -- and the Gentleman disappears through a
     trapdoor in the floor, down a chute -- Todd pulls the lever
     again and the chair returns to its normal position.

64   EXT. SLUM -- DAY                                              64

     ...We see Anthony moving past a crowded tenement, redolent of
     cholera.

                            ANTHONY
               Johanna...

65   INT. BAKEHOUSE STEPS -- DUSK                                  65
     ...Music continues as Mrs. Lovett descends a long and very
     claustrophobic series of steps down to the bakehouse. She
     unbolts and pulls aside a heavy iron door and enters.

     We remain outside. A fiery red glow spills out -- the roar of
     the oven within is thundering.

66   EXT. FLEET STREET -- DUSK                                     66

     ...The Beggar Woman stands on Fleet Street. The hellish
     metropolis glows, the smoke from a thousand chimneys creating
     a great pall over the city.

                         BEGGAR WOMAN
                   (in a demented rage)
               Smoke! Smoke!

66   CONTINUED:                                                   66

                  Sign of the devil! Sign of the devil!
                  City on fire!
                      (to disgusted passers-by)
                  Witch! Witch!
                  Smell it, sir! An evil smell!
                  Every night at the vespers bell--
                  Smoke that comes from the mouth of hell--
                  City on fire!
                  City on fire...
                      (She begins to scuttle
                       off)
                  Mischief! Mischief! Mischief...

67   INT. BARBER SHOP -- DUSK                                      67

     ...The red glow of sunset fills the shop as Todd ushers in
     another customer and prepares to shave him:

                            TODD
                  And if I never hear your voice,
                  My turtledove, my dear,
                  I still have reason to rejoice:
                  The way ahead is clear...

68   EXT. ALLEY -- DUSK                                            68

     ...We see the figure of Anthony moving down a dark alley.
     Shadowy figures lurk along the alley walls.

                               TODD (V.O.)
                  Johanna...

                             ANTHONY
                  I feel you...

69   INT. BARBER SHOP -- DUSK                                      69

     ...Todd continues to prepare to shave the customer:

                            TODD
                  And in that darkness when I'm blind
                  With what I can't forget--
                  It's always morning in my mind,
                  My little lamb, my pet...

70   EXT. GRAVEYARD -- DUSK                                        70

     ...We see Anthony moving past an lonely graveyard.

                               TODD (V.O.)
                  Johanna...

                            TODD
                  You stay, Johanna...
                      (He quietly cuts the
                       customer's throat)
                  The way I've dreamed you are.
                      (Todd notices dusk outside
                       the window)
                  Oh look, Johanna-,
                      (Pulls the lever and the
                       customer disappears)
                  A star!
                      (Tossing the customer's
                       hat down the chute)
                  A shooting star!

72   EXT. GRAVEYARD -- DUSK                                        72

     ...Anthony continues to move past the graveyard.

                            ANTHONY
                  Buried sweetly in your yellow hair...

73   INT. BAKEHOUSE STEPS -- DAY                                   73

     ...Music continues as Mrs. Lovett emerges from the bakehouse
     with a rack of hot pies.

     She walks out of frame, up the steps, as we push in on the
     crack in the door. The fiery roar of the oven within is
     overpowering.
74   EXT. FLEET STREET -- DAY                                      74

     ...The Beggar Woman is scuttling madly along Fleet Street.

                            BEGGAR WOMAN
                      (pointing to the smoke
                       over rooftops)
                  There! There!
                  Somebody, somebody look up there!
                      (the passers-by continue
                       to ignore her)
                  Didn't I tell you? Smell that air?
                  City on fire!

     She approaches the pie shop, the agitated music matching her
     increasing frenzy. She grabs a stunned Toby -- who is
     carrying some packages toward the pie shop:

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                      (panicked)
                  Quick, sir! Run and tell!
                  Warn 'em all of the witch's spell!
                  There it is, there it is, the unholy smell!
                  Tell it to the Beadle and the police as well!
                  Tell 'em! Tell 'em!

     She spots Mrs. Lovett emerging from the pie shop and explodes
     in desperation, pointing madly:

                            BEGGAR WOMAN
                  Help!!! Fiend!!!
                  City on fire!!!

     Toby pulls away from her, as she begins to scuttle off:

                            BEGGAR WOMAN
                  City on fire...
                  Mischief ... Mischief ... Mischief... Fiend...

     She appeals to other pedestrians as she goes:

                            BEGGAR WOMAN
                  Alms! ... Alms! ...

     Toby turns to consider the horrible black smoke belching from
     the chimney of the pie shop. Something about the foul, ebony
     smoke troubles him.

75   INT. BARBER SHOP -- DAY                                       75

     ...Todd is standing alone, contemplative, slowly and
     methodically stropping his razor.

                            TODD
                  And though I'll think of you, I guess,
                  Until the day I die,
                  I think I miss you less and less
                  As every day goes by...

76   EXT. LIMEHOUSE -- DAY                                         76

     ...We see the figure of Anthony trudging past the sinister
     opium dens and depraved taverns of the East End.

                               TODD (V.O.)

77   INT. BARBER SHOP -- DAY                                      77

     ...Todd completes shaving a customer. The customer's wife and
     daughter are waiting.

                          TODD
               And you'd be beautiful and pale,
               And look too much like her.
               If only angels could prevail,
               We'd be the way we were.
               Johanna...

     The customer pays. With a pleasant smile, Todd ushers them
     out..

78   EXT. ASYLUM -- NIGHT                                         78

     ...Anthony wanders past the high and impenetrable walls of a
     madhouse, the demented souls within can be seen moving about
     in silhouette behind barred windows.

                          ANTHONY
               I feel you...
               Johanna...

     Something makes him stop. He turns to consider the asylum...

79   INT. BARBER SHOP -- MORNING                                  79

     ...Todd shaves another customer. A beautiful morning outside
     the window.

                          TODD
               Wake up, Johanna!
               Another bright red day!
                   (He slits the customer's
                    throat)
               We learn, Johanna,
               To say...
               Goodbye...

     As the note continues, he pulls the lever and the customer
     disappears down the chute...

80   EXT. ASYLUM -- MORNING                                       80

     ...Anthony stares up at the asylum.

                         ANTHONY
               I'll steal you...
                                                                   PAGE 85.



81   INT. BARBER SHOP -- MORNING                                   81

     ...As the music concludes, Todd picks up the faded
     Daguerreotype and again sits in his barber chair.

     He gazes at the picture, lost in revery.

82   EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH -- DAY                                   82

     Mrs. Lovett and Todd rest on a picnic blanket, just like any
     other couple out enjoying the fine day.

     The remains of a nice picnic lunch are scattered around them
     and Toby can be seen flying a kite a bit away.

     Mrs. Lovett watches happy couples moving about ... dogs and
     kids running hither and yon ... military officers squiring
     their ladies ... nurses with prams...

     Todd is distinctly ill at ease, brooding, as she chatters:

                         MRS. LOVETT
               ... which is not to say we couldn't
               get some nice taxidermy animals to
               bring a touch of gentility to the
               place. You know, a boar's head or
               two...
                   (glancing at the
                    unresponsive Todd)
               Mr. T., are you listening to me?

                            TODD
               Of course.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Then what did I just say?
                         TODD
                   (back in his somber
                    reflections)
               There must be a way to the Judge!

                         MRS. LOVETT

                   (she massages his neck)
               We got a nice respectable business
               now, money coming in regular and --

               -- only strangers and such like wot
               won't be missed -- who's going to

     No response from Todd. She leans across and pecks him on the
     cheek:

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Oooh, Mr. Todd--
                      (Kisses him again)
                  I'm so happy--
                      (Again)
                  I could--
                      (Again)
                  Eat you up, I really could!
                  You know what I'd like to Do, Mr. Todd?
                      (Kisses him)
                  What I dream--
                      (Again)
                  If the business stays as good,
                  Where I'd really like to go--
                      (No response)
                  In a year or so...
                      (No response)
                  Don't you want to know?

                             TODD
                      (couldn't care less)
                  Of course.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Do you really want to know?

                            TODD
                      (forces a pained smile)
                  Yes, yes, I do, I do.

     The music continues as she leans back comfortably, beginning
     to imagine a wonderful, domestic future...
                             MRS. LOVETT
                  I've always had this dream of living
                  at the seaside ... I got a picture
                  postcard from me Aunt Nettie once. Oh,
                  it seems like such a grand place...
                      (notes Toby flying his
                       kite)
                  And all that fresh aquatic air's bound
                  to be good for the lad's poxy lungs...

                  By the sea, Mr. Todd,
                  That's the life I covet;
                  By the sea, Mr. Todd,
                  Ooh, I know you'd love it!
                  You and me, Mr. T.,
                  We could be alone

               Down by the sea...

                   (grumbles)
               Anything you say.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Wouldn't that be smashing?

     And we go to...

83   EXT. BEACH -- DAY                                             83

     ...In Mrs. Lovett's mind.

     She and Todd sit in the exact same positions as in Hampstead
     Heath. Only now they are sitting on a beach.

     They are wearing what she imagines as fashionable seaside
     bathing clothes.

     Toby, who is not consumptively pale but overly rosy-cheeked
     in her fantasy, is building a sandcastle nearby.

     Mrs. Lovett is sitting with her Dream Todd, of course, so he
     has a bland smile on his face. Somewhat unnatural.

     In fact, there is something vaguely unreal and stilted about
     all of this.

                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
               With the sea at our gate,
               We'll have kippered herring
               Wot have swum to us straight
               From the Straits of Bering.
               Every night in the kip
               When we're through our kippers,
               I'll be there slippin' off your
               slippers
               By the sea...
               With the fishies splashing.
               By the sea...
               Wouldn't that be smashing?
               Down by the sea--

                         TODD (V.O.)
               Anything you say,
               Anything you say.
                                                                  PAGE 88.



84   EXT. BOARDWALK -- DAY                                        84

     Mrs. Lovett strolls with Todd on a boardwalk. Artificially
     lovely couples, like rotogravure magazine pictures, move
     about.

     Toby runs along ahead of them.

                          MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
               I can see us waking,
               The breakers breaking,
               The seagulls squawking:
               Hoo! Hoo!
               I do me baking,
               Then I go walking
               With yoo-hoo...
                   (she waves to Toby)
               Yoo-hoo...

85   EXT. BOARDWALK -- DAY                                        85

     Mrs. Lovett and Todd recline on comfortable deck chairs,
     having tea and scones.

                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
               I'll warm me bones
               On the esplanade
               Have tea and scones
               With me gay young blade...

86   EXT. SEASIDE COTTAGE, PORCH -- DAY                           86

     Mrs. Lovett's notion of a fashionable little seaside cottage.
     Crushing in its bourgeois blandness.

     She is making Toby try on a sweater. Todd is writing a
     letter.

                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
               Then I'll knit a sweater
               While you write a letter...

87   EXT. BEACH -- DAY                                            87

     Back on the beach, she cuddles into Todd:

                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
                   (Coyly)
               Unless we got better
               To do-hoo...

88   INT. SEASIDE COTTAGE -- NIGHT                              88

     Mrs. Lovett and Todd snuggle into bed:

                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
               Think how snug it'll be
               Underneath our flannel
               When it's just you and me
               And the English Channel...

89   INT. SEASIDE COTTAGE -- EVENING                            89

     Mrs. Lovett and Todd entertain some unnaturally jolly chums.

                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
               In our cozy retreat,
               Kept all neat and tidy,
               We'll have chums over every Friday...

90   EXT. BEACH -- DAY                                          90

     Back on the beach.

                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
               By the sea...

                         TODD (V.O.)
               Anything you say...

     Toby pulls Mrs. Lovett over to examine his little sandcastle
     as:

                          MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
               Don't you love the weather
               By the sea?
               We'll grow old together
               By the seaside,
                   (Beckons to Todd to join
                    them)
               Hoo! Hoo!
               By the beautiful sea!

     Music continues as Todd joins them. He kneels with Toby to
     help him work on the sandcastle. Mrs. Lovett stands, watching
     them, the picture of the doting mother.

                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
               It'll be so quiet
               That who'll come by it
               Except a seagull?
               Hoo! Hoo!
               We shouldn't try it,

                  For two-hoo!

91   INT. SEASIDE CHAPEL -- DAY                                    91

     Mrs. Lovett and Todd getting married. This being her fantasy,
     after all, she wears white. Todd is in a constricting morning
     coat with a rakish top hat. Toby, the best man, watches
     proudly.

                            MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
                  But a seaside wedding
                  Could be devised,
                  Me rumpled bedding
                  Legitimized.

     They exchange vows and kiss.

                            MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
                  My eyelids'll flutter,
                  I'll turn into butter,
                  The moment I mutter
                  "I do-hoo!"

92   INT. SEASIDE COTTAGE -- MORNING                               92

     Mrs. Lovett is placing a plate of kippers on the table amidst
     a proper English breakfast. A guest stands, leaning against a
     wall, waiting to eat.

                            MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
                  By the sea, in our nest,
                  We could share our kippers
                  With the odd paying guest
                  From the weekend trippers,
                  Have a nice sunny suite
                  For the guest to rest in--

     A dark shape quickly moves past the guest -- Todd -- then the
     guest slides down the wall -- a splash of blood on the
     wallpaper-

                            MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
                  Now and then, you could do the guest in--

93   EXT. BEACH -- SUNSET                                          93

     Back at the beach, Mrs. Lovett, Todd and Toby sit
     comfortably. Watching an unnaturally gorgeous sunset.

     A picture postcard of a happy family.

     The music concludes as she throws her arms affectionately
     around her two men.

     We cut back to--

94   EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH -- DAY                                    94

     --Mrs. Lovett is sitting in the exact same position with
     Todd. Silence.

     Her smiles fades as she considers him. The grim, brooding
     reality is so clear next to her lovely dream.

     She watches him in silence as we fade to...

95   INT. BARBER SHOP -- MORNING                                    95

     Todd is standing at his usual post, the window, gazing
     intently down at Fleet Street.

     Mrs. Lovett enters with a tray of food:

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Brought you some breakfast, dear, farm
                  fresh eggs and a dollop of lovely
                  clotted cream, only the best for my...
     She stops when he realizes he isn't even listening to her.
     Her heart sinks seeing him at the window, wearing his
     obsession like a cloak.

     A beat as she looks at him.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Mr. T., might I ask you a question?

                              TODD
                        (not turning)
                  Mm?

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  What did your Lucy look like?

     He turns to her.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  You heard me ... (a beat) ... Can't
                  really remember can you?

                            TODD
                  She had yellow hair.

     He turns back to the window.

     Mrs. Lovett proceeds with great sincerity:

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  You've got to leave all this behind
                  you now. She's gone ... You keep
                  looking down into the grave, you're
                  never gonna look up. And life will
                  just pass right by ... Life is for the
                  alive, my dear.

     He does not answer.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  We could have a life we two ... Maybe
                  not like I dreamed, maybe not like you
                  remember ... But we could get by.

     He does not answer.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Come away from the window.

     A long beat.

     He finally turns from the window. Almost as if to leave his
     demons behind...
     She smiles quietly and holds out her hand...

     She begins to cross to him...

     SUDDENLY REVEALING--

     The Gentleman!

     Standing right behind Mrs. Lovett--

     He is glaring at Todd, relentless and accusatory--

     Blood pouring from his throat--

     A shocking horror movie vision--

     Then the bell rings outside the shop ... Todd turns ... the
     Gentleman is gone ... we hear footsteps climbing the
     stairs...

     Mrs. Lovett remains standing, her hand out to him, as--

     Anthony enters, absolutely exhausted.

                         ANTHONY
               Mr. Todd ... Mrs. Lovett, ma'am ...
               (sinks into a chair) ... Seems I've
               not slept in a week -- but it's done--

                         TODD
               What is it, Anthony?

                         ANTHONY
                   (bitter)
               He has her locked in a madhouse.

     Todd's head snaps to Anthony, riveted:

                         TODD
               You've found Johanna?

                         ANTHONY
               For all the good it'll do -- it's
               impossible to get to her.

     Todd begins pacing, the tiger again, his mind is racing--

                         TODD
               A madhouse ... A madhouse ... Where?

                         ANTHONY
               Fogg's Asylum. But I've circled the
               place a dozen times. There's no way
               in. It's a fortress.

     Anthony fades to a brooding silence as Todd continues pacing,
     thinking, thinking. Mrs. Lovett watches him, concerned.

     Todd suddenly stops...

     We see him settling into an inspired sort of calm, as if he
     can finally see the Promised Land.

                         TODD
                   (a whisper)
               I've got him.

                           ANTHONY
               Mr. Todd?

                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                                 PAGE 94.
95   CONTINUED: (3)                                             95

                         TODD
                   (to Anthony)
               We've got her ... Where do you suppose
               all the wigmakers of London go to
               obtain their human hair? Bedlam. They
               get their hair from the lunatics at
               Bedlam--

                         ANTHONY
               I don't understand--

     Todd suddenly grabs Anthony and hauls him up -- holds him
     close, forehead to forehead -- his whispered intensity truly
     disturbing:

                         TODD
               We shall set you up as a wigmaker in
               search of hair -- that will gain you
               access -- then you will take her.

                            ANTHONY
               Yes...

                         TODD
               You will not be deterred -- You will
               slaughter the world -- To bring her
               here.

                            ANTHONY
               Yes.

     Mrs. Lovett watches, troubled, as Todd embraces Anthony
     closely. He holds him for a long beat.

     Then Todd is all action, hurries to get some money and gives
     it to Anthony, as:
                         TODD
               Go and outfit yourself properly -- you
               are to be a gentlemen wigmaker. When
               you return we shall dispatch a letter
               to this Mr. Fogg announcing your
               arrival. Go -- quickly now!

                         ANTHONY
                   (clasping Todd's hand)
               Mr. Todd -- how can I ever--?

                            TODD
               Go!

     Anthony hurries out.


                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                                   PAGE 95.

     Todd immediately hurls himself into a chair and begins
     writing a letter, his violent scrawl slashing across the
     page.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Dear, I wonder if--

                         TODD
               Fetch the boy.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Don't you think it's time you--

                         TODD
               Fetch the boy.

     Mrs. Lovett goes...

96   EXT. PIE SHOP -- MORNING                                      96

     Mrs. Lovett begins going down the stairs outside the barber
     shop.

     Then she stops. She stands for a long moment, disturbed that
     Todd's demons are again devouring him.

     She looks down and sees Toby washing the tables in the
     outdoor garden. Toby is serious about his work, vigorously
     scrubbing the tables with soap and water.

     She watches him for a moment and then continues down the
     steps:

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Toby ... Mr. Todd requires you.
                           TOBY
               Yes'm.

     He goes up the steps. She just stands, deep in thought.

97   INT. BARBER SHOP -- MORNING                                   97

     Todd is finishing the letter as Toby enters:

                           TOBY
               Mr. T.?

                         TODD
                   (still writing)
               You know where the Old Bailey is?

                             TOBY
                   Oh, yes, sir. Not that I ever--

                             TODD
                       (interrupts, folding up
                        letter)
                   Take this there and seek out a Judge
                   Turpin. Repeat that. Repeat that.

                             TOBY
                   Go to the Old Bailey. Find Judge
                   Turpin.

                             TODD
                       (handing him letter)
                   Put this into his hands. Only to him.
                   Do you understand?

                             TOBY
                   Yes, sir, and while I'm out do you
                   mind if I stop by the grocer and pick
                   up the--

      Todd pounces like a panther--

      He suddenly leaps up and grabs Toby by the throat with
      shocking brutality--

                             TODD
                   DON'T CHATTER, BOY! You are not to
                   stop! You are not to speak! You are to
                   deliver this letter! DO YOU
                   UNDERSTAND?!

      Toby is stunned and terrified. It is the first time he has
      seen this side of his friend, Mr. Todd.
      Todd releases him. Toby races out.

      Todd immediately begins pacing like a caged animal, back and
      forth, back and forth, whispering to himself neurotically, as
      day becomes evening...

101   EXT. PIE SHOP -- EVENING                                      101

      Toby walks back to the pie shop, upset.

      He stops when he sees Todd at the window above, unblinking,
      gazing like a falcon into the street.

      He continues on to Mrs. Lovett, who is clearing up the
      remains of a meal in the outdoor garden.

                              MRS. LOVETT
                   Where you been, lad? We had quite the
                   luncheon rush! Me poor bones is ready
                   to drop...
                       (She looks at him, notes
                        his dark expression.)
                   What is it, Toby?

      He sits. She sits next to him.

                             TOBY
                   Mr. Todd sent me on an errand ... And
                   on the way back I went by the
                   workhouse. And I was thinkin' ... But
                   for you I would be there now. Or
                   someplace worse.

      A beat.

                             TOBY
                   Seems like the Good Lord sent you for
                   me.

                             MRS. LOVETT
                   Oh, love, I feel quite the same way--

                             TOBY
                   Hear me out, mum ... You know there's
                   nothing I wouldn't do for you. Say, if
                   there was someone around -- someone
                   bad -- only you didn't know it--

                             MRS. LOVETT
                       (concerned)
                   What is this? What are you talking
                   about?
                             TOBY
                   Nothing's gonna harm you,
                   Not while I'm around.

                             MRS. LOVETT
                   What do you mean, "someone bad"?

                              TOBY
                   Demons are prowling
                   Everywhere
                   Nowadays.

                I got ways.

                          MRS. LOVETT
                Darling, hush now, there's no need for
                this...

                          TOBY
                No one's gonna hurt you,
                No one's gonna dare.
                Others can desert you--
                Not to worry--
                Whistle, I'll be there.
                Demons'll charm you
                With a smile
                For a while,

      Music continues:

                What is this foolishness now? What are
                you talking about?

                          TOBY
                Little things wot I been thinking ...
                About Mr. Todd...

                Not to worry, not to worry,
                I may not be smart but I ain't dumb.
                I can do it,
                Put me to it,
                Show me something I can overcome.
                Not to worry, mum.
      He leans into her, she puts her arms around him, but her
      expression is deeply troubled.

                           TOBY
                Being close and being clever
                Ain't like being true,
                I don't need to,
                I won't never
                Hide a thing from you,
                Like some.

      Music continues as she nervously comforts him:

                Now, Toby dear, haven't we had enough

                ... Here, how about I give you a shiny
                new penny and you can fetch us some
                nice toffees--?

      She pulls Pirelli's chatelaine purse from her dress--

                          TOBY
                That's Signor Pirelli's purse!

                          MRS. LOVETT
                No, no, love -- this is just something
                Mr. T. give me for my birthday--

                           TOBY
                See that proves it -- what I been
                thinkin'--
                    (He stands, urgently
                     pulling her hand)
                We gotta go, ma'am, right now -- we
                gotta find the Beadle and get the law
                here--

      She pulls him down to her again, agitated, her mind racing:

                          MRS. LOVETT
                Hush now, Toby, hush ... Here, you
                just sit next to me nice and quiet ...
                    (calming)
                ... How could you think such a thing
                of Mr. Todd, who's been so good to us?

      He calms down a bit as she holds him.

      And she comes to a painful, dreadful decision.
                          MRS. LOVETT
                Nothing's gonna harm you,
                Not while I'm around.
                Nothing's gonna harm you, darling,

                Nothing's gonna harm you,
                Not while I'm around.

      The music continues as she holds him. There are tears in her
      eyes. But we see that her gentle song has calmed him.

                          TOBY
                    (dreamily)
                Yes, ma'am.

      She quickly dries her eyes and then turns him to look at her.

                          MRS. LOVETT
                    (smiles)
                Well ... no time like the present.

102   INT. BAKEHOUSE STEPS -- EVENING                            102

      Mrs. Lovett leads Toby down the claustrophobic, long stairway
      toward the bakehouse.

                          TOBY
                My heart bleeds for you havin' to go
                up and down all these stairs!

                          MRS. LOVETT
                Well, that'll be your job now.

                          TOBY
                Yes, ma'am!

      She arrives at the heavy iron door to the bakehouse. We can
      hear the seismic rumble of the bake oven within.
      She unbolts the door and ushers Toby in.

      And we finally enter...

103   INT. THE BAKEHOUSE -- EVENING                              103

      A macabre vision of Hell.

      The roof hangs low in this subterranean chamber. The grisly
      tools of her trade are scattered about the place: a large,
      stained chopping block; a meat grinder; buckets of
      questionable viscous liquid; cleavers and bone saws and meat
      hooks; wet sewer grates for the blood.

      A metal sheet, hinged at the top, has been attached to cover
      an opening in the wall: the mouth of the chute from the
      barber shop above.

                                                                   PAGE 101.
103   CONTINUED:                                                  103

      And eeriest of all ... the thundering roar of flame coming
      from a large industrial oven against one wall.

      Toby takes in the cavernous bakehouse:

                             TOBY
                   Coo, quite a stink, ain't there?

      She indicates the sewer grates:

                             MRS. LOVETT
                   Those grates go right down to the
                   sewers and the whiffs come up, always
                   a few rats gone home to Jesus down
                   there.

                             TOBY
                   So -- where do I start?!

      She leads him across to the thrumming, fiery oven:

                             MRS. LOVETT
                   Now this would be the bake oven ...
                   Ten dozen at a time. Always be sure
                   the doors is closed properly, like
                   this.

                             TOBY
                       (trying to remember it
                        all)
                   Yes'm, always closed properly.

      She leads him to the meat grinder:

                             MRS. LOVETT
                   And here's the grinder ...
                       (demonstrates it)
                   ... You pop in the meat, give it a
                   good grind and it comes out here.

                             TOBY
                       (practicing with the
                        grinder)
                   Good grind, comes out there.

                             MRS. LOVETT
                   That's my boy. Smoothly, smoothly --
                   Now I've got to pop upstairs, back in
                   two shakes, all right?

                             TOBY
                   Yes'm.

       She begins to go. He stops her with:

                           TOBY
                 Do you think I might have a pie while
                 I wait?

       She turns. He is standing at a rack of cooling pies.

                           MRS. LOVETT
                 As many as you like, son ... As many
                 as you like.

       She goes and shuts the door behind her.

104    INT. BAKEHOUSE STEPS -- EVENING                            104

       She leans against the bakehouse door, tormented, gasping for
       air. Then she slowly bolts the door.

A120
 105   INT. FOGG'S ASYLUM -- EVENING                              105

       A cacophony of madness. The ragged inmates of the asylum are
       slammed together in a series of cramped cells, the low
       ceiling pressing down.

       We discover Anthony, dressed as a fashionable wigmaker,
       walking past the cells with the odious MR. FOGG. Fogg carries
       a large pair of scissors.

                           FOGG
                 ... Oh yes, sir, I agree it would be
                 to our mutual interest to come to some
                 arrangement in regard to my poor
                 children's hair.

       He moves to one of the cells and unlocks it:
                           FOGG
                 I keep the blondes over here. It was
                 yellow hair you was looking for, sir?

                           ANTHONY
                 Yes.

       Fogg goes into the crowded cell -- the inmates, all blonde
       women, scurry back, clearly terrified of Fogg. Anthony sees
       Johanna, wearing a filthy straitjacket, hunched like a feral
       animal, cowering in a corner of the cell.

                           ANTHONY
                     (points)
                 That one has hair the shade I need.

105   CONTINUED:                                                   105

      Fogg goes to fetch Johanna, hauls her to Anthony:

                             FOGG
                   Come, child. Smile for the gentleman
                   and you shall have a sweetie.

      Johanna's eyes shoot wide when she sees Anthony, but she says
      nothing.

                             FOGG
                       (prepares scissors)
                   Now, where shall I cut?

      Before Fogg can react -- Anthony pulls a revolver from his
      clothing, grabs Johanna and pushes Fogg back into the cell.
      He swings the cell door shut, locking Fogg in.

                             ANTHONY
                   Not a word, Mr. Fogg, or it will be
                   your last ... Now, I leave you to the
                   mercy of your "children."

      He grabs Johanna and pulls her away.

      Mr. Fogg turns. He is locked in with the blonde inmates. They
      slowly begin to advance on him. Menacing. It is likely they
      are going to rip him limb from limb...

106   EXT. PIE SHOP -- EVENING                                      106

      Todd and Mrs. Lovett are hurrying down the stairs from the
      barber shop, urgent. Todd has a razor.

                             MRS. LOVETT
                   ... I got him locked in -- but if he
                   escapes he'll go to the law!
                             TODD
                   Then he can't escape.


                             MRS. LOVETT
                   Mr. T. -- I don't know -- maybe we
                   could--

                             TODD
                   The Judge will be here soon! I have no
                   time, woman! Come on--!

      They turn a corner and walk straight into--

      The Beadle!

                             MRS. LOVETT
                   Excuse me, sir! -- You gave me a
                   fright.

                             BEADLE
                   Not my intention, good madam, though I
                   am here on official business.
                       (elaborately prepares a
                        pinch of snuff)
                   You see, there's been complaints.
                   About the stink from your chimney.
                   They say at night, it's something most
                   foul. Health regulations -- and the
                   general public welfare, naturally --
                   being my duty, I'm afraid I'll have to
                   take a look ...
                       (inhales the snuff,
                        Sneezes and daintily

                   ... at your bakehouse.

                              TODD
                        (smoothly)
                   Of course ... But first why don't you
                   come upstairs and let me attend to
                   you?

                             BEADLE
                   Much as I do appreciate tonsorial
                   adornment, I really ought see to my
                   "official" obligations first.

                             TODD
                   An admirable sentiment -- But I must
                   ask you, out of professional curiosity
                   you understand, is that a cream or a
                   tallow pomade?

                             BEADLE
                       (touches his hair)
                   Oh, not a pomade at all! Me secret is
                   a touch of ambergris.

                             TODD
                   But, sir, hair that delicate requires
                   a genuine pomade! Come along, let me
                   show you the difference.

                              BEADLE
                       (considering)
                   Well ... you are the expert in these
                   matters...

                And we'll finish you off with a nice
                facial rub of bay rum.

                          BEADLE
                Oooh, bay rum is bracing.

                          TODD
                And all on the house, for my friend,
                Beadle Bamford.

                          BEADLE
                Well, sir, I take that very kindly ...
                Lead on.

                          TODD

      He leads the Beadle away.

107   EXT. PIE SHOP -- EVENING                                   107

      From across the street, we see Todd leading the Beadle up the
      stairs to the barber shop, chatting with him easily.

      We realize we are seeing the perspective of the Beggar Woman,
      hunched across the street, watching them closely.

108   INT. BAKEHOUSE -- EVENING                                  108
      Toby is eating a pie as he slowly wanders around the
      bakehouse.

      He stops to consider the many stained cleavers and bone saws,
      curious.

      Then he bites on something hard -- stops -- he reaches into
      his mouth and pulls something out. Looks at it:

      It is a fingernail.

      To be exact, it is the severed tip of a finger.

      Toby drops it in horror and starts back--

      Suddenly, a loud THUMPING and CLANGING makes him spin,
      alarmed--

      As --

      The bloody body of the Beadle EXPLODES SUDDENLY from the
      mouth of the chute--

      Toby screams and races to the door--

      Pulls at it. Locked. No use. He bangs on the heavy iron door
      wildly:

                             TOBY
                   MRS. LOVETT! MRS. LOVETT! LET ME OUT!
                   MRS. LOVETT!

      The thundering roar from the bake oven seems to rise to match
      his frenzy as--

      In panic, Toby races to the sewer grate, yanks it up and
      disappears down into the sewers as the shrill factory whistle
      SCREAMS and we cut to--

109   INT. BARBER SHOP -- EVENING                                   109

      Todd stands by the chair, his razor high--

      His eyes blazing--

      His face covered in a spray of blood--

      Lost in rapture.

      Not for long.

      The Gentleman, the Banker, the General move into the frame
      with purpose, impatient.
      The Gentleman flicks out his handkerchief and begins to clean
      the blood off Todd's face -- he is not gentle, the blood
      smears--

                             GENTLEMAN
                   The engine roared, the motor hissed,
                   And who could see how the road would twist...?

      Meanwhile, the Banker pulls off Todd's stained barber tunic
      and hands Todd his jacket--

                   In Sweeney's ledger the entries matched:

      chair--

                   ...Street!

      Todd sees that more and more of the ghastly specters are
      moving around the room -- multiplying exponentially -- we see
      the TOURIST, the STUDENT, the PRIEST and others.

      They are more intrusive than they have ever been -- touching
      Todd -- eagerly preparing him for the finale of his drama --

                             GHOSTS
                       (variously)
                   Sweeney! Sweeney!
                   Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeney!

      By now the ghosts are fully Furies, demented and threatening--

                             GHOSTS
                   Sweeney!
                   Sweeeeeeneeeeey...!

      The screeching music transforms into a strange symphony of
      inarticulate moans and howls and chants, taking us to...

      Todd and Mrs. Lovett are searching for Toby through a
      horrible catacomb of decaying sewers. Todd carries a razor.
      Their voices echo bizarrely:

                             MRS. LOVETT
                   Toby!
                   Where are you, love?

111   INT. BARBER SHOP -- NIGHT                                     111
      Anthony and Johanna hurry into the barber shop. She is now
      dressed as a scruffy boy, a cap hiding her hair. She is
      distracted and disturbed.

                             ANTHONY
                   Mr. Todd...? No matter. You wait for
                   him here -- I'll return with the coach
                   in less than half an hour...

      She gently touches Todd's collection of razors...

                             ANTHONY
                   Don't worry, darling, in those
                   clothes, no one will recognize you ...
                   You're safe now.

      She picks up the largest razor, looks at it, an eerie echo of
      her father.

                             JOHANNA
                       (darkly ironic)
                   Safe ... So we run away and then all
                   our dreams come true?

                             ANTHONY
                   I hope so...

                             JOHANNA
                   I have never had dreams. Only
                   nightmares.

                             ANTHONY
                   Johanna ... When we're free of this
                   place all the ghosts will go away.

      She looks at him very intensely:

                             JOHANNA
                   No, Anthony, they never go away.

      He gently touches her face.

                             ANTHONY
                   I'll be right back to you ... Half an
                   hour and we'll be free.

      He goes.

      She turns to the window, watches him go. Her expression is
      sad: he will never fully comprehend her depth.

      Then she sees the Beggar Woman approaching from across the
      street...

112   EXT. PIE SHOP -- NIGHT                                       112

      The Beggar Woman begins climbing the stairs to the barber
      shop:

                             BEGGAR WOMAN
                   Beadle ... Beadle ...
                   No good hiding, I saw you!
                   Are you in there still?

113   INT. BARBER SHOP -- NIGHT                                    113

      Johanna hears the Beggar Woman singing, climbing the stairs.

                             BEGGAR WOMAN (V.O.)
                   Beadle ... Beadle...

      Johanna looks around urgently, sees the large chest. She
      quickly climbs into it and shuts the lid as--

      The Beggar Woman enters.

                             BEGGAR WOMAN
                   Beadle dear, Beadle...

      The room has a strange effect on her, as if she were vaguely
      recalling some distant dream. She intones to pretty lullaby
      music...

                             BEGGAR WOMAN
                   Beadle deedle deedle deedle deedle dumpling,
                   Beadle, dumpling, Be-deedle dumpling...

      SUDDENLY--

      Without warning -- like a thunderbolt -- Todd leaps into the
      room--

                             TODD
                   What are you doing here?!

                             BEGGAR WOMAN
                       (clutching at his arm)
                   Ah, evil is here, sir. The stink of
                   evil -- from below -- from her! ...
                       (calling)
                   ... Beadle dear, Beadle!

      He looks anxiously out the window for the Judge:
                             TODD
                   Be quiet, woman!

                             BEGGAR WOMAN
                       (still clutching at him)
                   She's the Devil's wife! Oh, beware
                   her, sir. She with no pity ...
                       (slowing, looking at him
                        more closely)
                    ...in her heart...

                             TODD
                   Out of here! Now!

                    (really peering at him
                     now)
                Hey, don't I know you, mister?

      Todd suddenly sees -- the Judge! -- walking toward the shop--
      Todd has no time--!

      The music THUNDERS as--

      In one brutal motion -- he swings around and grabs his razor -
      - fiercely SLASHES her throat -- tosses her in the chair --
      pulls the lever -- she slides through the floor--

      He pulls the chair back to its normal position just as--

      The Judge enters.

                          JUDGE
                Where is she? Where's the girl?

                          TODD
                Below, your Honor. With my neighbor.
                Thank heavens the sailor did not
                molest her. Thank heavens, too, she
                has seen the error of her ways.

                           JUDGE
                She has?

                          TODD
                Oh yes, sir, your lesson was well
                learned. She speaks only of you,
                longing for forgiveness.

                          JUDGE
                Then she shall have it. She'll be here
                soon, you say?

      The music builds, the pace increases:

                          TODD
                I think I hear her now.

                          JUDGE
                    (excited)
                Oh, excellent, my friend!

                          TODD
                Is that her dainty footstep on the stair?

                          JUDGE
                I hear nothing.

                If possible.

                          JUDGE

                You're in a merry mood again today,

      They sing simultaneously as Todd smoothes bay rum on the
      Judge's face and then reaches for his razor:

                          JUDGE
                Pretty women!

                Blowing out their candles
                Combing out their hair--
                Then they leave--
                Even when they leave you
                And vanish, they somehow
                Can still remain
                There with you there...

                          TODD
                Pretty women!

                Blowing out their candles
                Or combing out their hair,

                Even when they leave,
                They still
                Are there,
                They're there...
      The music builds dangerously as:

                How seldom it is one meets a fellow
                spirit!

                With fellow tastes -- in women, at
                least.

                          JUDGE
                What? What's that?

                          TODD
                The years no doubt have changed me,

                But then, I suppose the face of a
                barber -- the face of a prisoner in
                the dock -- is not particularly
                memorable.

      The factory whistle screams a steady, terrible blast as--

      Todd brutally SLASHES the Judge's throat--

      Severing his jugular--

      The spray of blood drenches Todd--

      He pulls the lever and sends the body tumbling out of sight
      down the chute.

      The music continues...

      As Todd stands for a long moment, blood dripping from his
      face, exalted.

      Then he sinks to his knees, overcome.

      The music stops.

      A long beat of silence.

      Then Todd looks at his razor deeply:
                          TODD
                Rest now, my friend,
                Rest now forever,
                Sleep now the untroubled
                Sleep of the angels.

      Then silence as he reverently sets the razor on the floor and
      looks at it.

      We focus on his face.

      His quest is completed.

      His demons silenced.

      The ghosts are gone.

      It's done.

      He just kneels there. No reason to move. No purpose in life.

      Then...

      A sound from the chest. A slight thump.

      His eyes dart to the chest.

      He slowly picks up his razor and moves to the chest. Then
      suddenly WRENCHES it open and HAULS out Johanna--

                             TODD
                       (darkly)
                   Come for a shave, have you, lad?

                                JOHANNA
                   No -- I...

      He tosses her in the chair, throws back his arm, his razor
      ready--

                             TODD
                   Surely, yes! Everyone needs a good
                   shave--!

      SUDDENLY -- A PIERCING SCREAM ECHOES UP FROM THE CHUTE --
      Mrs. Lovett's voice -- screaming to raise the dead--

      Todd rivets Johanna, pointing the razor at her, a lethal
      warning:

                             TODD
                   Forget my face.
      He spins and bolts out of the shop, leaving her sitting in
      the chair--

114   INT. BAKEHOUSE -- NIGHT                                      114

      Mrs. Lovett is standing in horror by the mouth of the chute.
      The Judge, still barely alive, clutches at her skirt--

      She tries to wrench herself away from his vise-like grip--

                             MRS. LOVETT
                   Die! Die! God in heaven -- die!

      The Judge's fingers finally relax their grip; he is dead.

      Panting, Mrs. Lovett, backs away from him and for the first
      time notices the body of the Beggar Woman.

                             MRS. LOVETT
                   You! Can it be? Have all the demons of
                   Hell come to torment me?!

      She grabs the Beggar Woman and starts dragging her quickly
      toward the oven as Todd races in:

                             TODD
                   Why did you scream? Does the Judge
                   live still?

                             MRS. LOVETT
                   He was clutching, holding on to my
                   dress, but he's finished now...

      She continues quickly dragging the Beggar Woman toward the
      oven.

                             TODD
                   Leave them to me. Open the doors.

      He waves her toward the oven--

                             MRS. LOVETT
                   No! Don't touch her!

                             TODD
                   Open the doors!

      He shoves her toward the oven and leans over to pick up the
      Beggar Woman's body--

                             TODD
                   What's the matter with you? It's only
                   a silly old beggar--
      Then -- Mrs. Lovett opens the oven doors--

      The thundering roar from the oven crashes through the room as
      the fiery light slashes across the floor--

      Clearly illuminating the face of the Beggar Woman.

      A chord of music as Todd realizes who she is. Music continues
      and builds as:

                             TODD
                   Oh no! ... Oh God ... "Don't I know
                   you?" she said ...

      He looks up to Mrs. Lovett:

                         TODD
               You knew she lived. From the moment
               that I came into your shop you knew my
               Lucy lived!

                         MRS. LOVETT
               I was only thinking of you!

                         TODD
                   (looking down again)
               Lucy...

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Your Lucy! A crazy hag picking bones
               and rotten spuds out of alley ashcans!
               Would you have wanted to know she
               ended up like that?

                         TODD
                   (looking up)
               You lied to me...

                         MRS. LOVETT
                   (desperately)
               No, no, not lied at all.
               No, I never lied.

                         TODD
                   (to Beggar Woman)
               Lucy...

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Said she took the poison -- she did --
               Never said that she died --
               Poor thing,
               She lived--
                         TODD
               I've come home again...

                         MRS. LOVETT
               But it left her weak in the head,
               All she did for months was just lie there in bed--

                         TODD
               Lucy...

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Should've been in hospital,
               Wound up in Bedlam instead,
               Poor thing!

                    (passionately)
                Yes, I lied 'cos I love you!

                I'd be twice the wife she was!
                I love you!
                Could that thing have cared for you
                Like me?

                          TODD
                    (a harrowing keen)
                WHAT HAVE I DONE?!

      Todd's eyes suddenly snap up to Mrs. Lovett -- as the
      glorious "Little Priest" waltz theme returns--

                          TODD
                Mrs. Lovett,
                You're a bloody wonder,
                Eminently practical and yet
                Appropriate as always,
                As you've said repeatedly,
                There's little point in dwelling on the past.

      He steps toward her, she steps back, unsure, as they sing
      simultaneously:

                           TODD
                No, come here, my love...
                Not a thing to fear,
                My love...
                What's dead
                Is dead.

                          MRS. LOVETT
                Do you mean it?
                Everything I did I swear I thought
                Was only for the best,
                Believe me!
                    (a heartbreaking plea)
                Can we still be
                Married?

      Todd steps toward her darkly.

      She knows she is doomed.

      But steps into his arms anyway for a final, triumphant waltz:

                          TODD
                The history of the world, my pet--

                          MRS. LOVETT
                    (through tears)
                Oh, Mr. Todd,
                Ooh, Mr. Todd,
                Leave it to me...

                          TODD
                Is learn forgiveness and try to forget.

                          MRS. LOVETT
                    (the lost dream)
                By the sea, Mr. Todd,
                We'll be comfy-cozy,
                By the sea, Mr. Todd,
                Where there's no one nosy...

      He waltzes her toward the roaring oven.

      She offers no resistance, fully aware of what's coming.

      The blazing, thundering inferno of the oven makes it seem
      they are the damned, dancing through Hell.

                          TODD
                And life is for the alive, my dear,
                So let's keep living it--!

                          BOTH
                Just keep living it,
                Really living it--!

      The music reaches a thundering crescendo as--

      He flings her into the oven and slams the doors--

      We hear her screaming. And banging on the oven doors.

      Todd sinks to his knees and covers his ears desperately as
      the banging and screaming and music finally fade to silence.

      Then he slowly drags himself across the floor to the Beggar
      Woman.

      He cradles her head in his arms.

                          TODD
                There was a barber and his wife,
                And she was beautiful.
                A foolish barber and his wife,
                She was his reason and his life.
                And she was beautiful.
                And she was virtuous.
                And he was...


      Todd folds himself over his dead wife.

      The only sound his deep, anguished sobs.

      A long beat.

      Then he becomes aware of something. He looks over to see....

      Toby -- staring at him from the open sewer grate. He has seen
      everything.

      Todd watches as Toby silently pulls himself up. Todd gently
      sets Lucy down and then, still kneeling, turns to face Toby.

      A long beat as they look at each other.

      Then Toby slowly moves and carefully picks up Todd's razor.

      Todd looks at him.

      Then slowly unbuttons his collar and exposes his neck.

      He bends his head back, offering his naked throat.

      Toby slowly goes to him and methodically slits his throat.
      Todd continues to gaze up at Toby as we hear the lonely sound
      of wind escaping from his severed wind pipe.

      Then Toby turns and leaves the bakehouse.

      Todd leans forward, dying.

      We cut to his point-of-view:

      The rough brick floor...

      From the bottom of the frame...

      A dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up
      the frame ... the fiery glow from the bake oven reflected in
      the blood...

      Finally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame.

      We realize this is the first image we saw in the story.
      Todd's perspective. Todd's blood. As he dies.

      As before, the Gentleman's face appears, reflected in the
      pool of blood...

                          GENTLEMAN
                Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd,
                His skin was pale and his eye was odd.

      The Banker emerges from the shadows of the bakehouse...

                          BANKER
                He shaved the faces of gentlemen
                Who never thereafter were heard of again.

      The General emerges ... and the Tourist ... and the Priest
      ... and the Student...

                He trod a path that few have trod,
                Did Sweeney Todd,
                The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

      Then a new ghost ... a face we recognize ... the Beggar
      Woman...

                          BEGGAR WOMAN
                He kept a shop in London town,
                Of fancy clients and good renown.

      She is joined by the Judge...
                          JUDGE
                And what if none of their souls were saved?
                They went to their maker impeccably shaved.

      The Beadle and Pirelli join the ghosts...

                Swing your razor wide, Sweeney!
                Hold it to the skies!
                Freely flows the blood of those
                Who moralize!

      The ghosts move around the bakehouse, considering the meat
      grinder and stained cleavers and chopping block...

                          GHOSTS

                His needs are few, his room is bare.
                He hardly uses his fancy chair.
                The more he bleeds, the more he lives.
                He never forgets and he never forgives.
                Perhaps today you gave a nod
                To Sweeney Todd.
                The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

      Hunting like predators, we begin to move urgently through the
      ghosts. Their long shadows tower bizarrely against the walls
      and ceiling of the bakehouse. The fiery red roar of the bake
      oven builds in intensity...

                          GHOSTS
                    (variously)
                Sweeney wishes the world away,
                Sweeney's weeping for yesterday,
                Hugging the blade, waiting the years,
                Hearing the music that nobody hears.
                Sweeney waits in the parlor hall,
                Sweeney leans on the office wall.
                No one can help, nothing can hide you--
                Isn't that Sweeney there beside you?
                Sweeney wishes the world away,
                Sweeney's weeping for yesterday,
                Is Sweeney!
                There he is, it's Sweeney!
                Sweeney! Sweeney!

      We tear through them with increasing frenzy -- cutting
      quickly, vertiginous angles -- as the music builds--
                          GHOSTS
                    (variously)
                There! There! There! There!
                There! There! There!
                    (almost a scream now)
                There!

      They move away--

      Revealing--

      Todd and Mrs. Lovett. Facing each other.

      We circle them:

                          GHOSTS
                Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd!
                He served a dark and a hungry god!

                          TODD
                    (sharply to Mrs. Lovett)
                To seek revenge may lead to hell.

                          MRS. LOVETT
                    (coldly to him)
                But everyone does it, if seldom as well--

                          TODD AND MRS. LOVETT
                --As Sweeney...

                          GHOSTS
                As Sweeney Todd...
                The Demon Barber of Fleet...

      The ghosts begin to disappear ... fading into the shadows of
      the bakehouse ... leaving Todd and Mrs. Lovett alone...

                          GHOSTS
                ... Street!

      The febrile music continues as Todd and Mrs. Lovett stand
      alone, continuing to glare at each other.

      Finally she gives him a grim little smile and disappears into
      the darkness.

      He stands alone.

      And we cut to--

      A series of images from earlier in our story, cut to the music --
      Todd's life flashing before his eyes --

      The images building as the music races toward its conclusion--

      Todd singing -- slashing -- smiling -- striding--

      The final crash of music at the final image:

      Todd kneeling, hunched over the pool of blood on the
      bakehouse floor.

      He falls...

      Into the blood.

      Dead.

FADE IN:





INT. BUS STATION - DAY


SUPERIMPOSE:     17 YEARS AGO



Small, Canadian, rural. Just the Native American CASHIER
jotting down sports stats from the paper. MARTIN, 16,
enters. Slight, pale and frail, new clothes, a tag still
hangs from his stiff work jacket. Martin stands in front
of the Cashier a beat. Nervously tugs an earlobe.

                         MARTIN

           Sir. Sir, may I have a ticket to
           Montreal please?

                           CASHIER

           Pardon?

                         MARTIN

           I need a ticket to Montreal.

                           CASHIER

           Montreal?

                            MARTIN

           Yes, sir.     Please.

                         CASHIER

           Forty-three dollars.
Martin pulls out an envelope filled with crisp twenties
and carefully counts out three. The Cashier gives Martin
his ticket and change. Points at a bus outside. The
DRIVER loading bags.




INT. BUS - DAY

A half dozen PASSENGERS. Martin steps aboard, takes a
seat. DAN SOULSBY, Martin's age, sits next to him,
offers a hand. Martin shakes.

                           DAN

           Dan Soulsby.

                            MARTIN

           Martin.     Nice to meet you.

                         DAN

           Where you heading to?

                         MARTIN

           Away from here.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                       2.





CONTINUED:




Dan produces a couple beers from his pockets.     Offers
Martin one.

                            MARTIN

             Pisswater.

                           DAN

             At least it's cold pisswater.
             Here's to getting away.
They CLINK CANS. The Driver enters the bus. Unlocks the
airbrakes. Puts the bus in reverse, gives it gas.
BOOM! The ENGINE throws a rod. Horrible GRINDING.
Smoke wafts into the windows. The Driver KILLS the
ENGINE. Silence. Martin and Dan trade looks.

                           DAN

             That was bad.
                     (bummed)
             It's gonna take all day to get
             another bus here.
Martin sighs, looks out the window.




WHAT MARTIN SEES

A car rental place.







BACK TO SCENE

Martin fingers the envelope of cash in his pocket.

                           MARTIN

             You have a license?

                             DAN

             Had one.    They took it away.

                            MARTIN

             I got one.   Let's go.




INT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Dan drives. JOURNEY ON the RADIO. Martin checks out
Dan's guitar. Dan shows Martin his teeth.

                             DAN

             See that?    They're all fake.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                 3.





CONTINUED:





                           MARTIN

             You take a hockey puck in the
             face?




                           DAN

             A fist. My stepdad socked me. I
             flew across the room and dented
             the sheetrock in the kitchen. My
             mom saw everything and still took
             his side.

                           MARTIN

             You got cracked good.

                           DAN

             I hate that guy. Two hundred
             pounds of worthless grease.

                           MARTIN

             Why'd he hit you?

                           DAN

             I wrecked his sixty-five Mustang
             and his boat in the same week.
             His babies. I totaled them.

                           MARTIN

             I would have popped you too.

                           DAN

             It was worth it. But I didn't
             deserve the tour in hell.
Dan rubs his close-cropped hair.

                           DAN

             Don't ever go to military school
             if you can help it. It sucks.
                     (a beat)
             I jumped the wall two days ago.

                           MARTIN

             You going back?

                           DAN

             I'm done with that racket. I'm
             going to Seattle and playing
             music.
Martin tries the guitar, he's not that good.

                           MARTIN

             I know some chords.

                           DAN

             Think you can learn drums?




                                                       4.





INT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - DAY




The land rolls endlessly. Martin drives.      Dan plays his
guitar. He's really good.

                        DAN

          I'm the next Billy Squire. Krokus
          will be opening for me one day.
POW! The CAR HITS a BOTTLE. A front tire deflates.
Martin guides the crippled vehicle to the curb.




EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The middle of nowhere.    Martin flips a coin.    Heads.

                          DAN

          Shit.
Dan hauls the spare from the trunk.      Sets the jack under
the bumper.
A PICKUP TRUCK approaches.      Still a mile away.
Martin watches Dan lean in the trunk for the tire iron.
The pickup gets closer, a big one.      Heavy with bags of
animal feed. Speeding.
Martin looking at Dan's back. Martin shoves Dan hard,
into the highway. In front of:







THE GRILL OF THE PICKUP

WHAM! It plasters Dan. He goes over the hood, SHATTERS
the front WINDSHIELD. Bounces off, spins like a rag doll
into a ditch.
The pickup has lost control, it rolls.      Several times, a
heaving mass of steel.
CRASH! The TRUCK folds itself around a husky tree.         No
survivors, that's clear.




MARTIN

He can't believe what he has just done.       He takes in the
carnage, tugs at his ear.




EXT. MONTREAL - DAY


SUPERIMPOSE:   PRESENT DAY

ESTABLISHING the river-bound city.      Beautiful.




                                                      5.





EXT. ST. LAWRENCE RIVER - DAY




A large Ferry plies the unstoppable waters.     Gliding
toward skyscrapers.







EXT. FERRY PIER - DAY

The signs in French. Crowded with PASSENGERS waiting to
board. As more PASSENGERS pour off the just-docked ship.
A WOMAN runs through the crowd. Terror etched in her
face. She knocks aside several PEOPLE. Runs toward a
row of restaurants. Even in her turmoil, she is
patrician, elegant.







EXT. PIER-SIDE CAFE - DAY

Two BEAT COPS eat at an outdoor table.   Laid back.    The
WOMAN approaches them, frantic.

                        WOMAN

          I just saw my dead son get off the
          ferry.
The COPS trade looks.

                         WOMAN

          Listen to me; he's been dead
          eighteen years. He just walked
          right past me.




INT. MONTREAL PD OFFICE - DAY

An INSPECTOR pours the Woman tea. She has calmed down.
He takes his pen, looking at her statement.

                        WOMAN

          You need to open that grave.   It
          can't be my son in there.
A beat.

                        INSPECTOR

          I lost my mother two years ago.
          Every day I think I see her.
          Driving to work in the car next to
          me. At mass. Shopping, I see
          her, but this is someone else's
          mother. You see?
The Woman lays a hand on his arm, looks him in the eye.
There is something formidable about her.

                           WOMAN

             Inspector, I'm saddened by your
             loss and touched by loyalty. But
             let's focus on the matter at hand.
             He walked right past me. We made
             eye contact. I know he recognized
             me. It was my son. A mother
             knows these things. I will sign
             anything, I will swear before a
             judge. And thank you, I do have
             all my faculties and friends who
             can vouch for my character.

                           INSPECTOR

             Did you talk to this man, he is a
             man now?

                           WOMAN

             Yes. Of course he's a man. He'd
             be thirty-two. And no, I did not
             speak with him. I ran.
                     (low, serious)
             Inspector, my son was very, very
             disturbed. He had serious
             emotional problems. I assure you
             he was.
                     (a beat)
             Is. Is a dangerous person.
He hands her some forms.

                           INSPECTOR

             Madame. The police department
             cannot resolve your problem. You
             need to get permits from the
             coroner and health and safety
             department. You pay for an
             exhumation. You have someone
             qualified examine the remains. If
             it is the wrong body, the Forensic
             Examiner will confirm there is a
             problem and call us. Then we open
             an investigation.
                     (a beat)
             No, Quebec City police will
             investigate. He is buried there,
             no?
The Woman bristles.     Stands, takes the forms.

                            WOMAN

             No.   Inspector. He is not.

EXT. FOREST CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY




Deep woods. In the mountains. Near a roaring river.        A
log vacation cabin is being erected by CONSTRUCTION

WORKERS.




A BACK HOE digs a trench. The scoop snags something -- a
wetsuit -- worn by a long dead corpse, twirling slowly,
hanging from the bucket's steel teeth. The BACK HOE
OPERATOR jumps off the huge machine, stares at the
headless body he has just dragged from its grave.
Workers gather and gawk.

                        WORKER

INSPECTOR LAVAL and INSPECTOR REYNAUD, rock solid French

DARKNESS

We hear BREATHING and the SOFT RUSH of a RIVER.        Soft,

Two eyes open, reflect moonlight.      The FOOTSTEPS drawing
closer.

EXT. FOREST CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

GRACE VANDERHOLT lies in the grave where the body was
discovered. It has been excavated by criminologists, the
soil sifted, the grass and brush removed. Grace sits up.
Grace holds out her FBI creds, shielding her eyes from
the bright light.

Grace lays back down. Sighs. Concentrates on the
sounds. The RIVER. WIND in the trees. Then: LAUGHTER

(O.S.).





                           GRACE

             Would you mind trading one liners
             somewhere else? I need to hear
             the natural sounds. I appreciate
             it.
The policemen have gathered in a chummy knot.    Laval
gestures for them to walk down the road.




ON GRACE

She steps out of the grave. Sits by it. Writes some
notes. Everything glistens in the moonlight, alive.
Grace takes it in for a beat.
Then:   HOWLING, the lonely song of a distant WOLF.
Grace rises, crosses to the river, to a big gravel bar.
Used as a campsite complete with a large fire pit. Grace
sits by the fire pit.
More HOWLING, CLOSER this time.
Grace looks down river, SEES the glowing eyes of a TIMBER
WOLF staring from a clump of trees. The animal stares a
beat, then runs off. Grace has the chills.
Grace walks quietly toward the trees. Grace just a few
feet away. RUSTLING. She cautiously moves aside a
sapling.







EXT. RIVERBANK - GRACE'S FLASHLIGHT - NIGHT

A TIMBER WOLF nestled amidst the trees gnaws on
something; a HUMAN HEAD.




EXT. RIVERBANK - NIGHT

Grace stands there alone, the wolf is long gone. She
stoops, pushes aside brush. She finds a hollow under
some roots. Grace CLICKS on her FLASHLIGHT.




WHAT SHE SEES

A human skull stares up from the hollow.     Picked clean,
weathered.




                                                     10.





EXT. DIRT ROAD IN THE FOREST - NIGHT




Laval and Reynaud, and the two UNIFORMS smoke and joke.
A quiet beat as the WIND picks up. Their cars up the
road in the b.g.



SOMETHING MOVES in the woods.   Inspector Reynaud draws
his Glock. SHUSHES the men.
A beat. MOVEMENT. Laval signals for the men to spread
out. Holsters are UNSNAPPED. Reynaud is all eyes and
ears as he picks his way toward the trees.
GRACE emerges from the trees, a laser-aiming dot on her
forehead. She REACTS to Reynaud, raises her hands.

                        GRACE

          Don't shoot, I'm on your team.
Reynaud holsters his gun.   The men relax.   Grace takes
Inspector Laval aside.

                        GRACE

          Call who you have to call.   I
          found his head.
Laval REACTS.




INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

Gloved hands carefully remove the skull from a box. The
MEDICAL EXAMINER places the skull on an exam table and
begins cleaning it.
Grace walks around the headless body. The wetsuit has
been removed, the body has been autopsied. Headless,
skeletal hands, the legs are surprisingly well-preserved.
DIRECTOR GILLET is tall, heavy, smoking a cigar.    He's a
cop's cop and all-around nice guy.

                        DIRECTOR GILLET

          I can't tell you how excited we
          are to have you here.

                         GRACE

          You only have one victim. Usually
          there's two or three by the time I
          get called in.

                        DIRECTOR GILLET

          This case made page one of the
          Globe. The tabloids say there is
          a headhunter on the loose.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET (CONT'D)

             The Mayor wants closure. That's
             his vacation house they were
             building. I get calls from
             supervisors I didn't know I had.

                           GRACE

             You clear the Mayor?

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             We cleared the Mayor. He read the
             article on you in Newsweek and
             insisted we fly you up. The
             papers say two campers had a
             drunken fight and the loser lost
             his head.

                           GRACE

             What do you think?

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             I don't solve crimes anymore, I
             balance budgets.

                           GRACE

             This was not a heat of the moment
             killing. And the victim was
             buried complete with head. The
             grave was five-foot ten. The
             victim's height. With square
             corners. Dug with a shovel the
             killer had the foresight to bring.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Thirty-five detectives searched
             the area Saturday. My
             investigators think you're a
             witch.

                           GRACE

             I've been called worse.
The Medical Examiner finds two small holes in the skull,
waves the PHOTOGRAPHER over.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Jeez. Look at that, looks like he
             got ice-picked.
She simulates fangs with her hands, they match marks on
the skull.

                           GRACE

             No. A large canine did that.
             Probably an old or sick timber
             wolf that couldn't hunt. It dug
             up the body and chewed off the
             head. It felt safe in the trees,
             away from the riverbank, away from
             the other wolves.
The Medical examiner looks at a chewed vertebrate.

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER

             I'd say you're right.
                     (into tape recorder)
             Postmortem scavenger damage to C-1.
The Medical Examiner examines the skull's teeth.

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER

             The victim was afraid of dentists.
             Bad teeth.
Inspectors Laval and Reynaud enter. Both give Grace wary
nods. Inspector Laval hands the Medical Examiner a paper
bag marked HUMAN REMAINS.

                            INSPECTOR LAVAL

             This was a meter from the skull.
             At soil level.
The Medical Examiner opens the bag. Removes a wig. No,
not a wig; someone's ponytail and leathered scalp.
Tangled with the hair is a braid of green nylon cord tied
to two pieces of broomstick. The Photographer SNAPS some
shots.
The Medical Examiner gingerly untangles the cord.

                             MEDICAL EXAMINER

             Look at this.
Grace crosses, grins.      Grace studies the cord, noting the
intricate knots.

                            GRACE

             Bingo.   That's your murder weapon.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             It might be trash a camper left.

                           GRACE

             No. Look at it, braided parachute
             cord, two pieces of broom stick.
             You approach the victim from
             behind, loop it around his head
             and hold on for all your might.
             The more the victim struggles, the
             quicker he passes out. And now
             you have convenient handles to
             drag around two hundred pounds of
             dead kayaker.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             That is a theory.

                           GRACE

             That's exactly what it is. A
             theory. That evidence supports.
             When the suspect is in custody you
             can ask him yourself what happened
             and you won't need me. Inspector.
Laval bristles, he crosses to check his cell messages.
Gillet looks at Grace, at the cord. Turns to her
quietly.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Laval and Reynaud are my stars.
             Very smart, very persistent
             investigators. On the street;
             they're magnificent.

                           GRACE

             I can see that Director.   You're
             lucky to have them.
A beat.

                           GRACE

             Go ahead, Director, say what you
             have to say.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             You're the expert. If you have
             any suggestions on how to
             proceed...

                           GRACE

             Sure. A forensic anthropologist
             can draw the victim's face based
             on the skull. I know someone at
             Quantico who can do it by
             tomorrow.

             Call 'em. Then show the results
             to everybody around who was
             selling outdoor goods two years
             ago. You have his initials; MRC,
             inside the wetsuit. The long hair
             is distinctive, someone may
             recognize him. It's a semi-long
             shot.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             No, that's bread and butter
             detective work. Thank you.
                     (checks his watch)
             We should get upstairs.
They cross to the exit. Director Gillet barks orders in
FRENCH at his two-star Inspectors.




INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY

Photos, maps, newspaper articles cover the walls.
Twenty-four Hour News ON a TV. Six DETECTIVES man the
phones. ROOKIES fetch reports, pour coffee.







INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The long table is crowded. Inspectors Laval and Reynaud.
Three more POLICE OFFICIALS. A pair of CITY COUNCILMEN.
Grace sits next to Gillet.

                           COUNCILMAN #1

             You found the skull. Incredible.

                           GRACE

             I had a case once where wild dogs
             had removed remains.

                           COUNCILMAN #2

             So I can tell my people there
             isn't a headhunter running around
             the wilds of Quebec?

                           GRACE

             No headhunters, sir.   However, a
             killer is out there.

                           COUNCILMAN #1

             Director Gillet. Do you have the
             victim identified?




                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             No name yet, sir. We have someone
             from the University recreating his
             face from the skull.

                           COUNCILMAN #1

             Why, after two years, has nobody
             reported him missing?

                           GRACE

             He wasn't missed. He had no
             family, or moved often. He had
             the musculature of a serious
             outdoorsman. He spent a lot of
             time in his kayak.

                           COUNCILMAN #1

             The big question is who killed
             him.

                           GRACE

             Always is, sir. I can give you a
             rough profile; white male, thirty
             to thirty-four. Has some college
             but no degree. Neat in
             appearance. At least six feet
             tall. Very intelligent. Charming
             when necessary. He uses murder as
             a tool, probably in furtherance of
             a criminal endeavor. He's killed
             before and will again unless
             caught.
Laval and Reynaud write furiously.     Gillet is impressed.
As are the Councilmen.

                           COUNCILMAN #1

             We really appreciate the FBI
             sending you. When can we expect
             your report?

                           GRACE

             A couple days, sir.

Laval has declared peace.      Grace smiles.   Reynaud still
keeps his distance.




INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A very nice bed and breakfast. Grace enters and finds
her luggage waiting. She loves the room. Antiques, art.
Grace finds a bottle of wine and a note from Gillet. She
smiles. Grace checks the mini fridge; bingo. Cracks a
Moosehead. Her CELL RINGS.

                     (filtered)
             We named the victim; Curtis
             Kohler. The forensic dentist just

             No. K-O-H-L-E-R. The initials

             Company. Kohler worked there as a
             guide three years ago. The owner
             remembers him because he stole the
             wetsuit.

Grace hangs up. Makes notes on the sketch.       Slips it
into a picture frame.




INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY

Grace, Reynaud and Laval look through a haystack of
computer printouts for needles of information. Grace
stretches. Grabs a donut from a box. Offers the box to
Laval.

                           GRACE

             Fruit of the Gods. You know you
             want one.
Laval gives in, takes a plain cake. She offers donuts to
Reynaud. He rubs his eyes, shoves aside papers, quietly
to Laval:

             good food. We are inviting you.
             Please.
Grace grabs her jacket and an armful of reports.

Locals only. The Inspector's favorite spot, they are
like family here. Grace, Laval and Reynaud at a table in
back. Covered with reports and plates. Grace stops
reading. Tosses aside a printout.

             So before he died he got his
             paychecks, paid his taxes.
             Patronized sporting goods stores.
             And had long spending gaps where
             he was enjoying the great
             outdoors. That pattern continues
             a year after his death. He gets
             some paychecks. Rents an
             apartment. Buys a three thousand
             dollar kayak. Pays his taxes.
             Dead and buried and still paying
             his taxes. Then everything stops.
             Last Visa charge was to
             Travelocity for a plane ticket to
             Mexico city.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Dead men don't pay their bills.
             It's identity theft.

                           GRACE

             This isn't someone renting limos
             and fancy dinners on someone
             else's credit. Lifestyle and
             habits don't change.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Computer error?

                           GRACE

             Too many independent systems.

                            INSPECTOR LAVAL

                     (beat)
             We work organized crime sometimes,
             maybe a hit man wanted to lay low.
             He assumed the life of a civilian
             until things cooled off.

                           GRACE

             You really think a gangster is
             going to break his stride and
             become a long hair groovy river
             guide? Inspector, this guy's
             whole life has been stolen.
             Someone killed him and became him.
             Down to profession and taste in
             clothing.
Laval and Reynaud trade looks.




                                                     19.





INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (HOURS LATER)




The lights are still on, Grace has fallen asleep on her
bed, still in her clothes, paperwork everywhere. Case
photos now fill the picture frames, cover the walls, even
on the ceiling. KNOCKING at the door. Grace stirs.



Crosses to the door, groggy. She checks the peephole.
Cracks the door. It's Inspector Laval.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          You are a heavy sleeper.

                        GRACE

          You're everywhere. What's up,
          Laval?

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          A man was killed tonight.
          Attacked from behind. Asphyxiated
          with a nylon cord with handles.
          And there's a witness. Or a
          suspect. We're not sure yet. We
          should go.




EXT. PARKING LOT CRIME SCENE (DOWNTOWN MONTREAL) -


NIGHT (4:00 AM)

Cop cars everywhere. Crime scene tape. The Coroner's
van. A couple NEWS CAMERAMEN. Grace crossing with
Laval.
Reynaud places a HANDCUFFED MAN in workout gear in the
back of a cop car.

                         INSPECTOR LAVAL

          That's him.   He says he saw the
          killer.
Reynaud SLAPS the cop car, it quickly drives away. Grace
and Laval arrive at a BODY dressed in sweats. A gym bag
nearby. A pair of UNIFORMS stand guard as a CRIMINALIST
processes the body. Thirty-ish, healthy, his generic
looks marred by bulging, bruised eyes. Face bruised.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          Meet Mr. Todd Ford.
Grace squats by the body. CLICKS on her Mag-Lite and
inspects the victim. Bruises on his neck.

                        GRACE

          He's still warm.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                        20.

Grace shines her flashlight along the corpse.      A couple
hairs glow in the strong light beam.

                           GRACE

             Want to get those?
The Criminalist takes a lint roller, collects the hairs.

                            GRACE

             Where is it?

                            INSPECTOR LAVAL

             There.   Under his car.
Grace shines her light under a car. A garrote is there,
made of broomsticks and knotted nylon cord.

                            GRACE

             Holy shit.   Has Le Directeur been
             notified?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             I'm letting the poor man sleep a
             couple more minutes.
                     (pointing things
                      out)
             Twenty-four hour gym is there,
             next door. He has a membership
             card in his wallet. That's his
             car. Car keys.
Grace looks around the garage.      Taking it all in.
Getting a feel for the scene.
She carefully examines the victim's car with her
flashlight. The door has been brushed with black print
dust.




INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICES - NIGHT (4:43 AM)

Director Gillet sips bad coffee in a rumpled suit and T-
shirt. Looking through a two-way mirror. Grace, Reynaud
are with him.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Is that our killer?

                           GRACE

             Maybe. So far he checks out as an
             art dealer from Winnipeg.




                                                     21.





INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT




JOHN COSTA, 33, sits at the small table. Glasses,
moppish hair. Laval sits across from him. Costa is
sincere, and frightened.




                        COSTA

          I walk out of the gym. Walk to my
          car. I'm unlocking it and I hear
          a scuffle, a fight. Over by this
          car I see this guy getting choked
          from behind and I shouted.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          What did you shout?

                        COSTA

          'Stop.' I ran towards them. Then
          the person doing the choking lets
          go and pointed a gun at me and
          ran. I'm so stupid. I could of
          been shot. I called the police
          gave him CPR until the paramedics
          came.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          You touched him?

                         COSTA

          Of course.   I was giving him CPR.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          You removed the Garrote?

                        COSTA

          The thing around his neck? Yes.
          I took it off, it was choking him.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          Did you see where the attacker
          went?

                          COSTA

          Away from me.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          What kind of gun did he have?

                        COSTA

                  (frustrated)
          The kind that puts really big
          holes in people.

                          INSPECTOR LAVAL

          Was it black?    Was it silver?

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                         22.

                           COSTA

             Black.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Okay, see? I am getting information.
             He had a large black handgun.

                           COSTA

             Listen to me. I can draw a
             picture of his face. I saw him.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             You want to draw a picture?

                          COSTA

             A sketch. I can sketch him.     I'm
             very good.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             How could you see his face in the
             dark?
A beat. Costa realizing he is under suspicion.        He leans
forward, looks Inspector Laval in the eye.

                           COSTA

             I did not do this. I saw two guys
             fighting and should of ran the
             other way but I didn't.
                     (as if to a child)
             You need to find the person who
             killed this man.
                     (in French)
             You need to find the guy who did
             this.




INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICES - NIGHT

Grace doesn't like the turn.

                           GRACE

             You need to confirm he's a suspect
             or clear him and kick-start a
             manhunt based on Costa's ID. If
             he is a legit witness, he'll get
             heated up and start forgetting
             details. I think there's a way to
             clear him without pissing him off.
             May I?

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Please.

                                                (CONTINUED)

Grace KNOCKS on the Interview room door.

                            GRACE

             Inspector.   I need a moment with
             you.
Laval exits the room, shutting the door behind them. A
ROOKIE hands Director Gillet a cup of coffee and a new
dress shirt wrapped in plastic.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             I was getting into his mind.

                           GRACE

             I have a shortcut. Can you get
             any of his school transcripts?

                            INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Sure.   It's all on-line.
Grace takes an evidence bag containing the garrote from
the latest crime scene. She drops it in her computer
bag.
Grabs a case file.

                            GRACE

             Call the Winnipeg Police and have
             them fax or e-mail his driver's
             license photo.
Grace crosses, opens the door, enters.




INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

John Costa smiles at Grace as she enters.        Sets her bag
on the floor. The case file on the desk.

                            COSTA

             I hope you guys are playing bad
             cop smart cop.

                          GRACE

             Sorry. I'm the dumb one. Agent
             Vanderholt. Call me Grace.
They shake.    She slides typing paper and a pencil over to
Costa.

                           COSTA

             Thank you. He had these real
             intense eyes.

Costa about to start drawing.

                           GRACE

             Hold on. Before you do that, I
             need some personal information
             from you. Can you write down the
             name of the elementary school you
             attended? And your elementary
             school teachers, as many as you
             can remember.
Costa looking at Grace a beat.

                           COSTA

             Are you kidding me? Lady, I saw
             someone get killed tonight and
             you're asking me about grade
             school?

                           GRACE

             I apologize, I know it's random,
             but it's the best way you can help
             me.

                           COSTA

             I don't remember any of that.

                           GRACE

             Please, Mr. Costa. You'd be
             surprised.

                           COSTA

                     (writing)
             I attended two. Holy Trinity and
             Mother of Good Counsel. I
             remember Sister Bernard. And. I
             don't know, Father Jeffrey. Mr.
             Johansen. Oh, and Mrs. Sebastien,
             she had a glass eye.

                            GRACE

             May I?
She takes the list of names. She tips over her briefcase
with her foot, the evidence bag spills out. Costa
glances at the garrote, REACTS.

                            COSTA

             Omigod.   That's it, isn't it?

                            GRACE

             That's what?

Costa looking at Grace, realizes it's a mind game.




                           COSTA

             I told the other guy, I'll tell
             you. I did not do this. Grace.
             I saw who did this and I can show
             you what he looks like and you can
             go catch him.
Costa is unambiguously sincere. Grace's attitude softens
a bit. She tucks the garrote back in her bag.

                           GRACE

             Go ahead and draw the face of the
             man you saw.
Costa draws a simple smiley face.     He shows her.

                           GRACE

             We'll get an artist to help you.

                           COSTA

             I can draw him, thank you.
Grace crosses to the door.     Costa begins drawing in
earnest.




INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICES - NIGHT

Grace emerges from the interrogation room. Reynaud hands
her a printout of Costa's school records. Grace checking
Costa's list against his transcripts.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             You left a file in there.

                          GRACE

             I know. See if he tries to peek
             in it. The real killer couldn't
             resist. He'll want to know what
             we know.
Laval watches Costa.







INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Costa draws with skilled hands, delicate but strong.      The

                        GRACE

          Can you remember any of your grade
          school teachers? He remembered
          three.
A Rookie crosses with a photo, hands it to Laval.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          Here's his provincial driver's
          license photo. He's checking out.
Laval shows Grace the photo.   It is definitely Costa.    A
beat.

                        GRACE

          Have a nurse take a DNA sample.
          Just to make sure his DNA isn't in
          the victim's car or anything
          weird.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          We'll run the tests.




INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Costa has finished the sketch. He holds it up to the
mirror, for those he assumes are watching.
REFLECTED in the two-way mirror is COSTA'S SKETCH.   Cold
piercing eyes, chiseled features.
The door opens, expecting Grace, Costa is disappointed to
see a tough-looking PARAMEDIC unwrapping a cotton swab.

          CWE? Whose initials?   Not the
          victim's.

                        MEDICAL EXAMINER

          No. I called the school and had
          someone find them in a yearbook.
          Here's the original owner's name.
          But it could have been through a
          dozen pawn shops since then.
He hands her a piece of paper.   Grace has a big smile.

                        GRACE

          Doctor, can I take you back to
          Quantico with me?

                        MEDICAL EXAMINER

          Sorry. I must remain where the
          hockey is good.
Grace hands the paper to Reynaud.




EXT. MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICES - DAY

Reynaud and Grace crossing through the parking lot.

                         INSPECTOR REYNAUD

                   (into radio, subtitled
                    French)
          This is Special Unit Fourteen. I
          want a complete name search.
          Clark William. Surname is
          Edwards.

CONTINUED:





                           GRACE

             Inspector Reynaud. Can we swing
             by the crime scene before we head
             back?



Reynaud nods:     yes.    They get in his unmarked car.




EXT. PARKING LOT CRIME SCENE - DAY

Tape still up. The 24 Hour gym is closed for the day.
Grace looking around. Laval studies a shrine of candles
on the sidewalk.
Grace sneaks up on him. She gets real close.       Laval
watches the candles burn.

                            GRACE

             Inspector.
Laval startles.

                           GRACE

             C'mere a second, please.
They cross to the victim's car.

                           GRACE

             Borrow your keys? Stand there
             like you're going to choke me.
Grace pantomimes unlocking the door, drops the keys and
reaches for her throat.

                           GRACE

             Keys drop straight down, how'd
             they end up over there under that
             car?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             They were kicked. During the
             struggle.

                           GRACE

                     (points)
             Okay. Kick them as hard as you
             can that way.
Laval looks at her, kicks his keys.

                           GRACE

             Not even halfway.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         29.





CONTINUED:




Grace crosses to the candles.     Laval follows.

                           GRACE

             I had this case. This young
             hundred-pound woman was abducted
             from a parking lot. She kicked
             off a mirror, broke a window,
             dented her door. She struggled.
             This guy? Nothing.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Everything you are saying, you are
             saying one thing, do we trust
             Costa?

                           GRACE

             Good question.  Do we trust Costa?
An unmarked car pulls up.     Reynaud drives.

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             Get in.




INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - DAY

Grace and Laval get in, Reynaud guns it.       Grace belts in.

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             I found a current address here in
             Montreal.
Reynaud leans on the HORN, aggressively maneuvering
through traffic.

                           GRACE

             You guys have an extra weapon? I
             didn't want to cross the border
             armed.

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             The glove box.
Grace opens it and finds a compact Glock.       She checks it,
shoves it into her pocket.
Reynaud swerves into the wrong lane. Stops cold in front
of an apartment building. And gets out. Great driving.
A mere two blocks away from the crime scene.       Laval gets
out. Then Grace.




                                                       30.





INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY




An upper floor. Grace, Reynaud and the MANAGER cross to
a door. The Manager studies Costa's sketch of the
attacker.




                        SUPER

          I never met him. We conducted our
          business by phone.
They arrive at a door. Reynaud about to knock.   Grace
stops him, listening at the door.

                        GRACE

          I smell smoke. Back where I'm
          from anyone can kick a door if
          there's a fire. It's the
          'citizen's arrest' of search
          warrants.
Then: The SMOKE ALARM inside the apartment BUZZES O.S.
Reynaud and Laval trade looks. Reynaud cocks a leg...
The Manager unlocks the door a beat before Reynaud kicks
it. Laval is no danger junkie, he's a little hesitant to
enter. Grace gets down low, enters carefully, she knows
what she's doing.




INT. APARTMENT - DAY

It's dark, drawn shades. A small studio. Reynaud and
Grace move tactically with drawn guns. Grace enters the
kitchen. Light smoke.
Reynaud approaches the futon, a person-sized shape under
the blankets. Reynaud whips aside the blanket. Just
pillows.
Grace checks under the sink.
Reynaud checks the bathroom and shower.
A coffee pot smokes, SIZZLING sludge on the bottom.
Grace checks around the fridge, now satisfied no one
lurks in there.

                        GRACE

          Clear.
Grace turns off the burner. She crosses to a window,
whips aside the curtains, and opens it. Coughing.

                         GRACE

          Ugh.   Got a lung full.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                        31.





CONTINUED:




Grace looks at a glass of orange juice, a half-eaten
plate of food on the table.

                           GRACE

             Looks like this guy ran out in the
             middle of breakfast.
Laval has entered, he stares out the window.      Grace looks
out the window, REACTS.




WHAT GRACE SEES

The apartment window has a perfect view of the gym
parking lot where the killing occurred.







BACK TO SCENE

Reynaud sees that and also REACTS.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             We should get out of here. Don't
             touch anything.
They back out of there.




INT. APARTMENT - DAY (AN HOUR LATER)

Grace watches a CRIMINALIST bag a comb from the medicine
cabinet. A couple hairs entwined in its teeth.
In the kitchen another CRIMINALIST dusts for prints.
Reynaud taking pictures with a large still camera. Laval
KNOCKS on the walls.
Laval moves a picture frame. A photograph falls out.
Laval picks it up with surgical gloves.
INSERT PHOTO: A dead ringer for Costa's sketch,
carousing in a Thai bar.
Laval shows Grace.

                            GRACE

             Resembles the man Costa sketched.
                     (beat)
             Have you released him? You don't
             want your star witness steaming in
             a holding cell.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                       32.





CONTINUED:





                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             He went home twenty minutes ago.
             Agent Grace, where do you think
             Monsieur Edwards is?




                           GRACE

             I bet Monsieur Edwards is in a
             deep grave with square corners
             like Messieurs Kohler and Ford.
             Which looks like all the victims.
             Maybe he's subconsciously killing
             himself.
Grace finds a guitar case. Opens it. It's a mobile
office; it has postage stamps. Postcards. Assorted
stationery, different address labels. Neat, organized.
Holiday cards. A CD titled: "Learn Flamenco Guitar."
Hundreds of practice signatures. Forged documents.
Victim's personal effects.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             We'll take that with us.
                     (in French)
             Put a number and seal on that case.
Reynaud SNAPS pictures of the guitar case.
Grace is absorbing everything this little apartment can
tell her. Bonding with the space. She smells a pillow.
Thinking.

                           GRACE

             Ever see a Hermit crab?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             No.

                           GRACE

             It's a crab that lives in the
             shells of dead sea snails.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Yes, yes. They have one big claw
             and curl up tight.
Laval takes a long, sharpened screwdriver from his
jacket. Begins prying off a door molding. Grace sits at
the kitchen table.

                           GRACE

             When they outgrow an old shell,
             they search for a new empty shell,
             crawl up to it and quickly switch.

                           GRACE (CONT'D)

             They live in these beautiful
             shells because they have these
             soft ugly bodies. They couldn't
             survive without the shells.
             Neither can the guy we're after.
Laval exposes several MINI DV and MICRO-CASSETTES hidden
under the molding.




INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN - DAY

Surprisingly clear video shot with a long night-vision
lens. TODD FORD exits the 24 Hour Gym, gets in his car.

WIDEN TO:

The Director, Grace, Reynaud and Laval watch the video on
the TV. Director Gillet turns it off. He is not in a
good mood and that has Laval and Reynaud on edge.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             We could have had him this
             morning.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Director, please. We are getting
             close. The hairs recovered from
             the apartment match the hairs
             recovered at the crime scene on
             Ford's body. We found hours of
             video like that of the victim. He
             has been following him, filming
             him for weeks. He tapped his
             phone and has recordings of Ford's
             calls. Even a CD with copies of
             Mr. Ford's E-mail folders.

                            GRACE

             With that much detail, you could
             become anyone.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             So he hunts people and wears their
             lives as a kind of trophy.

                           GRACE

             More like a kind of camouflage.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             What's his real name?

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        34.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             We know what he looks like, we
             have his fingerprints, we know
             what he had for breakfast. But
             his name eludes us still.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

                     (angry)
             Find it, Laval. Find him.

                          INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Yes, sir.
Laval and Reynaud quickly exit.     Grace stays.




INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Director Gillet and Grace walk down the hall.

                           GRACE

             They're working really hard.

                          DIRECTOR GILLET

             I know.

                           GRACE

             Someone died last night because the
             asshole we're after isn't in custody.
             It's happened to me before and I'm
             sure it will happen again. It's a
             pretty miserable feeling.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             I haven't felt it in a long time.
                     (a beat)
             Dinner?

                           GRACE

             Thank you. I promised the boys
             I'd hang out tonight. I'm sorry.







INT. BISTRO - NIGHT

Grace, Reynaud and Laval have mussels and beer.      Laval
watches the GUITARIST, a little melancholy.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             I'm fair and I keep my promises.
             My informants trust me. I have
             eyes on the trains, on the buses.
             If they see him, they will tell
             me.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                     (subtitled French)
             Maybe they will tell you. Why do
             you trust junkies?




                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

                     (makes a fist)
             I trust their fear of this.

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

                     (subtitled French)
             Don't say that in front of her.

                           GRACE

                     (subtitled French)
             It's okay. I was a street cop in
             Philadelphia for three years
             before I joined the FBI.
Grace speaks French.      Reynaud REACTS.    As does Laval.

                            INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             Very nice.   You like to play
             games.
Grace smiles.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Mr. Ford worked as a cruise-ship
             musician. He would walk around
             and play his guitar on the decks
             at night.

                           GRACE

             Life is pretty cold sometimes.
             Man's just trying to spread a
             little music and gets murdered.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             He targeted Mr. Ford the night
             before he was supposed to get on a
             plane and meet a ship in Aruba.

                           GRACE

             Only the new improved Mr. Ford was
             going to meet he ship.

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             Think he has a plan B?

                           GRACE

             I doubt it. He's been so
             meticulous and effective in the
             past, I bet he's never needed one.
             We can assume he has all sorts of
             fake IDs and passports.
             Disguises. But that's not enough
             for him, he has to be someone
             else. He gets off impersonating
             people. And he knows his current
             persona is compromised.
Laval and Reynaud have stopped eating, are looking at
her.

                           GRACE

             What?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             You're always thinking. Save
             something for tomorrow. We have
             three boxes of evidence to go
             through.

                           GRACE

             Pretty cavalier attitude for a man
             who just got his ass chewed by his
             boss.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             My papa dropped dead of a heart
             attack in front of a drill press
             at work. Not me.
Grace understands.     Laval CLINKS her beer, Reynaud too.

                           GRACE

             I'm dropping by Costa's, I still
             have a couple questions.
                     (off Laval's look)
             I can't turn it off.




EXT. ART GALLERY STREET - NIGHT

A warm night, people are out. TEENS, COUPLES. Some OLD
MEN argue politics. Grace approaches the gallery, keeping
a low profile as she finds an angle to look inside.







INT. ART GALLERY - GRACE'S POV - NIGHT (MOS)

John Costa shares some Merlot with a statuesque ELEGANT
WOMAN. She's laughing, flirting. Costa is making her
laugh.




                                                    37.





EXT. ART GALLERY STREET - NIGHT




Grace quickly crosses to the entrance.




INT. ART GALLERY - GRACE'S POV - NIGHT




An OLDER MAN joins them, the woman is his arm candy.
Costa shakes his hand. The Older Man and the Elegant
Woman exit.







INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Grace enters. Costa sees her, REACTS, genuinely glad to
see her. And that throws Grace a beat. She really likes
his smile.

                           GRACE

          Mr. Costa.

                           COSTA

          You caught me.

                           GRACE

          Not yet.
Grace looks over the art.

                        COSTA

          Toussant Jean Bernard. I met him
          in Haiti last year. Very troubled
          life. Outlived all his children.
          And he had ten. He lost his wife
          to cancer and went blind. Passed
          away last year.

                        GRACE

          Overpriced folk art. Is it the
          work of a soul that has suffered?
          Sure. Are his explorations as an
          artist groundbreaking? No.

                        COSTA

          Ouch. And I was going to send you
          two and charge them to your Amex.

                        GRACE

          I couldn't afford it.
Costa is looking at her, looking through her.

                        COSTA

          What about Daddy's Amex? I've
          sold quite a bit of art to poor
          little rich girls like you.

Grace grows tense.

                             GRACE

             Excuse me.




                             COSTA

             Try the wine.

                           GRACE

             I'm partial to beer. And I don't
             have long. I came by to thank you
             for your help. And I apologize if
             you were detained. You did the
             right thing. Trying to save him.

                           COSTA

             Why, thank you. Agent Vanderholt.
                     (gives her a card)
             I'm having a show Friday. You
             should come by and meet some good
             people.

                            GRACE

             Who knows.   Where'd you learn CPR?

                           COSTA

             Medical school. Before I dropped
             out. I had a moment of clarity:
             in anatomy class I realized I'd
             rather draw bodies than cut them
             up. And when I realized I couldn't
             make art, I decided to sell it.

                             GRACE

             Some journey.

                           COSTA

             It's taken me all over the world.

                           GRACE

             About Monday again, did you see
             Mr. Ford fighting back?

                           COSTA

             At first I thought I was
             interrupting something, you know?

                             GRACE

             No, I don't.

                           COSTA

             I thought they were hugging. Then
             the gun came out when he saw me.

                           GRACE

             I guess that's it. Thanks.
Grace hands him a card.




                            GRACE

             If you remember any details or
             need anything.
                     (off his look)
             Anything related to the case,
             please call me.

                            COSTA

             Okay. Think about Friday.
             Please, Grace?
Grace will; she exits.




INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Grace has turned the romantic little room into a cave of
paperwork. Notes and photos cover the walls. Grace
reads a phone bill taped to a lamp. Circles a number
that keeps reappearing.







INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY (6:03 A.M.)

The place is gearing up for a new day. Grace crosses to
where Laval and Reynaud struggle awake with coffee and
the morning paper. Grace takes a seat, grabs the sports
section. A YOUNG DETECTIVE eats a grapefruit.

                           GRACE

             Morning. Can you run this name?
             She got twenty hang-up calls from
             Edward's phone.
The Young Detective takes a Post-It from Grace and
crosses.

                           GRACE

             What happened to that beautiful
             thumbprint on the orange juice
             glass, you get an ID?

                            INSPECTOR LAVAL

             No hits. He's never been
             fingerprinted.

                          GRACE

             Shit. Any activity on Edward's
             accounts?

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                    40.





CONTINUED:





                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Nothing. I think he became
             Edwards a year ago. He was a
             software engineer. Did everything
             by the internet, he never met
             anyone face to face.
Grace trades Reynaud for the front page.

                           GRACE

             Why a year ago.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Edwards went on a river trip.
             Kohler was a guide.
Grace REACTS.     Laval tosses her some papers.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Those are E-mails between Kohler
             and Edwards discussing the trip
             one year ago.

                           GRACE

             You connected Edwards and Kohler?
             Somebody was working all night.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             I couldn't sleep.

                           GRACE

             Our suspect kills Kohler on the
             river, lives his life a year,
             kills Edwards and assumes his ID
             for a year. Then he stalks Ford,
             kills him but is interrupted by
             Costa. Think he's pissed at
             Costa?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Of course.
The Young Detective returns with a report, hands it to
Grace.

                           YOUNG DETECTIVE

             Agent Vanderholt, a report came
             back on the name.




INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - DAY

Laval drives fast through a neat, modest neighborhood.

             fruitcake.




                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             This is it.
Grace watching Laval.      He looks pretty rough this
morning.

                           GRACE

             Let me go and be non-threatening.




INT. ASHER HOUSE - DAY

KNOCKING on the front door. The WOMAN from the ferry
answers the door. Her name is REBECCA ASHER. She opens
the door, smiles warmly at Grace.

                           MRS. ASHER

             Hi, please come in. Thank you for
             coming.







INT. ASHER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Classy decor. Grace sips Earl Grey.       Admires the
impressive antiques.

                           MRS. ASHER

             I'm glad they finally sent
             someone, those hang-up calls have
             me terrified. They started right
             after I saw him.
                     (a beat)
             I looked him directly in the eye.
             There was a moment of mutual
             recognition.

                           GRACE

             Do you think it's Martin calling
             and hanging up?

                           MRS. ASHER

             It couldn't sound crazier, but who
             else?

                           GRACE

             Were you ever asked to identify
             his body?

                           MRS. ASHER

             The body? Yes, they showed me
             some remains that had been hit by
             a pickup truck. The upper body
             was crushed. There was no face.
             I got physically ill.
Mrs. Asher studies Grace.

                           MRS. ASHER

             You're not Canadian, are you?

                            GRACE

             No.   I'm with the FBI.
Grace shows her creds.

                           MRS. ASHER

             There was three. About two weeks
             ago. I began turning off my
             telephone when I go to bed.

                           GRACE

             You have some very nice things,
             Mrs. Asher.

                           MRS. ASHER

             Thank you. Some of them have been
             in my family for several generations.
             Please call me Rebecca.
Grace looking at pictures on the wall of a good-looking,
athletic kid. They stop at age fourteen.

             Is that Martin?

                          MRS. ASHER

             No. That's Reese. Martin's older
             brother. He drowned in a terrible
             accident.
Grace notes a photo of a smiling young REESE receiving a
long distance swimming trophy.

                           GRACE

             I'm so sorry, Rebecca.    How did he
             drown?

                           MRS. ASHER

             The San Michel River. Martin fell
             out of their raft and Reese jumped
             in to save him.

                           MRS. ASHER (CONT'D)

             There was a lot of snowmelt that
             year. Martin reached the bank.
             Reese didn't. It was their
             fourteenth birthday.

                           GRACE

             Their fourteenth birthday?

                           MRS. ASHER

             They were twins. Identical twins.

                           GRACE

             You said Reese was older.

                           MRS. ASHER

             By three minutes. They were very
             different boys.

                           GRACE

             To lose one son so young, then to
             lose the other two years later; to
             think you've lost him. That must
             have been devastating.
Mrs. Asher lights a cigarette. Crosses to the window, so
poised, so tragic. Grace studies her with a critical
eye.

                           MRS. ASHER

             Reese was very charismatic and
             outgoing. Martin was introverted.
             He never thrived like Reese. He
             was a very disturbed young man.
             Reese was Martin's world. Martin
             never recovered his equilibrium
             after we lost him. He changed.
             Martin began to intimidate me. He
             could be very menacing. He began
             imitating Reese at school and that
             lead to fights with other
             students. At sixteen he stole
             some jewelry that was very
             precious to me and ran away. A
             few days later the Thunder Bay
             police called and said my son had
             been killed changing a tire.

                           GRACE

             The police want you to sign this
             so they can exhume the body in
             Martin's grave and verify
             identity.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Grace pokes her head in, looks around.     Nothing of note.







INT. MRS. ASHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

The door opens and Grace peers in. Flowing silk, throw
pillows, like a Sultan's tent. Interesting.




INT. THE BOYS' ROOM - DAY

Grace opens the door. Bingo. More LAUGHTER O.S. A bed,
still made. Old toys. Sports equipment. An "R" on the
headboard.
On the other side; shadows on the wall where pictures
used to hang. Indents in the carpet. Where a bed used
to be.
Grace's brow furrows.     Martin has been erased.




INT. HALLWAY - DAY

GROWLING. Grace turns. Sees a diminutive DOBERMAN
SNARLING at her. The miniature hound guards a door.
A door with several locks.    Grace takes a step toward it.
The tiny dog bares its fangs. Grace reaches for a
deadbolt. The little DOG GROWLING. One deadbolt is
open. CLICK. Grace opens the other one.

Grace startles.        Mrs. Asher is right behind her.

                              GRACE

             I know.     I was snooping.
Grace closes the door.       Mrs. Asher escorts Grace away,
past the boys' room.

                           MRS. ASHER

                     (re: the boys' room)
             My friends call it the shrine.     It

A beat.

             He's killing people, isn't he?
Grace nods:     yes.     Mrs. Asher assumed as much.

                           GRACE

             That doesn't surprise you?

             curtsied.
                     (watches him shave)
             Hygiene on the road. Very
             efficient.
The razor dies.        Leaving Laval half-shaven.

                             INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Merde!

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                    46.

Grace trying not to laugh, hands him a form.

                            GRACE

             She signed.   Start digging.







EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY

A back hoe rips a bucket of earth from amidst the graves.
A couple UNIFORMS watch.







INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY




A cheap wood coffin sits on a gurney. The lid has been
removed. Grace, Laval and Reynaud peer inside and REACT.
Reynaud looks ill.

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER

             Hmm. Could be worse after getting
             run over by a pickup and twenty
             years in the ground.




INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY (10 MINUTES LATER)

The body has been moved to the exam table. Covered with
mold the corpse seems to be upholstered with baby blue
velvet. The Medical Examiner checks the scale.

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER

             Bodies get mixed up all the time.
             Police found the wallet, called
             the mother and nothing was cross-
             checked. This was his head.
Medical Examiner pulls a plastic bag from the coffin.
Slices it open, revealing skull fragments and teeth.
Passes them off to an ASSISTANT.

                            MEDICAL EXAMINER

                     (to the assistant)
             Get that to Doctor Shivani and
             make sure someone signs for it.
                     (to Grace)
             She'll rebuild his jaw line and
             check it against Martin Asher's
             dental X-rays.

                           GRACE

             How soon, sir?

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER

                     (shrugs)
             This is a priority case, this
             afternoon maybe.




                                                      47.





INT. POLICE GYM - DAY




Five XL-sized COPS pump iron before their shift.

CAMERA FINDS GRACE.




She's doing sit-ups on a decline bench, holding a 25-
pound plate to her chest. She's a machine. Sweating.
Intense. The cops can't help but to be impressed.
Grace's CELL RINGS. She doesn't stop, does sit-ups
faster. At the last second she answers.

                        GRACE

                  (into phone, panting)
          Vanderholt.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.)

                  (filtered)
          Am I interrupting something?

                          GRACE

          Yes.   What?

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.)

          The X-rays don't match.

                        GRACE

          Find the real Martin Asher. He's
          your killer.
                  (a beat)
          You better get his mother someplace
          safe.




EXT. POSH HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

An UNMARKED parked with Laval and Grace inside.     They
watch:







INT. POSH HOTEL LOBBY - GRACE'S POV - NIGHT

MRS. ASHER checking in.




INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT


                        GRACE

          How'd she finagle a room there?

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          She's a very slick woman.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                       48.





CONTINUED:





                           GRACE

             She didn't have one picture of
             Martin. Not one. Even cut him
             out of the old yearbooks. And she
             had a basement door like a vault.
             She's hiding something. In the
             basement of her house. What is
             it, ten minutes away from here?
             Her house.
A beat.   Laval looks at Grace, decides he can trust her.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             If she's under our protection and
             something happens to her house,
             her belongings, the department
             could be liable. There could be a
             lawsuit.

                           GRACE

             You're right. We should make sure
             her front door is locked.
Laval makes a U-turn.




INT. ASHER HOUSE - NIGHT

The front door opens. Revealing Grace, and Laval as he
pockets a lockpick gun.

                            INSPECTOR LAVAL

             I'll stay outside. Kill him if
             he's in there.

                           GRACE

             Yeah, I'll get 'em.
Grace enters with a flashlight and a pistol. She
cautiously clears each room until she is sure she is
alone.
Grace crosses to the hallway. The little dog is there.
GROWLING. Grace tosses it a hamburger patty.

                           GRACE

             Let's be friends.
The dog happily attacks its treat as Grace opens the
deadbolts on the door the little dog was guarding.




                                                     49.





INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT




Grace descends CREAKING STOPS. Shining her light around.
Old boxes. Furniture. Forgotten things. Dust.
Grace is looking for something and she's not sure what.
She spots a door chain. She moves some boxes. Finds a
leather razor strop hanging next to a small door.
Grace's hand undoes the chain. Lifts the latch and opens
the door as rusted HINGES SQUEAL.




INT. MARTIN'S CELL - NIGHT

Grace moves aside cobwebs with her big flashlight. The
room is tiny. Exposed joists overhead. Grace sits on
the cold concrete. A sleeping bag rolled in the corner.
One wall is just chicken wire. Her flashlight beam stabs
at the yawning darkness beneath the house.
There is a public school desk chair combo. The name
MARTIN neatly carved into it, then scratched out. A
broken light bulb overhead, its wires running to a corner
of the house.
Grace cautiously unrolls the sleeping bag. A pair of
socks, underwear, T-shirt neatly folded inside. She
rolls it back up. Finds a large jar, picks it up. Very
old feces inside, a makeshift toilet. She sets it down.
Grace pulls the door shut.   And turns off her flashlight.
Pitch black. So quiet.
She sits there, in the musty little cage. Listening to
her BREATHING, to her HEART BEAT. So lonely, so
frightening. A tear rolls down her cheek. She SNIFFLES,
wipes away the tear. A beat. Grace hears SCRATCHING.
She clicks on her light.







GRACE'S FLASHBACK - INT. MARTIN'S CELL - NIGHT

YOUNG MARTIN ASHER IS HUDDLED in the corner, shivering,
CRYING and WHIMPERING. Martin looks AT us with haunted
eyes.




INT. MARTIN'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)

Grace REACTS, nothing is there. Chuckles for scaring
herself. Grace feels the chicken wire. MORE SCRATCHING.
Grace freezes. Listening carefully. Mice?
SOMETHING moves closer.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                        50.





CONTINUED:




She swings her flashlight on:       TWO FIERY EYES.
WHAM! Something big slams into the chicken wire. Teeth
flashing, GROWLING. It's a BADGER. Grace almost shoots
it. The fearless beast GROWLS.
Grace kicks the door open and runs out of there.




INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Laval driving back to Montreal.      Grace is shaken.

                           GRACE

             I think I just shaved ten years
             off my life.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Ah, you do feel fear.

                          GRACE

             Yes. Rabies scares me.     Only
             rabies. Nothing else.
Her CELL RINGS.

                           GRACE

                     (into phone)
             Vanderholt.

                     (filtered)
             Grace. Someone broke into my
             office. Minutes ago.

                           GRACE

             At the art gallery?

                            COSTA (V.O.)

             Yes.   My office here.

                           GRACE

             Are they still there?

                           COSTA (V.O.)

             No.

                           GRACE

             Did you call the police?

                           COSTA (V.O.)

             You told me to call you if
             anything happened.

                                               (CONTINUED)

             We'll be right there. I'm sending
             a car. Don't touch anything.







EXT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Two POLICE CRUISERS SCREECH to a stop outside.







INT. ART GALLERY OFFICE - NIGHT

Wooden painting crates everywhere. A table saw for
making frames. Costa is distressed. Grace looking at a
message typed onto his computer screen.

                           COSTA

             I do all my calls to Europe and
             shipping stuff at night. My
             address book was on the screen
             when I went out for coffee. I
             came back and this was on the
             screen.

                           GRACE

             How long were you gone?

                           COSTA

             Ten minutes. Maybe. When I
             returned, that was on the screen.

INSERT COMPUTER SCREEN: MR. COSTA: MEET ME TONIGHT @ LES


FRERS ON RUE CHAUCER. CU @ THE BAR 1:30 A.M.

Reynaud takes a picture of the screen. Laval checking
the door's lock. Finds no marks. Gives Costa a look.

                           COSTA

             Is this about the strangling?   Is
             that guy after me?

                           GRACE

             Please relax, Mr. Costa. We don't
             know if there's a connection yet.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Is anything missing.

                           COSTA

             No.  Everything's here.
                     (a beat)
             Shit. He took my organizer and my
             business checkbook.
Grace nods for Laval to step outside with her.




                                                        52.





EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GALLERY - DAY




Grace and Laval.

                        GRACE

          How do we know Costa didn't stage
          this? For attention or something.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          He's happy to see you. But the
          alarm was jumpered. Do you think
          Costa knows how to jumper an
          alarm?

                        GRACE

          We should take the computer.
Costa who has followed them out, overheard.

                        COSTA

          Don't take the computer.    That's
          my brain.
Costa turns to Grace.

                        COSTA

          I'm not making this up.     Believe
          me.
Grace shrugs, sees an ATM facing the alley.

                        GRACE

          Should I believe you?
Grace crosses to the ATM.   Peers into its security
camera.

                        GRACE

          Or should I believe this.

                        COSTA

          Believe what you want.
He's cocky, Grace likes that.




EXT. ALLEY - ATM VIDEO - NIGHT

Being fast forwarded. COSTA exits his office.        Locks the
door. He walks TOWARD CAMERA and EXITS FRAME.
A MAN'S SILHOUETTE in the alley. Crossing towards the
office door. An ATM CUSTOMER blocks the shot. The ATM
customer moves on.

                                                (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:




Nobody is there.     Then:
MARTIN ASHER exits Costa's office. Closes the door.
APPROACHES CAMERA, nonchalant. His face is clear; the
piercing eyes, the sharp features. Asher EXITS FRAME.
Fast forward some more until Costa ENTERS FRAME and
crosses to his office with a cup of coffee. The VIDEO
STOPS. It REWINDS. FREEZES ON ASHER.

                                         CUT WIDE TO:





INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT

Costa, Grace, Laval and Reynaud. Costa stands there
looking at Asher's image on the video monitor.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Is that the man you saw choking
             Mr. Ford?
Fear flashes across Costa's face.

                           COSTA

             I must of walked right past him.

                           GRACE

             Mr. Costa, is that the man you saw
             kill Mr. Ford in the parking lot?

                           COSTA

             Yes. That's him. That is the man
             I saw murder Todd Ford in the
             parking lot outside my gym. No
             doubt. Now will you go catch him,
             please?

                            GRACE

             Thank you.   I just needed you to
             say it.

                           COSTA

             Who is this guy? He's like a
             Ninja. Sneaking into my office.
             How dangerous is he? Does he want
             to kill me?

                           GRACE

             John, no harm will come to you.
             Listen to me. No harm will come
             to you. I promise. Anyone who
             wants to hurt you will have to get
             through these two for starters.

She gestures at Laval and Reynaud.     Costa turns to them.

                           COSTA

             How many people have you killed?



Reynaud shrugs.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             You will be safe, my friend.

                           GRACE

             We want you to be there tonight.
A beat, Costa smiles.     Realizes she's serious.

                           COSTA

             No. I'm not meeting him.
             Absolutely not. You ever go
             fishing? The bait always dies.

                           GRACE

             He won't get within fifty feet of
             you. The second we see him, the
             cuffs go on.

                           COSTA

                     (adamant)
             Grace, no.




INT. STAKEOUT VAN - NIGHT

Costa gives Grace a look as Reynaud tapes a microphone to
the BODY ARMOR he is wearing.

                           COSTA

             What if he shoots me in the head?

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             I will take the bullet for you
             like the Secret Service. Okay,
             friend?
Reynaud is serious.     Grace helps Costa with his shirt.

                           COSTA

             You're good. You could move a lot
             of art if you wanted to.
Their eyes meet for a beat.

                           COSTA

             And inspire some too, I'm sure.
Right then something very rare happens; Grace blushes.




                                                      55.





INT. LES FRERS - NIGHT (1:29 AM)




Ultra-hip. The dance floor THROBS with CLUBGOERS.      THE
DJ THUMPS a EUROBEAT.
Costa sits at the bar. PEOPLE all around him, jostling
to buy drinks. Two busy BARTENDERS sling booze.
Costa finds the noise and crowd absolutely nerve-
wracking. He twirls the ice in his Scotch with a finger.
Staring at the clock. 1:31 AM. He's nervous, sweat
beads his forehead. A big BARTENDER, an undercover cop,
pours Costa a Scotch.

                         BARTENDER

          Don't worry.   You're doing fine.

                        COSTA

          Could you look any more like a
          cop?

                         BARTENDER

          What?

                        COSTA

          Could I have some water?    I'm
          cooking in this thing.
Costa scratches around the neck of the hot BODY ARMOR.
The Bartender gives him a Dasani.
VARIOUS ANGLES: A half-dozen UNDERCOVERS are mixed in
with the CLUBGOERS.
CAMERA FINDS Reynaud sitting at the bar near Costa, gives
Costa a reassuring nod through the crowd.




INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT (1:53 AM)

Parked outside the club. Grace and Laval watch Costa via
the TV built into the dash.

                        GRACE

          Costa fits Asher's choice of
          victims. Travels the World
          looking for art. Single. No kids
          or anything.
                  (looking around)
          Asher's here somewhere. Watching.
          With all the patience in the
          world.

             I wish I had his patience. He
             should be a cop. His mother
             should be punished. Like the
             owner of pit bulls that attack
             kids.

                             GRACE

             You got kids?

                             INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Three.

                           GRACE

             Don't keep them in a cage.




INT. LES FRERS - NIGHT (2:03 AM)

Costa looks miserable. Overheating, anxiously nursing
his water. He looks around. Then REACTS. A note sits
on the bar top. Right in front of him. Costa looks
around. Only sees strange faces.
Costa carefully unfolds the note.       It reads:   "MEET ME IN

THE RESTROOM NOW."








INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Costa walks down a narrow hallway. Paint peeling.        MUSIC
MUTED. Red light bulbs hanging from the ceiling.
Approaching the men's room, Costa looks over his
shoulder. No one is watching.




INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Costa cautiously pushes open the door. Stepping inside.
Dingy tiles. DRIPPING FAUCET. Several stalls.
The room seems empty. Costa swallows, bends down.
Checks under the stalls. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing...
Then. Something. At the far stall. A pair of men's
shoes. Black. Polished. Facing the stall door.
Waiting...
Costa freezes.     Backs away as...
The stall door slowly swings open. HINGES CREAK.        A
foot, a trouser cuff. A leg stepping out...

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         57.





CONTINUED:




A BLACK MAN emerges.       One of the guys at the end of the
bar. Costa exhales.        A bundle of nerves.

                            BLACK MAN

             Go outside.
Costa eyes him.

                            COSTA

             What?

                           BLACK MAN

             We're calling it off.




EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE CLUB - NIGHT

Costa bursts from the fire exit, fed up. He rips off the
wire, he struggles out of the body armor. Grace and
Laval watching.

                           COSTA

             I have a life. I can't play
             superhero for you. I don't handle
             stress very well. I have an art
             show to open tomorrow and I don't
             know what I'm putting on the walls
             yet.

                           GRACE

             I know you have a life. So did
             the people who have lost theirs.
             Someone else might die if you do
             not help us. Every time someone
             dies it affects forty, fifty
             lives.
Costa looks at her, arms on his hips.

                           COSTA

             Grace, I've been cooperating. I
             even drew you a picture. You
             can't put your responsibility on
             me. You have a badge, not me.

                           GRACE

             If somebody else dies, and you
             know you could have done more to
             stop it, you're going to feel like
             shit for a very long time, Mr.
             Costa.
A beat.   That resonates with Costa.

             don't have time to hang out and
             listen to bad techno.



A beat.

                           GRACE

             It's okay to be scared.

                           COSTA

             Scared? I'm off-the-charts
             terrified. There's a pissed-off
             serial killer after me. I mean,
             what did I do to him?

                           GRACE

             You saw him and that's enough.
             Don't stop living your life.
             You'll be protected by armed
             officers twenty-four seven.

                           COSTA

             Until he's caught?

                           GRACE

                     (softly)
             I can't promise you that.
Costa is torn, Grace empathizes with him.

                           COSTA

             I have a lot of work to do.

                           GRACE

             A car is watching the gallery.
             You'll be okay.
Costa looking at Grace.     He decides to trust her.




INT. DIRECTOR GILLET'S OFFICE - DAY

Director Gillet leans against a wall, smoking a pipe.
Grace, Laval, Reynaud sit on the tired couches.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             So who was in Asher's grave?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Dan Soulsby. He went missing from
             the Alberta Military Institute two
             days before the accident.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         59.





CONTINUED:





                           GRACE

             I'm sure Soulsby's death was a
             homicide, Asher saw the
             opportunity and took it. He
             became Soulsby and bummed around
             Seattle for a couple years.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Why is Asher after Costa? Why
             isn't he in Mexico getting a new
             face?

                           GRACE

             Costa saw him. Costa caught him
             in the act, caught him being
             Martin Asher. Seen first by his
             mother, then by Costa. For the
             first time he's failed at taking a
             life, and since we found the
             apartment, he can't be Edwards.
             To be seen, to be recognized, is a
             horrifying thing to Asher. He has
             no identity and wants it that way.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Where is the real Mr. Edwards?

                            GRACE

             Likely dead and buried south of
             the border somewhere.
                     (beat)
             South of the American border
             somewhere. Visa records put
             Asher, using Kohler's ID and
             Edwards at a Mexican surf resort.
             Edwards' last charge was sixteen
             hundred dollars at a 'no questions
             asked' facelift clinic in
             Guadalajara.
Director Gillet taps out his pipe.     Looks at a new, more
detailed portrait of Asher.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Have you contacted the clinic?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Yes. They are also 'no questions
             answered.' Mr. Kohler suddenly
             paid off his credit card bills,
             thanks to money from Edwards.

             Keep's the collection agencies off

             Asher?




                           GRACE

             He's focused on Costa. Who fits
             the profile of Asher's victims.
             He went on Costa's computer and E-
             mailed copies of Costa's files to
             an E-mail account in Denmark.
             Constant threat of discovery,
             Asher will become more
             disorganized.
Laval and Reynaud agree.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Okay. My office will arrange a
             press conference. I will tell a
             room full of correspondents we
             have a suspect who is dead and
             murder victims who are alive. And
             I'll sound like a madman.

                           GRACE

             It does sound crazy. That's what
             the press likes, sir.




INT. POLICE BUILDING LOBBY - NEWS VIDEO - DAY

Director Gillet stands tall before a podium. Blinded by
lights. A bouquet of microphones in his face. Beside
him is a haunting poster-sized portrait of Martin Asher.

             Mr. Asher, we know who you really
             are. We will find you and we will
             arrest you. You can hide no
             longer.

ON COSTA




Lost in thought. He studies a series of vivid paintings
leaning against the wall. He crosses. Changes the
order. Steps back. Something isn't right.




                         CARPENTER

           Mr. Costa, some men in that car
           have been watching this place all
           morning.
The Carpenters looking out the window.

                         COSTA

           They're protecting the art. Go
           ahead and hang those. Be very
           careful.

                         CARPENTER

           Yessir.
Costa hears a POLICE RADIO. Spins around. Grace and
Reynaud have entered. Costa is apprehensive. What now?
Grace gives him a reassuring smile.

                         GRACE

           Security is going to be very solid
           tonight.
She waves him out of earshot of the Carpenters.     Their
faces are close. Grace gets butterflies.

                         COSTA

           Is he going to show up tonight?
           What do I do, offer him a drink?

                         GRACE

           He won't show. But we want to be
           here in case he does. Four
           plainclothes officers will form a
           perimeter watching the four
           corners.

                         COSTA

           A perimeter, excellent.

                         GRACE

           Yes. And four plainclothes
           officers will be in here.
           Mingling.

                         COSTA

           Mingling? I don't need four
           bruisers crashing through my
           clientele.

             your thing.

                              GRACE

             Sure.     If you feel safer.

             Much safer.




EXT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Summerfest, a street festival, is just warming up.       It
could be Mardi Gras, plastic cups and glowsticks.







INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT (9:39 PM)

A cutting edge club feel. A DJ spins a captivating
mellow mix. The gallery is filled PATRONS ABUZZ with
chit-chat. Inspector Laval and Reynaud study the
patrons.

                     (subtitled French)
             This painting costs more than my
             house.
Reynaud shakes his head.




FIND GRACE

She's stunning and shy about it. She examines a
painting. A gentle hand touches her back. She turns.
It's Costa. He hands her a highball.

                             GRACE

             Thanks.

                           COSTA

             You look a little anxious.

the painting.

                           GRACE

             I'm trying to get into the show,
             but I mean. What is this? It
             looks like somebody napalmed the
             Garden of Eden.

                            COSTA

             Mangos.   Ripe mangos hanging on a
             branch.
Now she sees it.

                           GRACE

             Oh. Okay. Why the borders?
             Almost every painting has one.
             Was he in prison or something?
Costa REACTS, impressed by Grace.

                           COSTA

             Most people don't notice. This is
             from his prison series. He could
             see a mango grove through his cell
             window. He made some of the
             pigments himself. From flowers.
             From his own blood.

                           GRACE

             What was his crime?

                           COSTA

             He attacked his neighbor with a
             machete. There was a woman
             involved.

                             GRACE

             Always is.
Grace sips her drink, letting herself relax.       She enjoys
Costa's company.

                           GRACE

             He had a lot of lovers, didn't he?

                           COSTA

             Dozens. He was a consumer of
             life's pleasures.

             His children formed a corporation,
             I take ten percent. I'm not a
             buccaneer, Grace.
Grace looks at Costa and smiles.

             What?

             You're very sensitive for...

             An FBI agent?
The ELEGANT WOMAN spots Costa and crosses. She lays a
hand on Costa's shoulder. He turns and they kiss cheeks.

             John, it's amazing tonight. I
             want to cry, I'm so touched.
Grace watches her hand linger on Costa's arm. And is
amazed that she feels jealous. She catches Costa's eye.

                           GRACE

             Mr. Costa, I would like to discuss
             an arrangement for the series.
The Elegant Woman REACTS.

                           ELEGANT WOMAN

             Just a sec, John.
She crosses to the Older Man in b.g.       Costa is miffed.

                           COSTA

             What are you doing?

                           GRACE

             She's not writing the checks.
The Elegant Woman returns with the Older Man.       He grabs
Costa's hand.

                                                          65.

                           OLDER MAN

             John, it's incredible what you've
             put together.
                     (aside to Costa)
             The thing we were talking about
             the other day, well I'd like to
             proceed. Hell, I'm sick of making
             two percent in the market.

                           COSTA

             Dick, they're yours.
The Older Man smiles, shakes Costa's hand. The Elegant
Woman looking at Grace, arms crossed, enjoys her victory.
Grace plays along, stalks off, hiding a grin.




INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

A few minutes later Costa finds Grace at the turntables
looking through the DJ's records.

                           GRACE

             Don't you miss wax?

                           COSTA

             You helped me close the biggest
             sale of the night.

                             GRACE

             What's my cut?

                           COSTA

             What do you want?
Grace smiles coyly.

                             GRACE

             I don't know.
Costa looks at Grace for a long beat.      Not sure what her
game is, or if he wants to play.

                           COSTA

             Let me know when you do.   Excuse
             me.
Costa walks away.     Grace REACTS; she didn't want that.







INT. ART GALLERY - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Costa takes a leak.     He's in a good mood.

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                            66.





CONTINUED:




The window above the stalls is open. The noise of the
PARTYING CROWD on the sidewalks outside.
Costa finishes, washes his hands.        Pauses.    Smoothes his
hair.




SOMEONE BEHIND HIM

Costa looks in the mirror and REACTS.
MARTIN ASHER stares at him from the mirror. No doubt who
it is. Asher is wound tight, not at all happy.

                           ASHER

             Put your hands on the wall.
Asher jams a gun in Costa's back.        Costa is very scared.

                           ASHER

             Feel that?

                           COSTA

             Please be cool with that.    I don't
             wanna get hurt.

                           ASHER

             I should blow your spine out. My
             face is everywhere. I have to
             hide in the shadows like a fucking
             animal because of you.

                           COSTA

             Yessir. I apologize for
             everything you think I may have
             done.

                           ASHER

             We're moved past sorry. You
             ruined everything. John, soon to
             be dead, Costa.
Asher's eyes flash. WHAM! Asher slams Costa's face into
the mirror. Costa's nose bleeds.

                           COSTA

             Stop it!







INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Reynaud stands near the bathroom. He heard that.          He
approaches the door, tests the knob.




                                                     67.





INT. ART GALLERY - BATHROOM - NIGHT




The door opens. Costa hits the deck. Asher spins, aims
at Reynaud and FIRES. POP-POP-POP-POP! Reynaud drops
and rolls out of the line of fire.







INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Asher bursts from the bathroom, running right over
Reynaud, who draws his pistol.
Grace pulls a pistol, Laval too. Asher running through
the patrons. Grace takes a knee and aims. She doesn't
have a clear shot. Asher aims his gun straight ahead as
he runs. People hit the deck.

                           ASHER

          Out of my way!
POP! Asher SHOOTS a WINDOW, SHATTERING it. He shoulders
his way through the safety glass. Grace and Laval
follow.







EXT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Chaos. Summerfest is in full swing. A swirling, boiling
CROWD of shiny faces. Asher dives into their midst.
Grace plunges in after him. Inspector Laval follows.




INT. ART GALLERY - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Costa is stunned, Reynaud checks him for bullet holes.

                           COSTA

          I'm okay.
From Reynaud's radio:

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.)

                  (filtered, subtitled
                   French)
          Jean, he ran into the damn crowd.
Reynaud bolts out of there.




EXT. FESTIVAL STREET - NIGHT

Asher and his pursuers leave a wake of disturbed REVELERS
that Reynaud follows.
Asher running. Careening, rolling, bouncing off PEOPLE.
He has the tireless power of a soccer player.




                                                         68.





ON GRACE




Running.   Equally tireless.      Locked onto Asher like a
missile.
Grace is slowly gaining on Asher.



Laval behind her.      Running.   Screaming in his radio.

                          INSPECTOR LAVAL

                   (subtitled French)
           We're heading East. Form a line
           at Seychelles.
A dozen UNIFORMS charge through the crowd.




EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY

Police RADIOS busy with CHATTER. UNIFORMS clear a path
for two PATROL CARS. SIRENS WHOOP as they coast in, TAP
bumpers, blocking the intersection.
POLICE OFFICERS form a formidable skirmish line.
SHOUTING for REVELERS to move aside.







EXT. FESTIVAL STREET - NIGHT

Asher running. Gun in his pocket. Elbowing his way
through the crowd. Asher REACTS. He sees the gauntlet
of UNIFORMS and PATROL CARS blocking the intersection
ahead.
Asher shoves his hand in his pocket...

BOOM!   BOOM-BOOM!     POP-POP-POP!

Thunderous GUNFIRE. Grace hits the deck. The Uniforms
hit the deck. The CROWD SCREAMS, CLAPS and WHISTLES.
It's not gunfire...

TILT UP.

FIREWORKS unfold in the night sky like giant flowers of
fire. Rivers of sparks.
Grace recovers her feet with palpable relief, she thought
she was dead for a second. Grace looking around for
Asher. Laval reaches her.

                            GRACE

           Shit.     You see him?
POP-POP-BOOM! More fireworks.         Laval gestures for some
Uniforms to spread out.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        69.

A SHRILL SCREAM O.S.

From an apartment building. Grace runs into the
building. Laval follows her.







INT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Grace and Laval running.   More SCREAMING O.S.    They run
upstairs.







INT. APARTMENT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION




An UPSET WOMAN is in the hall, standing by the just-been
kicked-in door of her apartment. Grace and Laval charge
inside.




INT. UPSET WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The SLIDING GLASS DOOR to the balcony has been shattered.
Below and beyond is a long rooftop.
Madly lit by a swirl of bright lights. A huge outdoor
dance floor throbs with energy in a park along the St.
Lawrence River.

GRACE SEES --

ASHER jump from the far end of the roof.




EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Laval will go no further. Grace gets a running start,
jumps from the apartment window, tucks and rolls. On her
feet again, Grace sprints along the roof.
FIREWORKS BOOM and POP overhead.   THUMPING TECHNO.
Grace reaches the edge of the roof.     REACTS.   Reynaud has
caught up with her.




EXT. RIVER PARK - GRACE'S POV - NIGHT

Asher has vanished into a vast sea of DANCERS, adorned
with strobing and glowing jewelry. The BEAT dominates
all sound.




                                                         70.





EXT. RIVER PARK - NIGHT




Grace and Reynaud trade looks, tenacious street cops at
heart, they holster their guns and jump into the crowd.

FIND ASHER --




A dozen yards away. He stalks a dancing RAVER who wears
a huge bundle of glowing necklaces.
Asher snatches necklaces.   Disappears into a wall of

DANCERS.


FIND GRACE --

She and Reynaud scan the moving bodies for Asher. Grace
GLIMPSES the back of Asher's head. Grace and Reynaud
tear through the crowd like bulls, working together, a
bonding moment.
Asher is an arm's length ahead of Grace. She reaches
out, her fingers snag the cloth of his shirt. Asher
turns...

IT'S NOT ASHER.

Grace shoves him aside and moves on. She SEES a
disturbance up ahead. Grace shoulders her way through
the crowd.
Grace and Reynaud converge on the disturbance.    They
cleave through ONLOOKERS to reveal...




A FIGHT

Two drunk COLLEGE JOCKS slug it out. Grace looks around;
no Asher. Angry, frustrated, Grace grabs one of the
Jocks, hurls him to the ground. Six UNIFORMS swarm in
and arrest the two Jocks.
Reynaud throws up his arms in frustration.    He looks at
Grace, they know they've been beaten.







EXT. RIVER PARK - CRANE SHOT - NIGHT

PULL BACK to reveal Grace and Reynaud surrounded by an
ocean of bodies in motion.

CAMERA FINDS A DANCER.

Some dude with his shirt off grinds on three HOTTIES.

PUSH IN ON THE DANCER.

CONTINUED:




It's Asher. His face is an evil green from his mane of
pilfered gel glow necklaces. Red plastic cup in hand,
Asher enjoys the boisterous anonymity.







ASHER'S EYES

Dangerous and cold.     They track Grace as she moves
through the crowd.
Asher grabs one of the hotties, begins making out with
her.
Grace searching the crowd.    Scanning faces.
Grace passes within feet of Asher.
Asher smirks.     Now another hottie wants a kiss.   Asher
complies.







INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

It's late. Costa has a beer, his nose bandaged.
INSPECTORS finish up questioning PATRONS. Grace enters,
crosses to Costa. She's tense, wound tight.

                           GRACE (O.S.)

             Need a ride home?
Costa looks at her. Despite everything, his face shows
he is glad to see Grace.




INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - LATE NIGHT

Grace drives.     Costa in the passenger seat.

                           COSTA

             The night started out great.
             Everything gelled. Everyone was
             happy. You helped land a big fish
             and the feeding frenzy started.
             Six figure pieces were flying off
             the wall.
                     (shivers)
             He said he was going to blow out
             my spine. I was thinking surgery.
             Six months in bed. Exercise
             pools. Never walking again.
Grace looks at him.     Costa is worried.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                           COSTA

             He was in my bathroom and none of
             you could stop him. I need to
             leave town.




                           GRACE

             That might be a good idea. Until
             then I'll check under your bed for
             monsters.
Costa looks at her.     Grace gives him a warm, open stare.

                           COSTA

             I would appreciate that very much.
                     (a beat)
             Can I profile you? I read your
             book.

                           GRACE

             Please, don't.

                           COSTA

             Thirty-something, single white
             female. Best schools best grades.
             Discovers adrenaline policing the
             inner city.

                           GRACE

                     (cuts in)
             John, stop it. Please. Let's
             shift the conversation from me and
             my business onto something
             inbounds.

                           COSTA

             Okay. Are you going to my funeral
             when Martin Asher cuts my throat?
They both know she's been lowballing the threat. We can
tell Grace is truly concerned for Costa's welfare.

                           COSTA

             You let him get away.
Grace takes that hard.

                            GRACE

             No excuses.   I'm sorry.

                           COSTA

             I meant you in the general sense.
                     (a beat)
             Can you catch him?

                           GRACE

             We got his name. We catch
             everyone sooner or later.




                           COSTA

             Sooner, please.




INT. COSTA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (3:33 A.M.)

Spacious, lofty.     Costa and Grace enter.

                           COSTA

             Careful.
Costa scoots aside a pile of clothing.       The newspapers.
Cool art, sketches, images all over the walls.
Reminiscent of Grace's hotel room. And a very cool view
of downtown.
Grace taking everything in. Art books, sketch pads.
Piled high on the desk. She looks at the ceiling. SEES
notes and sketches taped up. Grace laughs to herself.

                           COSTA

             I'm sorry. It's a sty.    Must be a
             profiling mother lode.

                           GRACE

             I'm done profiling you.   I got you
             figured out.

                           COSTA

             A failed healer, a failed artist.
Grace looking at a drawing on the wall.       Costa winces, he
didn't want her to notice it.

                           GRACE

             Is that how you see yourself?

                          COSTA

             No. That's you. I did it last
             night.

                           GRACE

             This is how you see me?

                          COSTA

             No. It's how I think you see
             yourself.

                           GRACE

Costa licks his lips.




                           COSTA

             That would be out of bounds.
Grace looking at him. Costa looking at her. A staring
match. Costa and Grace try not to laugh. They end up
giggling.

                           COSTA

             What was that?

                           GRACE

             I don't know. John, games are
             fun. But head games are
             dangerous.

                           COSTA

             Then keep your head out of it.
A beat.   Grace shrugs, back to business.

                           GRACE

             The Justice minister is going to
             relocate you to another city until
             Mr. Asher is in custody.

                           COSTA

             I don't know what your deal is.
             One second you're so there, then
             all I get is the badge.

                           GRACE

             I apologize if you've been getting
             the wrong signal.

                            COSTA

             Yeah.   Relocate where?

                           GRACE

             Another province. They want you
             on a flight tomorrow morning.

                           COSTA

             This monster comes into my life
             and I have to leave?
A UNIFORM SERGEANT enters.

             My people are in place.

                           GRACE

             Thank you, Sergeant.
The Sergeant exits.

                           COSTA

             This is surreal. What do I pack?

                            GRACE

             What you need.   Movers can get the
             rest.

                           COSTA

             I need tomorrow morning to finish
             up my business here.

                           GRACE

             I'll let them know.
This is goodbye.     Neither of them feels very good about
it.

                           COSTA

             I thought you were going to check
             under my bed.
Grace smiles, plays along, crosses, looks under the bed,
stretching for Costa. Driving him nuts.

                            GRACE

             No monsters.

                            COSTA

             Thank you.
Grace holds out her hand.      They shake.

                           GRACE

             I probably won't see you again
             until the trial. If there is a
             trial.

                            COSTA

             Goodbye, then.
Costa leans across her, braces himself against the wall.
A bold move. Now they are eye to eye. Grace kisses
Costa for a long beat.
Grace breaks the kiss. Holds a finger to her lips; shhh.
She turns and exits. The door shuts behind her. Costa
is going to miss Grace.

block away.







INT. UNMARKED #2 - DAY

Reynaud behind the wheel, turns to Grace.

                          INSPECTOR REYNAUD

            You spent a lot of time with
            Costa.
Grace isn't sure if that's an accusation.

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

            I like him.   He's a good guy.
Grace smiles.




EXT. COSTA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Laval RINGING the bell.
A white PLUMBER'S VAN pulls up behind Laval's unmarked.
A PLUMBER gets out.    Coveralls, clipboard.    Crosses to
another apartment.
Costa opens the door. With two packed bags.       Laval takes
one. Costa takes one last look at his home.       Locks the
door.
Laval watches the plumber KNOCKING a couple doors down.
Costa and Laval cross to unmarked #1.
The plumber approaches them.     Costa looking at him,

REACTS.

The plumber is MARTIN ASHER. A gun in his hand.       Laval
drops Costa's bag, reaches for his holster...
POP-POP-POP!    Asher drops Laval with three to the face.

                            ASHER

             Let's go.   Go!
Costa hits the gas and pulls out.




EXT. COSTA'S APARTMENT - DAY

SCREECH! Reynaud slides to a stop. Leaps from the
still-moving car and checks his friend Laval. Who is no
more. Grace wants to get Asher.

                           GRACE

             You staying or going?

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             I'm not leaving.
Grace slides behind the wheel.          And takes off in the

                           ASHER

             Jesus, he was a cop. He's dead
             because of you, because you made
             the choice. The choice to fuck
             with me. That, John, was a very
             bad choice.
A T intersection ahead.

                            COSTA

             Which way?   Left, right?

                           ASHER

             Left.
Costa makes the turn.     It leads to a HIGHWAY.

                           ASHER

             You're dead, John Costa. You
             fucked with the wrong man,
             shitsmear.
Costa is shaking, looks in the rearview.      Asher rips the
rearview off the windshield.

                           ASHER

             Faster, asshole.

                           COSTA

             I'm flooring it.

                            ASHER

             Shut up.   Faster.
Costa pulls onto the highway, buckles his safety belt.
Asher scoffs at the gesture, then does likewise.

                           ASHER

             Give me your wallet.   Give it
             over. Right now.
Costa does. Asher looks through it, pockets it.      Costa
tries to focus on driving.

                           COSTA

             Are you going to kill me?

                           ASHER

             You're goddamn right I am. I've
             been dreaming about it, John.

           blow your head off!

                          COSTA

           God help me.
Costa swings out to pass the truck.







AN ONCOMING TRUCK

A head-on imminent.    The Buick swerves onto the shoulder.
Just missing them.




INT. UNMARKED #2 - MOVING - DAY

Grace watches Costa's unmarked SCRAPE past the truck.        A
side mirror is knocked off.
The oncoming Buick swerves back onto the asphalt.
Overcompensates, now heading right for Grace...
Grace REACTS, swerves.
BAM!   The cars hit.   Grace gets a face full of airbag.




EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

Grace's car spins off the road. Stops in a ditch.       A
beat. The Buick's hulk blocking the road.
Grace exits the unmarked. Dazed but unhurt. She crosses
to the Buick. Three HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS are in the car.

                         GRACE

           Is everyone okay?
They seem alright.

                          GIRL #1

             Omigod, I have to call my mom.
A POLICE CAR SCREECHES to a stop. Then another POLICE
CAR. Grace runs to one of the police cars.

                           GRACE

             They're okay. Let's go.
                     (points up the road)
             He just shot a cop.
Grace jumps in the passenger seat.        The COP looking at
her.

                            GRACE

             Let's go.   Bad guy's that way.
The Cop nods, PUNCHES IT.




INT. UNMARKED #1 - MOVING - DAY

Costa is driving towards the mountains.        Driving through
the pine forest.

                            ASHER

             There.   Turn there.
A hard-to-see side road. Costa JAMS the BRAKES to make
the turn. Asher SLAPS him.

                            ASHER

             Careful.

                           COSTA

             Okay. Sorry. Sorry.      You don't
             want to do this.

                           ASHER

             Yes I do. John, do you have any
             idea how many people I have
             killed? It's always been
             business. This time is personal.

                           COSTA

             Please be cool. C'mon, we don't
             even know each other.

             Shut up. Art Man. You are stupid
             or crazy or both. Will you drive
             faster? I'll shoot you in the
             thigh. Will that get your
             attention.
Costa speeds up.

                           COSTA

             Don't, man. I got money. You
             want money, I'll give you money.
             I got paintings. What do you
             want? Talk to me, Martin.

                           ASHER

             I am not Martin. There is no
             Martin.

                          COSTA

             Of course. No Martin. What do
             you want? What's my life worth to
             you?

                           ASHER

             Nothing. And everything. This is
             deeper than money. Shut up. Talk
             is done. Talk is over.
             Understand that. You are over.
             Just shut the fuck up.
Asher lights a cigarette.     A sharp turn ahead.    Costa

             Okay, please, Martin.   Martin.   Be
             cool.
Asher aims his pistol at Costa's head.

                     (really pissed)
             Who the fuck is Martin?
Costa sets his brow in determination; he is driving
straight at a large tree...
Asher REACTS.
Costa jams his thumb into the release button of Asher's
seatbelt...
Asher angrily pulls the trigger of his pistol.

Reynaud acquiesces.     A Uniform escorts him out of there.
Director Gillet crosses to Grace, who was watching him.
She sips coffee, an icepack on her ankle.

Gillet shrugs.

             He got off light. With a broken
             wrist and fifty stitches. Lucky
             man.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             My luck has run out. Until today
             I have never had to bury a friend.
Grace squeezes his arm.

             I'm sorry, Director.

             Thankfully it's over. We have our

INT. SUPERKOOL LOUNGE - NIGHT




Ultra mellow. Grace and Costa chill on throw-pillows and
tapestries. Persian trip-hop and hookahs.
Grace and Costa have melted into a corner where they sip
tea. Nobody has been more comfortable. Costa pours beer
from a pitcher.

                        COSTA

          I'm happy to be alive but it's
          like this door has been opened.      I
          don't think I was naive. But
          everything is different now.

                        GRACE

          You'll fold this experience into
          your life and be stronger for it.

                        COSTA

          How do you deal with it? All the
          misery and pain and violence.

                        GRACE

          I can stop monsters, John.     And
          because I can, I have to.

                        COSTA

          So is it a calling or a curse?

                         GRACE

          Neither.   It's just my job.

                        COSTA

          When I was in med school I saw a
          guy on a Harley get T-boned by a
          Daihatsu. He was screaming in
          pain and needed help and I knew
          what to do, I had all my certs,
          but I saw all this blood and
          froze. I failed the big test.
          Bye-bye, med school. Hello,
          graphic design.

                         GRACE

          Roy Wilson.

                        COSTA

          The man on the Harley.
Costa REACTS.   Sighs.

                        COSTA

          So you knew about that. No wonder
          you knew what to say to keep me
          cooperating.

                           GRACE

             You're a sharp one, John Costa.

                           COSTA

             You threw me in a tiger cage like
             a piece of meat.

                           GRACE

             That's right. You were the cheese
             in the trap. We stopped a monster.
             That's what matters.
Grace is utterly unapologetic.      It makes Costa like her
even more.




INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Grace is in manic cleaning mode. She pulls papers off
the walls. Shoves a pile of clothing in the closet.
Sweeps coffee cups into a wastebasket.
She opens the door for Costa. He enters.        The room is
still a mess, but it feels safe, cozy.

                            GRACE

             I'm sorry.   I'm a pig.

                           COSTA

             I don't trust anyone who's too
             organized.
Grace puts some MUSIC ON the CLOCK RADIO.

                            GRACE

             Want a beer?

                            COSTA

             Please.
She grabs a couple cold ones from the mini-fridge.

                           COSTA

             Which is it, are you a runner or
             chaser?

                           GRACE

             What's that mean?

                           COSTA

             People like you --

                           GRACE

             People like me?

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                            89.





CONTINUED:





                           COSTA

             Yeah, people like you. Hardcore.
             Gung-ho people like you. And you
             know what I mean. People like you
             are either runners or chasers.
Grace looks at Costa.

                           GRACE

             You are a trip, John Costa.
He's not letting her off the hook.       She plays along.

                          GRACE

             Okay. I guess I'm running and
             chasing.
Costa REACTS.

                            COSTA

             I'm sorry.   I didn't know.

                           GRACE

             Growing up I quit speaking after
             that. I didn't say a word for
             three years. When you're not in
             the conversation, you get
             forgotten real quick. So I'd
             watch people. Study them. The
             mouth can say anything, but the
             body doesn't lie. The tilt of the
             head, the way the hands move.
Grace draws closer.       Costa watching her mouth.

                           COSTA

             How'd you get your voice back?

                           GRACE

             The day my Uncle died. The truth
             exploded out of me like a vision.
             My Uncle and Father had been
             arguing, there was a gunshot and
             my father was dead.

                           COSTA

             You are very intense, you know
             that?

                           GRACE

             I remember my Uncle telling me not
             to say anything. And I didn't.

                           (MORE)

CONTINUED:





                            GRACE (CONT'D)

             I made myself forget why. The day
             he died my voice and my memory
             came back. I screamed for an
             hour. Very primal. I haven't
             shut up since.

                           COSTA

             Why did your Uncle do it?

                           GRACE

             Land. Great-grandpa owned half of
             Pennsylvania. My Uncle wanted
             control and sold it all. All
             that's left is an old farmhouse
             and a horse pasture.
                     (sadly)
             My father's murderer got away with
             it because I couldn't open my
             mouth.

                           COSTA

             That's a hell of a lot of
             responsibility for you to put on
             the shoulders of an eight-year-old
             girl.
Grace blinks, looks at Costa.     That's exactly what she
needed to hear.

                           GRACE

             Something good game out of it.
             The dead can't speak. Now I'm
             their voice.
Costa cups her face and kisses her. Grace breaks away, a
little hesitant. Something is bothering her.

                           GRACE

             Martin Asher is dead, right?
Costa REACTS.

                           COSTA

             Can we please forget about him?

                            GRACE

             That's the point. He's dead, so
             there won't be a trial where you
             or I would have to admit under
             oath that we did anything
             inappropriate.

                           COSTA

             We haven't done anything.
That's about to change. Grace stands, pulls him off the
couch. Begins undressing him.
She finds horrible dog-bite scars.

                           GRACE

             Jesus.

                           COSTA

             In college we tried to make my
             friend's German Shepherd take a
             bong hit.

                            GRACE

             How mean.   Serves you right.
Costa pulls Grace to her feet.
Grace retreating. Step by step across the room. Costa.
Pursuing. Slowly. Determined. The heat. The immediacy
building.
Costa grabs her. Pushing her. Up against the wall.            The
phone CLATTERS to the floor. Grace's eyes widen.
Two mouths. Inches apart. Costa's hand reaches up her
skirt. Exploring. Grace swallows. His hand reaching
into her panties.
Grace's eyes looking away. As she grabs his arm.
Pulling. Pushing. Wanting. Her mouth. Avoiding his.
Their breath mingling. Until. Costa's lips crush down
on hers. The kiss devouring. Knocking pictures off the
walls. Grace's hands pulling him closer.
Costa picks her up. Throws her on the bed. He tears at
her blouse. Her white lace bra. Grace's back arching.
Her legs wrapping around him. As her eyes flutter open.
Looking up at the ceiling, she gasps.
Costa stops. Turns. To see what she's looking at.
Surprised to see pictures of Asher's victims, the crime
scenes. Staring down at them.
Costa turns to Grace, whispers.

                           COSTA

             Let them watch.
Grace looking deep into Costa's eyes.        Nods her head.
Costa flips her onto her stomach...




                                                          92.





INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (5:41 A.M.)




Grace and Costa spoon. Grace stirs.       Kisses the back of
Costa's head. He's utterly still.







INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Grace enters, groggy.      Turns on the sink.   Flips on the
light.
Grace reacts, stumbles back.
She's covered with blood.      Grace panics, feels herself
for wounds.







INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Grace shakes Costa.     Tears well in her eyes.

                           GRACE

          John.    John.
Costa stirs.

                         COSTA

          Mmmmm.   Morning.
He sees the blood.    Doesn't really react.

                        COSTA

          My stitches must have ripped.
Grace hands him a towel.      Presses it against his
shoulder.

                        GRACE

          I thought you were scared of
          blood?

                        COSTA

          You better take a shower.




INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT (4:30 A.M.)

Mrs. Asher looking at Martin Asher's remains.       The
charred torso, blackened thighbones.
Mrs. Asher reaches for Asher's red swollen face.

                        MEDICAL EXAMINER

          Please don't touch the remains.

She gives him a withering look.

                           MRS. ASHER

             Nineteen years ago I stood in this
             same room and your predecessor
             showed me a washtub full of blood
             and guts and told me it was my
             son. I will touch anything I
             want, Doctor. I'm not going
             through this a third time.
He hands her a pair of rubber gloves. Mrs. Asher SNAPS
them on, she reaches for an eyelid, peels it back.
Stares into the clouded eye. Mrs. Asher REACTS, quickly
withdraws her hand.

                           MRS. ASHER

             It's not him. That's not my
             blood. You people are incredible.
The Medical Examiner SIGHS, thinks she's a kook.

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER

             I'll swab your cheek and test your
             DNA against the body. Will that
             do it?

                           MRS. ASHER

             Good idea, Doctor. He's smarter
             than all of you, do you know that?




INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

The Doctor staples Costa's scalp.

                           COSTA

             Is that going to hold?   I'm not
             coming back.
Grace enters, in a serious mood.

                             COSTA

             What's wrong?

                           GRACE

             That was my boss. I'm going back
             to Quantico tomorrow.
Suddenly that seems like the end of the world.       Costa
looks at her.

             Washington, DC has some of the

             would be a great place to open a
             gallery.
Grace realizes what he's saying.     Smiles.

                           GRACE

             Staple his mouth too, Doc.
Grace's CELL RINGS.     She exits to take the call.




INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

Grace leans against a wall.

             Vanderholt.

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER (V.O.)

             Grace. I ran Mrs. Asher's DNA
             against the suspect down here. No
             way it's her son.
A beat.

                            GRACE

             Not her son?   You're sure?

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER (V.O.)

             Lab ran the test twice.

                           GRACE

             That's weird. Was he adopted,
             switched at birth?

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER (V.O.)

             Listen for a minute. There was a
             match. John Costa is Mrs. Asher's
             biological son.
Grace laughs.     It's a joke.

                           GRACE

             So John Costa is really Martin
             Asher?

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER (V.O.)

             Dear God, I wish I was joking.
Grace turns and REACTS.

Costa has been standing there. Listening. He tries to
read Grace's expression, worry etching his face.
Grace is looking at Costa, her mind racing a million
miles an hour.
Grace's world crumbles as she puts it together.

                           GRACE

             Are you Martin?
Costa gasps.        The very thought is painful.

                           COSTA

             Grace, I'm John. Okay?      I'm John.
Costa hoping against hope everything is okay.          But it's
not okay. Grace has a calamitous expression.

                             GRACE

             Holy shit.
Costa takes a step toward her. The street cop motions
for Costa to stay back. Costa REACTS.




INT. HOSPITAL - COSTA'S POV - DAY

Grace's purse sits on a chair in the exam room.          Her
pistol visible.







INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

Costa takes the gun from her purse, pockets it, along
with her FBI credentials and car keys.
Costa backs away from Grace.
Costa's physicality transforms from hip art dealer to
something much more menacing. The monster Martin Asher.
Grace looks him dead in the eye, more angry than scared.
(NOTE:   Costa will now be called ASHER.)

                           ASHER

             She screwed it up, didn't she?

             Who?

                           ASHER

             I should have cut her throat when
             I saw her on the ferry. That's
             the least she deserves. Please
             don't do anything, Grace. It
             would hurt me so much if I had to
             hurt you.

                            GRACE

             Good idea.   Don't hurt me.
Costa shakes his head, his brow set with a grim
determination. He turns, enters a stairwell and exits
the building. Grace's heart is breaking.

                           GRACE

             Shit!
She kicks the wall and gives chase, runs into the
stairwell.




EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Asher gets into Grace's unmarked.      And drives away.
Grace exits the building, watches him go.
Grace has no way to follow.     Then...
She sees a COP talking to a cute NURSE by his patrol car.

                           GRACE

             Police emergency. We need to
             pursue him. He's a murder
             suspect.
The Cop cocks his head, looks at Grace like she's a
nutcase. Grace dials her cell phone.

                           GRACE

             Director Gillet, there's an
             emergency, can you please tell
             this officer to cooperate with me?
Grace hands the cell phone to the Cop.







EXT. NICE HOTEL - DAY

A patrol car stops in front. Grace leaps out and runs
into the building. An Unmarked pulls up. Reynaud jumps
out and enters the building.




                                                            97.





INT. NICE HOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY




Grace running.   Reading room numbers.     Reynaud appears in
the hall.
Grace finds the right room.    Reynaud joins her, gun
drawn.
The door is ajar.     Grace pushes it open.




INT. HOTEL ROOM - GRACE'S POV - DAY

A MAID changes the sheets.    Mrs. Asher is gone.







INT. ASHER HOUSE - DAY

Mrs. Asher answers a KNOCK at her door.       Mrs. Asher

REACTS.


                          ASHER

          Hello, Mother.
Asher forces his way inside.      Mrs. Asher SCREAMS.




EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

SIRENS SCREAMING, flashing lights as six police cars zip
by at 90.




INT. UNMARKED - DAY

Grace over the shock and harder than steel.       Reynaud
drives fast. Grace on her cell.

                           GRACE

          No answer.     She turns her phone
          off.




INT. ASHER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Mrs. Asher sits on her couch. Asher stands.        The teeny
Doberman walks into the room, sniffs Asher.

                        ASHER

          What happened to Rex?     He was a
          real dog, right, Mom?
Rolls up his sleeve, revealing the dog bite scars.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                           MRS. ASHER

             Don't show me that, Martin. I had
             Rex put down after you ran away.
             Martin, sit.



Asher looks at her defiantly.     Mrs. Asher stands, gets in
his face.

                           MRS. ASHER

             How dare you defy me. You will
             sit down on that couch and you
             will do it now. Martin.
Asher sits. Mrs. Asher lays a hand on his, leans
forward, her eyes intense and earnest.

                           MRS. ASHER

             Martin, you have severe emotional
             problems. I know you're in a lot
             of pain. There's hope and help,
             Martin. Look at me, Martin. I
             love you very much.

                           MARTIN

             I know now that what you did to me
             was not love.




INT. ASHER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Asher sitting on the couch.     Then stands.

                           ASHER

             I'll stand if I want to stand. I
             can do anything I want to do. And
             I've done some great things,
             Mother. I'm not a scared little
             boy you can push around anymore.







NEW ANGLE

Mrs. Asher's head neatly adorns a silver platter.




INT. POLICE CAR - MOVING - DAY

Grace holds on as Reynaud slaloms around a corner in
Asher's neighborhood.

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             I hope the son of a bitch doesn't
             shoot me with the gun you gave
             him. What else did you give
             Asher?

CONTINUED:




An accusing look.

                           GRACE

             Shut up and focus. That kind of
             shit helps no one right now.




EXT. ASHER HOUSE - DAY

Reynaud's car SLIDES to a stop. Police cars take
position around the block, forming a perimeter around the
house.
Grace and Reynaud exit the car. Grace has a shotgun.
Four UNIFORMS, also with shotguns, join them.
The ad hoc entry team runs up the steps, onto the porch.

                           GRACE

             Get right, I got left.
WHAM!   Reynaud KICKS the door.      Grace is first in.







INT. ASHER HOUSE - DAY

Grace, Reynaud and the four Uniforms enter.        Weapons
sweep for targets and clear sectors.
Grace moving down the hallway.       Slowly, breathing hard.




INT. ASHER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Grace enters, approaching the couch. SOMEONE is there.
Grace sidesteps quickly, raises the shotgun.

                             GRACE

             Don't move!
It's Mrs. Asher. Sans head, sitting on the couch.         Grace
turns away, REACTS.
She sees Mrs. Asher's head.

                             GRACE

             Omigod.
Reynaud enters.        Sees Mrs. Asher's head.

                             INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             He's gone.
Reynaud looks at Grace.        Grace feels hollow, miserable.




                                                        100.





INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY




Grace's hotel room is now a crime scene. CRIMINOLOGISTS
process the scene. The sheets are bagged as evidence.







ANGLE ON GRACE

watching this.   Reynaud crosses to her.   SLAPS her.

                        INSPECTOR REYNAUD

          My best friend died protecting a
          serial killer so you could get
          laid. Very nice.
Grace REACTS.    The cat is out of the bag.

                        GRACE

          That's none of your business.

                          INSPECTOR REYNAUD

          No?    It's my case.

                        GRACE

          Back off, Reynaud. Asher fooled
          you too.

                        INSPECTOR REYNAUD

          At least I didn't fuck him.
Grace walks off.   Reynaud intercepts her.

                        GRACE

          Touch me again and I will kick
          your ass.

                        INSPECTOR REYNAUD

          I am taking you to the Director.







INT. DIRECTOR'S GILLET'S OFFICE - DAY

Gillet sits at her desk across from Grace.     His eyes are
harder than normal.

                        DIRECTOR GILLET

          They're on their way from the
          airport.
Grace nods, chews a nail.

                         DIRECTOR GILLET

          Your old life is over. There is
          no going back.

             I know.

                            DIRECTOR GILLET

             You're still young. Whatever
             happens, be strong.
                     (beat)
             Where is he, Grace? How do we
             find him?

                            GRACE

             Director, I'm the last person you
             should be discussing the case with
             at this point.

                             DIRECTOR GILLET

             Grace.    You know his mind, and his
             heart.    Where is he?
A beat.

                           GRACE

             Not here. This city no longer has
             the psychic gravity to hold him
             here. Try Mexico, getting a
             facelift.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             We ID'd the remains in the morgue.
             The real ID.
He hands her a picture of the man whom we thought was
Asher.

                           GRACE

                     (reads)
             Richard Hart.




FLASHBACK - INT. HART'S APARTMENT - DAY

Hart rolls painting canvases into a tight cylinder.
Inserts it into a fancy lamp. A hypodermic stands by to
reward his work.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET (V.O.)

             He was an addict. And a thief.
             An art thief. He hits galleries
             in Europe and North America.
             Traveled back and forth smuggling
             and selling stolen canvasses.




                                                      102.





INT. DIRECTOR GILLET'S OFFICE - DAY (PRESENT)




Grace puts it together.

                        GRACE

          Let me guess, Costa was selling
          stolen art for Hart and never gave
          him the money. Now Hart is just
          another one of Asher's victims.
Director Gillet.

                        DIRECTOR GILLET

          Costa owed him eight thousand.
          Those are E-mails off Hart's
          computer.

                        GRACE

                  (reading)
          Go to hell. I won't pay you a
          dime. I'm not scared of you.




FLASHBACK - INT. INTERNET CAFE - NIGHT

Richard Hart checks his E-mail and nearly has a heart
attack.

                        GRACE (V.O.)

          Come and get me. I will never pay
          you, dumbass.
                  (thinks a beat)
          Asher taunted Hart into a
          confrontation. Jesus. It was
          right there in my face. I was
          interpreting behavior from two
          different suspects.







BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)


                        DIRECTOR GILLET

          He had us all fooled, Grace. All
          of us. If Asher can do that, what
          else can he do?

                        GRACE

          Anything he wants.
KNOCKING. Gillet stands, crosses, opens his door. Two
FBI SUPERVISORS enter. Grim, silver-haired. Grace
stands.

                         GRACE

          Ah, the undertakers have arrived
          for my career.

Grace hugs Gillet.     And the FBI Men escort her out of
Gillet's office.







INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Grace is on the spot.     Her LAWYER by her side.
Facing a panel of seven SENIOR AGENTS.     Microphones,
water pitchers.

                           SENIOR AGENT

             Have your rights been explained to
             you and has an indication to that
             effect been made in your employee
             record?

                           GRACE

             Yessir.







INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Grace is exhausted, but holding up well.     The questions
don't stop.

                           SENIOR AGENT

             Agent Vanderholt. Why would Asher
             kill Ford, if nobody knew he was
             Costa. If he wasn't going to use
             Ford's identity?

                           GRACE

             He needed a murder he could link
             not only Richard Hart to but also
             to his past victims.




FLASHBACK - INT. HART'S APARTMENT - DAY

Upscale Euro-hip. Hart SLAMS down the phone.        Shoves a
gun in his belt and exits.

                           GRACE (V.O.)

             Hart's behavior was consistent
             with a disorganized drug addict
             following the rules of the
             criminal road by attempting to
             kill a debtor who won't pay. He
             had no idea he was being
             manipulated by a serial killer.




                                                     104.





INT. HART'S APARTMENT - NIGHT




Asher enters through the front door.   Hart isn't home.




INT. HART'S BATHROOM - NIGHT




Asher steals floss from the garbage can.   Takes Hart's
toothbrush. Some dirty laundry.

                        GRACE (V.O.)

          Asher wasn't becoming disorganized
          and decomposing into madness, he
          was evolving.







EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Asher, his face obscured with a sweatshirt hood, pulls
Todd Ford from the trunk.

                        GRACE (V.O.)

          The Ford murder was staged and I
          missed it. Asher drove Ford's car
          there with Ford unconscious in the
          car. Ether maybe, GHB. Something
          that disappears. Asher works out,
          heads to the parking lot. Pulls
          Ford out of the trunk. And
          strangles him. He left a couple
          of Hart's hairs on the body.
Asher leans over Todd Ford, strangling the unconscious
man with the garotte.
Asher places a couple of Hart's hairs on the body.




INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Asher drawing the sketch of who we now know was Hart.     Is
that a sly grin Asher has?

                        GRACE (V.O.)

          He draws a nice portrait of Mr.
          Hart and he's now inside the heart
          of Montreal PD's investigation.




INT. ASHER'S APARTMENT - DAY

In the bathroom, Asher, wearing surgical gloves, places
Hart's comb in the medicine cabinet. Puts Hart's trash
in the wastebasket.

                           GRACE (V.O.)

             Evidence at the Ford crime scene
             led to an apartment with more of
             Hart's DNA. And evidence linking
             Hart to Asher's crimes. Hart
             never set food in that apartment.
             Asher staged everything.




EXT. FESTIVAL STREET - NIGHT

Grace chasing Hart.

                           SENIOR AGENT (V.O.)

             Mr. Hart, not Asher, murdered the
             Montreal Inspector, correct?

                           GRACE (V.O.)

             Yes. Hart thought Costa was
             systematically destroying his
             life. Hart's violent explosion
             was inevitable.

                           SENIOR AGENT (V.O.)

             How could Asher plan on Hart
             snapping like that?

                           GRACE (V.O.)

             He couldn't. My guess is Asher
             intended to kill Hart and make it
             look like suicide. The
             authorities would find the body
             and close the Martin Asher file.







INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - THE NEXT DAY (PRESENT)

Things are wrapping up.

                           SENIOR AGENT

             This ethics panel has no choice
             but to recommend terminating you
             for misconduct. Do you wish to
             make a statement?
Grace shakes her head: no.

                           SENIOR AGENT

             Please speak up for the record.
Grace leans into her mike.

                            GRACE

             No.   I have nothing to say.




                                                    106.





INT. FBI BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE UNIT - DAY




Grace does the walk of shame in front of her former
COLLEAGUES. She carries a cardboard box full of personal
stuff from her office. Two GSA POLICE escort her.







EXT. QUANTICO PARKING LOT - DAY

Grace heaves the box into the back of her Audi.   A GSA
police car stands by.
DICK COLTON, her ex-boss intercepts her before she gets
in.

                       COLTON

          Grace. This is a bitter loss to
          the unit.

                           GRACE

          You'll manage.

                        COLTON

          Want some good news? RCMP closed
          their investigation and the
          Minister isn't indicting you.
          This could have been a real train
          wreck for you, Grace.

                           GRACE

          It wasn't?
Grace gets in her car.

                        COLTON

          No one has any clue where Asher
          is. That son of a bitch might
          fixate on you. Please watch your
          back, Grace.

                        GRACE

          I'll dig a hole and hide in it.

                        COLTON

          Don't fade away, Grace.   You're
          still my friend, okay?
Grace pulls out.   Heads for the road that will take her
out of Quantico.







EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY

Grace has the top down. The WIND snatching papers from
her box. Grace doesn't care.




                                                         107.





INT. ECONOMY MOTEL - NIGHT




Grace watches TV in the dark.      Drinking a beer.
Her CELL RINGS. Grace looks at it.        Sees OUT OF AREA on
the caller ID. She answers.

           Hello?

                           ASHER (V.O.)

           I'm sorry.    I'm sorry you lost
           your job.
A beat.   Grace grabs the big .45 by her thigh.

                           ASHER (V.O.)

           Hello?

                           GRACE

           I'm here.

                           ASHER (V.O.)

           I miss you.

                         GRACE

           Why don't you come and see me. I
           miss you, too. I'm at the
           Gainesville Virginia. The Motel 6
           off Highway 29. Stop by.
There is a strange tension in her voice. She hangs up.
Turns off the TV. She gets off the bed, crosses to a
corner. She sits, settles in for a long vigil.




INT. ECONOMY MOTEL - DAY

The rising sun reveals Grace has not moved. She is now
realizing Asher isn't going to show. Grace drops the .45
and begins to cry.







EXT. MEDICAL CLINIC - DAY

Grace exits the clinic reading a test result.      She
freezes in her tracks, returns inside.




INT. WAREHOUSE STORE - DAY

Grace shopping. She has a quarter ton bag of dog food.
Gallons of spaghetti sauce. Stocking up.




                                                     108.





EXT. WAREHOUSE STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT




Wintertime. It's an ice storm. Freezing rain
accumulates on existing snow and ice. Grace loading her
supplies into her truck. It's miserable out and getting
worse.



HONKING. Grace turns to watch a car slowly sliding
helpless across the ice. It stops just short of hitting
a parked car.




INT. POST OFFICE - NIGHT

Ten minutes later Grace checks her P.O. Box. Finds some
baby catalogs. A local PREGNANT WOMAN enters.

                        PREGNANT WOMAN

          Wow, you know the question?

                           GRACE

          Six months.

WIDER TO REVEAL:

Grace is very pregnant.

                           PREGNANT WOMAN

          That's it?

                           GRACE

          Twins.

                        PREGNANT WOMAN

          Good luck, sweetheart. Get
          yourself home, it's miserable out.
Grace smiles, exits.







EXT. OLD PRIVATE ROAD - NIGHT

Old and falling apart. Overgrown with branches. The
wind picking up. Grace's truck slowly navigating the
ice. The only vehicle around.




INT. GRACE'S TRUCK - MOVING - NIGHT

The accumulating ice is beautiful but deadly. Grace
drives with extreme caution, picking through the ice in
low gear. She drives around a fallen tree branch.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                         109.





CONTINUED:





                           RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

             The State Police have said to stay
             off the road unless it's an
             absolute emergency. Several of
             their cruisers have already been
             damaged. There is ice everywhere.
             On the way in tonight I saw the
             snowplow slipping and sliding.
             Everybody, stay where you are.
             This is only the beginning.
Grace turns OFF the RADIO.     Turns on the defroster.

SOMETHING MOVING.


WHAM!

Her WINDSHIELD SHATTERS.     Grace REACTS.
A tree branch overburdened with ice has fallen on her
truck.
The truck slides across the ice. Grace fights to regain
control, to keep it out of the ditch.
Grace stops.     Gets out.   Pulls the branch off the hood.




EXT. OLD FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

The last remnant of the once-proud Vanderholt holdings.
Grace pulls open a large garage door.
Assaulted by rain and sleet. She slips on the ice.
Regains her feet, finishes opening the door.
She gets back in her truck and parks it inside the garage.







INT. OLD FARMHOUSE - DAY

Restored. Filled with family heirlooms.      Another family
that has decayed from glory.
Grace enters. Dripping wet. She turns OFF the ALARM.
Then hangs up her heavy jacket. Bone tired.
Grace crosses to the kitchen.




INT. OLD FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Grace takes a Glock from her pocket and sets it on the
counter. She pours water into a kettle.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                           110.





CONTINUED:




Puts the kettle on the stove. Turns on the stove.         Grace
notices water on the kitchen floor. Wait. Wet
footprints.



Grace REACTS.     Reaches for the Glock.
A hand lands on top of her hand.      It's MARTIN ASHER.

                             ASHER

             Hi, Grace.
CLICK!   He snaps a handcuff around Grace's wrist.
Asher has the upper hand, he spins her, pulls her down
into a chair. She throws a punch. Asher blocks it.
Asher yanks on her cuffed arm.       SMACK!   Grace slaps him.
Asher pulls her into a chair. CLICK! Grace is now
cuffed to the chair. She struggles futilely against the
cuffs.
Asher catches his breath.

                             ASHER

             Knock it off.    You're not going
             anywhere.
Grace stop struggling.       Asher looking at her huge belly.

                           ASHER

             I'm not going to hurt you.

                           GRACE

             You're so full of shit your eyes
             turned brown.
Asher is happy to see her.

                           ASHER

             They're contacts. You're glowing.
Grace looking at him. Still astonished to see him.         Her
arms behind her back, her belly is so vulnerable.

                           GRACE

             How the fuck did you find me?

                           ASHER

             You told me everything I had to
             know.

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                         111.





CONTINUED:





                           GRACE

             Get it over with. Just get it
             over with.




                           ASHER

             Ever since I met you, you're all I
             can think about. I had a way of
             life. And I can't go back to
             because of you. I want you in my
             life, Grace. Please listen to me,
             Grace. I have a proposal.
Asher takes out a couple passports, a pair of driver's
licenses.

                           ASHER

             You become her. I become him.    We
             are married, see?
Asher slides a woman's wedding ring across the table.
Already inscribed.

                           ASHER

             We have the babies. We raise
             them. However you want. I just
             want to be with you.
Grace looking at Asher, not sure whether to laugh out
loud or start crying. He seems edgy; he needs her
decision quick.

                           GRACE

             What happens if I don't want to
             assume this woman's identity and
             raise my babies with a serial
             killer?

                           ASHER

             Grace, don't be morbid. If anyone
             can deal with this, you can. I
             know you felt what I felt. It's
             real.

                           GRACE

             Answer my question.

                           ASHER

             I'll shoot you in the head and
             burn this place down.
Grace reacts. She can respect that. Grace looking at
Asher. He's scary, feeding off some fantasy about her.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         112.





CONTINUED:





                           GRACE

             You'll do what you have to do. I
             can respect that. How do you know
             it's still real? Maybe it's gone.
             What we felt.
Grace tilts her lips, looking in his eyes. Asher leans
over to kiss her. Slow, delicate. Asher kneels beside
her, the kisses become hungry, desperate.
Grace's eyes are so open, so vulnerable.

                           GRACE

             God, I missed you so much.
Asher leans in to kiss her...
Grace head-butts him.    CRUNCH!   Smashes his nose.
She drives her feet down and her shoulder into his chest.
Asher, already on his knees, falls back.
Grace scrambles over him, gets out of the chair.       She
shoulders over the kitchen table...
There is a holster mounted underneath the table.
Grace turns her back so she can grab the gun from it.
Grace REACTS.     There is no gun in the holster.
Asher looking at her, matter of fact:

                           ASHER

             I searched everything.
Asher stands, reaches for the Glock on the counter.
Grace can't let him get it. She lunges at Asher,
collides into his knees, hurting him.

                          ASHER

             Damn you!
Asher grabs a large knife from the butcher's block.
THWACK!   Plunges it into Grace's belly.
Grace GASPS, looking at the knife embedded in her stomach.
A beat as Grace and Asher stare at the knife.
Grace uses the pause to kick away from Asher.       She gets
on her feet and runs from the kitchen.




                                                     113.





EXT. OLD FARMHOUSE - NIGHT




Grace exits the kitchen door, running with her hands
cuffed behind her. Running for her life.
She runs for the nearby woods. Her shoes CRUNCHING
through a layer of fresh ice over old snow. Fighting for
balance.
POP-POP-POP! Asher OPENS FIRE on her from the house.
BULLETS HIT the ice around her.
Grace runs into the woods.   Branches sheathed in ice.
Smacking her face.
Asher exits the house, FIRING -- POP-POP-POP-POP!
BULLETS EXPLODE the ice around Grace. She dives to the
ground. She takes the opportunity to move her handcuffs
from behind to in front.
She unties and removes the heavy prosthetic belly she
wears. Grace is not pregnant. She pulls the knife out.
Grace runs deeper into the woods.
Asher running in the woods behind her. The gun in his
hand at the ready. Asher is hunting. He intends to kill
her.

                         ASHER

           Keep fucking running, Grace,
           you're only going to die tired!




ON GRACE

Running. Batting away ice-covered branches.     Drenched
with sleet. Hypothermic conditions.







EXT. OLD PRIVATE ROAD - NIGHT

Grace emerges from the woods. Running along the icy
road. She slips and falls. Cuts her hand on the ice.
Grace stands, and keeps running, her hand bleeding, the
knife getting slippery.




ON ASHER

Gaining on her. Grace slips again, scrabbling on the
ice, trying to keep moving. A slow motion nightmare.
Here comes Asher.   No mercy.   He aims the gun at her
face...

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                           114.





CONTINUED:




Grace raises her hands to protect her face...
POP! Asher FIRES. DING! The BULLET intended for
Grace's forehead hits the knife -- RICOCHETS into the
trees.
A beat.   Grace looking at the now-creased knife.
Asher's gun is out of rounds.     The slide is locked back
on an empty chamber.
SWICK! Grace slices Asher's legs with the knife.          Slices
each shin deeply.

                          ASHER

             Shit!
Asher kicks the knife from her hand. Then kicks her in
the face. He tries to kick her again but she grabs his
leg.
WHAM! Asher slips, hits the ice hard. Grace is on top
of him, wraps the handcuffs around his neck. Wraps her
legs around his body.
Grace chokes Asher for all he's worth. His eyes bulge,
his face reddens as he meets the same fate as his
victims. Asher has a seizure as his oxygen depleted
brain dies.
Grace doesn't let go. A long death embrace. Finally,
when she is sure, Grace releases from Martin Asher's
body.
She checks his pulse.    He's dead.    Grace stands.
The rain falling on her. Ice and moonlight. Grace spits
blood, looks around. Looks at Asher's corpse.

                           GRACE

             Better you than me, asshole.
Walks back toward the house.      Alone.   Strong.   Whole.




                                              FADE OUT.

     1958

     PROLOGUE:  INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. EVENING.

     Fade up on Ripley, as in the final scene of the film,
     sitting, desolate in a ship's cabin. The camera rotates
     around his face, which begins in light and ends in darkness.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               If I could just go back.  If I could rub
               everything out.  Starting with myself.
               Starting with borrowing a jacket.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST TERRACE. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley is at the piano, accompanying FRAN, a young soprano.
     CREDITS begin.

                         FRAN (SINGS)
               Ah, such fleeting paradise
               such innocent delight
               to love,
               be loved,
               a lullabye,
               then silence.

     The song finishes.  Applause.  They're the entertainment at a
     cocktail party to celebrate a silver wedding anniversary.
     Some partygoers congratulate Fran on her performance. A
     distinguished looking man, pushing his wife in a wheelchair,
     approaches Ripley, offers his hand.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
               Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (pointing at Ripley's borrowed
                    jacket)
               I see you were at Princeton.
               Then you'll most likely know our son,
               Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               We couldn't help noticing your jacket.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Yes.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Class of '56?

                         RIPLEY
                   (hesitating)
               How is Dickie?

     INT. ELEVATOR OPENING OUT INTO LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.

     Fran, Ripley, Mr and Mrs Greenleaf and others emerge from an
     elevator. Emily talks to Fran, Herbert to Ripley.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
                   (to Fran)
               I hope you'll come and see us...

                         FRAN
               That's very kind.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Both of you...

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Of course, Dickie's idea of music is
               Jazz. He has a saxophone.  To my ear Jazz
               is just noise, just an insolent noise.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley shakes hands with Herbert Greenleaf as he gets into
     his Rolls Royce. They are making an appointment. Ripley
     crosses the street to Fran, pecks her cheek. She hands him
     his share of their fee.

                         RIPLEY
               Gotta run. I'm so late.
                   (he hands Fran's boyfriend the
                    jacket he's been wearing)
               Thanks for the jacket.

                         BOYFRIEND
               Sure.  Thanks for filling in for me.

     From Greenleaf's point of view he sees a couple embracing.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Darling couple, aren't they?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Yes.  An exceptional young man.

     From another vantage point Ripley hurries on as Fran gets
     into her boyfriend's car. A piano quartet starts up.

     EXT. THEATER. EVENING.

     Ripley runs past the droves of arriving concert-goers and
     heads for the theater. Music continues.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM, THEATER. NIGHT.

     The interval: A thick mass of men in tuxedoes grooming
     themselves at the basins. Ripley turns on faucets, offers
     towels, brushes off dandruff. Men talk over, round, and
     through him.  Put coins in a bowl.

     INT. A BOX AT THE THEATER. NIGHT

     The concert continues. Ripley peers through the curtain at
     the performances.  A haughty woman in the box turns round and
     he closes the curtain.

     INT. BACKSTAGE. 1:30 A.M.

     An empty auditorium. Ripley plays Bach in the blue
     ghostlight.  A caretaker emerges from his rounds, flips on
     the house lights.  Ripley jerks up from his playing, waves
     apologetically.

                         RIPLEY
               Sorry, sorry.  I know.  Sorry.

     EXT. GREENLEAF SHIPYARDS, BROOKLYN. DAY.

     Greenleaf and Ripley walk through one of the drydocks.  A
     huge void in the shape of a boat, swarming with workers
     preparing the shell of a new liner.  If Central Park is where
     the money is spent, this is clearly where it's made.  And a
     lot of it. Workers nod deferentially to the man with his name
     over the buildings behind them.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Mongibello. Tiny place. South of Naples.
               Marge, his uh, the young lade is
               supposedly writing some kind of book. God
               knows what he does. By all accounts they
               spend the whole time on the beach. Or his
               sailboat. That's my son's talent,
               spending his allowance.

     Ripley, in his green corduroy jacket the very model of a
     sober young man, listens attentively.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF (cont'd)
               Could you ever conceive of going to
               Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?
                   (Ripley looks doubtful)
               I'd pay you.  I'd pay you 1000 dollars.

                         RIPLEY
               I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir,
               but...

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Good. Now you can go for a reason.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK. DAY.

     A vinyl RECORD revolves in close up.  An exuberant and
     mysterious VOICE is scat singing. Wild. Then the sound slides
     into a raucous big band jazz number:  Dizzy Gillespie's The
     Champ. A HAND ejects the record. When the camera finds the
     man's face it is BLINDFOLDED. He's hot. He's wearing an
     undershirt. He's trying to identify the recording.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               I don't know. Count Basie?  Duke
               Ellington. I don't know. Count Basie.

     The man pulls of the blindfold, examines the record cover of
     the disc he's been trying to learn, needs to put on glasses
     to do so, is irritated by his mistake. He ejects the record.

     A pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered
     table which includes classical sheet music and a paper
     keyboard. One hand idly mimes at the keys.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Another song for Ripley to identify is on the gramophone.
     Chet Baker's My Funny Valentine.  Signs everywhere of
     packing. A suitcase. Books about Italy.  Ripley paces in this
     BASEMENT room, which is bathroom, kitchen, living room and
     bedroom all in one.  Tiny, tidy, squalid and sad. The windows
     give onto bars and a wall.

                         RIPLEY
               Don't even know if this is a man or a
               woman.

     There's a violent row going on in the room above his head. He
     flinches.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley, shining his shoes, packing almost done, is testing
     himself on another piece of music. Free jazz saxophone:
     Charlie Parker's Koko.  He listens hard, recognizes the
     track.

                         RIPLEY
               That's Charlie Parker. Bird.

     He skips over to the gramophone, checks the record. He's
     right, he smiles.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley studies an old photograph of Dickie Greenleaf in a
     Princeton Yearbook. He shoves the book in a bag, picks up
     his suitcase and takes a last look around the dingy apartment
     before closing the door behind him.

     EXT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley hauls his luggage up the stairs and into the sunlight.
     He is met at the top of the stairs by Mr Greenleaf's
     chauffeur.

                         CHAUFFEUR
               Here.  I'll take that.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

                         CARETAKER
                   (nodding towards the apartment)
               That thousand bucks should come in handy.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, sir.

                         CHAUFFEUR
                   (interupts Ripley, who is
                    about to open the car door)
               I'll get that.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

                         CHAUFFEUR
                   (as he holds open the door for
                    Ripley)
               Sir.
                   (Ripley laughs excitedly)
               You're gonna have a great trip.  Mr
               Greenleaf is personal friends with the
               Cunard people.

     INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S CAR. DAY.

     Ripley luxuriates in the back of the Greenleaf limousine. He
     opens up an envelope he's carrying with Greenleaf stationery.
     Inside a First Class Cunard Ticket, some traveler's checks
     and dollars.

                         CHAUFFEUR
               I can tell you.  The Greenleaf name opens
               a lot of doors.

     EXT. QUEEN MARY, MANHATTAN SKYLINE. DAY.

     The liner leaves New York en route to Italy.  END CREDITS.

     INT. NAPLES HARBOR, CUSTOMS & IMMIGRATION HALL. DAY.

     ITALY. Brilliant sunshine. The Queen Mary has just docked.
     Passengers can be seen disembarking through the huge windows.
     Coming from the First Class gangways they are greeted,
     escorted, fussed over into the hall.  Their bags have been
     unloaded ahead of them, and are now being sorted in the hall
     under the initials of their owners.  STANDS WITH THE LETTERS
     OF THE ALPHABET CHALKED ON THEM are dotted about, and trunks
     and suitcases of all shapes and sizes form small hills around
     them. Ripley enters and an Italian Porter approaches, wants
     his name.  Ripley. Ripley. Ripley! he repeats in the hubbub
     and joins the crowd around the letter R.  A striking young
     woman (MEREDITH) is nearby. She notices him.

     Ripley proceeds to the Customs area, where he's held in a
     line as a large suitcase is opened and searched. Meredith
     catches up with him. Her luggage a mountain next to his.

                         MEREDITH
               What's your secret?

                         RIPLEY
               Excuse me?

                         MEREDITH
               No, it's just - you are American, aren't
               you? - no, I just, I have so much
               luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined.
               It's humiliating.

     Ripley shrugs.  Now they're opening a second case of the
     passenger ahead.  Hard not to converse.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith
               Randall.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.

                         MEREDITH
               Hello.

     They are passed through immigration, head down the long
     stairs towards the street.  Meredith catches up with Ripley.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?

                         RIPLEY
                   (thinking quickly)
               Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.

                         MEREDITH
               So now, did they put your suitcase in the
               wrong pile? It's just - upstairs -
               weren't you under the R stand? I thought
               I saw you there.

                         RIPLEY
               My father wants me in New York. He builds
               boats. I'd rather sail them.  I travel
               under my mother's name.

                         MEREDITH
               Which is?

                         RIPLEY
               Emily.
                   (Meredith's bewildered)
               Just kidding.

                         MEREDITH
               The funny thing is, I'm not Randall
               either. I'm Logue.

                         RIPLEY
                   (nods, recognizing the name)
               As in the...?

                         MEREDITH
               As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug
               off the dress. I travel under my mother's
               name, too.

                         RIPLEY
               Randall.

                         MEREDITH
               Right.

     They've arrived at a crossroads on the stairs - graphic signs
     explain the choices: one way for Buses, Taxis and exits - the
     other for Trains: ROMA, VENEZIA, MILANO.  They're going in
     different directions.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
                   (offering her hand)
               So - partners in disguise.
                   (looks at the signs)
               Bye.

     EXT. COASTAL ROAD FROM NAPLES. LATE AFTERNOON.

     A BUS rolls around a coastal road cut into the side of a
     cliff, mountain above, blue sea below.

     INT. BUS. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley sits surrounded by teeming life. The bus slows at a
     new town. People get off.

     INT/EXTERIOR. BUS ARRIVES MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.

     Later, the day ending. Ripley looks out as they continue on
     their journey. Arriving at a small fishing port they wind
     down through a square, passing the local church.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. LATE DAY.

     And then the bus is in the heart of a wharf. On one side
     there's evidence of the fisherman's life, nets, old men
     working. Opposite there's a tiny cafe spilling out onto the
     street, young guys hang out, play table football, lounge on
     their Vespas. The Driver chants -

                         DRIVER
               MONGIBELLO!

     Ripley gets out, lugging his cases, as the bus continues on
     its way. He looks around him. He feels completely foreign.

     EXT. MIRAMARE HOTEL/BOAT AT SEA. MORNING.

     A SAILBOAT has slid into his view, now drops anchor, drops
     the sail.  A couple dive off and swim towards shore.

     ALL OF THIS IS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RIPLEY, who's
     watching the events through binoculars from his tiny balcony
     in the Miramare Hotel. An Italian Vocabulary Book is perched
     on his knees and, during this, he continues his study,
     mouthing the Italian words.

                         RIPLEY
                   (looking at a long, lean girl
                    about to dive)
               La fidanzata a una faccia.  The fiancÈe
               has a face.  La fidanzata e Marge.

     Her partner, DICKIE GREENLEAF, dives too. They're brown,
     beautiful, perfect. Ripley notices the name of the boat:
     "BIRD".

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Questo e la mia faccia.....

     The golden couple emerge from the sea. Dickie shakes off the
     water, grins.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               This is my face.

     He double-checks himself with the vocabulary book.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Questa...e la mia faccia. Questa e la
               faccia di Dickie.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley emerges from one of the beach cabins, and stands on
     the edge of the sand on a wooden walkway. He's wearing A TINY
     LIME-GREEN BATHING SUIT. He loathes beaches. A couple of boys
     turn laconically and watch him.

     Ripley puts on his shoes and scurries to the sea. He feels
     ridiculous, his skin alabaster against the brown bodies.
     Finally, the shame is too great and he pulls off his shoes
     and dashes to the water, where he luxuriates in the coolness
     of it before wading out of the sea, and walking straight up
     to Dickie.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie Greenleaf?

     Dickie squints at Ripley, who holds his shoes, lamely.

                         DICKIE
               Who's this?

                         RIPLEY
               It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at
               Princeton together.

                         DICKIE
               Okay.
                   (he sits up)
               And did we know each other?

                         RIPLEY
               Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must
               have known me.

                         DICKIE
                   (to Marge)
               Princeton is like a fog, America's like a
               fog.
                   (to Ripley)
               This is Marge Sherwood. Tom - sorry, what
               was it?

                         RIPLEY
               Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.

                         MARGE
               How do you do.

                         DICKIE
               What are you doing in Mongi?

                         RIPLEY
               Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.

                         DICKIE
                   (finds this idea absurd)
               Passing through! You're so white. Did you
               ever see a guy so white, Marge?  Gray,
               actually.

                         RIPLEY
               It's just an undercoat.
                   (Marge laughs)

                         DICKIE
               Say again?

                         RIPLEY
               You know, a primer.

                         DICKIE
               That's funny.

     He shares some intimacy with Marge, makes her laugh.  Ripley
     stands as they wrestle around him. Marge looks up.

                         MARGE
               You should come and have lunch with us,
               before you go - Dickie?

                         DICKIE
               Sure.  Any time.

                         MARGE
               And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in
               danger of turning a little pink.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks. Well, a coincidence.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. EARLY MORNING.

     ANOTHER DAY.  Church Bells ringing. Dickie, dressed in
     shorts, comes bumping up the cobbled path towards the square
     on his MOTORSCOOTER. He stops by a steep flight of steps.
     RIPLEY, a book in hand, unseen, walking up a hill, catches
     all this and, intrigued, watches as a young Italian beauty,
     SILVANA, has a spikey, flirtatious exchange with Dickie, then
     climbs on the scooter, behind him.

                         DICKIE
               I've been looking for you everywhere.

                         SILVANA
               Ah, today you're looking for me.  And
               where have you been the rest of the week?
               Pig.  With your American girl?  I hate
               you, you know?

                         DICKIE
               What?

                         SILVANA
               I hate you.

     And RIPLEY watches them as they rattle down the hill towards
     the sea.

     EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.

     Dickie appears in Marge's garden, the sea behind his head.
     Marge is sitting at her outside table surrounded by some of
     the remnants of lunch.  Dickie's sheepish, showered, late.

                         DICKIE
               Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late,
               I'm a swine.

                         MARGE
               Did you forget where I live? It's four
               o'clock.

                         DICKIE
               I just woke up.  I'm sorry.

                         MARGE
               You just woke up!

                         DICKIE
               Fausto and I - we took the boat out, we
               were fishing, and then it was dawn and
               we'd caught absolutely nothing.

                         MARGE
               Well, we ate everything without you.

                         DICKIE
               We?

                         MARGE
               Yes, Tom Ripley's here.

     As Ripley appears with the tray to collect more dishes.

                         DICKIE
               Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We
               thought you'd disappeared. We were going
               to send out a search party.

                         RIPLEY
               No, still here.

                         MARGE
               Tom was telling me about his trip over.
               Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.

                         DICKIE
               Is that good?

                         MARGE
               Shut up!

     Marge flicks him with a napkin. They start to wrestle,
     excluding Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm intruding.

                         DICKIE
               Can you mix a martini?

                         RIPLEY
                   (hesitant)
               Sure.

                         MARGE
                   (going inside)
               I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.

                         DICKIE
               Everybody should have one talent.
                   (to Ripley)
               What's yours?

                         RIPLEY
                   (without a beat)
               Forging signatures. Telling lies.
               Impersonating practically anybody.

                         DICKIE
                   (enjoying this banter)
               That's three. Nobody should have more
               than one talent. Okay, do an impression.

                         RIPLEY
               Now?  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Talent -
                   (his voice ages, his face
                    changes)
               The only talent my son has is for cashing
               his allowance.

                         DICKIE
                   (absolutely thrown)
               What? What's this?

                         RIPLEY
               I like to sail, believe me, I love to
               sail! Instead I make boats and other
               people sail them.

                         DICKIE
                   (incredibly impressed)
               Stop! It's too much!  You're making all
               the hairs on my neck stand up!

                         RIPLEY
                   (relishing it)
               Jazz, let's face it, it's just an
               insolent noise.

                         DICKIE
               I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the
               old bastard is here right now!  That's
               brilliant!  How do you know him?

                         RIPLEY
               I met him in New York.

                         DICKIE
               Marge! You've got to hear this!

                         MARGE
                   (returning with the drinks)
               What?  What?

                         DICKIE
               Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf
               1st.

                         RIPLEY
               Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a
               fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.

                         MARGE
               What's going on?

                         DICKIE
               Uncanny!

                         MARGE
               I don't get it.

                         RIPLEY
               Could you ever conceive of going there,
               Tom, and bringing him back?

                         DICKIE
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and
               persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you
               $1000.

     INT/EXT. MONGIBELLO CHURCH AND SQUARE. DUSK.

     A christening is over and now the whole village is pouring
     out of Church for the Passeggiata in Sunday best. Girls arm
     in arm parade. Boys arm in arm evaluate. New babies are
     compared and fussed over. Old people smoke, talk, shrug.
     Dickie is walking with Ripley, seething about his father's
     scheming.

                         DICKIE
               I'm never going back. To actually hire
               somebody to come all the way here to drag
               me back home - got to be insane, hasn't
               he?

     SILVANA comes out of church arm in arm with a man, her
     fiancee, as part of a foursome which includes Dickie's pal
     FAUSTO. Silvana's eyes flick towards Dickie, otherwise
     there's no acknowledgement as they all greet each other.
     Dickie introduces Tom, then they move on.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               I'm never going back!

                         RIPLEY
               No, I think your mother, her illness -

                         DICKIE
               It's got nothing to do with my mother!
               She's had leukemia for - ! This is what
               makes me boil about him! HE wants me
               back! - it's got nothing to do with my
               mother.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling
               you what I -

                         DICKIE
                   (interrupting)
               Go back!  Go back to New York or call him
               if you can find a telephone that works,
               and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me
               back to him or his shipyard.

     EXT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, MONGIBELLO. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley appears, with his meagre luggage at Dickie's front
     door. He's carrying his tote bag under his arm, the bottom of
     which seems to be unstitched and held together only by his
     fingers. Marge is on the terrace, she looks down to see Tom
     talking with Dickie.

                         MARGE
               Hi Tom.

                         DICKIE
                   (looks up)
               Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.

                         MARGE
               I'll come down.

                         DICKIE
                   (to Ripley)
               Did you speak to my father?

                         RIPLEY
               You were right about the telephones.
               There are no lines, there's some problem.

                         MARGE
                   (coming out of the front door)
               Hello Tom. You're off? What are your
               plans?

                         RIPLEY
               Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.

     He goes to shake her hand and as he releases the tote bag the
     seam splits and records spill to the ground, scattering. He
     bends down, starts gathering them up. Marge helps.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Oh, damn, sorry, this bag's -

     Dickie's delighted when he sees the Jazz titles.

                         DICKIE
               You like jazz!

                         RIPLEY
                   (gathering up the records)
               I love jazz.

                         DICKIE
                   (holding up a Chet Baker)
               This is the best. Marge says she likes
               jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is
               jazz.

                         MARGE
               I never said that!

                         RIPLEY
               Bird. That's jazz.

                         DICKIE
               Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat -

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. What's the name of your
               sailboat?

                         DICKIE
               Bird!

                         MARGE
               Which is ridiculous. Boats are female,
               everyone knows you can't call a boat
               after a man.

                         RIPLEY
               He's not a man, he's a god.

                         DICKIE
                   (excited)
               Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a
               club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.

                         MARGE
               It's vile.

                         DICKIE
               Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't
               have to come.
                   (to Ripley)
               It's great.  You're going to love it.

     INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.

     A cavern blue with smoke. A surprisingly good QUINTET blast
     out their version of MOANIN'. Dickie and Ripley arrive and
     make their way to a table where Fausto is sitting with
     friends. It's too noisy for conversation, but Dickie shouts
     introductions and they shake Ripley's hand.  Dickie is
     instantly absorbed in the music, Ripley absorbed in Dickie.
     An attractive Italian Girl, DAHLIA, comes over, kisses
     Dickie, pulls off his hat, puts it on, there's no room for
     her to sit, so she sits on Dickie's lap, smoking his
     cigarette.  Dickie raises his eyebrow at Tom, but it's
     clearly no hardship. Then the band strikes up the intro to Tu
     vuo' fa' L'Americano - a hit which reflects the current craze
     for all things American - and Fausto pulls a protesting Dickie
     up onto the stage.

                         FAUSTO
                   (improvising in Italian)
               Ladies and Gentlemen. Dickie Greenleaf,
               all the way from America... etc.

     Fausto starts to sing. Dickie joins in the chorus. Everybody
     claps. Dickie talks off-mic to Fausto.

                         FAUSTO (cont'd)
               And a big round of applause for a new
               friend from New York - Tom Ripley!

     Ripley's mortified, but Dickie jumps off the stage and pulls
     him up.  The song continues and now, at the chorus, it's
     Dickie and Ripley who have to sing. Ripley, of course, can
     sing well, if not confident in this arena. Soon the audience
     is clapping, standing on tables, dancing, Dahlia prominent.

                         DICKIE (O/S)
                   (reading)
               I have bumped into an old friend from
               Princeton - a fellow named Tom Ripley.
               He says he's going to haunt me until I
               agree to come back to New York with
               him...

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NOON.

     Dickie, in his new dressing gown, is sitting at the table,
     typing. Ripley's head emerges from behind the couch on which
     he has been enjoying a blissful sleep.

                         DICKIE
                   (grins)
               Good afternoon!

                         RIPLEY
               What time is it?
                   (puts on his glasses and checks
                    his watch)
               Oh God!  Do you always type your letters?
                   (points at the letter)
               That should be two Ts.

                         DICKIE
               I can't write and I can't spell.  That's
               the privilege of a first-class education.
               You're upstairs at the back. I think
               Ermelinda made the bed up.

                         RIPLEY
               This is so good of you.

                         DICKIE
               Don't say it again. Now you're a Double
               Agent and we're going to string my Dad
               alone, I was thinking we might buy a
               little car with the expense money he's
               sending you. What do you think, Marge...a
               little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?

     Marge has appeared, carrying Camparis.

                         MARGE
               Dickie, you can't even drive a car!  No,
               what we need urgently is an icebox. What
               do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll
               be your friend for life.

                         RIPLEY
               I absolutely agree with Marge.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS. DAY.

     Ripley locates his room, puts down his luggage in what is a
     comfortable and simple room, then heads back downstairs only
     to be tempted by the open door of Dickie's bedroom.

     INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. DAY.

     Ripley explores the casual elegance of Dickie's bedroom - the
     Louis Vuitton chest, the closet's open door spilling out
     shirts, ties. On the dressing table there are toiletries,
     cufflinks scattered, a silk tie.  Ripley picks up the tie and
     walks towards the open window below which is a terrace where
     lunch is being laid. Marge and Dickie are chatting. Shreds of
     conversation float up to Ripley.

                         DICKIE
               It'll just be for a little while.  He can
               be... he makes me laugh.

                         MARGE
               Okay, darling.

                         DICKIE
               You'd say if you mind?

                         MARGE
               No, I like him.

                         DICKIE
               Marge, you like everybody.

                         MARGE
               I don't like you.

                         DICKIE
               Then I'll go to your place and you can
               move in with Tom.

     Above them, Ripley repeats these phrases, carefully, testing
     the cadences, No, I like him. Marge, you like everybody,
     until he's as accurate as a taperecorder.

     EXT. TERRACE OF DICKIE'S HOUSE. DAY.

     Ermelinda is clearing away lunch. Ripley is changed and
     sitting at the table with Marge while Dickie works on the
     coffee. Ripley watches him, studying everything: the way he
     uses the expresso machine, the way he wears no socks, his
     pants, his rings.

                         DICKIE
               Now you know why Miss Sherwood always
               shows up for breakfast.  It's not love
               it's the coffee machine.

                         MARGE
               It's the one task Dickie can do on his
               own - make coffee.

                         DICKIE
               Shut up.

                         MARGE
               Oh darling - is that for me?

                         DICKIE
               No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.

                         RIPLEY
                   (as Dickie hands him his cup)
               That ring's so great. The green one.

                         MARGE
                   (delighted)
               Tom, I love you!
                   (to Dickie)
               See!
                   (to Ripley)
               I bought it for him, for his birthday.

                         RIPLEY
               It's superb.

                         DICKIE
               I had to promise, capital P, never to
               take it off - otherwise I'd give it to
               you.

                         MARGE
                   (flicking a crumb at him)
               Bastard!
                   (to Ripley)
               Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in
               Naples.  I bargained for about two weeks.

                         DICKIE
               I hope it wasn't cheap.

                         MARGE
               Oh, it was.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Marge)
               I have to find a birthday present for
               Frances. Perhaps you can help me?

                         MARGE
               Frances?

                         RIPLEY
               My fiancÈe.

                         DICKIE
               You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?

                         RIPLEY
               Your parents met her.

                         DICKIE
               Oh God - I can just imagine - if only
               Dickie would settle down... doesn't every
               parent deserve a grandchild?  Never! I
               swear on your ring, Marge.  I am never
               going back.

     EXT. BIRD SAILBOAT. DAY.

     The Bird is sailing off the coast of Mongibello. There's a
     manoeuvre going on with the sail.  Captain Dickie supervises
     his crew of Marge and a painfully awkward anxious-to-please
     Ripley.  Dickie goes over to help him.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?

                         DICKIE
               You're doing great. We'll make a sailor
               of you yet. You're doing really well.

                         MARGE
               Dubious but special honor, Tom - crewing
               Dickie's boat.  Alright, bar's open.

                         DICKIE
               Yes please!

     She heads for the cabin. Dickie settles down beside Ripley.

                         RIPLEY
               Could we sail to Venice?

                         DICKIE
               Sure.  I love Venice.

                         RIPLEY
               I have to go to Venice.

                         DICKIE
               See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or
               is it Rome? You do something and die,
               don't you?  Okay, Venice is on the list.

                         RIPLEY
               And Rome.

                         DICKIE
               Do you ski?
                   (Ripley frowns)
               Don't tell me - you're a lost cause!
               That's the next thing to deal with. We're
               planning to go to Cortina at Christmas.
               Excellent skiing. Excellent.
                   (as Marge reappears)
               Marge - Ripley can't ski.  We'll have to
               teach him that, too. Have you ever known
               such low class?

                         MARGE
               Poor Tom. Good thing we're not getting
               married. We might have to invite him on
               our honeymoon.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.

     Marge and Ripley are on a shopping expedition. They walk down
     the hill towards the grocery shop, next to the bar in the
     little square. Ripley has asked Marge how she and Dickie met.

                         MARGE
               Oh I hated New York - that Park Avenue
               crowd - so I fled to Paris to work on my
               book, and I was always going to this cafe
               with Jean-Jacques, and Dickie used to
               play his saxophone outside and I would
               see him and he would see me, and he would
               play My Funny Valentine. It was only
               later that I realised he only knows about
               six songs.

     They've arrived at the Grocery Store. Alessandra, the woman
     who owns the store greets them.  Silvana, who's her daughter,
     is also there, and less comfortable. She waits for Marge's
     order.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
                   (to Silvana, in Italian)
               Buono Sera, Silvana. Por favore: arance e
               pane, e del prosciutto.

                         SILVANA
               E fichi?  Come sempre?

                         MARGE
               Si.  Come sempre.  Grazie.

     Silvana goes inside for the meat and bread. Marge frowns.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
                   (back to Ripley)
               Anyway, then one day, we go in, I see
               Dickie, he starts playing My Funny
               Valentine, and then all of a sudden he
               just walks into the cafe, right in front
               of Jean-Jacques, and grabs me! Now I had
               never spoken to him in my life - he said
               I'm going to Italy, tomorrow, and I want
               you to come with me. So I did.

     At the edge of the square there's A BOCCE AREA, where men
     throw metal balls along a track, aiming to get closest to a
     small cue. Dickie is there, playing intensely with Fausto and
     two other guys, one of whom we've seen before with Silvana.
     Ripley and Marge loop back towards home, taking in the Bocce
     en route. Dickie waves. They wave back. Marge calls to him.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom
               and I are running off together.

                         DICKIE
               Okay.

     EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. EARLY EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley are leaving.  They're fooling around.
     Dickie jumps on Ripley's shoulders. Marge watches from the
     top of the garden.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO SQUARE. EARLY EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley, still horsing about, pass Silvana's
     grocery store.  Dickie dismounts, goes over to Silvana, who's
     tense, a little troubled. They huddle, Ripley isolated.

                         SILVANA
               Did you get my message?  I want to talk
               to you.

                         DICKIE
               I want to talk to you too...Smile for me.

     And Dickie's already gone, back to Ripley feinting to box him
     then dancing, satyr-like, down the hill.

     EXT. COASTAL ROAD TO NAPLES. EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley on the Vespa. There's a steep incline where
     the road winds down towards Naples and, as the Vespa gains
     speed, Ripley is happy to cling to Dickie.

                         DICKIE
               You're breaking my ribs!

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               You're breaking my ribs!

     INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.

     Ripley's really singing, carrying the burden of My Funny
     Valentine in a flawless imitation of Chet Baker. Dickie is
     playing some sax. After a verse, there's spontaneous
     applause. Dickie, impressed beams at Ripley.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.

     A NEW ICEBOX, incongruous in pride of place in the living
     room, casts its glow on a delighted Dickie as he pulls out a
     couple of beers, handing one to Ripley who is paging through
     his copy of the Collected Works of Shakespeare.

                         DICKIE
               I could fuck this icebox I love it so
               much.
                   (considering Ripley)
               What were you actually doing in New York?

                         RIPLEY
               I played piano in a few places.

                         DICKIE
               That's one job, you told me a lot of
               jobs.

                         RIPLEY
               A few places - that's a few jobs. Anyway,
               I don't want to think about New York.

                         DICKIE
               The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I
               spend hours speculating.
                   (drinking)
               Cold beer. Thank you Dad.

                         RIPLEY
               Copy out from here...

     He hands the book to Dickie, pointing out the lines.

                         DICKIE
                   (staring to write on the back
                    of a postcard)
               I love the fact you brought Shakespeare
               with you and no clothes.  Ermelinda says
               you wash the same shirt out every night.
               Is that true?

                         RIPLEY
               No! I've got more than one shirt!

                         DICKIE
               She can do that stuff for you. Anyway,
               just wear some of my things, wear
               anything you want, most of it's ancient.
                   (he's finished writing)

                         RIPLEY
               Now your signature.
                   (watching him write)
               Not "Dickie". Your signature.

     Dickie writes his signature at the bottom of the postcard.
     Ripley studies the writing, takes off his glasses to clean
     them. Dickie looks at him.

                         DICKIE
               Without the glasses you're not even ugly.
                   (takes them, tries them on)
               I don't need them because I never read.
               How do I look.

                         RIPLEY
               Like Clark Kent.
                   (takes them back, puts them on
                    beaming at Dickie)
               Now Superman.

     Dickie cuffs him.  Ripley looks down at the postcard.

                         DICKIE
               I know. I write like a child.

                         RIPLEY
               Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T,
               do you see? - fine, vulnerable - that's
               pain, that's secret pain.

                         DICKIE
               It must be a deep secret, cause I don't
               know about it.

                         RIPLEY
               Your handwriting - nothing more naked.
               See - nothing's quite touching the line -
               that's vanity.

                         DICKIE
                   (flattered)
               Well we certainly know that's true.

     INT. DICKIE'S BATHROOM. NIGHT.

     Dickie's in the bath. Ripley, dressed, sits on the stool next
     to the bath. They're in the middle of playing chess, the
     board propped on the bath tray. Ripley puts his hand in the
     water, checking the temperature. He turns on the faucet for a
     burst of hot. Ripley is absurdly happy. He pours some wine.

                         DICKIE
               Do you have any brothers?

                         RIPLEY
               No, no brothers, no sisters.

                         DICKIE
               me neither. Nor does Marge. All only
               children - what does that mean?

     He looks at Ripley who looks at him, a little too long.

                         RIPLEY
               Means we never shared a bath.
               I'm cold. Can I get in?

                         DICKIE
               No!

                         RIPLEY
               I didn't mean with you in it.

                         DICKIE
                   (standing)
               Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune
               anyway.

     He gets out, walks past Ripley, who doesn't turn around. But
     Dickie's reflected in the mirror. Ripley looks, then Dickie
     turns, holds his look momentarily before flicking him with
     his towel.

     INT/EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, NAPLES. DAY.

     An OFFICIAL is studying Dickie's passport photograph. It's
     not a recent picture. The official looks suspicious. Dickie
     is used to it.

                         DICKIE
               It is me. It's an old picture.
                   (sighs at Ripley)
               Every time - 'is it you?  Doesn't look
               like you'.

     He's signing for his allowance. He has a smart document case
     with his initials prominently embossed.  Ripley watches him
     sign and collect a large wad of notes.

                         CLERK
               Letters - Greenleaf, and for Ripley.

     Ripley collects and studies his mail. As they walk outside he
     holds up one letter to Dickie.

                         RIPLEY
               Fran.
                   (anticipating her letter)
               I miss you, where are you coming home?
               Stop telling me what a great time you're
               having, how you love Dickie... and Marge
               and...
                   (the next letter)
               And this one, I think, is your dad...

     INT. TRAIN TO ROME. DAY.

     Ripley sits reading the LETTER from Herbert Greenleaf.  He
     frowns, stops reading, looks out of the window.

                         DICKIE
               What does he say?

                         RIPLEY
               He's getting impatient. He wants me to
               reassure him you'll be home by
               Thanksgiving.

                         DICKIE
               You've got to get a new jacket. Really.
               You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm
               sick of seeing you in them.

                         RIPLEY
               I can't. I can't keep spending your
               father's money.

                         DICKIE
               I love how responsible you are. My Dad
               should make you Chief Accountant or
               something.  Let me buy you a jacket.
               There's a great place when we get to
               Rome, Batistoni.

     Ripley loves this idea and mouths the word, "Batistoni".

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Andiamo a Roma.  We're taking Tom to
               Roma!

     EXT. ARCARI'S CAFE, PIAZZA NAVONA, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley and Dickie sit outside at a Cafe in the Piazza Navona.
     Very smart, very sophisticated, very young crowd.  There are
     already several empty coffee cups and a half empty bottle of
     Frascati.  Ripley has his guide book out and is incredibly
     impatient. Dickie, meanwhile, has stretched out for the
     duration.

                         RIPLEY
               Where do we find a carozza for the Forum,
               or can we hire any of them - ?

                         DICKIE
               Relax.

                         RIPLEY
               It's just there's so much to do in a
               single day.

                         DICKIE
               Relax. The most important question is
               where to eat. I hope Freddie made a
               reservation.

                         RIPLEY
               Freddie?

                         DICKIE
               Freddie Miles.  You know - he's
               organizing the Cortina skiing trip.

     Ripley hates the idea of having this special day invaded. A
     horn makes him look up as FREDDIE MILES illegally parks his
     open top sports car opposite the cafe, sees Dickie and
     bustles over.  He's a heavy-set American with a reddish
     crewcut. Ripley finds him disgusting to look at. Dickie is
     delighted.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Frederico!

                         FREDDIE
               Ciao bello.
                   (noticing a beautiful woman in
                    an open-topped car)
               Don't you want to fuck every woman you
               see.  Just once.

     They kiss cheeks, continental-style.

                         DICKIE
               This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.

                         FREDDIE
                   (mugging)
               Hey, if I'm late, think what her
               husband's saying!

     He fills Dickie's glass with wine and drinks it standing up.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               So let's go. I got us a table outside at
               Fabrizio's.

     And Dickie's up, leaving Ripley to pick up all the tiny
     checks to work out the bill and pay it.

                         DICKIE
               I'll tell you - I am so cabin-crazy with
               Mongi.

     Freddie and Dickie link arms Italian-style and cross the
     street to Freddie's car.

                         FREDDIE
               I know.  I was there.
                   (looks back to see Ripley
                    struggling to settle the
                    check)
               Tommy!  It's S.R.O.  Two seater.
               Standing Room Only.  Chop, chop, Tommy!

     Ripley, abandoned, goes over. There's no room in the car. He
     has to crouch in the rear.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               You're going to have to sit between us.
               But don't put your shoes on the seat,
               know what I mean, put them one on top of
               the other.  Okay?

     INT. A JAZZ RECORD STORE. LATE AFTERNOON.

     This record store is hidden away down a cobbled alley, and
     stuffed with the trendiest Romans, all of whom rifle the
     stacks under a fog of cigarette smoke.  There are two
     LISTENING BOOTHS, one of which has Freddie and Dickie crammed
     into it, sharing a set of headphones.  Ripley stands outside
     the booth, holding both of their jackets like a manservant,
     while inside and behind the glass doors they chat animatedly.
     He looks longingly at the street, where the light is fading.
     Dickie catches his hangdog expression and pushes open the
     accordion doors.

                         DICKIE
               Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and
               meet some friends of Freddie's. The best
               thing is - if you want to be a tourist -
               grab a cab and we can meet up at the
               railway station.

                         RIPLEY
                   (absolutely crestfallen)
               What club?

                         DICKIE
               Freddie's arranged it with some of the
               skiing crowd. Come if you want but I
               thought you wanted to see the Forum...?

                         RIPLEY
               I did. And then maybe get the jacket and
               what have you...

                         FREDDIE
                   (from inside the booth)
               Dick - you've got to hear this!

                         DICKIE
                   (oblivious to Ripley's pain)
               Listen, just take one of mine when we get
               back. Don't worry about it.  I did the
               Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is
               enough in anyone's life.

     Ripley hands him the coats, turns away.

                         DICKIE
               Ciao.  Have fun.

     Ripley heads for the door, then comes back, raps on the
     booth.  Dickie pushes it open.

                         RIPLEY
               You said to make sure you didn't miss the
               train. It leaves at eight.

     EXT. THE CAPITOL. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley hikes up Michelangelo's Arcoeli Steps. Then he's
     looking down from the Campodoglio at the Forum below. Then
     he's walking by the oversized fragments of the Colossus. This
     is the real Ripley, the lover of beauty, inspired by art, by
     antiquity. He's awed. He's cold. He so much wishes he weren't
     alone.

     INT. ROME RAILWAY STATION. NIGHT.

     It's past eight, Ripley stands, one foot on the guard step of
     the Naples train, waiting forlornly for Dickie, then giving
     up as the train pulls away. He pulls the door to his
     compartment closed, and sits inside the train alone.

     INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

     There's music playing, Bing Crosby's "May I". Very loud.
     Ripley dances to the mirror, SPECTACLES ABANDONED and DRESSED
     AS DICKIE IN HIS TUXEDO, MINUS TROUSERS. He adjusts his hair,
     catches one of Dickie's expressions.  There are clothes
     abandoned everywhere.  He's been having a big dressing-up
     session. He sings along with Bing.

                         DICKIE (O/S)
               What are you doing?

     Ripley turns, horrified, to see Dickie standing in the
     doorway.  The music thumps away.

                         RIPLEY
               Oh - just amusing myself.  Sorry, Dickie.
                   (pause)
               I didn't think you were coming back.

     Dickie turns off the record player.

                         DICKIE
               I wish you'd get out of my clothes.

     Ripley starts undressing, his fingers clumsy with
     mortification and shock.  Dickie looks at his feet, shakes
     his head.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Shoes too?

                         RIPLEY
                   (lame, ashamed)
               You said I could pick out a jacket and I
               just... Sorry.

                         DICKIE
               Get undressed in your own room, would
               you?

                         RIPLEY
               I thought you'd missed the train.

                         DICKIE
               Freddie drove me back in his car.

                         RIPLEY
                   (horrified)
               Is Freddie here?

                         DICKIE
               He's downstairs.

                         RIPLEY
               I was just fooling around. Don't say
               anything. Sorry.

     Dickie lets him leave and then sits amongst the debris of the
     dressing-up session, not amused.

     EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. DAY.

     Ripley comes down, apprehensive, to find Marge and Dickie and
     Freddie having a jolly breakfast on the terrace. Dickie looks
     perfectly happy.

                         MARGE
               Hi, Tom.  Come join us.

                         FREDDIE
               I want this job of yours, Tommy. I was
               just saying - You live in Italy, sleep in
               Dickie's house, eat Dickie's food, wear
               his clothes, and his father picks up the
               tab. If you get bored, let me know, I'll
               do it!

     EXT. THE OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DAY.

     The boat is drifting.  Freddie and Dickie and Marge are
     swimming, then Marge climbs back onto the boat, where Ripley
     is sitting alone, reading.

                         MARGE
               You really should go in, it's marvellous.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm fine.

     She approaches him, conscious of his isolation. She's in a
     red bikini, and she towels herself dry as they speak.

                         MARGE
               Are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               Sure.

     They watch Dickie and Freddie fooling around in the water.

                         MARGE
               The thing with Dickie - it's like the sun
               shines on you and it's glorious, then he
               forgets you and it's very very cold.

                         RIPLEY
               So I'm learning.

                         MARGE
               He's not even aware of it. When you've
               got his attention you feel like you're
               the only person in the world. That's why
               everybody loves him. Other times...

     There's a yell from Dickie as Freddie wrestles with him.

                         DICKIE
                   (laughing and choking)
               He's drowning me!

                         MARGE
               It's always the same whenever someone new
               comes into his life - Freddie, Fausto,
               Peter Smith-Kingsley - he's wonderful -
               did you meet him, he's a musician? -
               ... and especially you, of course... and
               that's only the boys.

     They watch as Freddie pushes Dickie under the surface.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               Tell me, why is it when men play they
               always play at killing each other...?
               I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.

                         RIPLEY
               What about Cortina?

                         MARGE
               Didn't Dick say? - he talked to
               Freddie... apparently it's not going to
               work out -
                   (Ripley's devastated, Marge
                    notices, can't look at him)
               Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.

     EXT. OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DUSK.

     LATER and now the boat is sailing again. Ripley is sitting in
     his spot. Dickie and Freddie are at the tiller.

                         DICKIE
               Come on, Frederico, do you really have
               to go back?  At least stick around for
               the Festival of the Madonna.

                         FREDDIE
               I don't think so. Come back with me to
               Rome. There's this great new club.  Have
               some drinks, lotta ladies...

     Marge, still in her bikini, disappears into the cabin. Dickie
     makes a face at Freddie.

                         DICKIE
               Do you think you can steer this thing?

                         FREDDIE
               Sure.

                         DICKIE
               Just point her at Capri and avoid the
               rocks.

                         FREDDIE
               What are you doing?

                         DICKIE
               Marge-maintenance.

                         FREDDIE
               Aye, aye.

     Dickie heads towards the cabin. Freddie takes over the
     tiller. There's a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the
     water.

     From where Ripley sits he can see Capri in the distance, but
     he can also look down into the cabin, its porthole offering
     him a restricted view.  He looks down and there's a flash of
     flesh, then nothing.  Then as the boat swings with the waves,
     he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair, and then
     Marge's bare foot kicking out rhythmically, the red-painted
     toes straining.  Ripley's mesmerized, aroused, and absolutely
     betrayed.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               Tommy - How's the peeping? Come on Tommy,
               you were looking.  Tommy Tommy Tommy.

     Shamed, Ripley looks away. He stares at the water, parting
     before the boat, its turmoil reflecting his.

     EXT. DICKIE'S MOORING. DAY.

     The Bird returns to the mooring by Dickie's House.  Dickie as
     ever Captain of the Ship, clambering around, shouting
     instructions, with Ripley, Marge and Freddie as crew.  Ripley
     looks back at shore. Silvana stands watching, staring.
     Dickie notices her too.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO SLIPWAY. LATE DAY.

     A WOMAN'S HEAD suddenly breaks the surface of the water.

     It's a statue of the Virgin Mary, life size, adorned with
     flowers and a lace veil.  As she is revealed, wooden,
     staring, four men emerge, lifting the statue on a palette,
     wading towards the shore, the Madonna aloft on their
     shoulders.

     The whole town of Mongibello is in attendance for this Annual
     Festival of the Madonna del Mare, either standing in their
     fishing boats, or on shore and flanking the Parish Priest and
     altar boys and incense. RIPLEY, DICKIE and MARGE watch from
     Dickie's terrace. There are hymns and, as the statue is
     carried to the shore, the men's heads barely above the waves,
     the congregation applauds at the illusion that the Madonna is
     walking on water.

     Suddenly ANOTHER HEAD appears on the surface of the water,
     about fifty yards from the statue. There's a scream from
     among the crowd as someone notices the body. It's SILVANA.
     One of the MEN carrying the statue turns first towards the
     direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse.
     It's Silvana's fiancee, and in a second he has let go of the
     palette, CAUSING IT TO TOPPLE, and - in absolute grief -
     wades, swims, splashes towards the body.

     PANDEMONIUM in the crowd, which breaks up, with other people
     splashing, fully clothed, into the water. From the terrace,
     Ripley turns and looks at Dickie, catching his eye.

     EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. LATE DAY.

     Marge and Ripley and Dickie watch from the terrace as below
     them an AMBULANCE takes away the body. It seems as if the
     whole town looks on - fiancee, parents, brothers, sisters,
     police, priest, etc. As the corpse is loaded into the vehicle
     A BRIEF SCUFFLE occurs between Silvana's fiancee and her
     brother. They are pulled apart. Then the ambulance pulls
     away.

                         RIPLEY
               What's the fight about? That's her
               fiancÈ, isn't it?  Are they blaming him?

                         DICKIE
                   (sharp)
               I don't know! Why are you asking me?
                   (agitated)
               How can it take an hour to find an
               ambulance?

                         MARGE
                   (conciliatory)
               Well, she was already dead, darling,
               wasn't she, so I suppose -

                         DICKIE
               I don't know why people say this
               country's civilised. It isn't. It's
               fucking primitive.

     And with that HE KICKS OUT VIOLENTLY AT A CHAIR SUPPORTING
     THE RECORDPLAYER. Records, machine, chair go flying across
     the terrace. Dickie storms inside.

                         MARGE
               Dickie!

                         RIPLEY
               I'll go and see what's the matter.

                         MARGE
               I'll go.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Later, Dickie is slumped in an armchair at the open window
     overlooking the slipway. He's playing sax. A forlorn, keening
     phrase from YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS. Ripley appears,
     begins tidying the mess in the living room.  He picks up
     empty bottles, an abandoned bikini top.

                         RIPLEY
               I know why you're upset.
                   (Dickie continues playing)
               I know about Silvana, Dickie. About you
               and Silvana.

     Dickie stops playing.

                         DICKIE
               What about us?

     He now has an armful of dishes and glasses and bottles.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
                   (losing his temper)
               You don't have to clean up! Really!

     Ripley disappears into the kitchen.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
                   (as Ripley returns)
               She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do
               you know what that means in a place like
               this?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm prepared to take the blame.

                         DICKIE
               What are you talking about?

                         RIPLEY
               You've been so good to me. You're the
               brother I never had. I'm the brother you
               never had.

                         DICKIE
               She came to me for help, she needed
               money, and I didn't help her. I didn't
               help her. Now she's dead and it's my
               fault.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm not going to say anything - to Marge,
               or anybody, the police - It's a secret
               between us and I'll keep it.

     And he disappears again, leaving Dickie to resume the sax,
     somehow in thrall to Ripley.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               Dear Tom, I think the time has come to
               discontinue your expense checks...

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, NAPLES. DAY.

     Ripley and Dickie are walking out of the American Express
     Office, Dickie pushing the rest of his money into his case,
     Ripley - despondent - reading aloud extracts from a letter
     from Herbert Greenleaf -

                         RIPLEY
               ...The thousand dollars, of course, was
               only due in the event that you succeeded
               in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I
               hope the trip has afforded you some
               pleasure despite the failure of its main
               objective you need no longer consider
               yourself obligated to us in any way...

                         DICKIE
               You can't blame him.  You could hardly
               expect this to go on forever.

                         RIPLEY
               I thought you might write again. Now that
               we're brothers...

                         DICKIE
               I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've
               had a good run, haven't we?

                         RIPLEY
                   (increasingly miserable)
               What about Venice? Can we stick to that
               plan at least?

                         DICKIE
               I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on
               here without money.  It's time we all
               moved on.  Besides I'm sick of Mongi.
               Especially now with everything - I really
               want to move to the North. I need to
               check out San Remo next week, find
               somewhere new to keep the boat.
               But it would be great, though, if you
               came with me.  Our last trip before you
               leave. There's a jazz festival - we could
               say goodbye in style.  What do you think?
               A last trip?

     INT. TRAIN TO SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.

     Dickie and Ripley travel up to San Remo. They sit next to
     each other. Dickie's asleep. Ripley lays his head on Dickie's
     shoulder, but as he does that, the ticket inspector announces
     the San Remo stop, taps on the window and Dickie stirs. Then
     Ripley plays his familiar game of studying his face in the
     reflection of the train window, so that he can move his head
     and see his reflection, then back and see Dickie's.  Dickie
     suddenly catches him staring. Ripley looks away.

                         DICKIE
                   (terse)
               Why do you do that thing - with your
               neck? On trains you always do that thing,
               it's so spooky.

     EXT. HOTEL TERRACE RESTAURANT, SAN REMO. NIGHT.

     Dickie and Ripley walk through the terrace of an hotel which
     lips out towards the sea. There's a restaurant and palms and
     a JAZZ QUINTET playing, American. Very cool. They pass the
     band. Dickie's captivated as they head for their table. They
     pass some girls at a table. Dickie smiles greedily.

                         DICKIE
               This is more like it. Didn't I tell you
               San Remo was crazy!

     They're shown to a good table. Dickie watches the band while
     their glasses are filled with champagne. Ripley looks happy.
     He's got Dickie all to himself.

                         RIPLEY
               To Mongibello and the happiest days of my
               life.

                         DICKIE
               To Mongi.  You're cheerful tonight.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm suddenly quite happy to be going
               back.

                         DICKIE
               That's good.

                         RIPLEY
               I've got plans!

                         DICKIE
               Ripley's plans.

                         RIPLEY
               Esatto. I'm always planning.

                         DICKIE
               Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I
               didn't, did I?

                         RIPLEY
               Why are you asking all of a sudden?

                         DICKIE
               No reason. Because you're leaving, I
               guess. I don't think you were there, were
               you?

                         RIPLEY
               Why?

                         DICKIE
               I mean it as a compliment. You've got
               such great taste, I don't know. Most of
               the thugs at Princeton had tasted
               everything and had no taste. Used to say,
               the cream of America: rich and thick.
               Freddie's the perfect example.

                         RIPLEY
               Then I'll take it as a compliment.

                         DICKIE
               I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!

                         RIPLEY
                   (a beat)
               Ha.

                         DICKIE
               Do you even like jazz - or was that
               something for my benefit?

                         RIPLEY
                   (conceding, without guile)
               I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to
               like everything about the way you live.
               It's one big love affair. If you knew my
               life back home in New York...

     Dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert
     solo, doesn't hear the confession of love.

                         DICKIE
               I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what
               do you think about drums?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               So cool.

     He mimes a high-hat and snare. Ripley can't quite credit this
     - it's superficiality.

     EXT. MID OCEAN. DAY.

     The bay of San Remo. DICKIE and RIPLEY have hired a motor 
     boat.

                         DICKIE
               That's how I found my place in Mongi.
               Took a boat out round the bay.  The first
               place I liked, I got it.

     The motor boat is ploughing the waves. Dickie exhilarated by
     the speed.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie, slow down, come on!

     Ripley grips the oar, his knuckles white. Dickie cuts the
     motor, and the boat slows to a crawl, miles from the shore.

                         DICKIE
                   (ecstatic)
               I love it here! Gonna live here!

     Dickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of
     the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers,
     already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich.

                         RIPLEY
               I wanted to tell you my plan.

                         DICKIE
               So tell me.

                         RIPLEY
               I thought I might come back. In the New
               Year. Under my own steam.

                         DICKIE
                   (suddenly tight)
               Really?  To Italy?

                         RIPLEY
               Of course. Let's say, for argument's
               sake, you were here - perhaps we could
               split the rent on a house - I'll get a
               job - or, better still, I could get a
               place in Rome and when we're there we
               could be there and if we're here we could
               be here -

                         DICKIE
               Oh God, I don't think so.

                         RIPLEY
               - you see, particularly with the Marge
               problem, you can just blame me.

                         DICKIE
               Marge and I are getting married.

                         RIPLEY
                   (appalled)
               How?

                         DICKIE
               How?

                         RIPLEY
               Yesterday you're ogling girls on the
               terrace, today you're getting married.
               It's absurd.

                         DICKIE
               I love Marge.

                         RIPLEY
               You love me and you're not marrying me.

                         DICKIE
                   (cold)
               Tom, I don't love you.

                         RIPLEY
               No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained
               all of that.

                         DICKIE
               I'm actually a little relieved you're
               going, to be honest. I think we've seen
               enough of each other for a while.

     Ripley stares at him, his eyes suddenly reptilian.

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               You can be a leech - you know this - and
               it's boring. You can be quite boring.

                         RIPLEY
                   (volcanic)
               The funny thing - I'm not pretending to
               be somebody else and you are. I'm
               absolutely honest with you. I've told you
               my feelings. But you, first of all I know
               there's something - that evening when we
               played chess, for instance, it was
               obvious -

                         DICKIE
                   (incredulous)
               What evening?

                         RIPLEY
               Sure - I know, that's too dangerous for
               you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers,
               fine, then you do this sordid thing with
               Marge, fucking her on the boat while we
               all have to listen, which was
               excruciating, frankly, plus you follow
               your cock around like a - and now you're
               getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive
               me...you're lying to Marge then getting
               married to her, you're knocking up
               Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've
               got to play drums, which is it, Dickie,
               what do you really play?

     Dickie, furious, gets up, and lurches towards Ripley.

                         DICKIE
                   (attacking him, administering
                    tiny slaps as punctuation to
                    his tirade)
               Who are you - some imposter, some third
               class mooch - who are you to tell me
               anything? Actually, I really really
               really don't want to be on this boat with
               you, I can't move without you moving,
               which is exactly how it feels and it
               gives me the creeps.
                   (he goes to rev up the engine)
               I can't move without - "Dickie, Dickie,
               Dickie" - like a little girl.  You give
               me the -

     RIPLEY SMASHES HIM ACROSS THE HEAD WITH THE OAR. DICKIE SLIPS
     OFF THE WOODEN SEAT, HIS EYES ROLLING IN GROGGY SURPRISE.

                         RIPLEY
               Shut up! Just shut up! Just shut up!

     The boat slows as Dickie releases the tiller.  Dickie looks
     up at Ripley wearily and slides onto his back.

                         DICKIE
               For God's sake.

     Ripley, shocked at himself, goes to Dickie, rocking the boat,
     catches him up, then is horrified to see Dickie's face,
     apparently unmarked, SUDDENLY SPLIT OPEN, a line of blood and
     then a peeling like a fruit bursting. Ripley's appalled.  A
     terrible roar issues from Dickie as he launches himself at
     Ripley.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               I'll kill you!

     Ripley finds himself pushing him away, picking up the oar,
     kicking off Dickie's hand around his ankle. The boat is
     rocking and swerving crazily as Dickie falls against the
     tiller. Ripley almost loses his balance. His glasses come
     off. They struggle, locked together in a life or death
     wrestle to get control of the oar. Dickie's blinded by his
     own blood, loses his grip.

     Ripley, terrified, hits Dickie again and again, the oar like
     a carpet-beater banging down flat, blood on the blade, blood
     on Ripley, until he's on his knees, heaving for breath,
     letting his arm drop, then realizing, disgusted, that he's
     let it rest in a pool of blood. He starts to sob, sprawls
     there, sobbing, next to Dickie, horrified by what he's done.

     Nobody's in sight.  The boat rocks, gently, the sun sparkling
     indifferently on the waves.  Ripley lies by Dickie in the
     bottom of the boat, in the embrace he's always wanted.

     The pretty blue-and-white boat rocks peacefully.  The sea
     calms.

     EXT. A COVE NEAR SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.

     A deserted cove, several miles along the coast. Ripley
     clambers onto a rock over the shore.  He's watching the boat
     slowly sinking. Shuddering from the exertion, the cold, he
     finds Dickie's jacket, puts it on and watches as the boat
     disappears under the surface.

     EXT. SAN REMO. DUSK.

     Ripley walks back towards the hotel, still wearing Dickie's
     jacket, cold and wet, his bag over his shoulder.

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley approaches the front desk.  He's shivering.  He's not
     wearing his glasses.

                         RIPLEY
               Can I have my key, please?

                         RECEPTIONIST
                   (at the key rack)
               Of course - But you must be very cold?
               Signor Greenleaf?  Yes? -

                         RIPLEY
                   (mind racing)
               No, it's - I'm...

     EXT. ROAD BETWEEN NAPLES AND MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley sits on the bus as it rumbles towards Mongi.  He
     stares out of the window, full of what he's done. No idea
     what to do.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. DAY.

     The BUS comes into town. Ripley gets out, looks calm, very
     together.

     INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM, MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley walks into the living room, slowly approaches
     Dickie's saxophone which is on its stand on the table.  He
     can't get close to it, it evokes Dickie too much.

     INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. DAY.

     Ripley has Dickie's Hermes Baby typewriter on the desk and is
     busy writing letters. He has finished a letter to the
     Greenleafs, now he's at the end of one to Marge. We can read
     part of it - C/O American Express, Rome 9 November 1958. Dear
     Marge, this is a difficult letter for me to write... Ripley
     produces the Shakespeare and Signature page and COPIES
     DICKIE'S SIGNATURE at the end of the letter.

     EXT. MARGE'S GARDEN, MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley stands at the entrance to Marge's garden where she is
     working at her book on the outside table, surrounded by
     references and notes, held down by bricks. He looks at her
     until she looks at him. She's startled, gasps.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Marge.

                         MARGE
               Tom, you startled me!  You're back.

                         RIPLEY
               How are you? Sorry. Is your book going
               well?

                         MARGE
               Yes - I'm on a good streak, thanks.

                         RIPLEY
               I was just looking at you -
                   (looking at her tenderly)
               - so quiet.

                         MARGE
               Where's Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               I think he's planning on staying in Rome
               for a few days.

                         MARGE
                   (looks at him)
               Ha. Did he say why?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. I don't understand Dickie,
               Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.

                         MARGE
               What does that mean?

                         RIPLEY
               Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the
               next day I'm not, one day we're all one
               family, the next day he wants to be
               alone. You tell me.

                         MARGE
               Is that what he said - he wanted to be
               alone?

                         RIPLEY
               He was thinking of you, Marge - he asked
               me to deliver this.

     He hands her a package. She pulls at it, it's perfume.

                         MARGE
               Thanks. he knows I love this, although
               why it couldn't have waited...

                         RIPLEY
               Errand number one - deliver Marge's
               perfume. Errand number two, pack some
               clothes and his precious saxophone.

                         MARGE
                   (alarmed)
               How long's he staying for?

                         RIPLEY
               Search me. I guess we're abandoned.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, BEACH. EARLY MORNING.

     Marge is walking along the beach and out onto the jetty,
     forlorn, a bleached figure on this winter morning.

     INT. OFF FROM DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. MORNING.

     As Ripley walks down the stairs, Marge is at the icebox in
     the living room. She's fixing herself a drink, has the icebox
     open for ice. She's ashen, and might have been weeping, walks
     back into the kitchen area.

                         MARGE
               There was a letter from Dickie in with my
               perfume. You realize it's more than a few
               days? He's thinking of moving to Rome.

     She bangs out the ice onto the counter, cubes falling
     everywhere. Ripley drops to the floor and starts to clear
     them up.  She's got the letter, shows it to Ripley. He puts
     fresh ice into her glass.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               The thing is, the night before he left,
               we talked about moving, together, going
               North - and I suppose I put some pressure
               on him, about getting married, I just
               might have scared him off. There's a side
               to him, when our heads are on the pillow,
               I know no-one else sees it, which is
               really tender.
                   (unravelling)
               I think I should come with you to Rome
               and just confront him.

     Ripley lights a cigarette.  Marge loses confidence.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               He hates being confronted.

                         RIPLEY
               I think you're right.

     INT. ALBERGO GOLDONI, ROME. DAY.

     RIPLEY'S BATTERED CASES are carried into the tiny lobby of
     this small hotel. He exchanges his passport at the desk for
     his room key, then makes his way, carrying his own luggage to
     the metal cage elevator. THIS SCENE INTERCUTS WITH:

     INT. HOTEL GRAND. DAY.

     DICKIE'S ARRAY OF LEATHER LUGGAGE is pulled along on a 
     baggage trolley by a liveried PORTER.

     Dickie's passport slides across the marble desk. A key comes
     back, collected by a hand sporting Dickie's two distinctive
     rings.  As ALDO, the Front Desk Manager, inspects the
     passport, he looks at the owner.  Ripley wears a terrific
     suit, his hair parted in the Greenleaf style, no glasses. His
     voice, when he speaks, has the same, lazy, confident drawl.

                         ALDO
               Welcome back, Signor Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
                   (walking away)
               Thank you.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. DAY.

     The PORTER takes the cases and opens them as Ripley walks
     around the suite. It's large and splendid. Ripley breathes in
     its opulence.  He immediately picks up the telephone.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, I'd like you to telephone the Hotel
               Goldoni. Yes. I want to speak to Signor
               Thomas Ripley - No Ripley, R, yes.
               Grazie.

     He produces Dickie's pen and signs the blotter quickly - H R
     Greenleaf.  Then he pulls out a postcard from the writing
     case to reveal Dickie's Stars, hide your fires handwriting
     specimen. He compares the two signatures, is pleased.

     The telephone rings.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Pronto? Signor Ripley is not there? I'd
               like to leave a message. Yes. Please call
               Dickie - Dickie Greenleaf - at the Grand.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOTEL ROOM, GOLDONI. DAY.

     A tiny, cell of a room, single bed. Ripley on the phone.

                         RIPLEY
               He's not there?  Very well. I'll leave a
               message - Got your call. Dinner tonight
               sounds fine. Ripley.
                   (listens as it's read back)
               Dinner tonight, yes, is okay. Yes, thank
               you.

     INT. GUCCI STORE, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley has bought some more LEATHER GOODS - a briefcase and
     overnight bag. He is at the counter, signing checks.

                         RIPLEY
               I'd like these to have my initials -
               embossed, I don't know the word in
               Italian ...embossed?

                         GUCCI ASSISTANT
               Embossed, of course, Signor Greenleaf.

     There's an excited rap on the window and a shout of DICKIE!
     Shocked, Ripley looks over to find MEREDITH LOGUE outside,
     alone and delighted to see him.  He grins and mouths hello.

                         MEREDITH
                   (entering the shop)
               Dickie! Oh my God!  Ciao.

     EXT. ACROSS PIAZZA NAVONA TO ARCARI'S CAFE. DAY.

     Ripley and Meredith walk across the Piazza towards the cafe.

                         MEREDITH
               But you're going skiing with us Yankees,
               aren't you?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MEREDITH
               At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie
               Miles and -

                         RIPLEY
                   (interrupting, astonished)
               How did you know that?

                         MEREDITH
               Everybody knows Freddie Miles.

                         RIPLEY
                   (unsettled)
               Is Freddie in Rome?

                         MEREDITH
               Now? I don't think so. But I've met him,
               of course, and we've chatted and I know
               about you and Marge and Mongi and what an
               unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you
               were a rat and I thought to myself now I
               know why he travels under R.

                         RIPLEY
               I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So
               the rat's here now, in Rome.

                         MEREDITH
               Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if -

                         RIPLEY
               Don't be sorry. I've never been happier.
               I feel like I've been handed a new life.

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.

     Meredith and Ripley walk down the Spanish Steps and head
     inside the office.

                         MEREDITH
               The truth is if you've had money your
               entire life, even if you despise it,
               which we do - agreed? - you're only truly
               comfortable around other people who have
               it and despise it.

                         RIPLEY
               I know.

                         MEREDITH
               I've never admitted that to anyone.

     INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley's signing Dickie's allowance receipt. Meredith is with
     him, signing her own counterfoil. He is, of course, endorsed
     by her presence.  She goes to the window ahead of him.

     She takes her money, turns to him.

     He hands over his documents. The Clerk compares Ripley's
     signature with the one on the passport and then looks up at
     him. Ripley is cool as a cucumber.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't want too many large bills. Nobody
               will change them.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. ANOTHER DAY.

     Where A TAILOR is finishing the fitting of a cashmere jacket
     for Ripley. Bolts of cloth everywhere as Meredith adjudicates
     the possible materials, which the tailor holds up against
     Ripley.

                         MEREDITH
               Show me the other one again.
                   (the Tailor obliges)
               I like them both.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll take them both.

     Ripley goes inside the bedroom to change. While he's inside,
     Meredith shows the Tailor out.  As she returns she notices
     the open sax case, peers inside.

                         MEREDITH (O/S)
               I know you're a jazz fiend but do you
               absolutely hate the Opera?  I've been
               trying to give my tickets away, it's
               tomorrow, but if you were prepared to be
               dragged...

     She looks up to catch him bare-chested. She's intoxicated by
     him, the romance she feels to be in the air.

                         RIPLEY
                   (emerging)
               You could drag me.

     INT. THE OPERA HOUSE, ROME.

     On stage is Act Two of Eugene Onegin.  Lensky sings his aria
     before the duel with Onegin.

     Ripley's in a tuxedo, in a box which includes a glamorous
     Meredith and her AUNT AND UNCLE.  He knows what comes next.
     Lensky is shot by Onegin. Blood pours from his neck into the
     snow.  Onegin, horrified at the death of his friend, goes
     over, wraps Lensky in his cloak, the silk lining flashing,
     kneels holding him... Ripley can barely hide his emotion...
     Meredith watches her sensitive friend, entranced.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE BOXES, OPERA HOUSE, ROME.

     The Interval.  Ripley and Meredith exit their box with
     Meredith's Aunt and Uncle (who heads for the interval
     drinks).

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.

                         JOAN
               Can you bear it?  We hear you're a friend
               of Freddie's - he has I hate Opera
               tattooed on his chest.

                         RIPLEY
               There's room for a whole libretto on
               Freddie's chest.

                         JOAN
                   (laughs)
               I'm sure we've met.

     They reach the console where Uncle Ted has their drinks.

                         JOAN (cont'd)
               I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted?
               This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks, yes, I think we did.

                         JOAN
               One minute you people are children and
               the next you're getting tattooed.

     INT. OPERA HOUSE, FOYER. NIGHT.

     Ripley heads past the Beautiful People on his hunt for the
     Men's Room, and walks straight into a young and cultured
     Englishman.  They greet each other and suddenly MARGE is
     beside them.

                         MARGE
                   (as if she's seen a ghost)
               Oh my God. Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, how are you? What are you doing in
               Rome?

                         MARGE
               Is he here? Are you with Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               No.
                   (to Smith-Kingsley)
               Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.

                         PETER
               Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about
               you, of course - from Marge, and Dickie.

                         MARGE
                   (works out what's strange)
               No glasses.

     He fishes out the glasses.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Peter)
               Ditto.

                         PETER
               Where are you hiding him? He's
               impossible, isn't he?

                         MARGE
               Is he really not here?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera
               tattooed on his chest.

                         MARGE
               You were going to Venice.

                         PETER
               Yes, what happened? I heard you were
               desperate to come. I was looking forward
               to rowing you around.

                         RIPLEY
               I am.  I really am. And I've been
               travelling. I just can't seem to get that
               far north.

                         PETER
               Well hurry, before we sink.
                   (reaches into his jacket)
               Should I give you my telephone number in
               Venice?

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

     The INTERVAL BELL'S ringing. Peter hands over his card to
     Ripley, sees Meredith.

                         PETER
               Look there's Meredith thingy - who's
               that, Marge? - they're in textiles...
               Meredith -
                   (embarrassed at not
                    remembering)
               God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in
               her house...!

                         MARGE
               I don't know her.
                   (to Ripley)
               He hasn't called, he's hardly written,
               just these cryptic notes. You don't just
               dump people.

     The last INTERVAL BELL. There's a mini-stampede to return.

                         PETER
               Will we see you later?

                         RIPLEY
               I can't later.

                         PETER
               And tomorrow?

                         RIPLEY
               Tomorrow's possible. Do you know
               Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?

                         PETER
               I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?

                         RIPLEY
               Ten thirty?

                         PETER
               We'll be there.

                         RIPLEY
               Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.
                   (to Peter)
               It's really good to meet you.

     INT. BOX, OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT.

     Ripley goes straight to Meredith and grabs her.

                         RIPLEY
               Let's go.

                         MEREDITH
               I thought you were enjoying yourself?

                         RIPLEY
               Let's take a Carozza and look at the
               moon.

                         MEREDITH
               You're crazy! It's freezing out there.

     He's looking past her, where a mirror reflects Marge wading
     through the audience, Peter's elegant head getting
     dangerously near as they approach their seats.

                         RIPLEY
               C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the
               two of us.

                         MEREDITH
                   (quite taken)
               Okay then, you're crazy.

     EXT. CAROZZA, ROME. NIGHT.

     Meredith shivers in the raw night as they cross the Tiber.
     Ripley as Dickie is confessing his heart belongs to Marge.

                         MEREDITH
               Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.

                         RIPLEY
               You're such a pal to understand. It's as
               if Marge is here now - I look at you and
               I see her face - and I can't, whatever
               I'm feeling towards you - I just can't...

                         MEREDITH
               No, I absolutely understand. Of course.

                         RIPLEY
               Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.

                         MEREDITH
               Beating you away.

     EXT. MEREDITH'S APARTMENT, ROME.

     They arrive at the courtyard outside Meredith's Apartment
     Building. Ripley jumps down, collects her. She makes to go
     inside, then looks at him.

                         MEREDITH
               Will you meet me tomorrow?  Just to say
               goodbye in the daylight, properly? So
               it's not just this, it's too...you should
               always save pain for daylight...

                         RIPLEY
               Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll
               meet you. Let's have coffee in the
               morning at Dinelli's.

                         MEREDITH
                   (fluttering)
               I don't - is that by the Spanish Steps?

                         RIPLEY
               Exactly. 10.30 -
                   (instantly correcting himself)
               10.15.

     He gets back into the carozza. It moves off.

     EXT. DINELLI'S CAFE, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. MORNING.

     Meredith sits waiting in a cafe at the bottom of the Spanish
     Steps. Ripley, dressed as Ripley, is at the top of the steps,
     among early tourists, watching as she drinks her coffee at an
     outside table. Then Marge and Peter appear walking up the Via
     Condotti, head for another table, don't see Meredith.  She
     acknowledges Peter who hasn't noticed her.

                         MEREDITH
               Peter? Hello, it's Meredith Logue.

                         PETER
               Of course it is, Meredith, hello, I'm
               sorry, half-asleep, how are you? This is
               Marge Sherwood. Meredith Logue.

                         MARGE
               Hello.

     Hearing Marge's name Meredith reacts, freezes.

                         PETER
               Join us, won't you? We're just waiting
               for a friend. Do you know, I wonder did
               we see you at the Opera last night?

                         MEREDITH
               I won't actually, although I think this
               might - are you waiting for Dickie?

                         PETER
               Well no, as it happens, although...

                         MARGE
                   (stunned at the mention of his
                    name)
               Dickie? Do you know Dickie?

                         MEREDITH
               You were at the Opera? Well, that
               explains - yes I was there. I was there
               with Dickie.

                         MARGE
                   (to Peter)
               I told you! I knew it!

                         MEREDITH
                   (moving over to them)
               Marge, I don't know you, so I have no
               right, but Dickie loves you.  He's - I
               think you'll find he's coming home to
               you.

                         MARGE
                   (proprietorial)
               How would you know that?

                         MEREDITH
               He told me everything. I was supposed to
               meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I...I'm
               going to go now, I think. Unless he meant
               us to meet - which would be a little
               cruel, wouldn't it?

                         PETER
               No, we're meeting another friend. Tom
               Ripley.

                         MARGE
               Do you know Tom?

                         MEREDITH
               Ripley? No. I heard about him, of course,
               but no, I didn't meet him.

     The WAITER has arrived to take orders. Meredith indicates
     she's leaving.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               Not for me. No, grazie.

     Marge is on the edge. Peter lays a hand to comfort her.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               I hope I didn't complicate matters, but
               nothing, nothing untoward happened,
               nothing to prevent you from welcoming him
               back, from marrying him...Goodbye.
               Goodbye Peter, please don't get up.

     Peter gets up. Ripley, from his vantage point at the top of
     the steps, watches Meredith leave and walk off into the
     crowd. He begins the slow walk down towards the square. As he
     becomes visible to the cafe, he starts to hurry. He's
     apologising to Marge and Peter as they see him, in his
     element, lying and believing in his lie.

                         RIPLEY
               Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers.
               Italian bureaucracy - never one stamp
               when they can make you line up for three.
               Have you been waiting long?

                         PETER
               Not at all. Morning Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Hi.
                   (to Marge)
               Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've
               seen a ghost...

                         MARGE
               Dickie was at the Opera last night.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't
               drag Dickie to -

                         MARGE
               He was there with someone. So I suppose
               she must have dragged him - that's not
               fair.  I'm going back to Mongi. I think
               Dickie's coming home.
                   (to Peter)
               I'm going to go home.

                         RIPLEY
               Really? That's swell. No, I was just -
               you're way ahead of me! Great!

                         PETER
               We think he's had a change of heart.
                   (to Marge)
               So we should be celebrating.

                         MARGE
               I hope so.

                         PETER
                   (to Marge)
               That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith
               said -
                   (to Ripley)
               Meredith's the American girl I saw last
               night, I know her, at the Opera, she's
               been seeing something of Dickie -

                         RIPLEY
               My God.

                         PETER
               But the point is Dickie - well we know
               this - Dickie loves Marge and he misses
               her and apparently he's come to his
               senses...

                         RIPLEY
               It's fantastic.
                   (to Peter)
               I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand
               this, but anytime Dickie does something I
               feel guilty.

     INT. APARTMENT, PALAZZA GIOIA. DAY.

     Ripley is being shown an APARTMENT FOR RENT in the Palazzo
     Gioia by a dry-witted older woman, SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley
     explores, relishing the decor.

                         SIGNORA BUFFI
               Accendo il riscaldamento.
               (I'll turn the heating on.)

                         RIPLEY
                   (mimes playing sax)
               Mi piace suonare.
               (I like to play music.)

                         SIGNORA BUFFI
                   (shrugs)
               Io sono sorda. Quelli di sotto, una
               coppia, sono sordi. Allora, ti piace?
               (I'm deaf. The couple below are deaf. So,
               do you like it?)

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley is in the apartment, fire burning, wearing pyjamas.
     There's a small Christmas tree. He kneels on the floor with
     some festive, gift-wrapped packages. He opens a package. It's
     a marble head of Hadrian. A gasp from Ripley. He picks up a
     glass, pours himself a drink.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley plunges into Bach's Italian Concerto on his new and
     precious toy, a STEINWAY GRAND. His doorbell rings. He stops
     playing. He doesn't get visitors. He rises, a little nervous.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello?

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               Who is it?

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               It's Freddie. Let me in.

     RIPLEY ALMOST COLLAPSES. He's faint.

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Dickie, come on, it's me.

     Ripley can't think what to hide, where to hide. He opens the
     door.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.

                         FREDDIE
                   (confused, not pleasantly)
               Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at
               dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?

                         FREDDIE
               I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm.
               If you said he was still at lunch I'd
               believe you. Incredible. The guy has
               disappeared off the face of the earth.

                         RIPLEY
               I guess.

                         FREDDIE
               The landlady - as far as I could tell,
               the landlady said he was here right now.

                         RIPLEY
               He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I
               can't think why you would imagine Dickie
               would hide from you.

                         FREDDIE
               Because he's been hiding from me - what
               happened at Christmas?

                         RIPLEY
               What about Christmas?

                         FREDDIE
               He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't
               get a cable or a call or a note or,
               frankly, a fart.

     Ripley has his hands behind his back. HE'S TUGGING
     FRANTICALLY AT DICKIE'S RINGS. Ripley wanders into the
     kitchen, turns on the tap to sluice his fingers.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               Of course, he's been very involved in his
               music, hasn't he? I think his theory is,
               you know, you have to go into a cocoon
               before you can become a butterfly.

                         FREDDIE
               Which is horseshit.  Have you heard him
               play that thing?
                   (gesturing at the sax on its
                    stand)
               He can't.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
                   (casually)
               How did you find him? It's such an out of
               the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?

                         FREDDIE
               No thanks.
                   (explaining his detective work)
               Some kid at the American Express Office.
                   (he starts to explore)
               Are you living here?

     Now he starts to hammer a nasty boogie-woogie on the piano.

                         RIPLEY
                   (returning, flinching)
               No. No, I'm staying here for a few days,
               in Rome.  That's a new piano, so you prob -

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Did this place come furnished? It doesn't
               look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? - so
               bourgeois.

     Now he's poking at the Hadrian bust.

                         RIPLEY
               You should watch that!

                         FREDDIE
               In fact the only thing which looks like
               Dickie is you.

                         RIPLEY
               Hardly.

                         FREDDIE
               Have you done something to your hair?

     Ripley starts to smile, his eyes darting around the room.

                         RIPLEY
               Freddie, do you have something to say?

                         FREDDIE
               What? I think I'm saying it. Something's
               going on. He's either converted to
               Christianity - or to something else.

                         RIPLEY
               I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself.
               Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the
               Corso.

                         FREDDIE
               Is it on "delle Croce, just off the
               Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you?
               Last time you didn't know your ass from
               your elbow, now you're giving me
               directions. That's not fair, you probably
               do know your ass from your elbow. I'll
               see you.

     AND HE'S GONE. Ripley shuts the door, smooths the silk runner
     on the table where Freddie's hand had rucked it. He goes back
     to the door, opens it and looks over the rail.

     INT. LANDING AND STAIRS, RIPLEY'S BUILDING. LATE DAY.

     FREDDIE IS BACK IN CONVERSATION WITH SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley
     can't make out the text but there's some discussion about
     Signor Greenleaf and Signor Ripley. Ripley hurries inside as
     Freddie's heavy shoes start to clump up the stairs again.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. LATE DAY.

     Freddie knocks on the door which pushes open. As he marches
     in, he launches into his interrogation.

                         FREDDIE
               Ripley? There's someth -

     - AND WALKS STRAIGHT INTO THE HEAD OF HADRIAN WHICH RIPLEY
     SWINGS AT HIM, HOLDING ON AWKWARDLY WITH BOTH HANDS TO THE
     HEAVY MARBLE SCULPTURE.

     Freddie falls like an ox, first to his knees, groaning, then
     to the floor as Ripley brings the head down again, beating
     him downwards. As Freddie slumps away, Ripley loses his
     balance and the head sends Freddie a glancing blow before
     slipping from Ripley's grasp and smashing on to the floor.
     THE NOSE IS CHIPPED OFF.

     EXT. PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     It's deserted. Ripley hauls Freddie out of the shadows
     towards the car. A couple walk across the square. Ripley
     talks to Freddie, berating him for his drunken stupor. He
     pushes him over the door and into the passenger seat.

                         RIPLEY
                   (mimicking Freddie's voice)
               Hey, if I'm drunk, think what her
               husband's saying.

     EXT. VIA APPIA ANTICA. NIGHT.

     The Fiat noses along THE APPIAN WAY. Black fragments of tombs
     punctuate either side of the poorly lit road. Inside the car,
     Ripley looks to left and right for a place to dump the body.
     He slows near a clump of trees.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. EVENING.

     Someone is KNOCKING urgently at the door. Ripley opens it,
     finds himself face to face with Signora Buffi and TWO
     POLICEMEN. One of them offers his hand.

                         ROVERINI
               Dickie Greenleaf?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes?

                         ROVERINI
               Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. EVENING.

     Ripley sits with his head in his hands at the table. Roverini
     and his sergeant, BAGGIO, watch patiently.

                         ROVERINI
               It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did
               Signor Miles leave yesterday?

                         RIPLEY
               I can't be absolutely sure - 8? 9? We'd
               both taken on far too many drinks - but
               it was dark, it was certainly dark when I
               walked him down to his car.

                         ROVERINI
               So Signor Miles drove away and you did
               what?

                         RIPLEY
               I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but
               I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks.
               I've suffered all day. Who found him?

     Roverini has walked over to the bust of Hadrian.

                         ROVERINI
               Senta.  We have to ask you to stay in
               Rome.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.

                         ROVERINI
               So, the Doctor, he has to make the -
                   (looks at Baggio)
               - come se dice?

                         RIPLEY
               Postmortem?

                         ROVERINI
               Yes, exactly, but his first, his first
               conclusion was that Signor Miles was
               killed not later than seven o'clock
               yesterday evening.

                         RIPLEY
               Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he
               drove off in his car.

                         ROVERINI
               No.

     EXT. NARROW STREET, THE GHETTO, ROME. MORNING.

     Ripley comes through a dark tunnel in the Ghetto on his
     scooter. He drives past a furniture store, DRESSING TABLES
     AND MIRRORS spilling out onto the street. He glances
     sideways, sees his reflection fractured into several images
     and, for an instant, it seems AS IF DICKIE'S THERE
     WATCHING HIM. Ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the
     pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along
     the cobbled passage. The man he thought to be Dickie, an
     Italian, runs up concerned.

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. DAY.

     Ripley emerges from the American Express Office. Across the
     street at the cafe, as once before, sits Marge. Ripley slips
     Dickie's bag into his knapsack as he approaches his scooter.
     Marge spots him and strides across the piazza. She is in no
     mood for pleasantries.

                         MARGE
               Did he kill Freddie?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, when did you get here?

                         MARGE
               Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?

                         RIPLEY
               I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.

                         MARGE
               I tried again, waiting here, watching for
               him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look
               for Dickie I find you.

                   (focusing on Ripley's cuts and
                    bruises)
               What happened to your face?

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie did it.

                         MARGE
                   (suddenly tense)
               Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               My face! There was an argument. I said
               some things I shouldn't have.  About you.
               About the appalling way he's treating
               you, all of us.  And the next thing I
               know he's launched himself at me.
                   (he pulls the scooter off the
                    stand)
               Are you getting on?

                         MARGE
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               Get on. I'll take you to him.

     EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. DAY.

     Ripley and Marge come round the corner on the scooter. The
     entrance to the Palazzo is blocked by a couple of police cars.
     Inspector Roverini emerges from one of them. Ripley,
     startled, drives straight past the entrance.

     EXT. ROME STREET, BY THE RIVER. DAY.

     Ripley pulls up several hundred yards later, in a different
     piazza full of book stalls.  Marge is confused.

                         MARGE
               Where does Dickie live?

                         RIPLEY
               We passed it a few blocks back, where the
               police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They
               don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not
               going to incriminate Dickie -

                         MARGE
               Perhaps I shouldn't go either.

                         RIPLEY
                   (thinking hard, distracted)
               No, well go if you want to, but don't
               talk to the Police about my face - they
               find out he hit me - he's got a temper - he
               could've hit Freddie.
                   (sincerely)
               Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you
               later.

     And he drives off. At the first opportunity HE DOUBLES BACK
     and roars towards the Palazzo.

     EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley drives towards the entrance.  As Ripley gets off and
     pushes his scooter through the doorway SOME JOURNALISTS,
     LOITERING INSIDE A BARBER'S SHOP come running out and swarm
     around him with questions about Freddie. One of them gets off
     a photograph.  It's chaos, a Police Officer shouts him away
     as Ripley puts up a protective hand and runs inside.

     INT. ENTRANCE AND STAIRS, PALAZZO GIOIA. CONTINUOUS.

     As Ripley hurries inside he encounters officers conducting
     more thorough forensic investigations in the stairwell. On a
     landing is Roverini. Ripley hurries towards him.

                         RIPLEY
               Can we go up? Do you mind?

                         ROVERINI
               Of course. What happened to your face?

                         RIPLEY
               My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by
               photographers.

     He hurries up the stairs, Roverini in tow.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
                   (agitated)
               The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm
               feeling hounded - do you think you could
               not give out my address?

                         ROVERINI
               Never. We've had many requests and, of
               course, we say no - even to your fiancÈe.

                         RIPLEY
               I really don't want to see anybody.

                         ROVERINI
               Even your fiancÈe...?

                         RIPLEY
               Even her.

                         ROVERINI
               What about Thomas Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               What about Ripley?

     Ripley's way ahead and has reached the door of his apartment.
     He waits nervously for Roverini. He unlocks the door and can
     barely wait for Roverini to catch up.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.

     Roverini follows Ripley inside, Baggio hurries in behind him.

                         ROVERINI
               You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo,
               is that right?

     Ripley is appalled. He smiles.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That
               was months ago.

                         ROVERINI
               November, I thought.

                         RIPLEY
               Was it? Did you speak to Tom?

                         ROVERINI
               November 7th is my information.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't remember the exact date.

                         ROVERINI
               And when did you last see Signor Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               A few days ago.

                         ROVERINI
               Does he stay with you here?

                         RIPLEY
               No!

                         ROVERINI
               No.  Here is a pattern. Two days ago
               Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves your
               apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a
               little boat is found in San Remo full of
               rocks, and the owner tells the Police it
               was stolen on November 7th. We look at
               hotel records and we see oh! Dickie
               Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then
               our boatman remembers two Americans
               taking a boat.

                         RIPLEY
               It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence.
               There must be fifty hotels in San Remo,
               there must have been a hundred people
               renting a boat on that day.

                         ROVERINI
               31 people.

                         RIPLEY
               31 people.

     Baggio appears. Speaks to Roverini. Ripley is getting cranky.

                         ROVERINI
               That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge
               Sherwood.

                         RIPLEY
                   (appalled, defeated)
               Let her in, what's the difference?  Let
               her in.
                   (Baggio is on his way to the
                    door.)
               No, actually, no, I'd like it very much
               if you would ask her to come back later.

     Roverini nods, mutters to Baggio, who heads out.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Thank you.

                         ROVERINI
                   (watching him)
               May I ask...why would you speak to your
               friend and not your fiancÈe?

                         RIPLEY
               I think I just said. Ripley was handling
               some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley
               want to marry me.  Nor did he ask me
               every day if I would marry him. And when.

                         ROVERINI
               Do you have a photograph of Signor
               Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm not in the habit of carrying around
               photographs of my male friends.

                         ROVERINI
               Now I think I have upset you. My English
               perhaps is coarse.

                         RIPLEY
               It is a little coarse, yes.

                         ROVERINI
               Sorry.  No-one has seen Signor Ripley
               since San -

                         RIPLEY
               I have!

                         ROVERINI
               You have, yes.

                         RIPLEY
               No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask
               her! and if I could remember which hotel
               he was staying at - the Goldoni! - Tom
               was staying at the Goldoni.

                         ROVERINI
               Good. The Goldoni. Yes - you're right. A
               coincidence.
                   (he gets up to leave)
               I look forward to our next meeting when I
               will be more careful with my English and
               persuade you to play me your saxophone.
               Alto.

                         RIPLEY
               Absolutely.

                         ROVERINI
                   (suddenly turning)
               I have a witness who thinks they saw two
               men getting into Mr Miles' car. She
               wants to identify you in a - confronto -
               line-up.
                   (ominously)
               Tomorrow then?

                         RIPLEY
                   (thrown, scrabbling)
               Tomorrow.

     Ripley lets them out, heaves a heavy sigh, then peeps through
     the door, looks down to see Roverini speaking to Marge on the
     stairs.

                         ROVERINI (O/S)
               Buongiorno, Miss Sherwood.  He's in but I
               really don't think he wants to see
               anyone.

     Ripley leans against the door, the noose tightening, then
     suddenly a voice shocks him upright.

                         MARGE
               Dick? Dickie? I know you can hear me.
               What am I doing, chasing you around...?
               I was going to say I would count to three
               and if you didn't open the door, but I
               won't count any more. On you. I won't
               count on you any more. Whatever it is,
               whatever you've done or haven't done,
               you've broken my heart. That's one thing
               I know you're guilty of, and I don't know
               why, I don't know why, I just don't know
               why...

     Ripley listens, there's a silence, then Marge's footsteps as
     they ring out on the stone stairs. The tapping sound resolves
     into the tap-tap of a manual typewriter.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley's at the typewriter, he begins to type.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               My dear Tom, I'm getting out of this.
               Freddie's death, Silvana. I've thought
               about going to the police, but I can't do
               it, I can't face it.  I can't face
               anything anymore...

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     CHAOS.  Ripley is working quickly, selecting clothes,
     dividing them into TWO PILES - one for Dickie's trunk, one
     for his own battered suitcase. He puts the license plates
     from Freddie's car in Dickie's luggage. He has placed one
     shirt on the Ripley pile then checks again, and - on seeing
     Dickie's initials, places it with the bigger pile, then picks
     it up again and holds it briefly against his cheek.

     He takes Dickie's rings, opens up a LITTLE BOX of buttons and
     needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in. Dickie's
     leather writing case goes on the big pile, too, as do cuff
     links, ties, the Mont Blanc, Dickie's passport, which he
     opens to scratch at the photograph, obliterating the face.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               ...I wish I could give you the life I
               took for granted. You've always
               understood what's at the heart of me,
               Tom. Marge never could. I suppose that's
               why I'm writing this to you, the brother
               I never had. The only true friend I ever
               had. In all kinds of ways you're much
               more like the son my father always
               wanted. I realise you can change the
               people, change the scenery, but you can't
               change your own rotten self. Now I can't
               think what to do, or where to go. I'm
               haunted by everything I've done, and
               can't undo. I'm sorry, I can't go on.
               I've made a mess of being Dickie
               Greenleaf haven't I?

     He's finished the letter, signs it, puts it in an envelope
     marked Tom Ripley and places the letter on top of the piano
     next to Dickie's passport. His head is reflected in the
     distorting curve of the lid. As he puts on his glasses
     there's a moment when there are two heads slowly separating,
     as Ripley leaves behind his brief life as Dickie Greenleaf.

     INT. BASEMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley carries Dickie's luggage down into THE COMMUNAL
     BASEMENT of the Gioia, a wretched place full of shadows and
     gloom and the overflow from thirty apartments. A red plush
     couch sits on top of a mound of furniture.  He finds some
     dustsheets and shoves the cases under them. Then Dickie's
     saxophone.

     Outside the small window, Ripley sees uniformed feet and the
     revolving blue light of a Police Car. He shrinks back, turns
     off the light and disappears into the dark, illuminated
     fitfully by the strobe of cold blue.

     EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA, ROME. NIGHT.

     Ripley, familiar battered luggage in tow, appears at the
     entrance of the building next to his own, glances at the
     police car parked opposite the big doors, then hurries off
     into the darkness.

     EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley's briefly silhouetted as he scuttles down an alley,
     hurrying towards a gate, and disappears behind it.

     EXT. PIAZZALE ROMA, VENICE. DAWN.

     Ripley sits next to his battered luggage at the prow of a
     MOTOR TAXI as it surges towards Venice at dawn. Peter Smith-
     Kingsley waits on the quay. Ripley waves. Peter waves back.

                         PETER
                   (indicating the taxi stop)
               I'll see you over there!

     EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. EARLY MORNING.

     Ripley and Peter walk through the square, the pigeons
     scattering. Ripley breathes in the atmosphere, the beautiful
     grey.

                         RIPLEY
               Peter, I'm really sorry to put you
               through this. I just couldn't face going
               to the police by myself when my Italian's
               so rotten.

                         PETER
               Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted
               you finally made it to Venice. I'm
               delighted, contrary to rumour, you're
               still in one piece?

                         RIPLEY
               What rumour?

                         PETER
               That Dickie murdered you and is
               travelling under your passport. I know,
               ridiculous.

     INT. POLICE STATION, VENICE. LATE DAY.

     Later.  Ripley sits in the middle of a bustling Police Station,
     where thefts, tourists, thieves and complaints are being
     processed.  The Station is in an old brewery or armory. It's a
     horrible, monochrome, oppressive place. Peter is in
     conversation at a desk, turns and walks over to where Ripley
     waits.

                         PETER
               Welcome to Venice.  This place reeks,
               doesn't it? Can you smell it?  Ugh.
               Sorry. Not the best way to spend your
               first day.

                         RIPLEY
               It's okay.

                         PETER
               Anyway I've got to the bottom of the
               delay. Finally.  We're waiting for
               someone from Rome.

                         RIPLEY
                   (completely thrown)
               What do you mean?  They're sending
               someone from Rome?

                         PETER
               That's good, isn't it?

                         RIPLEY
                   (as if suffocating)
               No, but I thought that didn't happen in
               Italy, that each region was completely
               separate! I was sure that was the -

                         PETER
               You've seen the papers, you know what a
               big deal it's been here. American tourist
               murdered -

                         RIPLEY
               It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned
               the stench I can hardly breathe.

     A door opens. COLONEL VERRECCHIA, fresh from Rome, and a
     sullen wedge of a man, comes in, scowling at the couple.
     Ripley dare not look up in case it's Roverini.  A POLICEMAN
     introduces him.

                         POLICEMAN
               Colonelo Verrecchia della Polizia di
               Roma.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (to Peter, in Italian)
               Qui e Ripley?  Who is Ripley?

                         PETER
                   (in Italian)
               Lui. Him.

     Verrecchia strides past them and into a smaller, interview
     room at the back of the station.  His manner is ominous.

     INT. POLICE STATION, INTERVIEW ROOM, VENICE. LATE DAY.

     This room is not at all friendly. There is evidence of a
     locked area for cells at one wall.  A small, sour window
     gives onto a canal.  The main station is glimpsed through
     some internal windows. Peter and Ripley come through.

     Verrecchia sits down.  Verrecchia talks in staccato Italian,
     during which Peter translates.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in
               seguito alla negativa valutazione delle
               disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con
               il mio predecessore Roverini che come e
               noto non e riuscito a impedire il
               verificarsi della scomparsa del signor
               Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona
               al momento passibile di incriminazione
               del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               He's taken over the case because...
               they're annoyed the previous chap let
               Dickie...disappear when he was the only,
               he was the only suspect in Freddie's
               murder.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il
               signor Ripley ha visto il signor
               Greenleaf?
               (When was the last time Ripley saw
               Greenleaf?)

     Ripley forgets he's not supposed to have much Italian and
     answers.

                         RIPLEY
               In Rome, about three weeks ago.
                   (shrugs)
               I knew that one.

                         PETER
                   (giving Ripley a look)
               A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               Where have you been since then?

                         RIPLEY
               I've been backpacking.

                         PETER
               I don't know how to translate that.
                   (he tries)
               E difficile....il signor Ripley
               ....dormiva all'aperto, con un...

                         VERRECCHIA
               All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?

                         PETER
               He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping
               outside.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze
               omosessuali?

                         PETER
               Are you a homosexual?
                   (then as himself)
               Interesting non-sequitur.

                         RIPLEY
               No.

                         PETER
                   (translates for him)
               No.
                   (as Peter, drily)
               By the way, officially there are no
               Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo,
               Michelangelo very inconvenient.

                         RIPLEY
               Tell him I have a fiancÈe, Dickie has a
               fiancÈe and Freddie Miles probably had a
               string of them.

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il
               signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e
               probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha
               molte fidanzate.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (laughs)
               Mamma mia, quante fidanzate!

     They all laugh.

                         RIPLEY
               What did he say?

                         PETER
               He says so many fiancÈes.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (suddenly very tough)
               Lei ha ucciso prima Freddie Miles e dopo
               Dickie Greenleaf! Vero?

     As Peter translates Verrecchia watches intently.

                         PETER
               He wants to know if you killed Freddie
               Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?

                         RIPLEY
                   (outraged)
               No I did not. I did not kill Freddie
               Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf.  Is
               he accusing me?
                   (Peter clearly doesn't ask)
               Ask him if he's accusing me!

                         PETER
               He's already angry, I don't think -

                         RIPLEY
                   (interrupting, heated)
               Just because he doesn't like Americans!

                         VERRECCHIA
               Non e questo il luogo per le vostre
               conversazioni private!  (This is not the
               place for your private conversations)

                         PETER
                   (appeasing him)
               A ragione.  A ragione.  (You're right.
               You're right.)

                         VERRECCHIA
               Hmm. C'e questa...  (There's this...)

     Verrecchia hands over a letter. It's opened. Ripley's name on
     the outside. Ripley stares at it.

                         VERRECCHIA
                         (cont'd)
               Questa lettera e stata trovata
               nell'abitazione del signor Richard
               Greenleaf a Roma.

                         PETER
               They found this in Dickie's place in
               Rome.

                         RIPLEY
               You opened this?

                         VERRECCHIA
               Of course!

     He stands and takes the letter out.  Begins to read. He has
     the look of a man whose privacy has been violated.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Peter)
               It's a suicide note.
                   (to Verrecchia)
               You ask me all these questions and you've
               already read this suicide note?

     INT. PETER SMITH-KINGSLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     There's music everywhere - and stands - and posters of
     performances and PHOTOGRAPHS OF PETER CONDUCTING. Peter is an
     opera repetiteur. Ripley is sitting at Peter's piano, playing
     from the score of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater. Peter's made supper.
     He's setting the table.

                         PETER
               Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill
               Freddie, what must that be like? To wake
               up every morning, how can you? Just wake
               up and be a person, drink a coffee...?

                         RIPLEY
               Whatever you do, however terrible,
               however hurtful - it all makes sense,
               doesn't it? inside your head. You never
               meet anybody who thinks they're a bad
               person or that they're cruel.

                         PETER
               But you're still tormented, you must be,
               you've killed somebody...

                         RIPLEY
               Don't you put the past in a room, in the
               cellar, and lock the door and just never
               go in there? Because that's what I do.

                         PETER
               Probably. In my case it's probably a
               whole building.

                         RIPLEY
               Then you meet someone special and all you
               want to do is toss them the key, say open
               up, step inside, but you can't because
               it's dark and there are demons and if
               anybody saw how ugly it was...

     Peter's come over, stands behind him over the piano.

                         PETER
               That's the music talking. Harder to be
               bleak if you're playing Knees up Mother
               Brown.

     He vamps this vaudeville song over Ripley's shoulder.

                         RIPLEY
               I keep wanting to do that - fling open
               the door - let the light in, clean
               everything out. If I could get a huge
               eraser and rub everything out...starting
               with myself...the thing is, Peter, if...

                         PETER
                   (as Ripley falls silent)
               No key, huh?

     INT. SANTA MARIA DELLA PIETA, BRIDGE OF SIGHS. DAY.

     A YOUNG BOY SINGS the soprano part of Vivaldi's STABAT MATER.
     A piercingly pure sound in Vivaldi's own church.  The
     orchestra - rehearsing - is conducted by Peter from the
     organ.

     Ripley slips in at the back of the church. He stands and
     listens. Peter sees him, smiles.  Ripley smiles back.

     EXT. VENICE, S.LUCIA RAILWAY STATION. DAY.

     MARGE appears on the steps, carrying an overnight bag. Ripley
     and Peter have come to meet her.

                         MARGE
                   (kissing him warmly)
               Hello Peter, so good to see you.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Marge!

                         MARGE
                   (coolly)
               Tom.

     They walk towards the Vaporetto.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               So you found Peter...

                         PETER
               I think we sort of found each other.

     Marge smiles enigmatically. Ripley registers.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               Where's Dickie's father?

                         MARGE
               He's not coming till the morning.
               Evidently his stomach - I don't think the
               food here is agreeing with him.

                         RIPLEY
               I was looking forward to seeing him.

                         MARGE
               Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of
               that. There's a private detective on the
               case now - a Mr MacCarron - Dickie's
               father's employing him.

                         RIPLEY
               That's a terrific idea.

                         MARGE
               He's American. He's already discovered
               Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day
               before he disappeared.

     They step onto the Vaporetto.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               Is that what you do before you jump in
               the Tiber?  I don't think so.

     EXT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY.

     The boat arrives at the entrance to the house. Peter opens
     the door as Ripley collects Marge's bags.

                         MARGE
                   (to Peter)
               Is this you?

                         PETER
               No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?

                         MARGE
               Golly. Who's paying for this?

                         RIPLEY
               Peter found it for me. I can afford it
               because it's damp and, and falling down.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY.

     Marge, entering the living room, is astonished at its
     grandeur. She walks around as Ripley heads for the bar.

                         MARGE
               This is spectacular.

                         PETER
               That's why Tom wanted you to stay.  It's
               better than squeezing into my room, and I
               know how you hate hotels.

                         MARGE
               A hotel would've been fine.
                   (to Ripley)
               We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far
               his dollar has stretched.

     Ripley is shaking a martini. Marge laughs, helpless, somehow
     raging. Peter turns

                         PETER
               What's funny?

                         MARGE
               No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when
               Tom arrived in Mongi.
                   (to Ripley)
               And now look at you.

                         RIPLEY
               Look at me what?

                         MARGE
               To the manner born.

     EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. DAY.

     St Mark's Square is buzzing with life - tourists, balloon
     sellers - a man playing saxophone. HERBERT GREENLEAF sits out
     in the colonade on one of the many tables at Florian's Cafe,
     cradling a glass of hot water. He gets up as Marge and Ripley
     arrive.

                         RIPLEY
               Mr Greenleaf.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Tom. How are you?  You look well.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm well, thank you.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Far cry from New York.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes it is.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Marge, good morning.  Unusual weather.

                         MARGE
               Very.

                         RIPLEY
               And you, sir?  Any better?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Pretty good.  Sticking with hot water.

                         MARGE
               Where's Mr MacCarron?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well,
               my boy, it's come to a pretty pass,
               hasn't it?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes.  What's the detective hoping to
               find in San Remo?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               He's being thorough, that's all. I'm
               learning about my son, Tom, now he's
               missing. I'm learning a great deal about
               him. I hope you can fill in some more
               blanks for me. Marge has been good enough
               to do that, about Mongibello.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do
               anything to help Dickie.

     Marge looks at him in contempt.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               This theory, the letter he left for you,
               the Police think that's a clear
               indication he was planning on doing
               something...to himself.

                         MARGE
               I just don't believe that!

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk
               to Tom alone - perhaps this afternoon?
               Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say
               to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to
               another fellow -

                         MARGE
               Such as?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               What a waste of lives and opportunities
               and -

     A saxophonist is blaring away in the piazza. Greenleaf
     suddenly explodes.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (cont'd)
               - I'd pay that fellow a hundred dollars
               right now to shut up!

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.

     Herbert Greenleaf sits on a chair, Ripley pours him some tea.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (reading, plunging into gloom)
               No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.

                         RIPLEY
               I think it might hurt her to know.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               And his passport photo? Did you hear? To
               scratch out your own face like that - can
               you imagine - the frame of mind you'd
               have to be in?
                   (reading)
               I've thought about going to the police
               but I can't face it. I can't face
               anything anymore.

                         RIPLEY
               I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him
               away. I spoke and he heard you.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (such a disappointed father)
               Well, if we all pushed him away what
               about him pushing us away? You've been a
               great friend to my son. Everything is
               someone else's fault. We all want to sow
               wild oars. Somebody's got to - what's the
               word?
                   (Ripley shakes his head)
               The moment someone confronts him he
               lashes out.  He lashes out. You know,
               people always say you can't choose your
               parents, but you can't choose your
               children.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DUSK.

     Ripley wakes up from an awful, chilling nightmare, his head
     full of ghosts. He's cramped up in an armchair, his arms in
     sine foetal protection. HIS DOOR KNOCKER IS BEING REPEATEDLY
     SHAKEN. He surfaces thickly, stumbles to the door. It's Peter
     and Marge.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have
               fallen asleep.

                         PETER
               You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?

                         MARGE
               Did Dickie's Dad go?

                         RIPLEY
               He's having an early night.

                         MARGE
               Poor man.
                   (she heads to her room)
               We were knocking on that door for ever.
                   (she fiddles inside the sleeve
                    of her dress)
               I think I've broken my strap.

                         PETER
               Not guilty.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll fix some drinks.

                         MARGE
               You walk in Venice!

     She takes off her shoe, examining her feet for wear and tear,
     then disappears into the bedroom. Peter walks over to Ripley,
     a little concerned.

                         PETER
               Are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm fine.

                         PETER
                   (a hand on his shoulder)
               Do you want me to stick around?

                         RIPLEY
               It's okay.

                         PETER
               Or I could come back.

     Ripley looks at him. That's never happened. He digs in his
     pocket, finds his key, gives it to Peter. Peter smiles.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               Your key.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BATHROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.

     Ripley's in the bath. Marge knocks on his door.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               Tom?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

     Ripley, irritated, opens the door, his towel wrapped around
     his waist. Marge is white. She's wearing a robe. She's
     slightly breathless.

                         MARGE
               I found Dickie's rings.

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MARGE
               You've got Dickie's rings.

                         RIPLEY
               I can explain.

     He can't. His eyes dart. Marge holds up the evidence.

                         MARGE
               Dickie promised me he would never take
               off this ring.

                         RIPLEY
               Let me put on some clothes and then we
               can talk about this.

                         MARGE
               I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to
               tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr
               Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, calm down, you're being
               hysterical.

                         MARGE
               He promised me. I swear I'll never take
               off this ring until the day -

                         RIPLEY
               Shut up! Shut up!

     His towel slips off from his waist.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               I'm wet, Marge, I've lost my towel, I'd
               really like to put my clothes on. So go
               and pour us both a drink, will you?

     She goes off obediently, a zombie. He shuts the door.
     Immediately he starts looking for something, anything, to
     kill Marge with. He's got a shoe but it feels too light. He
     opens cabinets, drawers - nail scissors, nothing - then
     picks up his straight razor and considers it in the mirror.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SITTING ROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.

     Marge is leaving, coat on, as Ripley comes out of the
     bathroom.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge?  Where are you going?

                         MARGE
                   (like a creature caught in
                    headlights)
               I was looking for a needle and thread. I
               wasn't snooping. I was looking for a
               needle and thread to mend my bra.

                         RIPLEY
               The scent you're wearing. I bought it for
               you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie.
               So many things. The day he was late back
               from Rome - I tried to tell you this - he
               was with another girl. I'm not talking
               about Meredith, another girl we met in a
               bar. He couldn't be faithful for five
               minutes. So when he makes a promise it
               doesn't mean what it means when you make
               a promise. Or I do. He has so many
               realities, Dickie, and he believes them
               all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half
               the time he doesn't even realize.

     A SMALL RED STAIN is appearing on the pocket of his robe. As
     he speaks the stain spreads. He looks at it absently.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Today, for the first time, I've even
               wondered whether he might have killed
               Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody
               contradicted him - well, you know that.
               Marge. I loved you - you might as well
               know - I loved you, and because he knew I
               loved you, he let you think I loved him.
               Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't
               know, maybe it's grotesque to say this
               now, so just write it on a piece of paper
               or something, and keep it in your purse
               for a rainy day. Tom loves me.

                         MARGE
                   (as if she'd heard nothing)
               Why do you have Dickie's rings?

     His hand goes to his pocket. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT.

                         RIPLEY
               I told you. He gave them to me.

                         MARGE
               Why? When?

                         RIPLEY
               I feel as if you haven't heard anything
               I've been saying to you.

                         MARGE
               I don't believe you.

                         RIPLEY
               It's all true.

                         MARGE
               I don't believe a single word you've
               said.

     Marge is shivering. Ripley, ominous, advances, she retreats.

                         RIPLEY
               You're shivering, Marge. Can I hold you?
               Would you let me hold you?

     Marge panics, backed up against the door. She screams and
     turns straight into the arms of a startled PETER who's come
     back to visit Ripley, and is unlocking the door.

                         MARGE
                   (sobbing uncontrollably)
               Oh Peter! Get me out of here.

     Ripley storms off. His hand comes out of his pocket COVERED
     IN BLOOD from the razor. Peter notices, appalled.

                         PETER
               Tom, are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               You try. You try talking to her.

                         PETER
                   (calls after him)
               Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?

                         RIPLEY
                   (not turning around)
               I give up.

     INT. RIPLEY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

     Peter has just put a band-aid over Ripley's cut hand.

                         PETER
               You can't be angry with her.  She's upset
               and needs someone to blame. So she blames
               you.  I'll go home and talk to her.  As
               for you - either get a safety razor or
               grow a beard.

     INT. LOBBY, EUROPA REGINA HOTEL, VENICE. MORNING.

     Ripley hurries through the gleaming marble entrance.

     INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S SUITE, EUROPA REGINA. DAY.

     Ripley knocks on the door. It's opened by a face he doesn't
     recognize. A middle-aged heavy set man. It's MacCARRON, the
     private investigator.

                         RIPLEY
               Is Mr Greenleaf here?

                         MACCARRON
               Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               I don't know, I don't know, I just know
               it.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (O/S)
               Marge, there's female intuition, and
               then there are facts -

     Greenleaf sits with a scrubbed Marge, her hair pulled back,
     as if newly-widowed. THE RINGS SIT GLINTING ON THE COFFEE
     TABLE.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello, sir.
                   (smiles thinly at Marge)
               Marge, you should have waited, didn't
               Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you
               up?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Marge has been telling us about the
               rings.

                         RIPLEY
               You know I feel ridiculous I didn't
               mention them yesterday - I clean forgot -
               ridiculous.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Perhaps you didn't mention them because
               there's only one conclusion to be drawn.

     Ripley worries about what that conclusion is as Mr Greenleaf
     heads into his bedroom.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (cont'd)
               I'm going to take Marge for a little
               walk, Tom.  Mr MacCarron wants to talk
               with you.

                         RIPLEY
                   (feeling caged in)
               We could go down to the bar - no need for
               you to -

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               No, he should talk to you alone.

     He helps Marge to her feet and leads her out. RIPLEY IS
     PARALYSED. He waits for the door to shut. Aimlessly he walks
     out onto the terrace, with its staggering, beautiful and
     indifferent view.

     EXT. EUROPA REGINA, THE GREENLEAF TERRACE. DAY.

     Ripley stands, steels himself for MacCarron's charges.

                         RIPLEY
               I could probably see my bedroom from
               here. I can see my house. When you see
               where you live from a distance it's like
               a dream, isn't it?

                         MACCARRON
                   (coming out)
               I don't care for B.S. I don't care to
               hear it. I don't care to speak it.

                         RIPLEY
               Okay.

                         MACCARRON
               Why do you think Dickie's father sent him
               to Europe in the first place? Did you
               know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-
               killed a boy?

     Ripley turns, shocked.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               At a party. Over some girl. He kicked the
               kid several times in the head. Put him in
               the hospital. The boy had a wire fixed in
               his jaw. The Rome Police didn't think to
               ask Mr Greenleaf.

     MacCarron gets up.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Nor did they think to check whether a
               Thomas Ripley had ever been a student at
               Princeton University. I turned up a Tom
               Ripley who'd been a piano tuner in the
               music department.

     Ripley's head drops.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               See - in America we're taught to check a
               fact before it becomes a fact. We're
               taught to nose around when a girl drowns
               herself, find out if that girl was
               pregnant, find out if Dickie had an
               embarrassment there.

     Ripley doesn't know where this barrage is going.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty.
               He really does. Marge, she's got a
               hundred theories, but there are a few
               things she doesn't know. We hope she
               never knows.

                         RIPLEY
               I hope she never knows.

                         MACCARRON
               Three different people saw Dickie get
               into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't
               identify himself because he was jumping
               someone else's wife at the time saw
               Dickie removing license plates from a red
               sports car. The Police know about this
               man because he happens to be a Policeman.

     He walks out of the room, returns carrying THE LICENSE PLATES
     from Freddie's car.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               I found these in the basement of Dickie's
               apartment. They belonged to Freddie's
               car. Mr Greenleaf has asked me to lose
               them in the canal this evening.

     Ripley can't believe what he's hearing. It's like a dream.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Mr Greenleaf also feels there was a
               silent promise in Dickie's letter to you
               which he intends to honor. He intends to
               transfer a good part of Dickie's income
               from his trust into your name. He doesn't
               intend to give the Italian police any
               information about Dickie's past. He's
               rather hoping you'll feel the same.

     There is a silence in which this strange compact is agreed.

     EXT. EUROPA REGINA MOORING. DAY.

     Ripley stands with Marge, Mr Greenleaf and MacCarron at the
     water's edge - MOTOR LAUNCH growling. They shake hands, and
     then MacCarron and Mr Greenleaf get into the launch. Herbert
     Greenleaf carries the saxophone case.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Marge)
               I feel I never should have said those
               things to you the other evening. I was
               pretty flustered, the rings and - and you
               looked so, I don't know.

     Marge shakes her head to silence him.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               But I hope that note goes to New York in
               your purse, for a rainy day.

                         MARGE
               What are you going to do now, Tom?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. Peter has a concert in
               Athens next month - and he's asked if I
               want to go along, help out. He says
               goodbye by the way - he's in rehearsal,
               otherwise -

                         MARGE
               Why do I think there's never been a
               Ripley rainy day?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MARGE
                   (lunging at him)
               I know it was you - I know it was you,
               Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed
               Dickie. I know it was you.

                         RIPLEY
               Oh Marge.

     He puts his hand out to control her. She pushes it away.
     STARTS TO LASH OUT AT HIM, the frustration too much, so that
     Ripley has to cover his face. MacCarron comes off the boat to
     restrain her.  Ripley looks at him as if to say: what can you
     do, she's hysterical. MacCarron nods, pulls her on to the
     boat. Greenleaf catches Ripley's eye, guiltily. Turns away.
     They stand silhouetted as the launch revs up and surges off
     towards open waters, passing the little fleets of gondolas.

     EXT. FERRY FOR ATHENS, NAPLES. DAY.

     A week later and Peter and Ripley are on the deck of the
     ferry, the HELLENES, as it sails towards Greece.  They're
     laughing.

                         RIPLEY
               Ask me what I want to change about this
               moment.

                         PETER
               What do you want to change about this
               moment?

                         RIPLEY
               Nothing.

     INT. PETER'S CABIN. DUSK.

     Peter's in a bathrobe organising his currency, his
     traveller's cheques. Ripley knocks on the door, comes in.

                         PETER
               Hello.  What are you up to?

                         RIPLEY
               All kinds of things. Making plans.

                         PETER
               Plans - good, plans for tonight or plans
               for the future?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. Both. My plan right now is
               to go up on deck, look at the sunset.
               Come with me.

                         PETER
               You go. I don't want to get dressed yet.
               Come back though.  Come back.
                   (smiles at him)
               You know, you look so relaxed, like a
               completely different person.

                         RIPLEY
               Well, that's entirely your fault.  And,
               if I fall overboard, that'll be your
               fault too.

     EXT. DECK OF THE HELLENES. SUNSET.

     Ripley stands on deck, staring at the magnificent sunset.
     Then a voice shakes him from his reverie.

                         MEREDITH
               Dickie?  Dickie?

     He turns. He's caught. Suddenly he's Dickie.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               Dickie, my God!

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Meredith.

                         MEREDITH
               I was looking at you, your clothes, I
               wouldn't have known you...

                         RIPLEY
               Well, you've spotted me and so you get
               the reward.

                         MEREDITH
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               Just kidding. Are you alone?

                         MEREDITH
               Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.

     Meredith points to the UPPER DECK BALCONY where TWO OLDER
     COUPLES are walking around the deck.

                         RIPLEY
               Of course.  Aunt Joan.

                         MEREDITH
               And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've
               thought about you so much.

                         RIPLEY
               I've thought about you.

     And now he's thinking I can't kill them all...

                         MEREDITH
               When I thought about you I was mostly
               hating you. Where've you been hiding?

                         RIPLEY
               I haven't been hiding. I've been in
               Police custody. They've been trying to
               flush out Freddie's killer.

                         MEREDITH
               You're kidding.

                         RIPLEY
               They're letting me have this vacation.
               Which is why the get-up. Which is why you
               haven't heard from me.

                         MEREDITH
               You know, the whole world thinks you
               killed Freddie? It's terrible.

                         RIPLEY
               I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later.
               Later?

     He kisses her.  Full of future.

                         MEREDITH
               So - are you travelling under R?

                         RIPLEY
               You know what - I am.

                         MEREDITH
               Dickie, are you with Peter Smith-
               Kingsley?  I bet you are. My aunt thought
               she saw him.

                         RIPLEY
                   (horrified)
               Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him
               in months.  No, I'm alone.
                   (and he understands this is not
                    any kind of lie)

     INT. PETER'S CABIN. NIGHT.

     Peter's working on his score, lying on his front, apparently
     engrossed. Ripley knocks and enters. Looks long at Peter.

                         PETER
               How was it?

                         RIPLEY
               Good. But I think we should stay in here
               for the rest of the trip.

                         PETER
               Was that Meredith?

                         RIPLEY
                   (sighs)
               Was who Meredith?

                         PETER
               Meredith Logue. You were kissing
               somebody. Looked like Meredith.

                         RIPLEY
               Hardly kissing. Kissing off.

                         PETER
               Didn't look that way - you know - from a
               distance.

                         RIPLEY
               I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen
               you.

                         PETER
               Why lie?

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie and Peter, that's just too good
               gossip, isn't it?

                         PETER
               Or Tom and Peter even.

                         RIPLEY
               Well that would be even better gossip.

                         PETER
               Really, why?
                   (completely lost)
               Sorry, I'm completely lost.

                         RIPLEY
               I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be
               stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's
               my, that's my - terrible and alone and
               dark - and I've lied about who I am, and
               where I am, and so nobody can ever find
               me.

                         PETER
               What do you mean lied about who you are?

                         RIPLEY
               I suppose I always thought - better to be
               a fake somebody than a real nobody.

                         PETER
               What are you talking about - you're not a
               nobody! That's the last thing you are.

                         RIPLEY
               Peter, I... I...

                         PETER
                   (conciliatory)
               And don't forget. I have the key.

                         RIPLEY
               You have the key. Tell me some good
               things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up.
               Just tell me some nice things.

     He sits on the bed, leans against Peter. His eyes are
     brimming with tears.  He takes the cord from Peter's robe and
     begins twisting it in his hands.

                         PETER
               Good things about Tom Ripley?  Could take
               some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is
               tender... Tom is beautiful...

                         RIPLEY
                   (during this, and tender)
               You're such a liar...

                         PETER
               ...Tom is a mystery...

     Ripley is pressing against him, moving up his body, kisses
     his shoulder, the cord wrapped tight in his hands...

     INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. NIGHT.

     Ripley returns to his cabin. Sits on the bed, desolate.

                         PETER (O/S)
                   (cont'd)
               ...Tom is not a nobody. Tom has secrets
               he doesn't want to tell me, and I wish he
               would. Tom has nightmares. That's not a
               good thing. Tom has someone to love him.
               That is a good thing!
                   (feeling Ripley's weight on
                    him)
               Tom is crushing me. Tom is crushing me.
                   (suddenly alarmed)
               Tom, you're crushing me!

     The door of his closet flips open with the swell and he
     catches his reflection. It swings shut. Open then shut.
     Through the porthole the weather's changing as the light
     dies. There's a swell as the horizon rises and falls in the
     round glass. Ripley, alone, in a nightmare of his own making.

     THE END.






     Lullaby for Cain

     From the silence
     from the night
     comes a distant lullabye

     Cry, remembering that first cry
     Your brother standing by
     and loved
     both loved
     beloved sons of mine
     sing a lullabye
     mother is close by
     innocent eyes
     such innocent eyes

     Envy stole your brother's life
     came home murdered peace of mind
     left you nightmares on the pillow
     sleep now

     Soul, surrendering your soul
     the heart of you not whole
     for love
     but love
     what toll

     Cast into the dark
     branded with the mark
     of shame
     of Cain

     From the garden of God's light
     to a wilderness of light
     sleep now

     sleep now.

     1958

     PROLOGUE:  INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. EVENING.

     Fade up on Ripley, as in the final scene of the film,
     sitting, desolate in a ship's cabin. The camera rotates
     around his face, which begins in light and ends in darkness.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               If I could just go back.  If I could rub
               everything out.  Starting with myself.
               Starting with borrowing a jacket.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST TERRACE. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley is at the piano, accompanying FRAN, a young soprano.
     CREDITS begin.

                         FRAN (SINGS)
               Ah, such fleeting paradise
               such innocent delight
               to love,
               be loved,
               a lullabye,
               then silence.

     The song finishes.  Applause.  They're the entertainment at a
     cocktail party to celebrate a silver wedding anniversary.
     Some partygoers congratulate Fran on her performance. A
     distinguished looking man, pushing his wife in a wheelchair,
     approaches Ripley, offers his hand.

               Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
               Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (pointing at Ripley's borrowed
                    jacket)
               I see you were at Princeton.
               Then you'll most likely know our son,
               Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               We couldn't help noticing your jacket.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Yes.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Class of '56?

                         RIPLEY
                   (hesitating)
               How is Dickie?

     INT. ELEVATOR OPENING OUT INTO LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.

     Fran, Ripley, Mr and Mrs Greenleaf and others emerge from an
     elevator. Emily talks to Fran, Herbert to Ripley.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
                   (to Fran)
               I hope you'll come and see us...

                         FRAN
               That's very kind.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Both of you...

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Of course, Dickie's idea of music is
               Jazz. He has a saxophone.  To my ear Jazz
               is just noise, just an insolent noise.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley shakes hands with Herbert Greenleaf as he gets into
     his Rolls Royce. They are making an appointment. Ripley
     crosses the street to Fran, pecks her cheek. She hands him
     his share of their fee.

                         RIPLEY
               Gotta run. I'm so late.
                   (he hands Fran's boyfriend the
                    jacket he's been wearing)
               Thanks for the jacket.

                         BOYFRIEND
               Sure.  Thanks for filling in for me.

     From Greenleaf's point of view he sees a couple embracing.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Darling couple, aren't they?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Yes.  An exceptional young man.

     From another vantage point Ripley hurries on as Fran gets
     into her boyfriend's car. A piano quartet starts up.

     EXT. THEATER. EVENING.

     Ripley runs past the droves of arriving concert-goers and
     heads for the theater. Music continues.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM, THEATER. NIGHT.

     The interval: A thick mass of men in tuxedoes grooming
     themselves at the basins. Ripley turns on faucets, offers
     towels, brushes off dandruff. Men talk over, round, and
     through him.  Put coins in a bowl.

     INT. A BOX AT THE THEATER. NIGHT

     The concert continues. Ripley peers through the curtain at
     the performances.  A haughty woman in the box turns round and
     he closes the curtain.

     INT. BACKSTAGE. 1:30 A.M.

     An empty auditorium. Ripley plays Bach in the blue
     ghostlight.  A caretaker emerges from his rounds, flips on
     the house lights.  Ripley jerks up from his playing, waves
     apologetically.

                         RIPLEY
               Sorry, sorry.  I know.  Sorry.

     EXT. GREENLEAF SHIPYARDS, BROOKLYN. DAY.

     Greenleaf and Ripley walk through one of the drydocks.  A
     huge void in the shape of a boat, swarming with workers
     preparing the shell of a new liner.  If Central Park is where
     the money is spent, this is clearly where it's made.  And a
     lot of it. Workers nod deferentially to the man with his name
     over the buildings behind them.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Mongibello. Tiny place. South of Naples.
               Marge, his uh, the young lade is
               supposedly writing some kind of book. God
               knows what he does. By all accounts they
               spend the whole time on the beach. Or his
               sailboat. That's my son's talent,
               spending his allowance.

     Ripley, in his green corduroy jacket the very model of a
     sober young man, listens attentively.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF (cont'd)
               Could you ever conceive of going to
               Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?
                   (Ripley looks doubtful)
               I'd pay you.  I'd pay you 1000 dollars.

                         RIPLEY
               I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir,
               but...

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Good. Now you can go for a reason.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK. DAY.

     A vinyl RECORD revolves in close up.  An exuberant and
     mysterious VOICE is scat singing. Wild. Then the sound slides
     into a raucous big band jazz number:  Dizzy Gillespie's The
     Champ. A HAND ejects the record. When the camera finds the
     man's face it is BLINDFOLDED. He's hot. He's wearing an
     undershirt. He's trying to identify the recording.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               I don't know. Count Basie?  Duke
               Ellington. I don't know. Count Basie.

     The man pulls of the blindfold, examines the record cover of
     the disc he's been trying to learn, needs to put on glasses
     to do so, is irritated by his mistake. He ejects the record.

     A pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered
     table which includes classical sheet music and a paper
     keyboard. One hand idly mimes at the keys.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Another song for Ripley to identify is on the gramophone.
     Chet Baker's My Funny Valentine.  Signs everywhere of
     packing. A suitcase. Books about Italy.  Ripley paces in this
     BASEMENT room, which is bathroom, kitchen, living room and
     bedroom all in one.  Tiny, tidy, squalid and sad. The windows
     give onto bars and a wall.

                         RIPLEY
               Don't even know if this is a man or a
               woman.

     There's a violent row going on in the room above his head. He
     flinches.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley, shining his shoes, packing almost done, is testing
     himself on another piece of music. Free jazz saxophone:
     Charlie Parker's Koko.  He listens hard, recognizes the
     track.

                         RIPLEY
               That's Charlie Parker. Bird.

     He skips over to the gramophone, checks the record. He's
     right, he smiles.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley studies an old photograph of Dickie Greenleaf in a
     Princeton Yearbook. He shoves the book in a bag, picks up
     his suitcase and takes a last look around the dingy apartment
     before closing the door behind him.

     EXT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley hauls his luggage up the stairs and into the sunlight.
     He is met at the top of the stairs by Mr Greenleaf's
     chauffeur.

                         CHAUFFEUR
               Here.  I'll take that.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

                         CARETAKER
                   (nodding towards the apartment)
               That thousand bucks should come in handy.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, sir.

                         CHAUFFEUR
                   (interupts Ripley, who is
                    about to open the car door)
               I'll get that.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

                         CHAUFFEUR
                   (as he holds open the door for
                    Ripley)
               Sir.
                   (Ripley laughs excitedly)
               You're gonna have a great trip.  Mr
               Greenleaf is personal friends with the
               Cunard people.

     INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S CAR. DAY.

     Ripley luxuriates in the back of the Greenleaf limousine. He
     opens up an envelope he's carrying with Greenleaf stationery.
     Inside a First Class Cunard Ticket, some traveler's checks
     and dollars.

                         CHAUFFEUR
               I can tell you.  The Greenleaf name opens
               a lot of doors.

     EXT. QUEEN MARY, MANHATTAN SKYLINE. DAY.

     The liner leaves New York en route to Italy.  END CREDITS.

     INT. NAPLES HARBOR, CUSTOMS & IMMIGRATION HALL. DAY.

     ITALY. Brilliant sunshine. The Queen Mary has just docked.
     Passengers can be seen disembarking through the huge windows.
     Coming from the First Class gangways they are greeted,
     escorted, fussed over into the hall.  Their bags have been
     unloaded ahead of them, and are now being sorted in the hall
     under the initials of their owners.  STANDS WITH THE LETTERS
     OF THE ALPHABET CHALKED ON THEM are dotted about, and trunks
     and suitcases of all shapes and sizes form small hills around
     them. Ripley enters and an Italian Porter approaches, wants
     his name.  Ripley. Ripley. Ripley! he repeats in the hubbub
     and joins the crowd around the letter R.  A striking young
     woman (MEREDITH) is nearby. She notices him.

     Ripley proceeds to the Customs area, where he's held in a
     line as a large suitcase is opened and searched. Meredith
     catches up with him. Her luggage a mountain next to his.

                         MEREDITH
               What's your secret?

                         RIPLEY
               Excuse me?

                         MEREDITH
               No, it's just - you are American, aren't
               you? - no, I just, I have so much
               luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined.
               It's humiliating.

     Ripley shrugs.  Now they're opening a second case of the
     passenger ahead.  Hard not to converse.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith
               Randall.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.

                         MEREDITH
               Hello.

     They are passed through immigration, head down the long
     stairs towards the street.  Meredith catches up with Ripley.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?

                         RIPLEY
                   (thinking quickly)
               Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.

                         MEREDITH
               So now, did they put your suitcase in the
               wrong pile? It's just - upstairs -
               weren't you under the R stand? I thought
               I saw you there.

                         RIPLEY
               My father wants me in New York. He builds
               boats. I'd rather sail them.  I travel
               under my mother's name.

                         MEREDITH
               Which is?

                         RIPLEY
               Emily.
                   (Meredith's bewildered)
               Just kidding.

                         MEREDITH
               The funny thing is, I'm not Randall
               either. I'm Logue.

                         RIPLEY
                   (nods, recognizing the name)
               As in the...?

                         MEREDITH
               As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug
               off the dress. I travel under my mother's
               name, too.

                         RIPLEY
               Randall.

                         MEREDITH
               Right.

     They've arrived at a crossroads on the stairs - graphic signs
     explain the choices: one way for Buses, Taxis and exits - the
     other for Trains: ROMA, VENEZIA, MILANO.  They're going in
     different directions.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
                   (offering her hand)
               So - partners in disguise.
                   (looks at the signs)
               Bye.

     EXT. COASTAL ROAD FROM NAPLES. LATE AFTERNOON.

     A BUS rolls around a coastal road cut into the side of a
     cliff, mountain above, blue sea below.

     INT. BUS. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley sits surrounded by teeming life. The bus slows at a
     new town. People get off.

     INT/EXTERIOR. BUS ARRIVES MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.

     Later, the day ending. Ripley looks out as they continue on
     their journey. Arriving at a small fishing port they wind
     down through a square, passing the local church.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. LATE DAY.

     And then the bus is in the heart of a wharf. On one side
     there's evidence of the fisherman's life, nets, old men
     working. Opposite there's a tiny cafe spilling out onto the
     street, young guys hang out, play table football, lounge on
     their Vespas. The Driver chants -

                         DRIVER
               MONGIBELLO!

     Ripley gets out, lugging his cases, as the bus continues on
     its way. He looks around him. He feels completely foreign.

     EXT. MIRAMARE HOTEL/BOAT AT SEA. MORNING.

     A SAILBOAT has slid into his view, now drops anchor, drops
     the sail.  A couple dive off and swim towards shore.

     ALL OF THIS IS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RIPLEY, who's
     watching the events through binoculars from his tiny balcony
     in the Miramare Hotel. An Italian Vocabulary Book is perched
     on his knees and, during this, he continues his study,
     mouthing the Italian words.

                         RIPLEY
                   (looking at a long, lean girl
                    about to dive)
               La fidanzata a una faccia.  The fiancÈe
               has a face.  La fidanzata e Marge.

     Her partner, DICKIE GREENLEAF, dives too. They're brown,
     beautiful, perfect. Ripley notices the name of the boat:
     "BIRD".

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Questo e la mia faccia.....

     The golden couple emerge from the sea. Dickie shakes off the
     water, grins.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               This is my face.

     He double-checks himself with the vocabulary book.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Questa...e la mia faccia. Questa e la
               faccia di Dickie.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley emerges from one of the beach cabins, and stands on
     the edge of the sand on a wooden walkway. He's wearing A TINY
     LIME-GREEN BATHING SUIT. He loathes beaches. A couple of boys
     turn laconically and watch him.

     Ripley puts on his shoes and scurries to the sea. He feels
     ridiculous, his skin alabaster against the brown bodies.
     Finally, the shame is too great and he pulls off his shoes
     and dashes to the water, where he luxuriates in the coolness
     of it before wading out of the sea, and walking straight up
     to Dickie.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie Greenleaf?

     Dickie squints at Ripley, who holds his shoes, lamely.

                         DICKIE
               Who's this?

                         RIPLEY
               It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at
               Princeton together.

                         DICKIE
               Okay.
                   (he sits up)
               And did we know each other?

                         RIPLEY
               Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must
               have known me.

                         DICKIE
                   (to Marge)
               Princeton is like a fog, America's like a
               fog.
                   (to Ripley)
               This is Marge Sherwood. Tom - sorry, what
               was it?

                         RIPLEY
               Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.

                         MARGE
               How do you do.

                         DICKIE
               What are you doing in Mongi?

                         RIPLEY
               Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.

                         DICKIE
                   (finds this idea absurd)
               Passing through! You're so white. Did you
               ever see a guy so white, Marge?  Gray,
               actually.

                         RIPLEY
               It's just an undercoat.
                   (Marge laughs)

                         DICKIE
               Say again?

                         RIPLEY
               You know, a primer.

                         DICKIE
               That's funny.

     He shares some intimacy with Marge, makes her laugh.  Ripley
     stands as they wrestle around him. Marge looks up.

                         MARGE
               You should come and have lunch with us,
               before you go - Dickie?

                         DICKIE
               Sure.  Any time.

                         MARGE
               And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in
               danger of turning a little pink.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks. Well, a coincidence.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. EARLY MORNING.

     ANOTHER DAY.  Church Bells ringing. Dickie, dressed in
     shorts, comes bumping up the cobbled path towards the square
     on his MOTORSCOOTER. He stops by a steep flight of steps.
     RIPLEY, a book in hand, unseen, walking up a hill, catches
     all this and, intrigued, watches as a young Italian beauty,
     SILVANA, has a spikey, flirtatious exchange with Dickie, then
     climbs on the scooter, behind him.

                         DICKIE
               I've been looking for you everywhere.

                         SILVANA
               Ah, today you're looking for me.  And
               where have you been the rest of the week?
               Pig.  With your American girl?  I hate
               you, you know?

                         DICKIE
               What?

                         SILVANA
               I hate you.

     And RIPLEY watches them as they rattle down the hill towards
     the sea.

     EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.

     Dickie appears in Marge's garden, the sea behind his head.
     Marge is sitting at her outside table surrounded by some of
     the remnants of lunch.  Dickie's sheepish, showered, late.

                         DICKIE
               Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late,
               I'm a swine.

                         MARGE
               Did you forget where I live? It's four
               o'clock.

                         DICKIE
               I just woke up.  I'm sorry.

                         MARGE
               You just woke up!

                         DICKIE
               Fausto and I - we took the boat out, we
               were fishing, and then it was dawn and
               we'd caught absolutely nothing.

                         MARGE
               Well, we ate everything without you.

                         DICKIE
               We?

                         MARGE
               Yes, Tom Ripley's here.

     As Ripley appears with the tray to collect more dishes.

                         DICKIE
               Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We
               thought you'd disappeared. We were going
               to send out a search party.

                         RIPLEY
               No, still here.

                         MARGE
               Tom was telling me about his trip over.
               Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.

                         DICKIE
               Is that good?

                         MARGE
               Shut up!

     Marge flicks him with a napkin. They start to wrestle,
     excluding Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm intruding.

                         DICKIE
               Can you mix a martini?

                         RIPLEY
                   (hesitant)
               Sure.

                         MARGE
                   (going inside)
               I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.

                         DICKIE
               Everybody should have one talent.
                   (to Ripley)
               What's yours?

                         RIPLEY
                   (without a beat)
               Forging signatures. Telling lies.
               Impersonating practically anybody.

                         DICKIE
                   (enjoying this banter)
               That's three. Nobody should have more
               than one talent. Okay, do an impression.

                         RIPLEY
               Now?  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Talent -
                   (his voice ages, his face
                    changes)
               The only talent my son has is for cashing
               his allowance.

                         DICKIE
                   (absolutely thrown)
               What? What's this?

                         RIPLEY
               I like to sail, believe me, I love to
               sail! Instead I make boats and other
               people sail them.

                         DICKIE
                   (incredibly impressed)
               Stop! It's too much!  You're making all
               the hairs on my neck stand up!

                         RIPLEY
                   (relishing it)
               Jazz, let's face it, it's just an
               insolent noise.

                         DICKIE
               I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the
               old bastard is here right now!  That's
               brilliant!  How do you know him?

                         RIPLEY
               I met him in New York.

                         DICKIE
               Marge! You've got to hear this!

                         MARGE
                   (returning with the drinks)
               What?  What?

                         DICKIE
               Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf
               1st.

                         RIPLEY
               Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a
               fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.

                         MARGE
               What's going on?

                         DICKIE
               Uncanny!

                         MARGE
               I don't get it.

                         RIPLEY
               Could you ever conceive of going there,
               Tom, and bringing him back?

                         DICKIE
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and
               persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you
               $1000.

     INT/EXT. MONGIBELLO CHURCH AND SQUARE. DUSK.

     A christening is over and now the whole village is pouring
     out of Church for the Passeggiata in Sunday best. Girls arm
     in arm parade. Boys arm in arm evaluate. New babies are
     compared and fussed over. Old people smoke, talk, shrug.
     Dickie is walking with Ripley, seething about his father's
     scheming.

                         DICKIE
               I'm never going back. To actually hire
               somebody to come all the way here to drag
               me back home - got to be insane, hasn't
               he?

     SILVANA comes out of church arm in arm with a man, her
     fiancee, as part of a foursome which includes Dickie's pal
     FAUSTO. Silvana's eyes flick towards Dickie, otherwise
     there's no acknowledgement as they all greet each other.
     Dickie introduces Tom, then they move on.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               I'm never going back!

                         RIPLEY
               No, I think your mother, her illness -

                         DICKIE
               It's got nothing to do with my mother!
               She's had leukemia for - ! This is what
               makes me boil about him! HE wants me
               back! - it's got nothing to do with my
               mother.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling
               you what I -

                         DICKIE
                   (interrupting)
               Go back!  Go back to New York or call him
               if you can find a telephone that works,
               and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me
               back to him or his shipyard.

     EXT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, MONGIBELLO. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley appears, with his meagre luggage at Dickie's front
     door. He's carrying his tote bag under his arm, the bottom of
     which seems to be unstitched and held together only by his
     fingers. Marge is on the terrace, she looks down to see Tom
     talking with Dickie.

                         MARGE
               Hi Tom.

                         DICKIE
                   (looks up)
               Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.

                         MARGE
               I'll come down.

                         DICKIE
                   (to Ripley)
               Did you speak to my father?

                         RIPLEY
               You were right about the telephones.
               There are no lines, there's some problem.

                         MARGE
                   (coming out of the front door)
               Hello Tom. You're off? What are your
               plans?

                         RIPLEY
               Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.

     He goes to shake her hand and as he releases the tote bag the
     seam splits and records spill to the ground, scattering. He
     bends down, starts gathering them up. Marge helps.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Oh, damn, sorry, this bag's -

     Dickie's delighted when he sees the Jazz titles.

                         DICKIE
               You like jazz!

                         RIPLEY
                   (gathering up the records)
               I love jazz.

                         DICKIE
                   (holding up a Chet Baker)
               This is the best. Marge says she likes
               jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is
               jazz.

                         MARGE
               I never said that!

                         RIPLEY
               Bird. That's jazz.

                         DICKIE
               Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat -

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. What's the name of your
               sailboat?

                         DICKIE
               Bird!

                         MARGE
               Which is ridiculous. Boats are female,
               everyone knows you can't call a boat
               after a man.

                         RIPLEY
               He's not a man, he's a god.

                         DICKIE
                   (excited)
               Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a
               club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.

                         MARGE
               It's vile.

                         DICKIE
               Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't
               have to come.
                   (to Ripley)
               It's great.  You're going to love it.

     INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.

     A cavern blue with smoke. A surprisingly good QUINTET blast
     out their version of MOANIN'. Dickie and Ripley arrive and
     make their way to a table where Fausto is sitting with
     friends. It's too noisy for conversation, but Dickie shouts
     introductions and they shake Ripley's hand.  Dickie is
     instantly absorbed in the music, Ripley absorbed in Dickie.
     An attractive Italian Girl, DAHLIA, comes over, kisses
     Dickie, pulls off his hat, puts it on, there's no room for
     her to sit, so she sits on Dickie's lap, smoking his
     cigarette.  Dickie raises his eyebrow at Tom, but it's
     clearly no hardship. Then the band strikes up the intro to Tu
     vuo' fa' L'Americano - a hit which reflects the current craze
     for all things American - and Fausto pulls a protesting Dickie
     up onto the stage.

                         FAUSTO
                   (improvising in Italian)
               Ladies and Gentlemen. Dickie Greenleaf,
               all the way from America... etc.

     Fausto starts to sing. Dickie joins in the chorus. Everybody
     claps. Dickie talks off-mic to Fausto.

                         FAUSTO (cont'd)
               And a big round of applause for a new
               friend from New York - Tom Ripley!

     Ripley's mortified, but Dickie jumps off the stage and pulls
     him up.  The song continues and now, at the chorus, it's
     Dickie and Ripley who have to sing. Ripley, of course, can
     sing well, if not confident in this arena. Soon the audience
     is clapping, standing on tables, dancing, Dahlia prominent.

                         DICKIE (O/S)
                   (reading)
               I have bumped into an old friend from
               Princeton - a fellow named Tom Ripley.
               He says he's going to haunt me until I
               agree to come back to New York with
               him...

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NOON.

     Dickie, in his new dressing gown, is sitting at the table,
     typing. Ripley's head emerges from behind the couch on which
     he has been enjoying a blissful sleep.

                         DICKIE
                   (grins)
               Good afternoon!

                         RIPLEY
               What time is it?
                   (puts on his glasses and checks
                    his watch)
               Oh God!  Do you always type your letters?
                   (points at the letter)
               That should be two Ts.

                         DICKIE
               I can't write and I can't spell.  That's
               the privilege of a first-class education.
               You're upstairs at the back. I think
               Ermelinda made the bed up.

                         RIPLEY
               This is so good of you.

                         DICKIE
               Don't say it again. Now you're a Double
               Agent and we're going to string my Dad
               alone, I was thinking we might buy a
               little car with the expense money he's
               sending you. What do you think, Marge...a
               little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?

     Marge has appeared, carrying Camparis.

                         MARGE
               Dickie, you can't even drive a car!  No,
               what we need urgently is an icebox. What
               do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll
               be your friend for life.

                         RIPLEY
               I absolutely agree with Marge.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS. DAY.

     Ripley locates his room, puts down his luggage in what is a
     comfortable and simple room, then heads back downstairs only
     to be tempted by the open door of Dickie's bedroom.

     INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. DAY.

     Ripley explores the casual elegance of Dickie's bedroom - the
     Louis Vuitton chest, the closet's open door spilling out
     shirts, ties. On the dressing table there are toiletries,
     cufflinks scattered, a silk tie.  Ripley picks up the tie and
     walks towards the open window below which is a terrace where
     lunch is being laid. Marge and Dickie are chatting. Shreds of
     conversation float up to Ripley.

                         DICKIE
               It'll just be for a little while.  He can
               be... he makes me laugh.

                         MARGE
               Okay, darling.

                         DICKIE
               You'd say if you mind?

                         MARGE
               No, I like him.

                         DICKIE
               Marge, you like everybody.

                         MARGE
               I don't like you.

                         DICKIE
               Then I'll go to your place and you can
               move in with Tom.

     Above them, Ripley repeats these phrases, carefully, testing
     the cadences, No, I like him. Marge, you like everybody,
     until he's as accurate as a taperecorder.

     EXT. TERRACE OF DICKIE'S HOUSE. DAY.

     Ermelinda is clearing away lunch. Ripley is changed and
     sitting at the table with Marge while Dickie works on the
     coffee. Ripley watches him, studying everything: the way he
     uses the expresso machine, the way he wears no socks, his
     pants, his rings.

                         DICKIE
               Now you know why Miss Sherwood always
               shows up for breakfast.  It's not love
               it's the coffee machine.

                         MARGE
               It's the one task Dickie can do on his
               own - make coffee.

                         DICKIE
               Shut up.

                         MARGE
               Oh darling - is that for me?

                         DICKIE
               No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.

                         RIPLEY
                   (as Dickie hands him his cup)
               That ring's so great. The green one.

                         MARGE
                   (delighted)
               Tom, I love you!
                   (to Dickie)
               See!
                   (to Ripley)
               I bought it for him, for his birthday.

                         RIPLEY
               It's superb.

                         DICKIE
               I had to promise, capital P, never to
               take it off - otherwise I'd give it to
               you.

                         MARGE
                   (flicking a crumb at him)
               Bastard!
                   (to Ripley)
               Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in
               Naples.  I bargained for about two weeks.

                         DICKIE
               I hope it wasn't cheap.

                         MARGE
               Oh, it was.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Marge)
               I have to find a birthday present for
               Frances. Perhaps you can help me?

                         MARGE
               Frances?

                         RIPLEY
               My fiancÈe.

                         DICKIE
               You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?

                         RIPLEY
               Your parents met her.

                         DICKIE
               Oh God - I can just imagine - if only
               Dickie would settle down... doesn't every
               parent deserve a grandchild?  Never! I
               swear on your ring, Marge.  I am never
               going back.

     EXT. BIRD SAILBOAT. DAY.

     The Bird is sailing off the coast of Mongibello. There's a
     manoeuvre going on with the sail.  Captain Dickie supervises
     his crew of Marge and a painfully awkward anxious-to-please
     Ripley.  Dickie goes over to help him.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?

                         DICKIE
               You're doing great. We'll make a sailor
               of you yet. You're doing really well.

                         MARGE
               Dubious but special honor, Tom - crewing
               Dickie's boat.  Alright, bar's open.

                         DICKIE
               Yes please!

     She heads for the cabin. Dickie settles down beside Ripley.

                         RIPLEY
               Could we sail to Venice?

                         DICKIE
               Sure.  I love Venice.

                         RIPLEY
               I have to go to Venice.

                         DICKIE
               See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or
               is it Rome? You do something and die,
               don't you?  Okay, Venice is on the list.

                         RIPLEY
               And Rome.

                         DICKIE
               Do you ski?
                   (Ripley frowns)
               Don't tell me - you're a lost cause!
               That's the next thing to deal with. We're
               planning to go to Cortina at Christmas.
               Excellent skiing. Excellent.
                   (as Marge reappears)
               Marge - Ripley can't ski.  We'll have to
               teach him that, too. Have you ever known
               such low class?

                         MARGE
               Poor Tom. Good thing we're not getting
               married. We might have to invite him on
               our honeymoon.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.

     Marge and Ripley are on a shopping expedition. They walk down
     the hill towards the grocery shop, next to the bar in the
     little square. Ripley has asked Marge how she and Dickie met.

                         MARGE
               Oh I hated New York - that Park Avenue
               crowd - so I fled to Paris to work on my
               book, and I was always going to this cafe
               with Jean-Jacques, and Dickie used to
               play his saxophone outside and I would
               see him and he would see me, and he would
               play My Funny Valentine. It was only
               later that I realised he only knows about
               six songs.

     They've arrived at the Grocery Store. Alessandra, the woman
     who owns the store greets them.  Silvana, who's her daughter,
     is also there, and less comfortable. She waits for Marge's
     order.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
                   (to Silvana, in Italian)
               Buono Sera, Silvana. Por favore: arance e
               pane, e del prosciutto.

                         SILVANA
               E fichi?  Come sempre?

                         MARGE
               Si.  Come sempre.  Grazie.

     Silvana goes inside for the meat and bread. Marge frowns.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
                   (back to Ripley)
               Anyway, then one day, we go in, I see
               Dickie, he starts playing My Funny
               Valentine, and then all of a sudden he
               just walks into the cafe, right in front
               of Jean-Jacques, and grabs me! Now I had
               never spoken to him in my life - he said
               I'm going to Italy, tomorrow, and I want
               you to come with me. So I did.

     At the edge of the square there's A BOCCE AREA, where men
     throw metal balls along a track, aiming to get closest to a
     small cue. Dickie is there, playing intensely with Fausto and
     two other guys, one of whom we've seen before with Silvana.
     Ripley and Marge loop back towards home, taking in the Bocce
     en route. Dickie waves. They wave back. Marge calls to him.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom
               and I are running off together.

                         DICKIE
               Okay.

     EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. EARLY EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley are leaving.  They're fooling around.
     Dickie jumps on Ripley's shoulders. Marge watches from the
     top of the garden.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO SQUARE. EARLY EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley, still horsing about, pass Silvana's
     grocery store.  Dickie dismounts, goes over to Silvana, who's
     tense, a little troubled. They huddle, Ripley isolated.

                         SILVANA
               Did you get my message?  I want to talk
               to you.

                         DICKIE
               I want to talk to you too...Smile for me.

     And Dickie's already gone, back to Ripley feinting to box him
     then dancing, satyr-like, down the hill.

     EXT. COASTAL ROAD TO NAPLES. EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley on the Vespa. There's a steep incline where
     the road winds down towards Naples and, as the Vespa gains
     speed, Ripley is happy to cling to Dickie.

                         DICKIE
               You're breaking my ribs!

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               You're breaking my ribs!

     INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.

     Ripley's really singing, carrying the burden of My Funny
     Valentine in a flawless imitation of Chet Baker. Dickie is
     playing some sax. After a verse, there's spontaneous
     applause. Dickie, impressed beams at Ripley.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.

     A NEW ICEBOX, incongruous in pride of place in the living
     room, casts its glow on a delighted Dickie as he pulls out a
     couple of beers, handing one to Ripley who is paging through
     his copy of the Collected Works of Shakespeare.

                         DICKIE
               I could fuck this icebox I love it so
               much.
                   (considering Ripley)
               What were you actually doing in New York?

                         RIPLEY
               I played piano in a few places.

                         DICKIE
               That's one job, you told me a lot of
               jobs.

                         RIPLEY
               A few places - that's a few jobs. Anyway,
               I don't want to think about New York.

                         DICKIE
               The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I
               spend hours speculating.
                   (drinking)
               Cold beer. Thank you Dad.

                         RIPLEY
               Copy out from here...

     He hands the book to Dickie, pointing out the lines.

                         DICKIE
                   (staring to write on the back
                    of a postcard)
               I love the fact you brought Shakespeare
               with you and no clothes.  Ermelinda says
               you wash the same shirt out every night.
               Is that true?

                         RIPLEY
               No! I've got more than one shirt!

                         DICKIE
               She can do that stuff for you. Anyway,
               just wear some of my things, wear
               anything you want, most of it's ancient.
                   (he's finished writing)

                         RIPLEY
               Now your signature.
                   (watching him write)
               Not "Dickie". Your signature.

     Dickie writes his signature at the bottom of the postcard.
     Ripley studies the writing, takes off his glasses to clean
     them. Dickie looks at him.

                         DICKIE
               Without the glasses you're not even ugly.
                   (takes them, tries them on)
               I don't need them because I never read.
               How do I look.

                         RIPLEY
               Like Clark Kent.
                   (takes them back, puts them on
                    beaming at Dickie)
               Now Superman.

     Dickie cuffs him.  Ripley looks down at the postcard.

                         DICKIE
               I know. I write like a child.

                         RIPLEY
               Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T,
               do you see? - fine, vulnerable - that's
               pain, that's secret pain.

                         DICKIE
               It must be a deep secret, cause I don't
               know about it.

                         RIPLEY
               Your handwriting - nothing more naked.
               See - nothing's quite touching the line -
               that's vanity.

                         DICKIE
                   (flattered)
               Well we certainly know that's true.

     INT. DICKIE'S BATHROOM. NIGHT.

     Dickie's in the bath. Ripley, dressed, sits on the stool next
     to the bath. They're in the middle of playing chess, the
     board propped on the bath tray. Ripley puts his hand in the
     water, checking the temperature. He turns on the faucet for a
     burst of hot. Ripley is absurdly happy. He pours some wine.

                         DICKIE
               Do you have any brothers?

                         RIPLEY
               No, no brothers, no sisters.

                         DICKIE
               me neither. Nor does Marge. All only
               children - what does that mean?

     He looks at Ripley who looks at him, a little too long.

                         RIPLEY
               Means we never shared a bath.
               I'm cold. Can I get in?

                         DICKIE
               No!

                         RIPLEY
               I didn't mean with you in it.

                         DICKIE
                   (standing)
               Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune
               anyway.

     He gets out, walks past Ripley, who doesn't turn around. But
     Dickie's reflected in the mirror. Ripley looks, then Dickie
     turns, holds his look momentarily before flicking him with
     his towel.

     INT/EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, NAPLES. DAY.

     An OFFICIAL is studying Dickie's passport photograph. It's
     not a recent picture. The official looks suspicious. Dickie
     is used to it.

                         DICKIE
               It is me. It's an old picture.
                   (sighs at Ripley)
               Every time - 'is it you?  Doesn't look
               like you'.

     He's signing for his allowance. He has a smart document case
     with his initials prominently embossed.  Ripley watches him
     sign and collect a large wad of notes.

                         CLERK
               Letters - Greenleaf, and for Ripley.

     Ripley collects and studies his mail. As they walk outside he
     holds up one letter to Dickie.

                         RIPLEY
               Fran.
                   (anticipating her letter)
               I miss you, where are you coming home?
               Stop telling me what a great time you're
               having, how you love Dickie... and Marge
               and...
                   (the next letter)
               And this one, I think, is your dad...

     INT. TRAIN TO ROME. DAY.

     Ripley sits reading the LETTER from Herbert Greenleaf.  He
     frowns, stops reading, looks out of the window.

                         DICKIE
               What does he say?

                         RIPLEY
               He's getting impatient. He wants me to
               reassure him you'll be home by
               Thanksgiving.

                         DICKIE
               You've got to get a new jacket. Really.
               You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm
               sick of seeing you in them.

                         RIPLEY
               I can't. I can't keep spending your
               father's money.

                         DICKIE
               I love how responsible you are. My Dad
               should make you Chief Accountant or
               something.  Let me buy you a jacket.
               There's a great place when we get to
               Rome, Batistoni.

     Ripley loves this idea and mouths the word, "Batistoni".

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Andiamo a Roma.  We're taking Tom to
               Roma!

     EXT. ARCARI'S CAFE, PIAZZA NAVONA, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley and Dickie sit outside at a Cafe in the Piazza Navona.
     Very smart, very sophisticated, very young crowd.  There are
     already several empty coffee cups and a half empty bottle of
     Frascati.  Ripley has his guide book out and is incredibly
     impatient. Dickie, meanwhile, has stretched out for the
     duration.

                         RIPLEY
               Where do we find a carozza for the Forum,
               or can we hire any of them - ?

                         DICKIE
               Relax.

                         RIPLEY
               It's just there's so much to do in a
               single day.

                         DICKIE
               Relax. The most important question is
               where to eat. I hope Freddie made a
               reservation.

                         RIPLEY
               Freddie?

                         DICKIE
               Freddie Miles.  You know - he's
               organizing the Cortina skiing trip.

     Ripley hates the idea of having this special day invaded. A
     horn makes him look up as FREDDIE MILES illegally parks his
     open top sports car opposite the cafe, sees Dickie and
     bustles over.  He's a heavy-set American with a reddish
     crewcut. Ripley finds him disgusting to look at. Dickie is
     delighted.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Frederico!

                         FREDDIE
               Ciao bello.
                   (noticing a beautiful woman in
                    an open-topped car)
               Don't you want to fuck every woman you
               see.  Just once.

     They kiss cheeks, continental-style.

                         DICKIE
               This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.

                         FREDDIE
                   (mugging)
               Hey, if I'm late, think what her
               husband's saying!

     He fills Dickie's glass with wine and drinks it standing up.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               So let's go. I got us a table outside at
               Fabrizio's.

     And Dickie's up, leaving Ripley to pick up all the tiny
     checks to work out the bill and pay it.

                         DICKIE
               I'll tell you - I am so cabin-crazy with
               Mongi.

     Freddie and Dickie link arms Italian-style and cross the
     street to Freddie's car.

                         FREDDIE
               I know.  I was there.
                   (looks back to see Ripley
                    struggling to settle the
                    check)
               Tommy!  It's S.R.O.  Two seater.
               Standing Room Only.  Chop, chop, Tommy!

     Ripley, abandoned, goes over. There's no room in the car. He
     has to crouch in the rear.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               You're going to have to sit between us.
               But don't put your shoes on the seat,
               know what I mean, put them one on top of
               the other.  Okay?

     INT. A JAZZ RECORD STORE. LATE AFTERNOON.

     This record store is hidden away down a cobbled alley, and
     stuffed with the trendiest Romans, all of whom rifle the
     stacks under a fog of cigarette smoke.  There are two
     LISTENING BOOTHS, one of which has Freddie and Dickie crammed
     into it, sharing a set of headphones.  Ripley stands outside
     the booth, holding both of their jackets like a manservant,
     while inside and behind the glass doors they chat animatedly.
     He looks longingly at the street, where the light is fading.
     Dickie catches his hangdog expression and pushes open the
     accordion doors.

                         DICKIE
               Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and
               meet some friends of Freddie's. The best
               thing is - if you want to be a tourist -
               grab a cab and we can meet up at the
               railway station.

                         RIPLEY
                   (absolutely crestfallen)
               What club?

                         DICKIE
               Freddie's arranged it with some of the
               skiing crowd. Come if you want but I
               thought you wanted to see the Forum...?

                         RIPLEY
               I did. And then maybe get the jacket and
               what have you...

                         FREDDIE
                   (from inside the booth)
               Dick - you've got to hear this!

                         DICKIE
                   (oblivious to Ripley's pain)
               Listen, just take one of mine when we get
               back. Don't worry about it.  I did the
               Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is
               enough in anyone's life.

     Ripley hands him the coats, turns away.

                         DICKIE
               Ciao.  Have fun.

     Ripley heads for the door, then comes back, raps on the
     booth.  Dickie pushes it open.

                         RIPLEY
               You said to make sure you didn't miss the
               train. It leaves at eight.

     EXT. THE CAPITOL. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley hikes up Michelangelo's Arcoeli Steps. Then he's
     looking down from the Campodoglio at the Forum below. Then
     he's walking by the oversized fragments of the Colossus. This
     is the real Ripley, the lover of beauty, inspired by art, by
     antiquity. He's awed. He's cold. He so much wishes he weren't
     alone.

     INT. ROME RAILWAY STATION. NIGHT.

     It's past eight, Ripley stands, one foot on the guard step of
     the Naples train, waiting forlornly for Dickie, then giving
     up as the train pulls away. He pulls the door to his
     compartment closed, and sits inside the train alone.

     INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

     There's music playing, Bing Crosby's "May I". Very loud.
     Ripley dances to the mirror, SPECTACLES ABANDONED and DRESSED
     AS DICKIE IN HIS TUXEDO, MINUS TROUSERS. He adjusts his hair,
     catches one of Dickie's expressions.  There are clothes
     abandoned everywhere.  He's been having a big dressing-up
     session. He sings along with Bing.

                         DICKIE (O/S)
               What are you doing?

     Ripley turns, horrified, to see Dickie standing in the
     doorway.  The music thumps away.

                         RIPLEY
               Oh - just amusing myself.  Sorry, Dickie.
                   (pause)
               I didn't think you were coming back.

     Dickie turns off the record player.

                         DICKIE
               I wish you'd get out of my clothes.

     Ripley starts undressing, his fingers clumsy with
     mortification and shock.  Dickie looks at his feet, shakes
     his head.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Shoes too?

                         RIPLEY
                   (lame, ashamed)
               You said I could pick out a jacket and I
               just... Sorry.

                         DICKIE
               Get undressed in your own room, would
               you?

                         RIPLEY
               I thought you'd missed the train.

                         DICKIE
               Freddie drove me back in his car.

                         RIPLEY
                   (horrified)
               Is Freddie here?

                         DICKIE
               He's downstairs.

                         RIPLEY
               I was just fooling around. Don't say
               anything. Sorry.

     Dickie lets him leave and then sits amongst the debris of the
     dressing-up session, not amused.

     EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. DAY.

     Ripley comes down, apprehensive, to find Marge and Dickie and
     Freddie having a jolly breakfast on the terrace. Dickie looks
     perfectly happy.

                         MARGE
               Hi, Tom.  Come join us.

                         FREDDIE
               I want this job of yours, Tommy. I was
               just saying - You live in Italy, sleep in
               Dickie's house, eat Dickie's food, wear
               his clothes, and his father picks up the
               tab. If you get bored, let me know, I'll
               do it!

     EXT. THE OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DAY.

     The boat is drifting.  Freddie and Dickie and Marge are
     swimming, then Marge climbs back onto the boat, where Ripley
     is sitting alone, reading.

                         MARGE
               You really should go in, it's marvellous.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm fine.

     She approaches him, conscious of his isolation. She's in a
     red bikini, and she towels herself dry as they speak.

                         MARGE
               Are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               Sure.

     They watch Dickie and Freddie fooling around in the water.

                         MARGE
               The thing with Dickie - it's like the sun
               shines on you and it's glorious, then he
               forgets you and it's very very cold.

                         RIPLEY
               So I'm learning.

                         MARGE
               He's not even aware of it. When you've
               got his attention you feel like you're
               the only person in the world. That's why
               everybody loves him. Other times...

     There's a yell from Dickie as Freddie wrestles with him.

                         DICKIE
                   (laughing and choking)
               He's drowning me!

                         MARGE
               It's always the same whenever someone new
               comes into his life - Freddie, Fausto,
               Peter Smith-Kingsley - he's wonderful -
               did you meet him, he's a musician? -
               ... and especially you, of course... and
               that's only the boys.

     They watch as Freddie pushes Dickie under the surface.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               Tell me, why is it when men play they
               always play at killing each other...?
               I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.

                         RIPLEY
               What about Cortina?

                         MARGE
               Didn't Dick say? - he talked to
               Freddie... apparently it's not going to
               work out -
                   (Ripley's devastated, Marge
                    notices, can't look at him)
               Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.

     EXT. OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DUSK.

     LATER and now the boat is sailing again. Ripley is sitting in
     his spot. Dickie and Freddie are at the tiller.

                         DICKIE
               Come on, Frederico, do you really have
               to go back?  At least stick around for
               the Festival of the Madonna.

                         FREDDIE
               I don't think so. Come back with me to
               Rome. There's this great new club.  Have
               some drinks, lotta ladies...

     Marge, still in her bikini, disappears into the cabin. Dickie
     makes a face at Freddie.

                         DICKIE
               Do you think you can steer this thing?

                         FREDDIE
               Sure.

                         DICKIE
               Just point her at Capri and avoid the
               rocks.

                         FREDDIE
               What are you doing?

                         DICKIE
               Marge-maintenance.

                         FREDDIE
               Aye, aye.

     Dickie heads towards the cabin. Freddie takes over the
     tiller. There's a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the
     water.

     From where Ripley sits he can see Capri in the distance, but
     he can also look down into the cabin, its porthole offering
     him a restricted view.  He looks down and there's a flash of
     flesh, then nothing.  Then as the boat swings with the waves,
     he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair, and then
     Marge's bare foot kicking out rhythmically, the red-painted
     toes straining.  Ripley's mesmerized, aroused, and absolutely
     betrayed.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               Tommy - How's the peeping? Come on Tommy,
               you were looking.  Tommy Tommy Tommy.

     Shamed, Ripley looks away. He stares at the water, parting
     before the boat, its turmoil reflecting his.

     EXT. DICKIE'S MOORING. DAY.

     The Bird returns to the mooring by Dickie's House.  Dickie as
     ever Captain of the Ship, clambering around, shouting
     instructions, with Ripley, Marge and Freddie as crew.  Ripley
     looks back at shore. Silvana stands watching, staring.
     Dickie notices her too.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO SLIPWAY. LATE DAY.

     A WOMAN'S HEAD suddenly breaks the surface of the water.

     It's a statue of the Virgin Mary, life size, adorned with
     flowers and a lace veil.  As she is revealed, wooden,
     staring, four men emerge, lifting the statue on a palette,
     wading towards the shore, the Madonna aloft on their
     shoulders.

     The whole town of Mongibello is in attendance for this Annual
     Festival of the Madonna del Mare, either standing in their
     fishing boats, or on shore and flanking the Parish Priest and
     altar boys and incense. RIPLEY, DICKIE and MARGE watch from
     Dickie's terrace. There are hymns and, as the statue is
     carried to the shore, the men's heads barely above the waves,
     the congregation applauds at the illusion that the Madonna is
     walking on water.

     Suddenly ANOTHER HEAD appears on the surface of the water,
     about fifty yards from the statue. There's a scream from
     among the crowd as someone notices the body. It's SILVANA.
     One of the MEN carrying the statue turns first towards the
     direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse.
     It's Silvana's fiancee, and in a second he has let go of the
     palette, CAUSING IT TO TOPPLE, and - in absolute grief -
     wades, swims, splashes towards the body.

     PANDEMONIUM in the crowd, which breaks up, with other people
     splashing, fully clothed, into the water. From the terrace,
     Ripley turns and looks at Dickie, catching his eye.

     EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. LATE DAY.

     Marge and Ripley and Dickie watch from the terrace as below
     them an AMBULANCE takes away the body. It seems as if the
     whole town looks on - fiancee, parents, brothers, sisters,
     police, priest, etc. As the corpse is loaded into the vehicle
     A BRIEF SCUFFLE occurs between Silvana's fiancee and her
     brother. They are pulled apart. Then the ambulance pulls
     away.

                         RIPLEY
               What's the fight about? That's her
               fiancÈ, isn't it?  Are they blaming him?

                         DICKIE
                   (sharp)
               I don't know! Why are you asking me?
                   (agitated)
               How can it take an hour to find an
               ambulance?

                         MARGE
                   (conciliatory)
               Well, she was already dead, darling,
               wasn't she, so I suppose -

                         DICKIE
               I don't know why people say this
               country's civilised. It isn't. It's
               fucking primitive.

     And with that HE KICKS OUT VIOLENTLY AT A CHAIR SUPPORTING
     THE RECORDPLAYER. Records, machine, chair go flying across
     the terrace. Dickie storms inside.

                         MARGE
               Dickie!

                         RIPLEY
               I'll go and see what's the matter.

                         MARGE
               I'll go.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Later, Dickie is slumped in an armchair at the open window
     overlooking the slipway. He's playing sax. A forlorn, keening
     phrase from YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS. Ripley appears,
     begins tidying the mess in the living room.  He picks up
     empty bottles, an abandoned bikini top.

                         RIPLEY
               I know why you're upset.
                   (Dickie continues playing)
               I know about Silvana, Dickie. About you
               and Silvana.

     Dickie stops playing.

                         DICKIE
               What about us?

     He now has an armful of dishes and glasses and bottles.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
                   (losing his temper)
               You don't have to clean up! Really!

     Ripley disappears into the kitchen.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
                   (as Ripley returns)
               She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do
               you know what that means in a place like
               this?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm prepared to take the blame.

                         DICKIE
               What are you talking about?

                         RIPLEY
               You've been so good to me. You're the
               brother I never had. I'm the brother you
               never had.

                         DICKIE
               She came to me for help, she needed
               money, and I didn't help her. I didn't
               help her. Now she's dead and it's my
               fault.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm not going to say anything - to Marge,
               or anybody, the police - It's a secret
               between us and I'll keep it.

     And he disappears again, leaving Dickie to resume the sax,
     somehow in thrall to Ripley.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               Dear Tom, I think the time has come to
               discontinue your expense checks...

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, NAPLES. DAY.

     Ripley and Dickie are walking out of the American Express
     Office, Dickie pushing the rest of his money into his case,
     Ripley - despondent - reading aloud extracts from a letter
     from Herbert Greenleaf -

                         RIPLEY
               ...The thousand dollars, of course, was
               only due in the event that you succeeded
               in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I
               hope the trip has afforded you some
               pleasure despite the failure of its main
               objective you need no longer consider
               yourself obligated to us in any way...

                         DICKIE
               You can't blame him.  You could hardly
               expect this to go on forever.

                         RIPLEY
               I thought you might write again. Now that
               we're brothers...

                         DICKIE
               I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've
               had a good run, haven't we?

                         RIPLEY
                   (increasingly miserable)
               What about Venice? Can we stick to that
               plan at least?

                         DICKIE
               I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on
               here without money.  It's time we all
               moved on.  Besides I'm sick of Mongi.
               Especially now with everything - I really
               want to move to the North. I need to
               check out San Remo next week, find
               somewhere new to keep the boat.
               But it would be great, though, if you
               came with me.  Our last trip before you
               leave. There's a jazz festival - we could
               say goodbye in style.  What do you think?
               A last trip?

     INT. TRAIN TO SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.

     Dickie and Ripley travel up to San Remo. They sit next to
     each other. Dickie's asleep. Ripley lays his head on Dickie's
     shoulder, but as he does that, the ticket inspector announces
     the San Remo stop, taps on the window and Dickie stirs. Then
     Ripley plays his familiar game of studying his face in the
     reflection of the train window, so that he can move his head
     and see his reflection, then back and see Dickie's.  Dickie
     suddenly catches him staring. Ripley looks away.

                         DICKIE
                   (terse)
               Why do you do that thing - with your
               neck? On trains you always do that thing,
               it's so spooky.

     EXT. HOTEL TERRACE RESTAURANT, SAN REMO. NIGHT.

     Dickie and Ripley walk through the terrace of an hotel which
     lips out towards the sea. There's a restaurant and palms and
     a JAZZ QUINTET playing, American. Very cool. They pass the
     band. Dickie's captivated as they head for their table. They
     pass some girls at a table. Dickie smiles greedily.

                         DICKIE
               This is more like it. Didn't I tell you
               San Remo was crazy!

     They're shown to a good table. Dickie watches the band while
     their glasses are filled with champagne. Ripley looks happy.
     He's got Dickie all to himself.

                         RIPLEY
               To Mongibello and the happiest days of my
               life.

                         DICKIE
               To Mongi.  You're cheerful tonight.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm suddenly quite happy to be going
               back.

                         DICKIE
               That's good.

                         RIPLEY
               I've got plans!

                         DICKIE
               Ripley's plans.

                         RIPLEY
               Esatto. I'm always planning.

                         DICKIE
               Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I
               didn't, did I?

                         RIPLEY
               Why are you asking all of a sudden?

                         DICKIE
               No reason. Because you're leaving, I
               guess. I don't think you were there, were
               you?

                         RIPLEY
               Why?

                         DICKIE
               I mean it as a compliment. You've got
               such great taste, I don't know. Most of
               the thugs at Princeton had tasted
               everything and had no taste. Used to say,
               the cream of America: rich and thick.
               Freddie's the perfect example.

                         RIPLEY
               Then I'll take it as a compliment.

                         DICKIE
               I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!

                         RIPLEY
                   (a beat)
               Ha.

                         DICKIE
               Do you even like jazz - or was that
               something for my benefit?

                         RIPLEY
                   (conceding, without guile)
               I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to
               like everything about the way you live.
               It's one big love affair. If you knew my
               life back home in New York...

     Dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert
     solo, doesn't hear the confession of love.

                         DICKIE
               I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what
               do you think about drums?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               So cool.

     He mimes a high-hat and snare. Ripley can't quite credit this
     - it's superficiality.

     EXT. MID OCEAN. DAY.

     The bay of San Remo. DICKIE and RIPLEY have hired a motor 
     boat.

                         DICKIE
               That's how I found my place in Mongi.
               Took a boat out round the bay.  The first
               place I liked, I got it.

     The motor boat is ploughing the waves. Dickie exhilarated by
     the speed.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie, slow down, come on!

     Ripley grips the oar, his knuckles white. Dickie cuts the
     motor, and the boat slows to a crawl, miles from the shore.

                         DICKIE
                   (ecstatic)
               I love it here! Gonna live here!

     Dickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of
     the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers,
     already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich.

                         RIPLEY
               I wanted to tell you my plan.

                         DICKIE
               So tell me.

                         RIPLEY
               I thought I might come back. In the New
               Year. Under my own steam.

                         DICKIE
                   (suddenly tight)
               Really?  To Italy?

                         RIPLEY
               Of course. Let's say, for argument's
               sake, you were here - perhaps we could
               split the rent on a house - I'll get a
               job - or, better still, I could get a
               place in Rome and when we're there we
               could be there and if we're here we could
               be here -

                         DICKIE
               Oh God, I don't think so.

                         RIPLEY
               - you see, particularly with the Marge
               problem, you can just blame me.

                         DICKIE
               Marge and I are getting married.

                         RIPLEY
                   (appalled)
               How?

                         DICKIE
               How?

                         RIPLEY
               Yesterday you're ogling girls on the
               terrace, today you're getting married.
               It's absurd.

                         DICKIE
               I love Marge.

                         RIPLEY
               You love me and you're not marrying me.

                         DICKIE
                   (cold)
               Tom, I don't love you.

                         RIPLEY
               No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained
               all of that.

                         DICKIE
               I'm actually a little relieved you're
               going, to be honest. I think we've seen
               enough of each other for a while.

     Ripley stares at him, his eyes suddenly reptilian.

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               You can be a leech - you know this - and
               it's boring. You can be quite boring.

                         RIPLEY
                   (volcanic)
               The funny thing - I'm not pretending to
               be somebody else and you are. I'm
               absolutely honest with you. I've told you
               my feelings. But you, first of all I know
               there's something - that evening when we
               played chess, for instance, it was
               obvious -

                         DICKIE
                   (incredulous)
               What evening?

                         RIPLEY
               Sure - I know, that's too dangerous for
               you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers,
               fine, then you do this sordid thing with
               Marge, fucking her on the boat while we
               all have to listen, which was
               excruciating, frankly, plus you follow
               your cock around like a - and now you're
               getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive
               me...you're lying to Marge then getting
               married to her, you're knocking up
               Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've
               got to play drums, which is it, Dickie,
               what do you really play?

     Dickie, furious, gets up, and lurches towards Ripley.

                         DICKIE
                   (attacking him, administering
                    tiny slaps as punctuation to
                    his tirade)
               Who are you - some imposter, some third
               class mooch - who are you to tell me
               anything? Actually, I really really
               really don't want to be on this boat with
               you, I can't move without you moving,
               which is exactly how it feels and it
               gives me the creeps.
                   (he goes to rev up the engine)
               I can't move without - "Dickie, Dickie,
               Dickie" - like a little girl.  You give
               me the -

     RIPLEY SMASHES HIM ACROSS THE HEAD WITH THE OAR. DICKIE SLIPS
     OFF THE WOODEN SEAT, HIS EYES ROLLING IN GROGGY SURPRISE.

                         RIPLEY
               Shut up! Just shut up! Just shut up!

     The boat slows as Dickie releases the tiller.  Dickie looks
     up at Ripley wearily and slides onto his back.

                         DICKIE
               For God's sake.

     Ripley, shocked at himself, goes to Dickie, rocking the boat,
     catches him up, then is horrified to see Dickie's face,
     apparently unmarked, SUDDENLY SPLIT OPEN, a line of blood and
     then a peeling like a fruit bursting. Ripley's appalled.  A
     terrible roar issues from Dickie as he launches himself at
     Ripley.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               I'll kill you!

     Ripley finds himself pushing him away, picking up the oar,
     kicking off Dickie's hand around his ankle. The boat is
     rocking and swerving crazily as Dickie falls against the
     tiller. Ripley almost loses his balance. His glasses come
     off. They struggle, locked together in a life or death
     wrestle to get control of the oar. Dickie's blinded by his
     own blood, loses his grip.

     Ripley, terrified, hits Dickie again and again, the oar like
     a carpet-beater banging down flat, blood on the blade, blood
     on Ripley, until he's on his knees, heaving for breath,
     letting his arm drop, then realizing, disgusted, that he's
     let it rest in a pool of blood. He starts to sob, sprawls
     there, sobbing, next to Dickie, horrified by what he's done.

     Nobody's in sight.  The boat rocks, gently, the sun sparkling
     indifferently on the waves.  Ripley lies by Dickie in the
     bottom of the boat, in the embrace he's always wanted.

     The pretty blue-and-white boat rocks peacefully.  The sea
     calms.

     EXT. A COVE NEAR SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.

     A deserted cove, several miles along the coast. Ripley
     clambers onto a rock over the shore.  He's watching the boat
     slowly sinking. Shuddering from the exertion, the cold, he
     finds Dickie's jacket, puts it on and watches as the boat
     disappears under the surface.

     EXT. SAN REMO. DUSK.

     Ripley walks back towards the hotel, still wearing Dickie's
     jacket, cold and wet, his bag over his shoulder.

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley approaches the front desk.  He's shivering.  He's not
     wearing his glasses.

                         RIPLEY
               Can I have my key, please?

                         RECEPTIONIST
                   (at the key rack)
               Of course - But you must be very cold?
               Signor Greenleaf?  Yes? -

                         RIPLEY
                   (mind racing)
               No, it's - I'm...

     EXT. ROAD BETWEEN NAPLES AND MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley sits on the bus as it rumbles towards Mongi.  He
     stares out of the window, full of what he's done. No idea
     what to do.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. DAY.

     The BUS comes into town. Ripley gets out, looks calm, very
     together.

     INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM, MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley walks into the living room, slowly approaches
     Dickie's saxophone which is on its stand on the table.  He
     can't get close to it, it evokes Dickie too much.

     INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. DAY.

     Ripley has Dickie's Hermes Baby typewriter on the desk and is
     busy writing letters. He has finished a letter to the
     Greenleafs, now he's at the end of one to Marge. We can read
     part of it - C/O American Express, Rome 9 November 1958. Dear
     Marge, this is a difficult letter for me to write... Ripley
     produces the Shakespeare and Signature page and COPIES
     DICKIE'S SIGNATURE at the end of the letter.

     EXT. MARGE'S GARDEN, MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley stands at the entrance to Marge's garden where she is
     working at her book on the outside table, surrounded by
     references and notes, held down by bricks. He looks at her
     until she looks at him. She's startled, gasps.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Marge.

                         MARGE
               Tom, you startled me!  You're back.

                         RIPLEY
               How are you? Sorry. Is your book going
               well?

                         MARGE
               Yes - I'm on a good streak, thanks.

                         RIPLEY
               I was just looking at you -
                   (looking at her tenderly)
               - so quiet.

                         MARGE
               Where's Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               I think he's planning on staying in Rome
               for a few days.

                         MARGE
                   (looks at him)
               Ha. Did he say why?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. I don't understand Dickie,
               Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.

                         MARGE
               What does that mean?

                         RIPLEY
               Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the
               next day I'm not, one day we're all one
               family, the next day he wants to be
               alone. You tell me.

                         MARGE
               Is that what he said - he wanted to be
               alone?

                         RIPLEY
               He was thinking of you, Marge - he asked
               me to deliver this.

     He hands her a package. She pulls at it, it's perfume.

                         MARGE
               Thanks. he knows I love this, although
               why it couldn't have waited...

                         RIPLEY
               Errand number one - deliver Marge's
               perfume. Errand number two, pack some
               clothes and his precious saxophone.

                         MARGE
                   (alarmed)
               How long's he staying for?

                         RIPLEY
               Search me. I guess we're abandoned.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, BEACH. EARLY MORNING.

     Marge is walking along the beach and out onto the jetty,
     forlorn, a bleached figure on this winter morning.

     INT. OFF FROM DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. MORNING.

     As Ripley walks down the stairs, Marge is at the icebox in
     the living room. She's fixing herself a drink, has the icebox
     open for ice. She's ashen, and might have been weeping, walks
     back into the kitchen area.

                         MARGE
               There was a letter from Dickie in with my
               perfume. You realize it's more than a few
               days? He's thinking of moving to Rome.

     She bangs out the ice onto the counter, cubes falling
     everywhere. Ripley drops to the floor and starts to clear
     them up.  She's got the letter, shows it to Ripley. He puts
     fresh ice into her glass.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               The thing is, the night before he left,
               we talked about moving, together, going
               North - and I suppose I put some pressure
               on him, about getting married, I just
               might have scared him off. There's a side
               to him, when our heads are on the pillow,
               I know no-one else sees it, which is
               really tender.
                   (unravelling)
               I think I should come with you to Rome
               and just confront him.

     Ripley lights a cigarette.  Marge loses confidence.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               He hates being confronted.

                         RIPLEY
               I think you're right.

     INT. ALBERGO GOLDONI, ROME. DAY.

     RIPLEY'S BATTERED CASES are carried into the tiny lobby of
     this small hotel. He exchanges his passport at the desk for
     his room key, then makes his way, carrying his own luggage to
     the metal cage elevator. THIS SCENE INTERCUTS WITH:

     INT. HOTEL GRAND. DAY.

     DICKIE'S ARRAY OF LEATHER LUGGAGE is pulled along on a 
     baggage trolley by a liveried PORTER.

     Dickie's passport slides across the marble desk. A key comes
     back, collected by a hand sporting Dickie's two distinctive
     rings.  As ALDO, the Front Desk Manager, inspects the
     passport, he looks at the owner.  Ripley wears a terrific
     suit, his hair parted in the Greenleaf style, no glasses. His
     voice, when he speaks, has the same, lazy, confident drawl.

                         ALDO
               Welcome back, Signor Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
                   (walking away)
               Thank you.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. DAY.

     The PORTER takes the cases and opens them as Ripley walks
     around the suite. It's large and splendid. Ripley breathes in
     its opulence.  He immediately picks up the telephone.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, I'd like you to telephone the Hotel
               Goldoni. Yes. I want to speak to Signor
               Thomas Ripley - No Ripley, R, yes.
               Grazie.

     He produces Dickie's pen and signs the blotter quickly - H R
     Greenleaf.  Then he pulls out a postcard from the writing
     case to reveal Dickie's Stars, hide your fires handwriting
     specimen. He compares the two signatures, is pleased.

     The telephone rings.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Pronto? Signor Ripley is not there? I'd
               like to leave a message. Yes. Please call
               Dickie - Dickie Greenleaf - at the Grand.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOTEL ROOM, GOLDONI. DAY.

     A tiny, cell of a room, single bed. Ripley on the phone.

                         RIPLEY
               He's not there?  Very well. I'll leave a
               message - Got your call. Dinner tonight
               sounds fine. Ripley.
                   (listens as it's read back)
               Dinner tonight, yes, is okay. Yes, thank
               you.

     INT. GUCCI STORE, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley has bought some more LEATHER GOODS - a briefcase and
     overnight bag. He is at the counter, signing checks.

                         RIPLEY
               I'd like these to have my initials -
               embossed, I don't know the word in
               Italian ...embossed?

                         GUCCI ASSISTANT
               Embossed, of course, Signor Greenleaf.

     There's an excited rap on the window and a shout of DICKIE!
     Shocked, Ripley looks over to find MEREDITH LOGUE outside,
     alone and delighted to see him.  He grins and mouths hello.

                         MEREDITH
                   (entering the shop)
               Dickie! Oh my God!  Ciao.

     EXT. ACROSS PIAZZA NAVONA TO ARCARI'S CAFE. DAY.

     Ripley and Meredith walk across the Piazza towards the cafe.

                         MEREDITH
               But you're going skiing with us Yankees,
               aren't you?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MEREDITH
               At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie
               Miles and -

                         RIPLEY
                   (interrupting, astonished)
               How did you know that?

                         MEREDITH
               Everybody knows Freddie Miles.

                         RIPLEY
                   (unsettled)
               Is Freddie in Rome?

                         MEREDITH
               Now? I don't think so. But I've met him,
               of course, and we've chatted and I know
               about you and Marge and Mongi and what an
               unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you
               were a rat and I thought to myself now I
               know why he travels under R.

                         RIPLEY
               I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So
               the rat's here now, in Rome.

                         MEREDITH
               Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if -

                         RIPLEY
               Don't be sorry. I've never been happier.
               I feel like I've been handed a new life.

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.

     Meredith and Ripley walk down the Spanish Steps and head
     inside the office.

                         MEREDITH
               The truth is if you've had money your
               entire life, even if you despise it,
               which we do - agreed? - you're only truly
               comfortable around other people who have
               it and despise it.

                         RIPLEY
               I know.

                         MEREDITH
               I've never admitted that to anyone.

     INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley's signing Dickie's allowance receipt. Meredith is with
     him, signing her own counterfoil. He is, of course, endorsed
     by her presence.  She goes to the window ahead of him.

     She takes her money, turns to him.

     He hands over his documents. The Clerk compares Ripley's
     signature with the one on the passport and then looks up at
     him. Ripley is cool as a cucumber.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't want too many large bills. Nobody
               will change them.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. ANOTHER DAY.

     Where A TAILOR is finishing the fitting of a cashmere jacket
     for Ripley. Bolts of cloth everywhere as Meredith adjudicates
     the possible materials, which the tailor holds up against
     Ripley.

                         MEREDITH
               Show me the other one again.
                   (the Tailor obliges)
               I like them both.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll take them both.

     Ripley goes inside the bedroom to change. While he's inside,
     Meredith shows the Tailor out.  As she returns she notices
     the open sax case, peers inside.

                         MEREDITH (O/S)
               I know you're a jazz fiend but do you
               absolutely hate the Opera?  I've been
               trying to give my tickets away, it's
               tomorrow, but if you were prepared to be
               dragged...

     She looks up to catch him bare-chested. She's intoxicated by
     him, the romance she feels to be in the air.

                         RIPLEY
                   (emerging)
               You could drag me.

     INT. THE OPERA HOUSE, ROME.

     On stage is Act Two of Eugene Onegin.  Lensky sings his aria
     before the duel with Onegin.

     Ripley's in a tuxedo, in a box which includes a glamorous
     Meredith and her AUNT AND UNCLE.  He knows what comes next.
     Lensky is shot by Onegin. Blood pours from his neck into the
     snow.  Onegin, horrified at the death of his friend, goes
     over, wraps Lensky in his cloak, the silk lining flashing,
     kneels holding him... Ripley can barely hide his emotion...
     Meredith watches her sensitive friend, entranced.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE BOXES, OPERA HOUSE, ROME.

     The Interval.  Ripley and Meredith exit their box with
     Meredith's Aunt and Uncle (who heads for the interval
     drinks).

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.

                         JOAN
               Can you bear it?  We hear you're a friend
               of Freddie's - he has I hate Opera
               tattooed on his chest.

                         RIPLEY
               There's room for a whole libretto on
               Freddie's chest.

                         JOAN
                   (laughs)
               I'm sure we've met.

     They reach the console where Uncle Ted has their drinks.

                         JOAN (cont'd)
               I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted?
               This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks, yes, I think we did.

                         JOAN
               One minute you people are children and
               the next you're getting tattooed.

     INT. OPERA HOUSE, FOYER. NIGHT.

     Ripley heads past the Beautiful People on his hunt for the
     Men's Room, and walks straight into a young and cultured
     Englishman.  They greet each other and suddenly MARGE is
     beside them.

                         MARGE
                   (as if she's seen a ghost)
               Oh my God. Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, how are you? What are you doing in
               Rome?

                         MARGE
               Is he here? Are you with Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               No.
                   (to Smith-Kingsley)
               Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.

                         PETER
               Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about
               you, of course - from Marge, and Dickie.

                         MARGE
                   (works out what's strange)
               No glasses.

     He fishes out the glasses.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Peter)
               Ditto.

                         PETER
               Where are you hiding him? He's
               impossible, isn't he?

                         MARGE
               Is he really not here?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera
               tattooed on his chest.

                         MARGE
               You were going to Venice.

                         PETER
               Yes, what happened? I heard you were
               desperate to come. I was looking forward
               to rowing you around.

                         RIPLEY
               I am.  I really am. And I've been
               travelling. I just can't seem to get that
               far north.

                         PETER
               Well hurry, before we sink.
                   (reaches into his jacket)
               Should I give you my telephone number in
               Venice?

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

     The INTERVAL BELL'S ringing. Peter hands over his card to
     Ripley, sees Meredith.

                         PETER
               Look there's Meredith thingy - who's
               that, Marge? - they're in textiles...
               Meredith -
                   (embarrassed at not
                    remembering)
               God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in
               her house...!

                         MARGE
               I don't know her.
                   (to Ripley)
               He hasn't called, he's hardly written,
               just these cryptic notes. You don't just
               dump people.

     The last INTERVAL BELL. There's a mini-stampede to return.

                         PETER
               Will we see you later?

                         RIPLEY
               I can't later.

                         PETER
               And tomorrow?

                         RIPLEY
               Tomorrow's possible. Do you know
               Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?

                         PETER
               I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?

                         RIPLEY
               Ten thirty?

                         PETER
               We'll be there.

                         RIPLEY
               Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.
                   (to Peter)
               It's really good to meet you.

     INT. BOX, OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT.

     Ripley goes straight to Meredith and grabs her.

                         RIPLEY
               Let's go.

                         MEREDITH
               I thought you were enjoying yourself?

                         RIPLEY
               Let's take a Carozza and look at the
               moon.

                         MEREDITH
               You're crazy! It's freezing out there.

     He's looking past her, where a mirror reflects Marge wading
     through the audience, Peter's elegant head getting
     dangerously near as they approach their seats.

                         RIPLEY
               C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the
               two of us.

                         MEREDITH
                   (quite taken)
               Okay then, you're crazy.

     EXT. CAROZZA, ROME. NIGHT.

     Meredith shivers in the raw night as they cross the Tiber.
     Ripley as Dickie is confessing his heart belongs to Marge.

                         MEREDITH
               Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.

                         RIPLEY
               You're such a pal to understand. It's as
               if Marge is here now - I look at you and
               I see her face - and I can't, whatever
               I'm feeling towards you - I just can't...

                         MEREDITH
               No, I absolutely understand. Of course.

                         RIPLEY
               Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.

                         MEREDITH
               Beating you away.

     EXT. MEREDITH'S APARTMENT, ROME.

     They arrive at the courtyard outside Meredith's Apartment
     Building. Ripley jumps down, collects her. She makes to go
     inside, then looks at him.

                         MEREDITH
               Will you meet me tomorrow?  Just to say
               goodbye in the daylight, properly? So
               it's not just this, it's too...you should
               always save pain for daylight...

                         RIPLEY
               Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll
               meet you. Let's have coffee in the
               morning at Dinelli's.

                         MEREDITH
                   (fluttering)
               I don't - is that by the Spanish Steps?

                         RIPLEY
               Exactly. 10.30 -
                   (instantly correcting himself)
               10.15.

     He gets back into the carozza. It moves off.

     EXT. DINELLI'S CAFE, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. MORNING.

     Meredith sits waiting in a cafe at the bottom of the Spanish
     Steps. Ripley, dressed as Ripley, is at the top of the steps,
     among early tourists, watching as she drinks her coffee at an
     outside table. Then Marge and Peter appear walking up the Via
     Condotti, head for another table, don't see Meredith.  She
     acknowledges Peter who hasn't noticed her.

                         MEREDITH
               Peter? Hello, it's Meredith Logue.

                         PETER
               Of course it is, Meredith, hello, I'm
               sorry, half-asleep, how are you? This is
               Marge Sherwood. Meredith Logue.

                         MARGE
               Hello.

     Hearing Marge's name Meredith reacts, freezes.

                         PETER
               Join us, won't you? We're just waiting
               for a friend. Do you know, I wonder did
               we see you at the Opera last night?

                         MEREDITH
               I won't actually, although I think this
               might - are you waiting for Dickie?

                         PETER
               Well no, as it happens, although...

                         MARGE
                   (stunned at the mention of his
                    name)
               Dickie? Do you know Dickie?

                         MEREDITH
               You were at the Opera? Well, that
               explains - yes I was there. I was there
               with Dickie.

                         MARGE
                   (to Peter)
               I told you! I knew it!

                         MEREDITH
                   (moving over to them)
               Marge, I don't know you, so I have no
               right, but Dickie loves you.  He's - I
               think you'll find he's coming home to
               you.

                         MARGE
                   (proprietorial)
               How would you know that?

                         MEREDITH
               He told me everything. I was supposed to
               meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I...I'm
               going to go now, I think. Unless he meant
               us to meet - which would be a little
               cruel, wouldn't it?

                         PETER
               No, we're meeting another friend. Tom
               Ripley.

                         MARGE
               Do you know Tom?

                         MEREDITH
               Ripley? No. I heard about him, of course,
               but no, I didn't meet him.

     The WAITER has arrived to take orders. Meredith indicates
     she's leaving.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               Not for me. No, grazie.

     Marge is on the edge. Peter lays a hand to comfort her.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               I hope I didn't complicate matters, but
               nothing, nothing untoward happened,
               nothing to prevent you from welcoming him
               back, from marrying him...Goodbye.
               Goodbye Peter, please don't get up.

     Peter gets up. Ripley, from his vantage point at the top of
     the steps, watches Meredith leave and walk off into the
     crowd. He begins the slow walk down towards the square. As he
     becomes visible to the cafe, he starts to hurry. He's
     apologising to Marge and Peter as they see him, in his
     element, lying and believing in his lie.

                         RIPLEY
               Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers.
               Italian bureaucracy - never one stamp
               when they can make you line up for three.
               Have you been waiting long?

                         PETER
               Not at all. Morning Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Hi.
                   (to Marge)
               Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've
               seen a ghost...

                         MARGE
               Dickie was at the Opera last night.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't
               drag Dickie to -

                         MARGE
               He was there with someone. So I suppose
               she must have dragged him - that's not
               fair.  I'm going back to Mongi. I think
               Dickie's coming home.
                   (to Peter)
               I'm going to go home.

                         RIPLEY
               Really? That's swell. No, I was just -
               you're way ahead of me! Great!

                         PETER
               We think he's had a change of heart.
                   (to Marge)
               So we should be celebrating.

                         MARGE
               I hope so.

                         PETER
                   (to Marge)
               That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith
               said -
                   (to Ripley)
               Meredith's the American girl I saw last
               night, I know her, at the Opera, she's
               been seeing something of Dickie -

                         RIPLEY
               My God.

                         PETER
               But the point is Dickie - well we know
               this - Dickie loves Marge and he misses
               her and apparently he's come to his
               senses...

                         RIPLEY
               It's fantastic.
                   (to Peter)
               I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand
               this, but anytime Dickie does something I
               feel guilty.

     INT. APARTMENT, PALAZZA GIOIA. DAY.

     Ripley is being shown an APARTMENT FOR RENT in the Palazzo
     Gioia by a dry-witted older woman, SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley
     explores, relishing the decor.

                         SIGNORA BUFFI
               Accendo il riscaldamento.
               (I'll turn the heating on.)

                         RIPLEY
                   (mimes playing sax)
               Mi piace suonare.
               (I like to play music.)

                         SIGNORA BUFFI
                   (shrugs)
               Io sono sorda. Quelli di sotto, una
               coppia, sono sordi. Allora, ti piace?
               (I'm deaf. The couple below are deaf. So,
               do you like it?)

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley is in the apartment, fire burning, wearing pyjamas.
     There's a small Christmas tree. He kneels on the floor with
     some festive, gift-wrapped packages. He opens a package. It's
     a marble head of Hadrian. A gasp from Ripley. He picks up a
     glass, pours himself a drink.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley plunges into Bach's Italian Concerto on his new and
     precious toy, a STEINWAY GRAND. His doorbell rings. He stops
     playing. He doesn't get visitors. He rises, a little nervous.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello?

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               Who is it?

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               It's Freddie. Let me in.

     RIPLEY ALMOST COLLAPSES. He's faint.

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Dickie, come on, it's me.

     Ripley can't think what to hide, where to hide. He opens the
     door.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.

                         FREDDIE
                   (confused, not pleasantly)
               Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at
               dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?

                         FREDDIE
               I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm.
               If you said he was still at lunch I'd
               believe you. Incredible. The guy has
               disappeared off the face of the earth.

                         RIPLEY
               I guess.

                         FREDDIE
               The landlady - as far as I could tell,
               the landlady said he was here right now.

                         RIPLEY
               He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I
               can't think why you would imagine Dickie
               would hide from you.

                         FREDDIE
               Because he's been hiding from me - what
               happened at Christmas?

                         RIPLEY
               What about Christmas?

                         FREDDIE
               He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't
               get a cable or a call or a note or,
               frankly, a fart.

     Ripley has his hands behind his back. HE'S TUGGING
     FRANTICALLY AT DICKIE'S RINGS. Ripley wanders into the
     kitchen, turns on the tap to sluice his fingers.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               Of course, he's been very involved in his
               music, hasn't he? I think his theory is,
               you know, you have to go into a cocoon
               before you can become a butterfly.

                         FREDDIE
               Which is horseshit.  Have you heard him
               play that thing?
                   (gesturing at the sax on its
                    stand)
               He can't.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
                   (casually)
               How did you find him? It's such an out of
               the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?

                         FREDDIE
               No thanks.
                   (explaining his detective work)
               Some kid at the American Express Office.
                   (he starts to explore)
               Are you living here?

     Now he starts to hammer a nasty boogie-woogie on the piano.

                         RIPLEY
                   (returning, flinching)
               No. No, I'm staying here for a few days,
               in Rome.  That's a new piano, so you prob -

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Did this place come furnished? It doesn't
               look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? - so
               bourgeois.

     Now he's poking at the Hadrian bust.

                         RIPLEY
               You should watch that!

                         FREDDIE
               In fact the only thing which looks like
               Dickie is you.

                         RIPLEY
               Hardly.

                         FREDDIE
               Have you done something to your hair?

     Ripley starts to smile, his eyes darting around the room.

                         RIPLEY
               Freddie, do you have something to say?

                         FREDDIE
               What? I think I'm saying it. Something's
               going on. He's either converted to
               Christianity - or to something else.

                         RIPLEY
               I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself.
               Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the
               Corso.

                         FREDDIE
               Is it on "delle Croce, just off the
               Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you?
               Last time you didn't know your ass from
               your elbow, now you're giving me
               directions. That's not fair, you probably
               do know your ass from your elbow. I'll
               see you.

     AND HE'S GONE. Ripley shuts the door, smooths the silk runner
     on the table where Freddie's hand had rucked it. He goes back
     to the door, opens it and looks over the rail.

     INT. LANDING AND STAIRS, RIPLEY'S BUILDING. LATE DAY.

     FREDDIE IS BACK IN CONVERSATION WITH SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley
     can't make out the text but there's some discussion about
     Signor Greenleaf and Signor Ripley. Ripley hurries inside as
     Freddie's heavy shoes start to clump up the stairs again.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. LATE DAY.

     Freddie knocks on the door which pushes open. As he marches
     in, he launches into his interrogation.

                         FREDDIE
               Ripley? There's someth -

     - AND WALKS STRAIGHT INTO THE HEAD OF HADRIAN WHICH RIPLEY
     SWINGS AT HIM, HOLDING ON AWKWARDLY WITH BOTH HANDS TO THE
     HEAVY MARBLE SCULPTURE.

     Freddie falls like an ox, first to his knees, groaning, then
     to the floor as Ripley brings the head down again, beating
     him downwards. As Freddie slumps away, Ripley loses his
     balance and the head sends Freddie a glancing blow before
     slipping from Ripley's grasp and smashing on to the floor.
     THE NOSE IS CHIPPED OFF.

     EXT. PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     It's deserted. Ripley hauls Freddie out of the shadows
     towards the car. A couple walk across the square. Ripley
     talks to Freddie, berating him for his drunken stupor. He
     pushes him over the door and into the passenger seat.

                         RIPLEY
                   (mimicking Freddie's voice)
               Hey, if I'm drunk, think what her
               husband's saying.

     EXT. VIA APPIA ANTICA. NIGHT.

     The Fiat noses along THE APPIAN WAY. Black fragments of tombs
     punctuate either side of the poorly lit road. Inside the car,
     Ripley looks to left and right for a place to dump the body.
     He slows near a clump of trees.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. EVENING.

     Someone is KNOCKING urgently at the door. Ripley opens it,
     finds himself face to face with Signora Buffi and TWO
     POLICEMEN. One of them offers his hand.

                         ROVERINI
               Dickie Greenleaf?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes?

                         ROVERINI
               Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. EVENING.

     Ripley sits with his head in his hands at the table. Roverini
     and his sergeant, BAGGIO, watch patiently.

                         ROVERINI
               It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did
               Signor Miles leave yesterday?

                         RIPLEY
               I can't be absolutely sure - 8? 9? We'd
               both taken on far too many drinks - but
               it was dark, it was certainly dark when I
               walked him down to his car.

                         ROVERINI
               So Signor Miles drove away and you did
               what?

                         RIPLEY
               I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but
               I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks.
               I've suffered all day. Who found him?

     Roverini has walked over to the bust of Hadrian.

                         ROVERINI
               Senta.  We have to ask you to stay in
               Rome.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.

                         ROVERINI
               So, the Doctor, he has to make the -
                   (looks at Baggio)
               - come se dice?

                         RIPLEY
               Postmortem?

                         ROVERINI
               Yes, exactly, but his first, his first
               conclusion was that Signor Miles was
               killed not later than seven o'clock
               yesterday evening.

                         RIPLEY
               Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he
               drove off in his car.

                         ROVERINI
               No.

     EXT. NARROW STREET, THE GHETTO, ROME. MORNING.

     Ripley comes through a dark tunnel in the Ghetto on his
     scooter. He drives past a furniture store, DRESSING TABLES
     AND MIRRORS spilling out onto the street. He glances
     sideways, sees his reflection fractured into several images
     and, for an instant, it seems AS IF DICKIE'S THERE
     WATCHING HIM. Ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the
     pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along
     the cobbled passage. The man he thought to be Dickie, an
     Italian, runs up concerned.

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. DAY.

     Ripley emerges from the American Express Office. Across the
     street at the cafe, as once before, sits Marge. Ripley slips
     Dickie's bag into his knapsack as he approaches his scooter.
     Marge spots him and strides across the piazza. She is in no
     mood for pleasantries.

                         MARGE
               Did he kill Freddie?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, when did you get here?

                         MARGE
               Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?

                         RIPLEY
               I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.

                         MARGE
               I tried again, waiting here, watching for
               him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look
               for Dickie I find you.

                   (focusing on Ripley's cuts and
                    bruises)
               What happened to your face?

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie did it.

                         MARGE
                   (suddenly tense)
               Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               My face! There was an argument. I said
               some things I shouldn't have.  About you.
               About the appalling way he's treating
               you, all of us.  And the next thing I
               know he's launched himself at me.
                   (he pulls the scooter off the
                    stand)
               Are you getting on?

                         MARGE
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               Get on. I'll take you to him.

     EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. DAY.

     Ripley and Marge come round the corner on the scooter. The
     entrance to the Palazzo is blocked by a couple of police cars.
     Inspector Roverini emerges from one of them. Ripley,
     startled, drives straight past the entrance.

     EXT. ROME STREET, BY THE RIVER. DAY.

     Ripley pulls up several hundred yards later, in a different
     piazza full of book stalls.  Marge is confused.

                         MARGE
               Where does Dickie live?

                         RIPLEY
               We passed it a few blocks back, where the
               police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They
               don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not
               going to incriminate Dickie -

                         MARGE
               Perhaps I shouldn't go either.

                         RIPLEY
                   (thinking hard, distracted)
               No, well go if you want to, but don't
               talk to the Police about my face - they
               find out he hit me - he's got a temper - he
               could've hit Freddie.
                   (sincerely)
               Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you
               later.

     And he drives off. At the first opportunity HE DOUBLES BACK
     and roars towards the Palazzo.

     EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley drives towards the entrance.  As Ripley gets off and
     pushes his scooter through the doorway SOME JOURNALISTS,
     LOITERING INSIDE A BARBER'S SHOP come running out and swarm
     around him with questions about Freddie. One of them gets off
     a photograph.  It's chaos, a Police Officer shouts him away
     as Ripley puts up a protective hand and runs inside.

     INT. ENTRANCE AND STAIRS, PALAZZO GIOIA. CONTINUOUS.

     As Ripley hurries inside he encounters officers conducting
     more thorough forensic investigations in the stairwell. On a
     landing is Roverini. Ripley hurries towards him.

                         RIPLEY
               Can we go up? Do you mind?

                         ROVERINI
               Of course. What happened to your face?

                         RIPLEY
               My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by
               photographers.

     He hurries up the stairs, Roverini in tow.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
                   (agitated)
               The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm
               feeling hounded - do you think you could
               not give out my address?

                         ROVERINI
               Never. We've had many requests and, of
               course, we say no - even to your fiancÈe.

                         RIPLEY
               I really don't want to see anybody.

                         ROVERINI
               Even your fiancÈe...?

                         RIPLEY
               Even her.

                         ROVERINI
               What about Thomas Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               What about Ripley?

     Ripley's way ahead and has reached the door of his apartment.
     He waits nervously for Roverini. He unlocks the door and can
     barely wait for Roverini to catch up.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.

     Roverini follows Ripley inside, Baggio hurries in behind him.

                         ROVERINI
               You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo,
               is that right?

     Ripley is appalled. He smiles.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That
               was months ago.

                         ROVERINI
               November, I thought.

                         RIPLEY
               Was it? Did you speak to Tom?

                         ROVERINI
               November 7th is my information.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't remember the exact date.

                         ROVERINI
               And when did you last see Signor Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               A few days ago.

                         ROVERINI
               Does he stay with you here?

                         RIPLEY
               No!

                         ROVERINI
               No.  Here is a pattern. Two days ago
               Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves your
               apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a
               little boat is found in San Remo full of
               rocks, and the owner tells the Police it
               was stolen on November 7th. We look at
               hotel records and we see oh! Dickie
               Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then
               our boatman remembers two Americans
               taking a boat.

                         RIPLEY
               It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence.
               There must be fifty hotels in San Remo,
               there must have been a hundred people
               renting a boat on that day.

                         ROVERINI
               31 people.

                         RIPLEY
               31 people.

     Baggio appears. Speaks to Roverini. Ripley is getting cranky.

                         ROVERINI
               That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge
               Sherwood.

                         RIPLEY
                   (appalled, defeated)
               Let her in, what's the difference?  Let
               her in.
                   (Baggio is on his way to the
                    door.)
               No, actually, no, I'd like it very much
               if you would ask her to come back later.

     Roverini nods, mutters to Baggio, who heads out.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Thank you.

                         ROVERINI
                   (watching him)
               May I ask...why would you speak to your
               friend and not your fiancÈe?

                         RIPLEY
               I think I just said. Ripley was handling
               some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley
               want to marry me.  Nor did he ask me
               every day if I would marry him. And when.

                         ROVERINI
               Do you have a photograph of Signor
               Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm not in the habit of carrying around
               photographs of my male friends.

                         ROVERINI
               Now I think I have upset you. My English
               perhaps is coarse.

                         RIPLEY
               It is a little coarse, yes.

                         ROVERINI
               Sorry.  No-one has seen Signor Ripley
               since San -

                         RIPLEY
               I have!

                         ROVERINI
               You have, yes.

                         RIPLEY
               No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask
               her! and if I could remember which hotel
               he was staying at - the Goldoni! - Tom
               was staying at the Goldoni.

                         ROVERINI
               Good. The Goldoni. Yes - you're right. A
               coincidence.
                   (he gets up to leave)
               I look forward to our next meeting when I
               will be more careful with my English and
               persuade you to play me your saxophone.
               Alto.

                         RIPLEY
               Absolutely.

                         ROVERINI
                   (suddenly turning)
               I have a witness who thinks they saw two
               men getting into Mr Miles' car. She
               wants to identify you in a - confronto -
               line-up.
                   (ominously)
               Tomorrow then?

                         RIPLEY
                   (thrown, scrabbling)
               Tomorrow.

     Ripley lets them out, heaves a heavy sigh, then peeps through
     the door, looks down to see Roverini speaking to Marge on the
     stairs.

                         ROVERINI (O/S)
               Buongiorno, Miss Sherwood.  He's in but I
               really don't think he wants to see
               anyone.

     Ripley leans against the door, the noose tightening, then
     suddenly a voice shocks him upright.

                         MARGE
               Dick? Dickie? I know you can hear me.
               What am I doing, chasing you around...?
               I was going to say I would count to three
               and if you didn't open the door, but I
               won't count any more. On you. I won't
               count on you any more. Whatever it is,
               whatever you've done or haven't done,
               you've broken my heart. That's one thing
               I know you're guilty of, and I don't know
               why, I don't know why, I just don't know
               why...

     Ripley listens, there's a silence, then Marge's footsteps as
     they ring out on the stone stairs. The tapping sound resolves
     into the tap-tap of a manual typewriter.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley's at the typewriter, he begins to type.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               My dear Tom, I'm getting out of this.
               Freddie's death, Silvana. I've thought
               about going to the police, but I can't do
               it, I can't face it.  I can't face
               anything anymore...

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     CHAOS.  Ripley is working quickly, selecting clothes,
     dividing them into TWO PILES - one for Dickie's trunk, one
     for his own battered suitcase. He puts the license plates
     from Freddie's car in Dickie's luggage. He has placed one
     shirt on the Ripley pile then checks again, and - on seeing
     Dickie's initials, places it with the bigger pile, then picks
     it up again and holds it briefly against his cheek.

     He takes Dickie's rings, opens up a LITTLE BOX of buttons and
     needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in. Dickie's
     leather writing case goes on the big pile, too, as do cuff
     links, ties, the Mont Blanc, Dickie's passport, which he
     opens to scratch at the photograph, obliterating the face.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               ...I wish I could give you the life I
               took for granted. You've always
               understood what's at the heart of me,
               Tom. Marge never could. I suppose that's
               why I'm writing this to you, the brother
               I never had. The only true friend I ever
               had. In all kinds of ways you're much
               more like the son my father always
               wanted. I realise you can change the
               people, change the scenery, but you can't
               change your own rotten self. Now I can't
               think what to do, or where to go. I'm
               haunted by everything I've done, and
               can't undo. I'm sorry, I can't go on.
               I've made a mess of being Dickie
               Greenleaf haven't I?

     He's finished the letter, signs it, puts it in an envelope
     marked Tom Ripley and places the letter on top of the piano
     next to Dickie's passport. His head is reflected in the
     distorting curve of the lid. As he puts on his glasses
     there's a moment when there are two heads slowly separating,
     as Ripley leaves behind his brief life as Dickie Greenleaf.

     INT. BASEMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley carries Dickie's luggage down into THE COMMUNAL
     BASEMENT of the Gioia, a wretched place full of shadows and
     gloom and the overflow from thirty apartments. A red plush
     couch sits on top of a mound of furniture.  He finds some
     dustsheets and shoves the cases under them. Then Dickie's
     saxophone.

     Outside the small window, Ripley sees uniformed feet and the
     revolving blue light of a Police Car. He shrinks back, turns
     off the light and disappears into the dark, illuminated
     fitfully by the strobe of cold blue.

     EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA, ROME. NIGHT.

     Ripley, familiar battered luggage in tow, appears at the
     entrance of the building next to his own, glances at the
     police car parked opposite the big doors, then hurries off
     into the darkness.

     EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley's briefly silhouetted as he scuttles down an alley,
     hurrying towards a gate, and disappears behind it.

     EXT. PIAZZALE ROMA, VENICE. DAWN.

     Ripley sits next to his battered luggage at the prow of a
     MOTOR TAXI as it surges towards Venice at dawn. Peter Smith-
     Kingsley waits on the quay. Ripley waves. Peter waves back.

                         PETER
                   (indicating the taxi stop)
               I'll see you over there!

     EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. EARLY MORNING.

     Ripley and Peter walk through the square, the pigeons
     scattering. Ripley breathes in the atmosphere, the beautiful
     grey.

                         RIPLEY
               Peter, I'm really sorry to put you
               through this. I just couldn't face going
               to the police by myself when my Italian's
               so rotten.

                         PETER
               Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted
               you finally made it to Venice. I'm
               delighted, contrary to rumour, you're
               still in one piece?

                         RIPLEY
               What rumour?

                         PETER
               That Dickie murdered you and is
               travelling under your passport. I know,
               ridiculous.

     INT. POLICE STATION, VENICE. LATE DAY.

     Later.  Ripley sits in the middle of a bustling Police Station,
     where thefts, tourists, thieves and complaints are being
     processed.  The Station is in an old brewery or armory. It's a
     horrible, monochrome, oppressive place. Peter is in
     conversation at a desk, turns and walks over to where Ripley
     waits.

                         PETER
               Welcome to Venice.  This place reeks,
               doesn't it? Can you smell it?  Ugh.
               Sorry. Not the best way to spend your
               first day.

                         RIPLEY
               It's okay.

                         PETER
               Anyway I've got to the bottom of the
               delay. Finally.  We're waiting for
               someone from Rome.

                         RIPLEY
                   (completely thrown)
               What do you mean?  They're sending
               someone from Rome?

                         PETER
               That's good, isn't it?

                         RIPLEY
                   (as if suffocating)
               No, but I thought that didn't happen in
               Italy, that each region was completely
               separate! I was sure that was the -

                         PETER
               You've seen the papers, you know what a
               big deal it's been here. American tourist
               murdered -

                         RIPLEY
               It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned
               the stench I can hardly breathe.

     A door opens. COLONEL VERRECCHIA, fresh from Rome, and a
     sullen wedge of a man, comes in, scowling at the couple.
     Ripley dare not look up in case it's Roverini.  A POLICEMAN
     introduces him.

                         POLICEMAN
               Colonelo Verrecchia della Polizia di
               Roma.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (to Peter, in Italian)
               Qui e Ripley?  Who is Ripley?

                         PETER
                   (in Italian)
               Lui. Him.

     Verrecchia strides past them and into a smaller, interview
     room at the back of the station.  His manner is ominous.

     INT. POLICE STATION, INTERVIEW ROOM, VENICE. LATE DAY.

     This room is not at all friendly. There is evidence of a
     locked area for cells at one wall.  A small, sour window
     gives onto a canal.  The main station is glimpsed through
     some internal windows. Peter and Ripley come through.

     Verrecchia sits down.  Verrecchia talks in staccato Italian,
     during which Peter translates.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in
               seguito alla negativa valutazione delle
               disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con
               il mio predecessore Roverini che come e
               noto non e riuscito a impedire il
               verificarsi della scomparsa del signor
               Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona
               al momento passibile di incriminazione
               del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               He's taken over the case because...
               they're annoyed the previous chap let
               Dickie...disappear when he was the only,
               he was the only suspect in Freddie's
               murder.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il
               signor Ripley ha visto il signor
               Greenleaf?
               (When was the last time Ripley saw
               Greenleaf?)

     Ripley forgets he's not supposed to have much Italian and
     answers.

                         RIPLEY
               In Rome, about three weeks ago.
                   (shrugs)
               I knew that one.

                         PETER
                   (giving Ripley a look)
               A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               Where have you been since then?

                         RIPLEY
               I've been backpacking.

                         PETER
               I don't know how to translate that.
                   (he tries)
               E difficile....il signor Ripley
               ....dormiva all'aperto, con un...

                         VERRECCHIA
               All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?

                         PETER
               He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping
               outside.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze
               omosessuali?

                         PETER
               Are you a homosexual?
                   (then as himself)
               Interesting non-sequitur.

                         RIPLEY
               No.

                         PETER
                   (translates for him)
               No.
                   (as Peter, drily)
               By the way, officially there are no
               Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo,
               Michelangelo very inconvenient.

                         RIPLEY
               Tell him I have a fiancÈe, Dickie has a
               fiancÈe and Freddie Miles probably had a
               string of them.

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il
               signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e
               probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha
               molte fidanzate.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (laughs)
               Mamma mia, quante fidanzate!

     They all laugh.

                         RIPLEY
               What did he say?

                         PETER
               He says so many fiancÈes.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (suddenly very tough)
               Lei ha ucciso prima Freddie Miles e dopo
               Dickie Greenleaf! Vero?

     As Peter translates Verrecchia watches intently.

                         PETER
               He wants to know if you killed Freddie
               Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?

                         RIPLEY
                   (outraged)
               No I did not. I did not kill Freddie
               Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf.  Is
               he accusing me?
                   (Peter clearly doesn't ask)
               Ask him if he's accusing me!

                         PETER
               He's already angry, I don't think -

                         RIPLEY
                   (interrupting, heated)
               Just because he doesn't like Americans!

                         VERRECCHIA
               Non e questo il luogo per le vostre
               conversazioni private!  (This is not the
               place for your private conversations)

                         PETER
                   (appeasing him)
               A ragione.  A ragione.  (You're right.
               You're right.)

                         VERRECCHIA
               Hmm. C'e questa...  (There's this...)

     Verrecchia hands over a letter. It's opened. Ripley's name on
     the outside. Ripley stares at it.

                         VERRECCHIA
                         (cont'd)
               Questa lettera e stata trovata
               nell'abitazione del signor Richard
               Greenleaf a Roma.

                         PETER
               They found this in Dickie's place in
               Rome.

                         RIPLEY
               You opened this?

                         VERRECCHIA
               Of course!

     He stands and takes the letter out.  Begins to read. He has
     the look of a man whose privacy has been violated.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Peter)
               It's a suicide note.
                   (to Verrecchia)
               You ask me all these questions and you've
               already read this suicide note?

     INT. PETER SMITH-KINGSLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     There's music everywhere - and stands - and posters of
     performances and PHOTOGRAPHS OF PETER CONDUCTING. Peter is an
     opera repetiteur. Ripley is sitting at Peter's piano, playing
     from the score of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater. Peter's made supper.
     He's setting the table.

                         PETER
               Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill
               Freddie, what must that be like? To wake
               up every morning, how can you? Just wake
               up and be a person, drink a coffee...?

                         RIPLEY
               Whatever you do, however terrible,
               however hurtful - it all makes sense,
               doesn't it? inside your head. You never
               meet anybody who thinks they're a bad
               person or that they're cruel.

                         PETER
               But you're still tormented, you must be,
               you've killed somebody...

                         RIPLEY
               Don't you put the past in a room, in the
               cellar, and lock the door and just never
               go in there? Because that's what I do.

                         PETER
               Probably. In my case it's probably a
               whole building.

                         RIPLEY
               Then you meet someone special and all you
               want to do is toss them the key, say open
               up, step inside, but you can't because
               it's dark and there are demons and if
               anybody saw how ugly it was...

     Peter's come over, stands behind him over the piano.

                         PETER
               That's the music talking. Harder to be
               bleak if you're playing Knees up Mother
               Brown.

     He vamps this vaudeville song over Ripley's shoulder.

                         RIPLEY
               I keep wanting to do that - fling open
               the door - let the light in, clean
               everything out. If I could get a huge
               eraser and rub everything out...starting
               with myself...the thing is, Peter, if...

                         PETER
                   (as Ripley falls silent)
               No key, huh?

     INT. SANTA MARIA DELLA PIETA, BRIDGE OF SIGHS. DAY.

     A YOUNG BOY SINGS the soprano part of Vivaldi's STABAT MATER.
     A piercingly pure sound in Vivaldi's own church.  The
     orchestra - rehearsing - is conducted by Peter from the
     organ.

     Ripley slips in at the back of the church. He stands and
     listens. Peter sees him, smiles.  Ripley smiles back.

     EXT. VENICE, S.LUCIA RAILWAY STATION. DAY.

     MARGE appears on the steps, carrying an overnight bag. Ripley
     and Peter have come to meet her.

                         MARGE
                   (kissing him warmly)
               Hello Peter, so good to see you.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Marge!

                         MARGE
                   (coolly)
               Tom.

     They walk towards the Vaporetto.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               So you found Peter...

                         PETER
               I think we sort of found each other.

     Marge smiles enigmatically. Ripley registers.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               Where's Dickie's father?

                         MARGE
               He's not coming till the morning.
               Evidently his stomach - I don't think the
               food here is agreeing with him.

                         RIPLEY
               I was looking forward to seeing him.

                         MARGE
               Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of
               that. There's a private detective on the
               case now - a Mr MacCarron - Dickie's
               father's employing him.

                         RIPLEY
               That's a terrific idea.

                         MARGE
               He's American. He's already discovered
               Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day
               before he disappeared.

     They step onto the Vaporetto.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               Is that what you do before you jump in
               the Tiber?  I don't think so.

     EXT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY.

     The boat arrives at the entrance to the house. Peter opens
     the door as Ripley collects Marge's bags.

                         MARGE
                   (to Peter)
               Is this you?

                         PETER
               No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?

                         MARGE
               Golly. Who's paying for this?

                         RIPLEY
               Peter found it for me. I can afford it
               because it's damp and, and falling down.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY.

     Marge, entering the living room, is astonished at its
     grandeur. She walks around as Ripley heads for the bar.

                         MARGE
               This is spectacular.

                         PETER
               That's why Tom wanted you to stay.  It's
               better than squeezing into my room, and I
               know how you hate hotels.

                         MARGE
               A hotel would've been fine.
                   (to Ripley)
               We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far
               his dollar has stretched.

     Ripley is shaking a martini. Marge laughs, helpless, somehow
     raging. Peter turns

                         PETER
               What's funny?

                         MARGE
               No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when
               Tom arrived in Mongi.
                   (to Ripley)
               And now look at you.

                         RIPLEY
               Look at me what?

                         MARGE
               To the manner born.

     EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. DAY.

     St Mark's Square is buzzing with life - tourists, balloon
     sellers - a man playing saxophone. HERBERT GREENLEAF sits out
     in the colonade on one of the many tables at Florian's Cafe,
     cradling a glass of hot water. He gets up as Marge and Ripley
     arrive.

                         RIPLEY
               Mr Greenleaf.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Tom. How are you?  You look well.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm well, thank you.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Far cry from New York.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes it is.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Marge, good morning.  Unusual weather.

                         MARGE
               Very.

                         RIPLEY
               And you, sir?  Any better?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Pretty good.  Sticking with hot water.

                         MARGE
               Where's Mr MacCarron?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well,
               my boy, it's come to a pretty pass,
               hasn't it?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes.  What's the detective hoping to
               find in San Remo?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               He's being thorough, that's all. I'm
               learning about my son, Tom, now he's
               missing. I'm learning a great deal about
               him. I hope you can fill in some more
               blanks for me. Marge has been good enough
               to do that, about Mongibello.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do
               anything to help Dickie.

     Marge looks at him in contempt.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               This theory, the letter he left for you,
               the Police think that's a clear
               indication he was planning on doing
               something...to himself.

                         MARGE
               I just don't believe that!

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk
               to Tom alone - perhaps this afternoon?
               Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say
               to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to
               another fellow -

                         MARGE
               Such as?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               What a waste of lives and opportunities
               and -

     A saxophonist is blaring away in the piazza. Greenleaf
     suddenly explodes.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (cont'd)
               - I'd pay that fellow a hundred dollars
               right now to shut up!

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.

     Herbert Greenleaf sits on a chair, Ripley pours him some tea.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (reading, plunging into gloom)
               No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.

                         RIPLEY
               I think it might hurt her to know.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               And his passport photo? Did you hear? To
               scratch out your own face like that - can
               you imagine - the frame of mind you'd
               have to be in?
                   (reading)
               I've thought about going to the police
               but I can't face it. I can't face
               anything anymore.

                         RIPLEY
               I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him
               away. I spoke and he heard you.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (such a disappointed father)
               Well, if we all pushed him away what
               about him pushing us away? You've been a
               great friend to my son. Everything is
               someone else's fault. We all want to sow
               wild oars. Somebody's got to - what's the
               word?
                   (Ripley shakes his head)
               The moment someone confronts him he
               lashes out.  He lashes out. You know,
               people always say you can't choose your
               parents, but you can't choose your
               children.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DUSK.

     Ripley wakes up from an awful, chilling nightmare, his head
     full of ghosts. He's cramped up in an armchair, his arms in
     sine foetal protection. HIS DOOR KNOCKER IS BEING REPEATEDLY
     SHAKEN. He surfaces thickly, stumbles to the door. It's Peter
     and Marge.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have
               fallen asleep.

                         PETER
               You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?

                         MARGE
               Did Dickie's Dad go?

                         RIPLEY
               He's having an early night.

                         MARGE
               Poor man.
                   (she heads to her room)
               We were knocking on that door for ever.
                   (she fiddles inside the sleeve
                    of her dress)
               I think I've broken my strap.

                         PETER
               Not guilty.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll fix some drinks.

                         MARGE
               You walk in Venice!

     She takes off her shoe, examining her feet for wear and tear,
     then disappears into the bedroom. Peter walks over to Ripley,
     a little concerned.

                         PETER
               Are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm fine.

                         PETER
                   (a hand on his shoulder)
               Do you want me to stick around?

                         RIPLEY
               It's okay.

                         PETER
               Or I could come back.

     Ripley looks at him. That's never happened. He digs in his
     pocket, finds his key, gives it to Peter. Peter smiles.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               Your key.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BATHROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.

     Ripley's in the bath. Marge knocks on his door.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               Tom?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

     Ripley, irritated, opens the door, his towel wrapped around
     his waist. Marge is white. She's wearing a robe. She's
     slightly breathless.

                         MARGE
               I found Dickie's rings.

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MARGE
               You've got Dickie's rings.

                         RIPLEY
               I can explain.

     He can't. His eyes dart. Marge holds up the evidence.

                         MARGE
               Dickie promised me he would never take
               off this ring.

                         RIPLEY
               Let me put on some clothes and then we
               can talk about this.

                         MARGE
               I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to
               tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr
               Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, calm down, you're being
               hysterical.

                         MARGE
               He promised me. I swear I'll never take
               off this ring until the day -

                         RIPLEY
               Shut up! Shut up!

     His towel slips off from his waist.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               I'm wet, Marge, I've lost my towel, I'd
               really like to put my clothes on. So go
               and pour us both a drink, will you?

     She goes off obediently, a zombie. He shuts the door.
     Immediately he starts looking for something, anything, to
     kill Marge with. He's got a shoe but it feels too light. He
     opens cabinets, drawers - nail scissors, nothing - then
     picks up his straight razor and considers it in the mirror.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SITTING ROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.

     Marge is leaving, coat on, as Ripley comes out of the
     bathroom.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge?  Where are you going?

                         MARGE
                   (like a creature caught in
                    headlights)
               I was looking for a needle and thread. I
               wasn't snooping. I was looking for a
               needle and thread to mend my bra.

                         RIPLEY
               The scent you're wearing. I bought it for
               you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie.
               So many things. The day he was late back
               from Rome - I tried to tell you this - he
               was with another girl. I'm not talking
               about Meredith, another girl we met in a
               bar. He couldn't be faithful for five
               minutes. So when he makes a promise it
               doesn't mean what it means when you make
               a promise. Or I do. He has so many
               realities, Dickie, and he believes them
               all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half
               the time he doesn't even realize.

     A SMALL RED STAIN is appearing on the pocket of his robe. As
     he speaks the stain spreads. He looks at it absently.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Today, for the first time, I've even
               wondered whether he might have killed
               Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody
               contradicted him - well, you know that.
               Marge. I loved you - you might as well
               know - I loved you, and because he knew I
               loved you, he let you think I loved him.
               Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't
               know, maybe it's grotesque to say this
               now, so just write it on a piece of paper
               or something, and keep it in your purse
               for a rainy day. Tom loves me.

                         MARGE
                   (as if she'd heard nothing)
               Why do you have Dickie's rings?

     His hand goes to his pocket. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT.

                         RIPLEY
               I told you. He gave them to me.

                         MARGE
               Why? When?

                         RIPLEY
               I feel as if you haven't heard anything
               I've been saying to you.

                         MARGE
               I don't believe you.

                         RIPLEY
               It's all true.

                         MARGE
               I don't believe a single word you've
               said.

     Marge is shivering. Ripley, ominous, advances, she retreats.

                         RIPLEY
               You're shivering, Marge. Can I hold you?
               Would you let me hold you?

     Marge panics, backed up against the door. She screams and
     turns straight into the arms of a startled PETER who's come
     back to visit Ripley, and is unlocking the door.

                         MARGE
                   (sobbing uncontrollably)
               Oh Peter! Get me out of here.

     Ripley storms off. His hand comes out of his pocket COVERED
     IN BLOOD from the razor. Peter notices, appalled.

                         PETER
               Tom, are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               You try. You try talking to her.

                         PETER
                   (calls after him)
               Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?

                         RIPLEY
                   (not turning around)
               I give up.

     INT. RIPLEY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

     Peter has just put a band-aid over Ripley's cut hand.

                         PETER
               You can't be angry with her.  She's upset
               and needs someone to blame. So she blames
               you.  I'll go home and talk to her.  As
               for you - either get a safety razor or
               grow a beard.

     INT. LOBBY, EUROPA REGINA HOTEL, VENICE. MORNING.

     Ripley hurries through the gleaming marble entrance.

     INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S SUITE, EUROPA REGINA. DAY.

     Ripley knocks on the door. It's opened by a face he doesn't
     recognize. A middle-aged heavy set man. It's MacCARRON, the
     private investigator.

                         RIPLEY
               Is Mr Greenleaf here?

                         MACCARRON
               Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               I don't know, I don't know, I just know
               it.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (O/S)
               Marge, there's female intuition, and
               then there are facts -

     Greenleaf sits with a scrubbed Marge, her hair pulled back,
     as if newly-widowed. THE RINGS SIT GLINTING ON THE COFFEE
     TABLE.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello, sir.
                   (smiles thinly at Marge)
               Marge, you should have waited, didn't
               Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you
               up?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Marge has been telling us about the
               rings.

                         RIPLEY
               You know I feel ridiculous I didn't
               mention them yesterday - I clean forgot -
               ridiculous.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Perhaps you didn't mention them because
               there's only one conclusion to be drawn.

     Ripley worries about what that conclusion is as Mr Greenleaf
     heads into his bedroom.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (cont'd)
               I'm going to take Marge for a little
               walk, Tom.  Mr MacCarron wants to talk
               with you.

                         RIPLEY
                   (feeling caged in)
               We could go down to the bar - no need for
               you to -

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               No, he should talk to you alone.

     He helps Marge to her feet and leads her out. RIPLEY IS
     PARALYSED. He waits for the door to shut. Aimlessly he walks
     out onto the terrace, with its staggering, beautiful and
     indifferent view.

     EXT. EUROPA REGINA, THE GREENLEAF TERRACE. DAY.

     Ripley stands, steels himself for MacCarron's charges.

                         RIPLEY
               I could probably see my bedroom from
               here. I can see my house. When you see
               where you live from a distance it's like
               a dream, isn't it?

                         MACCARRON
                   (coming out)
               I don't care for B.S. I don't care to
               hear it. I don't care to speak it.

                         RIPLEY
               Okay.

                         MACCARRON
               Why do you think Dickie's father sent him
               to Europe in the first place? Did you
               know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-
               killed a boy?

     Ripley turns, shocked.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               At a party. Over some girl. He kicked the
               kid several times in the head. Put him in
               the hospital. The boy had a wire fixed in
               his jaw. The Rome Police didn't think to
               ask Mr Greenleaf.

     MacCarron gets up.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Nor did they think to check whether a
               Thomas Ripley had ever been a student at
               Princeton University. I turned up a Tom
               Ripley who'd been a piano tuner in the
               music department.

     Ripley's head drops.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               See - in America we're taught to check a
               fact before it becomes a fact. We're
               taught to nose around when a girl drowns
               herself, find out if that girl was
               pregnant, find out if Dickie had an
               embarrassment there.

     Ripley doesn't know where this barrage is going.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty.
               He really does. Marge, she's got a
               hundred theories, but there are a few
               things she doesn't know. We hope she
               never knows.

                         RIPLEY
               I hope she never knows.

                         MACCARRON
               Three different people saw Dickie get
               into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't
               identify himself because he was jumping
               someone else's wife at the time saw
               Dickie removing license plates from a red
               sports car. The Police know about this
               man because he happens to be a Policeman.

     He walks out of the room, returns carrying THE LICENSE PLATES
     from Freddie's car.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               I found these in the basement of Dickie's
               apartment. They belonged to Freddie's
               car. Mr Greenleaf has asked me to lose
               them in the canal this evening.

     Ripley can't believe what he's hearing. It's like a dream.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Mr Greenleaf also feels there was a
               silent promise in Dickie's letter to you
               which he intends to honor. He intends to
               transfer a good part of Dickie's income
               from his trust into your name. He doesn't
               intend to give the Italian police any
               information about Dickie's past. He's
               rather hoping you'll feel the same.

     There is a silence in which this strange compact is agreed.

     EXT. EUROPA REGINA MOORING. DAY.

     Ripley stands with Marge, Mr Greenleaf and MacCarron at the
     water's edge - MOTOR LAUNCH growling. They shake hands, and
     then MacCarron and Mr Greenleaf get into the launch. Herbert
     Greenleaf carries the saxophone case.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Marge)
               I feel I never should have said those
               things to you the other evening. I was
               pretty flustered, the rings and - and you
               looked so, I don't know.

     Marge shakes her head to silence him.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               But I hope that note goes to New York in
               your purse, for a rainy day.

                         MARGE
               What are you going to do now, Tom?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. Peter has a concert in
               Athens next month - and he's asked if I
               want to go along, help out. He says
               goodbye by the way - he's in rehearsal,
               otherwise -

                         MARGE
               Why do I think there's never been a
               Ripley rainy day?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MARGE
                   (lunging at him)
               I know it was you - I know it was you,
               Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed
               Dickie. I know it was you.

                         RIPLEY
               Oh Marge.

     He puts his hand out to control her. She pushes it away.
     STARTS TO LASH OUT AT HIM, the frustration too much, so that
     Ripley has to cover his face. MacCarron comes off the boat to
     restrain her.  Ripley looks at him as if to say: what can you
     do, she's hysterical. MacCarron nods, pulls her on to the
     boat. Greenleaf catches Ripley's eye, guiltily. Turns away.
     They stand silhouetted as the launch revs up and surges off
     towards open waters, passing the little fleets of gondolas.

     EXT. FERRY FOR ATHENS, NAPLES. DAY.

     A week later and Peter and Ripley are on the deck of the
     ferry, the HELLENES, as it sails towards Greece.  They're
     laughing.

                         RIPLEY
               Ask me what I want to change about this
               moment.

                         PETER
               What do you want to change about this
               moment?

                         RIPLEY
               Nothing.

     INT. PETER'S CABIN. DUSK.

     Peter's in a bathrobe organising his currency, his
     traveller's cheques. Ripley knocks on the door, comes in.

                         PETER
               Hello.  What are you up to?

                         RIPLEY
               All kinds of things. Making plans.

                         PETER
               Plans - good, plans for tonight or plans
               for the future?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. Both. My plan right now is
               to go up on deck, look at the sunset.
               Come with me.

                         PETER
               You go. I don't want to get dressed yet.
               Come back though.  Come back.
                   (smiles at him)
               You know, you look so relaxed, like a
               completely different person.

                         RIPLEY
               Well, that's entirely your fault.  And,
               if I fall overboard, that'll be your
               fault too.

     EXT. DECK OF THE HELLENES. SUNSET.

     Ripley stands on deck, staring at the magnificent sunset.
     Then a voice shakes him from his reverie.

                         MEREDITH
               Dickie?  Dickie?

     He turns. He's caught. Suddenly he's Dickie.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               Dickie, my God!

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Meredith.

                         MEREDITH
               I was looking at you, your clothes, I
               wouldn't have known you...

                         RIPLEY
               Well, you've spotted me and so you get
               the reward.

                         MEREDITH
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               Just kidding. Are you alone?

                         MEREDITH
               Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.

     Meredith points to the UPPER DECK BALCONY where TWO OLDER
     COUPLES are walking around the deck.

                         RIPLEY
               Of course.  Aunt Joan.

                         MEREDITH
               And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've
               thought about you so much.

                         RIPLEY
               I've thought about you.

     And now he's thinking I can't kill them all...

                         MEREDITH
               When I thought about you I was mostly
               hating you. Where've you been hiding?

                         RIPLEY
               I haven't been hiding. I've been in
               Police custody. They've been trying to
               flush out Freddie's killer.

                         MEREDITH
               You're kidding.

                         RIPLEY
               They're letting me have this vacation.
               Which is why the get-up. Which is why you
               haven't heard from me.

                         MEREDITH
               You know, the whole world thinks you
               killed Freddie? It's terrible.

                         RIPLEY
               I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later.
               Later?

     He kisses her.  Full of future.

                         MEREDITH
               So - are you travelling under R?

                         RIPLEY
               You know what - I am.

                         MEREDITH
               Dickie, are you with Peter Smith-
               Kingsley?  I bet you are. My aunt thought
               she saw him.

                         RIPLEY
                   (horrified)
               Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him
               in months.  No, I'm alone.
                   (and he understands this is not
                    any kind of lie)

     INT. PETER'S CABIN. NIGHT.

     Peter's working on his score, lying on his front, apparently
     engrossed. Ripley knocks and enters. Looks long at Peter.

                         PETER
               How was it?

                         RIPLEY
               Good. But I think we should stay in here
               for the rest of the trip.

                         PETER
               Was that Meredith?

                         RIPLEY
                   (sighs)
               Was who Meredith?

                         PETER
               Meredith Logue. You were kissing
               somebody. Looked like Meredith.

                         RIPLEY
               Hardly kissing. Kissing off.

                         PETER
               Didn't look that way - you know - from a
               distance.

                         RIPLEY
               I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen
               you.

                         PETER
               Why lie?

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie and Peter, that's just too good
               gossip, isn't it?

                         PETER
               Or Tom and Peter even.

                         RIPLEY
               Well that would be even better gossip.

                         PETER
               Really, why?
                   (completely lost)
               Sorry, I'm completely lost.

                         RIPLEY
               I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be
               stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's
               my, that's my - terrible and alone and
               dark - and I've lied about who I am, and
               where I am, and so nobody can ever find
               me.

                         PETER
               What do you mean lied about who you are?

                         RIPLEY
               I suppose I always thought - better to be
               a fake somebody than a real nobody.

                         PETER
               What are you talking about - you're not a
               nobody! That's the last thing you are.

                         RIPLEY
               Peter, I... I...

                         PETER
                   (conciliatory)
               And don't forget. I have the key.

                         RIPLEY
               You have the key. Tell me some good
               things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up.
               Just tell me some nice things.

     He sits on the bed, leans against Peter. His eyes are
     brimming with tears.  He takes the cord from Peter's robe and
     begins twisting it in his hands.

                         PETER
               Good things about Tom Ripley?  Could take
               some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is
               tender... Tom is beautiful...

                         RIPLEY
                   (during this, and tender)
               You're such a liar...

                         PETER
               ...Tom is a mystery...

     Ripley is pressing against him, moving up his body, kisses
     his shoulder, the cord wrapped tight in his hands...

     INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. NIGHT.

     Ripley returns to his cabin. Sits on the bed, desolate.

                         PETER (O/S)
                   (cont'd)
               ...Tom is not a nobody. Tom has secrets
               he doesn't want to tell me, and I wish he
               would. Tom has nightmares. That's not a
               good thing. Tom has someone to love him.
               That is a good thing!
                   (feeling Ripley's weight on
                    him)
               Tom is crushing me. Tom is crushing me.
                   (suddenly alarmed)
               Tom, you're crushing me!

     The door of his closet flips open with the swell and he
     catches his reflection. It swings shut. Open then shut.
     Through the porthole the weather's changing as the light
     dies. There's a swell as the horizon rises and falls in the
     round glass. Ripley, alone, in a nightmare of his own making.

     THE END.






     Lullaby for Cain

     From the silence
     from the night
     comes a distant lullabye

     Cry, remembering that first cry
     Your brother standing by
     and loved
     both loved
     beloved sons of mine
     sing a lullabye
     mother is close by
     innocent eyes
     such innocent eyes

     Envy stole your brother's life
     came home murdered peace of mind
     left you nightmares on the pillow
     sleep now

     Soul, surrendering your soul
     the heart of you not whole
     for love
     but love
     what toll

     Cast into the dark
     branded with the mark
     of shame
     of Cain

     From the garden of God's light
     to a wilderness of light
     sleep now

     sleep now.

                                                      13 FEBRUARY 1998
                         

                         
          "I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
          That would save you dear lady from going insane"

          BLACK

          MUSIC UP: Slow, sad, ethereal.
          Perhaps even eerie.

          FADE IN:

          On a sea of red, filling the frame. A crimson ocean without
          waves or ripples.

          A thick housepainter's BRUSH dips in, revealing its paint.
          The BRUSH is extracted, paint dripping like congealing blood.
          FOLLOW THE BRUSH to reveal...

          INT. A HOUSE - NIGHT

          A white wall, where the BRUSH is moved horizontally, leaving
          a thick continuous stripe, until the paint thins out.
          A WOMAN'S HAND plunges the BRUSH back into the paint can,
          then takes up creating the stripe again, painting the wall:
          until it reaches &pleated drape --
          -- and doesn't stop. A window and another drape receive the
          same treatment before the BRUSH is re-dipped.

          A PUPPY,
          a sad-eyed basset hound, sits on the floor watching, a bit
          perplexed. This is WALTER and even he knows this is weird.
          The dog looks over to...

          A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
          standing next to him, also watching. This is RACHEL. Dark
          haired, in a plain dress. Her large eyes are welling on the
          verge of tears.

          The BRUSH is dragged across the wall, hits a wooden picture
          frame, moves across a cheap oil painting of a pastoral,
          forest scene, and over the other edge of the frame.

          Another ANGLE takes in the red line, five feet high, parallel
          to the floor, extending around a modest living room.

          Painting the line is BARBARA LANG, in her thirties, yet worn,
          haggard- She hasn't slept in a while.

          The precision of her work, her concentration, her focus, as
          the line runs across a wall and into a corner, is more than a
          little frightening.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RACHEL

                         Mommy

          BARBARA hears nothing, says nothing, just wipes a paint drip.
          This is a very careful line.

                         RACHEL
          Momma, come play with me. In my room.
          But her mother keeps painting across a door.

                         RACHEL
          Right now, mommy, okay?
          BARBARA looks at her, or rather through her. And continues
          her task. RACHEL steps forward, tugs on her mom's

                         RACHEL
          I got a idea, we could--
          -- and gets , , splat, right-in the face with the brush

                         THE KITCHEN
           A TOY AMBULANCE sits on the floor. RACHEL's tiny hand
           deliberately presses a button on it. The TOY responds with a
          wheep whe ep siren, then:

                         AMBULANCE VOICE

                         (CANNED; TINNY)
          If you need help, dial nine one one.
          If you need help, dial nine one one.

          A WALL-MOUNTED PHONE
          RACHEL's HAND struggles to reach the buttons to dial 9-1-1.
          BARBARA's still painting the wall in the background.

          RACHEL (O.S.)
          Hello? It's my mom. She's doing
          some... some wrong things. She's
          doing wrong things, so, and, you
          should come.

          EXT. THE STREET - FROM ABOVE - NIGHT

          A light rain falls on an AMBULANCE sitting next to a POLICE
          Its dashing red lights
          CRUISER with its doors flung open.
          splash over the umbrella carrying NEIGHBORS, in pajamas and
          robes, watching...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          TWO E.M.S. WORKERS drag a struggling BARBARA across a lawn,
          her hands in plastic restraining cuffs.
          A wet RACHEL stands by a kneeling POLICE OFFICER holding a
          poncho over her head.

                         POLICEMAN
          Rachel? Rachel, are you okay?
          She keeps staring off, watching her mother being stuffed into
          the ambulance.

                         RACHEL
          Momma!
          She starts towards her, but the OFFICER holds her back.

                         POLICEMAN
          Honey, she just has to go somewhere,
          to get some rest, so she'll feel
          better.
          As the AMBULANCE pulls away, RACHEL catches a glimpse of her
          mother in the rear windows, watching her.

                         POLICEMAN
          is your dad around? When's he get
          home from work?
          I don't have a dad.
          The POLICEMAN collects himself.

                         POLICEMAN
          Okay. Then we're going to take you
          someplace nice, with a family, a
          really nice family, till we get all
          this sorted out.

                         (QUIETLY)
          No.

                         POLICMIAN

                         WE'LL JUS

                         RACHEL
          She breaks free, races into.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          INT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Where she runs down the entrance hall. Behind her, outside,
          as the POLICEMAN runs toward the front door, it --
          SLAMS by itself, right in his face.
          FOLLOW RACHEL as she rushes through the living room and down
          a hall. Another door slams shut behind her.

                         HER ROOM
          She spins, frightened by the door that closed behind her. To
          her left...
          A WINDOW crashes shut, startling her. Then, like a wave
          moving in a circle around her, another WINDOW bangs down, a
          DOOR slams shut, another WINDOW. Scared, RACHEL backs into

                         A CLOSET
          where she finds WALTER huddling and cradles him in her arms.
          The CLOSET DOOR swings shut, sealing her off from the world.

                         FROM ABOVE
          In the dark, RACHEL is in a fetal position on the floor, dry
          eyed, in shock, curled around her puppy.
          There's the far-off sound of POUNDING on a door.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          NT. A DARKENED BEDROOM - DAWN
          RACHEL, now 17, is curled in bed around WALTER, also now a
          far more senior dog. She's enmeshed in tangled white
          Small TATTOOS come into view -- A delicate angel with broken
          wings on her ankle. A small EGYPTIAN ANKH is etched on her
          shoulder blade.
          Wrapped around her upper arm is an elegant THORN BAND
          encircling a HEART, either protecting or imprisoning it.
          There's a knock on her bedroom door.

          WOMAN (O.S.)
          Rachel. c et up. You're gonna be late
          again.
          She rolls over, blinks awake. She's beautiful, with sensual
          lips framed by raven black hair.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RACHEL
          joy.

                         CUT TO
          BLACK. A SUPER burns in:

           M. O N D A Y

                          FADE INTO:

          A PAN AROUND RACHEL'S ROOM
          the usual teenage mess, clothes strewn everywhere. A POSTER
          of Jim Morrison reads: "No One Here Gets Out Alive."
          RACHEL stands before her dresser mirror, in a ratty bathrobe,
          putting on a small nose stud. She dons her daily armor --
          -- Slipping on multiple earrings.
          -- Applying Kohl around her eyes.
          -- Shrugging on a T-shirt with a photo of Sharon Tate
          captioned "Manson Sucks".
          -- Disheveling her long black hair.
          Scooping up WALTER, she kisses him, takes him to an open
          ground floor window.
          Sorry, Walt.
          And gently lowers him outside.

          EXT. A HOUSE - MORNING

          It's not the home RACHEL lived in with BARBARA. This one is
          run down and in the section of town where people have cars in
          their yards they've abandoned tinkering with. The lawn is
          overgrown, there's broken glass on the street.

          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

          The crammed eat-in-kitchen of the WALLACE house. EMILYN,
          40's, is ironing a waitress uniform on the counter. A groggy
          BOYD, 40's, enters, he's a trucker and looks like one. He
          goes straight for the refrigerator.
          BOYD and his wife EMILYN have taken in RACHEL as a foster kid
          to augment their income.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
           RACHEL is alone at a formica table, eating cereal. BOYD
          looks at his ..rife.

                         BOYD

                         (YAWNS)
          Working tonight?

                         EMILYN
          Graveyard shift, again.

                         (TO RACHEL)
          Was the dog in the house last night?
          He's allowed in the morning.

                         BOYD
          (head in refrigerator)
          Daytime, yes; nighttime, no. We've
          been over this ground.
          I only brought him in this morning.
          No juice?

                         EMILYN
          We're out of a lot of things.

                         (TO RACHEL)
          I heard dog noises last night.
          When I was trying to sleep.

                         (LOUDER)
          Walter was not in the house last
          night.

                         BOYD
          (shoots Rachel a look)
          You watch that voice in this house.
          While you're here, you'll respect her
          as your mother, and treat her as such.

                         RACHEL
          (lowers her eyes, mumbles)
          Sorry.
          She picks through her cold cereal in silence.

                         EMILYN
          Your mom's making progress isn't she,
          on the new medicacions, the
          tricyclics?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         RACHEL
          Yes, ma'am.

                         (BEAT)
          May I be excused?
          Without waiting for a reply, she stands and gathers the bowl.
          (casually, a routine)
          And you should take that thing outta
          your nose. Don't you have enough
          holes in your head?
          As she turns away, RACHEL makes a face, but replies.

                         RACHEL
          Yes, sir.

          EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

          RACHEL stands outside, clad in a long dark overcoat, with a
          black backpack. WALTER sits next to her, behind a fence.
          A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up.

                         RACHEL
          Later, Walt.
          On WALTER, bummed.

          WITHIN THE SCHOOL BUS
          A gaggle of young KIDS in faded denims and pastels. RACHEL
          moves to the back, sits with LISA PARKER, who could be her
          younger sister, also dressed Goth, black lace and metal.
          LISA has a HEART-THORN TATTOO around her arm, like RACHEL's.

                         LISA

                         (SMILES)
          Well, hullo.

                         RACHEL
          She speaks. She opens her mouth
          and sounds come out. The sounds
          are words.
          LTA gives her a Cheshire cat grin.

                         LISA
          What's wrong, fcscer-dad bein' a
          pain again?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         RACHEL
          Why are you so weiz.ly happy?

                         LISA
          o I look any different?

                         RACHEL
          Do you look any...

                         (GETTING IT)
          Oh, my gawd. You did it.

                         LISA
          Yep.
          With who?

                         LISA
          You'd never believe me if I told you.
          I'm bringing him to lunch.

                         RACHEL
          C'mon. ' 1 Fess up.

                         LISA
          All will be revealed in due time.
          RACHEL pulls out a worn Anne Rice paperback from her ba
          gives it to LISA.

                         RACHEL
          You suck.

                         LISA
          I love you too.
          Simultaneously, they bite their thumbs, then press them
          together; a pantomime of blood sisters.

                         LISA / RACHEL
          Best Blood. / Best Blood.
          ARNIE, a skinny, pimply stoner, plops into the seat behind
          them, sticks his head on their seatback, smiles full braces.

                         ARNIE
          Hi there gruesome twosome, how 'bout
          a threesome?

                         LISA
          (ignoring him, to Rachel)
          Lunch. Meet me in the parking lot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

          EXT. BERGEN HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

          A modern, windowless school, shrouded in mist. It's
          beautiful in an eerie "Fall of the House of Usher" way.

          E SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MORNING
          Hung over the concrete entrance is a large bedsheet BANNER
          with oversized red lettering:

          CRUSH CARLIN FRIDAY!
          The school mascot, a scrappy BULLDOG wearing a CROWN tilted
          at a rakish angle, is also drawn on the banner.
          FADE IN -- KNOTS of STUDENTS, like spectral figures.
          The two major school cliques are...
          on the front steps. Land of burnouts, step-kids, Metalheat s
          skateboard junkiei-and other lost souls.
          A STONER KID kicks his skateboard up and catches it. HIS
          BUDDY follows suit and misses, suffering the embarrassment of
          watching his board shoot down the steps whose metal rail
          separates Freak Hall and..,

                         THE PATIO
          a courtyard with concrete tables where the school's royalty
          hold court. The cleancut "Patio People" are the jocks,
          student government types and others who have no idea what it
          is to be alone on a Saturday night.
          At the patio is a pack of muscular jocks in football letter
          jackets reading "Bulldogs", some sport caps marked "Dawgs:
          There's JESSE RYAN, handsome, longish hair, a young Eddie
          Vedor if Eddie ever played football. Next to him is...
          MARK BING, good looking, with a body like a fist.
          Behind them, arrayed around a concrete table are the large,
          doltish BRAD, hearty rich boy CHUCK, and the arrogant ERIC.
          CHUCKS looks over a plain looking GIRL on the Patio.

                         CHUCK
          (aside, low)
          Hey, Mark, the girl over there,
          how many if I do her?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.
          Six.

                         BRAD

                         (MIFFED)
          Hold it. I did her last week,
          I only got five.

                         MARK
          She was having a bad hairday.
          A group of PATIO GIRLS sit at another table. Among them is
          MONICA, a stunning brunette, AMY a cute redhead and TRACY, an
          icy BLONDE who could spend all day checking her makeup.
          JESSE looks over. TRACY graces him with a smile and turns
          away. MARK leans in to JESSE.

                         MARK
          Hey, Jess. Tracy, she wants you, man.
          Jump her bones.

                         I JESSE
          Yeah, whatever.

                         CHUCK
          What's the matter with you, she's got
          an ass stamped "Made in Heaven

                         JESSE
          I don't know, you ever have a
          conversation with her? It's like
          talking down a well. She only wants
          me cause I'm on the football team.

                         MARK
          So what? You want her to want you
          cause of your dazzling personality?
          Look, you want someone to talk to,
          you got us. H, you screw.

          THE SCHOOL BUS
          RACHEL and LISA hop off and walk past the Patio. CHUCK
          watches LISA pass.

                         CHUCK

                         (ASIDE)
          Woof- Coyote date.

                         JESSE
          That's harsh, man, keep it down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         11

                         ERIC
          What's a coyote date?

                         MARK
          When you wake up in the morning, and
          she's sleeping on your arm, and the
          only way to get up is to wake her.
          So you gnaw your arm off instead.
          BRAD snorts a laugh.
          A goatee'd ENGLISH TEACHER nods to both camps as he passes.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Hello Montagues, hello Capulets.
          A BELL goes off and the STUDENTS start filing into school.
          LISA waves the tips of her fingers to RACHEL, bye-bye.
          RACHEL looks over, catches a glimpse of JESSE, across the
          line of demarcation. For a piece of a second it seems as if
          he's looking back. She drops her head, walks away.

          INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

          The ENGLISH TEACHER strolls among the student's desk. RACHEL
          is in social Siberia, sitting in the back.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Okay, then how many saw the movie?
          A show of hands, all the girls, some of the boys.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Now, how many read the play?

                         AS ASSIGN
          A few tentative hands, including JESSE.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          I thank you for your honesty, but I am
          saddened. I'd like to think we're
          here to study William Shakespeare, not
          worship at the altar of Leo DiCaprio.
          Scattered laughs.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          I was going to calk about the
          language. But since you haven't Z&&d
          the language, let's talk about the
          plot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          Sighs of relief

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Romeo and Juliet, a tale of two lovers
          meant for each other, pulled apart by
          their families, society, and, some
          might say, by fate.

                         (BEAT)
          Why is it that we are so moved by love
          stories that end with separation?
          The STUDENT' s faces are blank.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          What are some other stories with this
          theme?

                         (NO RESPONSES)
          How about, Dr. Zhivago? Casablanca?
          Still blank. AMY timidly raises her hand.

                         AMY
          You meair like in Dumb and
          when the girl's husband showed up?
          The TEACHER surrenders to the inevitable.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Okay, well. Perhaps at some level
          we know that Lauren Holly's husband
          AIM to show up? What say? Anyone?

                         (BEAT)
          Rachel?
          I don't know that I believe in it.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Believe in what?

                         RACHEL
          Love.
          JESSE looks at her, pensive.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER

                         (SYMPATHETIC)
          Well, then you've got bigger problems
          than passing this crass.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         ARNIE
          (raises his hand)
          Love is fifteen seconds of squishing
          noises. Unquote. Johnny Rotten.
          Scattered laughs. JESSE overhears TRACY as she nods at
          RACHEL, whispers to AMY...

                         TRACY
          Who would love her?

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Do you think that all love stories are
          tragedies? I mean, unless they die at
          the same time, all lovers are
          eventually separated by death.

                         JESSE
          Well, then Romeo and Juliet isn't a
          tragedy, because the only way they
          could really be together was in death.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Very good.
          (nods at Rachel)
          A foul cynic, most cliche.
          (turns to Jesse)
          A true romantic, how refreshing.
          Kids scoff at JESSE, but RACHEL eyes JESSE, struck by this
          side of him.
          The BELL rings and ARNIE leads the exodus.

                         ARNIE
          Food!

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Next assignment, Brave New World, the
          book, not the TV movie.

          INT, HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
          A stone-faced LISA folds a NOTE, places it within her hallway
          locker, jammed to the brim with books; a photo of Fiona Apple
          and a Nine Inch Nails sticker are plastered on its door.

          EXT. ICE SCHOOL. THE REAR PARKING LOT - LUNCHTIME

          STUDENTS pour out the doors, some heading to a row of outside
          lockers. RACHEL appears, searching for LISA.

                         BACK TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

          THE SCHOOL HALLWAY
          LISA walks as if moving through extremely dense air, hugging
          the wall as STUDENTS pass without acknowledging her.

                         HACK TO:

          THE PARKING LOT
          RACHEL looks around the students, sees a GIRL's HEAD from
          behind, realizes it isn't LISA.

                         BACK TO:

                         A STAIRWELL
          LISA ascends several flights, still brushing the wall,
          exiting onto the...

                         SCHOOL'S ROOF
          She walks past a TRIO OF STUDENTS smoking near the roof's
          edge. Without slowing or blinking an eyelash LISA simply..

          DROPS OUT OF FRAME.
          A GIRL turns in the direction of LISA's disappearance.

                         SMOKING GIRL
          Did you see that?

          SHOCK CUT TO:

          WITHIN A PARKED CAR
          LISA'S FACE smashes into the windshield which cracks in a
          spider web pattern. Blood fills the web. The sound of a
          droplet hitting car vinyl, then drops SPLATTER RED on our

          P.Q.V.

          EXT. THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

          Standing in the lot is RACHEL. She stares in horror at --
          LISA sprawled on the dented hood of a parked car, her head a
          bloody mass nestled in the shattered windshield.
          -- and RACHEL opens her mouth, but the SCREAM BOTTLED inside
          catches in her throat, which causes --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

          A ROW OF OUTDOOR LOCKERS
          to "ULQ open, behind her, like dominoes, banging in a wave
          away from her, startling KIDS near them.

          INT. SCHOOL - DAY

          BANG as a door marked "GUIDANCE COUNSELOR" swings open and..
          SUE SNELL whips around in her seat, late 30's, but with the
          eyes of someone who's been to hell and back. A YOUNG GIRL is
          seated before her for counseling.
          in her doorway is the SCHOOL PRINCIPAL, chaos in the hall
          behind him.

                         PRINCIPAL
          You'd better come with me, a girl just
          killed herself in the lot.

          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY.

          More chaos. KIDS'rush in to see, others move away.
          Next to the car with LISA's body is RACHEL. Slowly,
          tentatively, without knowing what she's doing, RACHEL runs
          her hand along the car's hood, coating her thumb with blood.

                         RACHEL

                         (TO HERSELF)
          Best blood.
          SUE pushes her way through the crowd, sees a stunned RACHEL,
          puts an arm around her shoulder.

                         SUE
          Corns. Come with me. Let's back off.
          One step. Good. Let's back away.
          PULL BACK to see the widening circles of shock as the
          students of Bergen High realize what's just occurred.

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

          A SNOW DOME with a forest scene. RACHEL is in a chair, her
          face an ashen mask, staring at the dome on the desk. SUE
          offers a glass of water, RACHEL doesn't take it. SUE leans
          on the desk's edge.

                         SUE
          (low, intimace)
          Was she a friend? This is a place
          where you can calk about it.

                         (MORE)

                         SUE (CONC'D)

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          Or not. But if you need to, I'm
          always here.
          SUE takes RACHEL's hand. RACHEL looks up at her, eyes
          welling. Bur she doesn't cry.

                         SUE
          It's okay. Let it out.

                         RACHEL
          (shakes her head)
          I never cry. Miss Snell? She was so
          happy this morning. I don't
          understand. Why would she--
          The INTERCOM BOX squawks:

          WOMAN (V.0.)
          Ms. Snell, would you please come to
          the principal's office? Ms. Snell,
          please come to the principal's office.

                         - SUE
          You stay here as long as you need to.
          RACHEL nods. SUE moves to the door and exits.
          Leaving RACHEL alone, looking all of five years old.

          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

          A medium-sized office, standing room only. The PRINCIPAL
          addresses SUE and his STAFF as he hands out sheets of paper.

                         PRINCIPAL
          The board of education has given us
          these procedures to follow. I want
          every teacher to read this aloud in
          their classrooms in ten minutes.
          Do not digress or become overly
          emotional or dramatic.
          His VOICE under...

          EXT. THE SCHOOL ENTRANCE - DAY

          A door BANGS open as RACHEL runs out and down the steps.

          PRINCIPAL (V_O.)
          Then I'll ask you to identify any
          students who may have been Lisa
          Parker's close friends and therefore
          may require additional counseling.

          ERIC surreptitiously passes MARK something under a desk, a
          large pocket NOTEBOOK.
          A GIRL picks her nose. A 3CY yawns. Another BOY absently
          fiddles with his crucifix as he reads a comic book.

          RACHEL sits on rock in a clearing, observing her own moment
          of silence.

          LISA's BLOOD.

          The dilapidated room is a statue garden of catatonics and

          T.V. PATIENTS shuffle past like motorized corpses.
          BARBARA LANG, now in her 40's, sits on a couch with a
          transformed RACHEL. BARBARA is lucid and beaming at her.

                         BARBARA
          Yes, baby, I really am feeling so much
          better. I feel so good on the inside,
          I must be glowing on the outside.

                         RACHEL
          You look great, mama.

                         BARBARA
          Lord, you come all the way out here,
          we can't keep talking about me. How
          are you? I wane to hear every little
          thing I'm missing.

          RACHEL takes a deep breath, working extra hard to seem happy
          and well adjusted today.

                         RACHEL
          Things are really great. Last night
          I, um, I had this slumber party, with
          some girlfriends. And this morning,
          Mrs. Wallace made us all pancakes
          before school.

                         BARBARA
          The Wallaces sure are a nice family.

                         RACHEL
          (her smile falters)
          Oh, they are. A nice family.

                         BARBARA
          What's wrong?

                         RACHEL
          Nothing, I just... I miss those crepes
          you used to make me.

                         BARBARA
          Oh, honey, those.crepes weren't
          nothing but watered down pancakes.
          (holds out her arms)
          Come here baby.
          She gives her daughter a big hug.

                         BARBARA
          Now you listen to me, the doctors say
          I'm doing well. You know what that
          means? That means someday, soon, you
          and I are gonna be eating crepes for
          breakfast, lunch and dinner.
          For the first time, RACHEL's smile is genuine.

                         RACHEL
          That would be so great.

                         BARBARA
          (holds her at arm's length)
          Oh, I look at you, remembering what
          you were like at five, at ten...
          (decides not to go down a sad path)
          All I need is a little Loving Care for
          these grey hairs and we'll make up for
          all the time we've lost.

          wake up, she was just a pump, a nut.

          And she freaked and took a header.

          Catholic schools frown on that shit.

          No one knows 'bout you and her.

          Lisa took a picture of me with. her.

                         MARK

                         MARK
          Eric, relax, its me, Mark. I'll
          handle it.
          The WAITER sets a pitcher of soda and cups on the table.
          AT THE BAR -- MR. STARK, a rotund lawyer in his 40's, takes a
          pitcher of beer from the BARTENDER.

          I don't see nuthin'.
          STARK strolls to the booth with the pitcher in hand. He
          sits, hiding the pitcher below table level.

                         STARK
          Hello, boys.

                         ERIC
          Hi, dad.
          STARK winks, takes MARK's empty cup and fills it with beer
          below the table.

          Great game last week. All of us on
          the town council are awful proud.
          He hands MARK the cup under the table and takes JESSE's cup.
          The PLAYERS smile at each other.

                         STARK
          So, the Bulldogs bringing home the

          with a pair of boltcutters held by SHERIFF KELTON, 30"s, a
          former Bulldog himself. The PRINCIPAL and SUE stand nearby.
          Opening the locker, KELTON finds LISA's NOTE. As he pulls it
          out, something falls from the note.

          RACHEL's at her job, an island in the middle of a parking
          lot. She wears her Walkman, listening to music. Across the
          street is a 7-11 type store.

          INT. MINIMART - DAY

          INT. ROYAL PHOTOMAT - DAY

          Photos glide out of the developing machine. RACHEL pulls the
          pictures out, stops dead when she sees they're shots of LISA;
          With RACHEL, laughing. LISA with Rachel's dog.
          RACHEL's finger tenderly slides along LISA's face.
          She's shocked to find a picture of --
          LISA AND ERIC -- his arm draped around her in the backseat of
          a car. LISA's holding the camera at arm's length.
          JESSE's CAR pulls up outside. MARK sits beside him.

                         RACHEL

                         (STARTLED)
          Oh!
          She peels off her headphones.

                         JESSE
          Sorry, didn't scare you, did I?
          RACHEL turns, slides LISA's PICTURES into an envelope. MARK
          checks her out, likes what.he sees, nudges JESSE.

                         JESSE
          You're... Rachel, right?
          She nods, surprised he knows she's alive, much less knows her
          name.

                         JESSE
          I'm Jesse.

                         RACHEL
          Uh-huh. The true romantic.
          MARK leans over JESSE, his voice low now, intimate.

                         MARK
          So, Rachel, there were some pictures
          Lisa took. They have, what you might
          call sentimental value.
          She just stares at him. MARK pulls a twenty from his wallet.

                         MARK
          Twenty bucks cover it?

                         RACHEL
          No.

                         MARK
          What do you mean? I'll go thirty.

                         RACHEL
          They're not your pictures.

                         MARK
          Well it's not like she's gonna be
          picking them up, is it?
          RACHEL turns away. JESSE glares at MARK.

                         JESSE
          Hey, cool. it.

                         MARK
          (tries a different tack)
          Rachel, why don't I come by when you get
          off and, you know, take you for a ride?
          JESSE cocks an ear for her reply, but she doesn't answer.

                         T MARK
          C'mon, I don't bite... not unless you
          want me to.

                         RACHEL
          I don't think so.

                         MARK
          Why not?

                         RACHEL

                         (TURNS)
          Cause I'm a dyke.
          JESSE laughs. MARK doesn't. He knows she's putting him on
          and bores holes into her.

                         MARK
          Let's go, Jess.
          The car pulls away, MARK glances in the REARVIEW MIRROR at
          RACHEL, framed like a target.

                         MARK
          (low to himself)
          Bitch. I'll show you funny.
          ON RACHEL -- watching them go.
          Seconds later, a SHERIFF'S CRUISER pulls up.

                         KELTON
          Hi.
          He holds out Lisa's PHOTO STUB. RACHEL takes it, sees the
          name, her eyes widen.

          EXT. A HILL - NIGHT

          A star-filled sky hangs above the town's makeout spot, a hill
          overlooking Bergen. MARK and CHUCK stand outside a car
          sipping beers. JESSE's CAR, a blue G.T.Â©, is several yards
          away, with foggy windows.

          WITHIN JESSE'S CAR
          The backseat. JESSE's on top of TRACY. He pulls away from
          her. She pulls her top down, sits up.

                         JESSE
          I'm sorry, it's not you. its me.

                         TRACY
          It's okay. You should save your
          energy for the game anyway.
          JESSE opens the door, stands outside, tucking in his shirt.
          MARK and CHUCK make a crude humping gesture to JESSE. He
          hesitates, then nods at them.
          MARK pulls out the SCOREBOARD and enters JESSE's name with
          TRACY's and the number 10.

                         MARK
          He shoots, he scores.
          ON TRACY -- in the front seat, using the rearview to adjust
          her makeup, pleased with what she sees. She glances at JESSE
          as he re-enters on the driver's side.

                         TRACY
          What are you thinking about?

                         JESSE
          Nobody.

                         TRACY
          I asked what, not who.

                         JESSE
          Oh. Nothing.

                         (PAUSE)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         JESSE (CONT'D)
          Doesn't it bother you that a girl
          offed herself today?

                         TRACY
          Why? She wasn't anybody.

                         JESSE
          What?

                         TRACY
          I mean, I didn't know her.

                         (SMILES)
          You know, I still don't have a date to
          Mark's party Friday. Hint, hint.
          She leans over and nibbles on JESSE's ear. He pulls away,
          forces a smile and turns the ignition.

          INT. RACHEL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          SMASH as a dish drops onto the floor. RACHEL is at the sink,
          doing dishes. She crouches to retrieve the broken plate.
          WE PAN along the chorus line of dishes, glasses, and
          silverware on the counter as the metronome of the sink
          faucet's DRIP, DRIP, DRIP and the micro-explosions of the
          soap bubbles in the water intensify to deafening levels.
          TIGHT ON a SPOON atop the counter which suddenly begins
          dancing. Pots and pans on a hanging rack start rattling.
          A RUMBLE as more dishes and utensils vibrate and rattle, as
          if by a paranormal force.
          But as RACHEL casually straightens up and looks out the
          window, it's revealed it's only...

          EXT. RACHEL' S HOUSE - NIGHT

          BOYD driving a large SEMI-TRUCK pulling alongside the tiny
          house. Its engine shuts off..,

                         THE KITCHEN
          .and the spoons and dishes stop vibrating.

                         RACHEL
          (singsong, to herself)
          Daddy's home.
          She walks to her bedroom and closes the door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

          EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

          BOYD goes to shut the open fence and WALTER, the basset
          hound, scurries past him and into the street.

                         BOYD
          Come back here, mutt.

                         (WHISTLES LOUDLY)
          Aw, good riddance.
          And he closes the gate.

          INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          RACHEL lays in bed, staring at the ceiling. BOYD knocks on
          her door.

          BOYD (0.S.)
          Your dog got out. Better get'im.

          INT. JESSE'S CAR - NIGHT

          JESSE's driving alone, wiping Tracy's lipstick from his
          cheek.

          EXT. THE STREET -NIGHT

          's in her overcoat over her longjohns. She looks down
          the road and blanches as she sees WALTER trotting towards...
          The road in front of him, a two-lane blacktop with CARS and
          TRUCKS streaming by at high speed.

                         RACHEL
          Walter!
          And she breaks into a run. WALTER looks back, starts
          running, this is all fun for him.
          There's the low BLEAT of a TRUCK'S HORN and then...
          The high, piercing SQUEAL of a wounded animal.
          In the road, WALTER, laying flat, keening in pain.
          She runs to him and in one continuous motion SCOOPS him into
          her arms.
          RACHEL, in the middle of the two lanes. She turns as.__

                         HEADLIGHTS
          approach, fast.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          She stumbles under the dog's weight, tries flagging down a
          car.

                         RACHEL
          Help me! Please!
          It speeds past, dangerously close. Another set of LIGHTS.

                         RACHEL
          Stop! Please, stop!
          But the CAR passes, blaring its horn. She spins,around.
          is bearing down on her. She holds her ground.

                         RACHEL
          THE CAR'S WINDSHIELD -- CRACKS, crazes, as if it hit with a
          sharp, fierce projectile.
          THE CAR -- lays down rubber as it screeches to a halt.
          JESSE is at the wheel. Sees through the crazed windshield:
          RACHEL, splattered with dog's blood.
          He gets out, stares at his'windshield, shaken-up, groping for
          some explanation.

                         JESSE
          Damn. What... damn.
          RACHEL staggers up to him, holding a shivering mass of fur.

                         RACHEL

                         PLEASE--

                         JESSE
          Oh, my god.

          . JESSE'S CAR - NIGHT
          JESSE driving. RACHEL sits next to him, hugging the dog.

                         RACHEL
          It's my fault. He should have been in
          bed with me.

                         JESSE
          Everything's gonna be all right.
          His voice is not entirely convincing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.
          Through the spidered windshield: The car's headlights pierce
          the night.

          INT. THE VET'S PET CLINIC - NIGHT

          A craftsman bungalow which serves as a vet's hospital. The
          only light is over a FEMALE VET in her bathrobe, tending to
          WALTER on a shiny examining table. There are runnels on both
          sides of the table, for the blood.
          RACHEL and JESSE stand nearby.

                         RACHEL
          His name's Walter. will he be
          all right?
          The VET's intensely focused on inserting an I.V. into the
          dog.

                         VET
          You two had best wait outside.

                         JESSE
          Let's go. Best thing's to let her
          do her work.
          JESSE gently guides RACHEL away, who keeps looking back at
          her dog.

          THE WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
          RACHEL and JESSE on a couch in the darkened room. She's
          rocking herself, caked with blood. He tries to comfort her.

                         JESSE
          Your dog's gonna be okay.
          She nods, unconvinced.

                         JESSE
          God, I almost roadkilled you.
          Are you sure you're all right?
          She nods. They hear a muffled, "pmt", from the VET in the
          examining room. JESSE tries to take RACHEL's mind off it.

                         JESSE
          That tattoo on your arm, its pretty.
          Hurt a lot when you got it?

                         RACHEL
          some.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         JESSE
          Yeah?

                         RACHEL
          But it's... you know, like the song
          says, you hurt yourself to see if
          you can still feel.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm sorry.

                         JESSE
          For what?

                         RACHEL
          For making you--

                         JESSE
          No problem. Glad to help, you know.

                         RACHEL
          And I'm sorry about your windshield,
          about your car.

                         JESSE
          How bizarre was that,, huh? Anyway,
          wasn't your fault.

                         RACHEL
          You can be sorry for things that
          aren't your fault.
          The VET enters, drying her hands. RACHEL sits up, bracing
          herself for the bad news. JESSE puts an arm around her seat
          back, getting ready to hold her.

                         VET
          Walter's banged up pretty bad, lost
          quite a bit of blood, but he's gonna
          make it.

                         RACHEL
          Can I see him?

                         VET
          Come back tomorrow, any time after
          eight.

          EXT. HOUSE OF BREAKFAST - NIGHT

          Your typical I.H.O.P. JESSE's CAR is parked in the lot.

          INT. BATHROOM, HOUSE OF BREAKFAST - NIGHT

          RACHEL's at the sink, washing the dog's blood from her arms.
          A WOMAN walks in, sees her. Looks alarmed.
          INT. HOUSE OF BREAKFAST - NIGi4T
          As RACHEL moves through the restaurant, THREE PATRONS stare,
          stare, stare at the blood stains on her coat.
          She slides into a booth with JESSE. He's eating eggs.

                         JESSE
          Better. You don't look like a mass-
          murderer now.
          She smiles, sips a coffee. A country song comes on the
          jukebox.

                         JESSE
          Wow, this music. Guess we should just
          count ourselves lucky it ain't Hanson.

                         RACHEL
          (a weak smile)
          Lisa hLUd them.

                         JESSE
          She was a friend of yours?
          She nods.

                         JESSE
          really sorry.

                         RACHEL
          Sometimes I'd see someone, from
          behind, and I'd know, I'd just know,
          it was Lisa. And then she'd turn
          ound, and it wasn't. But sometimes,
          you know, it was. And now...

                         (PAUSES)
          Whenever I see someone who looks like
          her, and she turns around...
          it won't be... ever.
          They both go quiet, not knowing what to say.

                         JESSE
          (looks at his latch)
          Wow. It's late. "ve got football
          practice tomorrow.

                         JESSE
          No, if it wasn't for you I wouldn't
          have had this nutritious medl,

                         RACHEL
          You're very polite, for a jock.

                         JESSE
          The compliments, they just keep on
          comin'.
          He drops some money on the table.

                         RACHEL
          I don't have any--

                         JESSE
          's cool, I got it. Can I give you a

          Sure.

                         JESSE
          You'll let me know how Walter's doing?

                         RACHEL
          Yeah.

                         JESSE
          Good night.
          He extends his hand. She takes it.
          3i2!
          The SHOCK of static electricity. Their words are
          simultaneous.

          They both laugh. Then go quiet. Then just stare at each
          other. Then the moment is gone.
          RACHEL gets out of the car, through the gate, back inside her
          house. JESSE watches her go. Starts his engine, and his car

          WIPES THE FRAME TO:

          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

          RACHEL crossing the lot. Her HEARTBEAT can be heard. She
          looks up, sees LISA approaching the roof's edge. RACHEL's
          heart sounds like its bursting from her chest.

                         RACHEL
          Lisa don't! Somebody stop her! Stop!
          SLOW MOTION -- LISA falls through the air towards the car,
          arms outstretched, hair trailing like black flames.
          SMASH -- she goes through the windshield, but the face is

          RACHEL'S.

          SLAM CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

          NT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          RACHEL's eyes pop open as her body jerks awake, heart,
          pounding. She looks around, realizes where she is.

          FADE TO BLACK:

                         A SUPER:

          T U E S D
          Under which is heard:

          KELTON (V.O.)
          "For a moment, I thought someone was
          actually seeing me. But it was all a
          lie..."

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

          SHERIFF KELTON is reading from a photocopy of Lisa's
          SUE and RACHEL sit-,in chairs.

                         KELTON
          "Eric lied when he said I was special.
          And I guess I was lying to myself when
          I believed him."
          He folds the note.

                         SUE
          Rachel, is there anything in there
          that strikes a chord for you? Do you
          know what Lisa was referring to?

                         RACHEL
          (after a moment)
          Yesterday morning, she told me she'd,
          uh, lost her virginity.
          KELTON looks at SUE, produces the photo of LISA with ERIC.

                         KELTON
          You recognize this boy?

                         RACHEL
          Sure. Eric Stark. He's on the team.
          KELTON gestures to SUE and they step out into...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         THE HALLWAY
          with another "Heat Carlin!" banner in the background.

                         KELTON
          What do you think?

                         SUE
          Robbie, I had a Freshman crying in the
          hall last week. I couldn't get
          anything out of her, but her friend
          told me a football player slept with
          her, then dumped her.

                         KELTON
          Nothing illegal about breaking a
          girl's heart.

                         SUE
          Eric's 18. Lisa was 15. That's
          statutory rape.

                         KELTON
          That's a stretch.

                         SUE
          Then let's make it. I don't know
          what's going on around here, but if
          that's what it takes to stop it, let's
          stop it, before someone else's
          daughter kills herself.

                         KELTON
          All right. I'll look into it.

                         THE OFFICE
          SUE sits behind her desk, with RACHEL before her.

                         SUE
          How are you feeling?

                         RACHEL
          okay. Fine. Can I go no
          SUE opens a file on her desk.

                         SUE
          I was looking at chic last night.
          it says here your mom's in Arkham.

                         (BEAT)
          How's your mom doing?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         RACHEL
          She's gonna be fine.

                         SUE
          I spent some time up there.
          As a patient.
          RACHEL looks surprised.

                         SUE
          Does that surprise you?

                         RACHEL
          I guess. I mean, you seem pretty
          normal.

                         SUE
          Thanks. i try. You visit your moat
          often?

                         SUE
          Is that scary for you?

                         RACHEL
          Why?

                         SUE
          Well, children of schizophrenics
          sometimes live with the fear of it
          happening to them. At your age,
          it's perfectly normal to be afraid
          of turning out like your parents.

                         RACHEL
          Normal, huh? Get real, I know I'm
          ten times more likely to get it
          than most people.

                         SUE
          You're right. I'm sorry. So.
          You've been in a series of foster
          homes since you were, what, four?

                         RACHEL N

                         SUE
          How's your foster family?

                         RACHEL
          They're happy, - 'z-rig as they get
           their check every month.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         SUE
          What about your real father?

                         RACHEL
          Never met the gentleman. My mom
          won't even tell me his name.
          RACHEL stares at a ceramic MUG of coffee, very close o the
          edge of the desk.

                         SUE
          Rachel, in a way, you've lost your
          mother. And now you've lost a friend.
          Losing someone can be a very lonely,
          painful place to be.

                         RACHEL

                         (QUIETLY)
          You're right, I.lost my mom, I lost my,
          friend, the people who cared about me.
          But you only get paid to care.

                         SUE
          I really do care. How can I show you
          that I do?
          RACHEL is silent, staring at the MUG.

                         SUE
          Rachel?
          But RACHEL's shut off, pushing down a storm of emotions.

                         SUE
          You know, this room is a place where
          if you have feelings, you can talk
          about them. You can let them out.
          RACHEL shifts. SUE sees RACHEL's forearm near the coffee
          MUG. And, as if by proximity alone, it EDGES off the end of
          the desk --
          And FALLS --
          RACHEL catches it in one smooth motion just before it hits.

                         RACHEL
          sorry. I must've knocked it.
          SUE, the color draining from her face.

                         SUE
          I didn't... see you knock it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          The DOOR swings open and the PRINCIPAL walks in, lays a
          computer printout on her desk.

                         PRINCIPAL
          Sue, could you update the absentee
          lists, see who we have to call?

                         SUE

                         (DAZED)
          ure... sure.
          She turns, and RACHEL is gone.

          NT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
          ERIC is at his locker, wearing his BULLDOG letter jacket. He
          closes his locker to find RACHEL approaching him,
          intimidated, but determined. She looks him in the eyes.

                         RACHEL

                         (LOW)
          know. I know what you did.
          A chill goes through him. Not saying a word, he turns, walks
          through the crowd, looks back.
          She's still rooted, staring him down.

          EXT. FREAK HALL - LUNCH

          ARNIE plays hackey-sack behind RACHEL, who sits on the steps.
          She looks up, sees a BULLDOG letter jacket standing over her.
          It's JESSE.

                         JESSE
          Hi. How's Walter?

                         RACHEL

                         (COLD)
          Good. I'm picking him up today. Why
          aren't you hanging out with your
          friends over there?

                         JESSE

                         (TAKEN ABACK)
          What's up? What's wrong?
          She sees the hurt look in his eyes and softens.

                         RACHEL
          What do you wane from me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         JESSE
          I just wanted to, you know, see
          how you're doing.
          Over his shoulder she can see the stir his presence aC Freak
          Hall is causing among...

          THE PATIO GIRLS
          MONICA taps TRACY on the shoulder, who's checking her makeup
          in a compact mirror.

                         MONICA
          Look at Jesse, talking to a burnout.
          TRACY turns, slips on a stylish pair of DKNY glasses.

                         TRACY
          She's not very good in daylight is
          she? wonder where she keeps her
          coffin.

                         BACK ON:

                         JESSE
          So you'll meet me tonight, at the

                         PIZZA PLACE--

                         RACHEL
          --yeah. Okay.

                         JESSE
          (smiles, as he backs away)
          Okay. See you. Tonight.
          ARNIE sees the Patio Girls glancing at RACHEL. She sits an
          ARNIE nudges her.

                         ARNIE
          What'd he want?

                         RACHEL
          He asked me out.

                         ARNIE
          What'd you say?

                         RACHEL
          I said, "Okay, its your funeral."

                         ARNIE
          Pardon me, but is hanging out with
          jockboy such a hot idea? I mean,

                         ARNIE (CONT'D)
          I heard he's dating Tracy Campbell,
          who is giving you the look of a
          thousand deaths right now.
          RACHEL casually turns to take in TRACY, then turns away. Her
          heart sinks.

                         RACHEL
          She's beautiful.

                         ARNIE
          Duh.

          INT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - DAY

          CLOSE ON a TV SET showing game highlights of last year's
          Bulldog game against the Carlin Cougars.

          WALSH (O.S.)
          All right, as you can see from last
          year's tape, the Carlin Cougars are a
          tough, physical team. So Friday,
          it's gonna be kill or be killed.
          COACH WALSH, a charmless John Wayne, stands near the TV. The
          BULLDOGS sit on benches before him.
          On the VIDEO -.- MARK misses an easy block. WALSH points.

                         WALSH
          Here, we can see mark Sing kissing an
          opposing player good-bye.
          There are hoots of derision from the other PLAYERS. MARK
          nods. ERIC leans into MARK, speaks low.

                         ERIC
          You didn't get the picture?

                         MARK
          Bitch wouldn't give it to me. Stay
          frosty, no one else knows anything.
          It's still at the photomat, I'll
          get it.

          WALSH (O.S.)
          You two ladies back there gossiping?
          No, sir.

          WALSH (O.S. )
          Excellent. Then you can give me fifty
          when we hit the field.

          EXT. FOOTBALL PRACTICE - DAY

          JESSE and BRAD rest on a bench in their uniforms as MARK an
          ERIC do push-ups. The COACH stands on a blocking sled with
          PLAYERS Pounding into it.

                         WALSH
          C'mon girls, those are love taps!
          (sees Chuck give a weak block)
          Potter, show me you're a dog.

                         CHUCK
          Aww, coach.

                         WALSH
          You know the drill.
          The other PLAYERS begin a BARKING CHANT. CHUCK strips off
          his helmet, jogs to the bench and opens a styrofoam cooler,
          within it are slabs of raw steak on blood soaked ice..

                         WALSH
          Show me you're a dog, Potter.
          The barking rises as the PLAYERS psyche up CHUCK, who chews
          off a bite of the raw meat. JESSE whispers to MARK...

                         JESSE
          I hate this bullshit.

                         MARK
          Not me. I love it.
          MARK pops up, grabs a steak, rips off a bite, and runs full
          tilt at the, blocking tackle, smashing into it with meaning.

                         WALSH
          You're a piece of work, Bing.
          MARK takes a bow as he jogs away, chewing. He spots the
          SHERIFF's CRUISER pulling --p to the practice field.

          INT. A BUS - DAY

          RACHEL hugs her dog, who 'Looks a mess; hind legs bandaged, a
          funny cone around his head.
          TWO OLD LADIES are staring at RACHEL, unsure if they're more
          appalled by her appearance or the doge.
          WALSH c `1.O . )
          Show me you're dzgs'.

          EXT. FOOTBALL PRACTICE- LATER

          WALSH drill sergeants over MARK and the other PLAYERS as they
          do drills. The CHEERLEADERS run their practice in the'
          background.
          on the sideline, SHERIFF KELTON is talking to ERIC, who's
          sweating bullets as he fiddles with his helmet.
          MARK watches ERIC, so intent he bobbles a ball thrown to him.

                         KELTON
          So, you're saying you never met or
          talked to Lisa Parker?

                         ERIC
          No, sir. Never.
          KELTON produces the photo of LISA and ERIC.

                         N
          Eric, who's this you're hanging onto,
          a ghost?
          ERIC blanches.
          MARK watches KELTON leading ERIC away with WALSH.

          KENNEL - DAY
          A pinball machine as MARK plays, applying some body English
          to it. A wired ERIC enters, a bundle of violent energy.

                         MARK
          What happened?

          Kelton, man, with that sheriff's badge
          he pulled out of a cereal box.
          Somebody told him I did Lisa. He
          nails me with a picture of me and her,
          starts talking statutory rape.

                         MARK
          Relax, that's bullshit. Your dad's a
          lawyer, he'll kill that talk dead.

                         ERIC
          So I'm suspended. And Coach, Coach he
          up and does this scene where he says,
          "give me your helmet."

          What about Carlin? Game of the year,
          football scouts are gonna be there and
          I'm gonna be sittin' on the bench with

          You said you were gonna get the
          pictures.

                         MARK
          I tried. That Rachel bitch wouldn't
          give'em to me..

                         ERIC
          She's the one who put me and Lisa
          together. Shit. what are we gonna

          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

          BRAD and CHUCK are throwing unfurling TOILET PAPER rolls onto
          the trees in front of someone's middle-class house.

                         BRAD
          Who's place is this, again?

                         CHUCK
          Nimrod. It's Carlin's quarterback.
          MARK and ERIC pull up in Mark's Mustang convertible.

                         MARK

                         (WHISTLES LOUDLY)
          Hey, dogs! C'mon, we got a mission.
          BRAD and CHUCK run to MARK's car, jump over and into the back
          as MARK peels out.

          'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          A HAND WIPES shower steam off a mirror, revealing a wet
          RACHEL, a towel wrapped around her.

                         RACHEL
          jy are going to be late.
          She hears her doorbell go off.

          THE FRONT DOOR
          as RACHEL opens the door.

                         RACHEL
          What'd you forget your--
          There's nobody there.

                         (WEAKLY)
          --keys?
          She looks around, closes the door, locks it, wraps her towel
          tighter.

                         LIVING ROOM
          As she crosses back to her room. There's a KNOCKING on the
          kitchen back door. She frowns, goes to the back door, looks
          through the glass. No one there either. Now she's worried.

          . ' RACHEL
          (calls through the door)
          Boyd? Emilyn?
          She turns when the DOOR HANDLE on the front door JIGGLES
          once. She stops dead. Spins as...
          The BACK DOOR handle starts JIGGLING.
          She backs into the living room and spins as--
          Something starts TAPPING on one of the living room WINDOWS.
          Like a wave moving around her, a WINDOW on the other side
          starts TAPPING.
          RACHEL turns a full circle, scared, surrounded by TAPPING and
          JIGGLING, which grow increasingly loud r.
          She puts her palms against her temples, as if struggling to
          keep something bottled inside:

                         RACHEL
          Oh, god, oh, god. Not now. Stop
          Suddenly all goes silent. She jumps as...
          The PHONE RINGS near her. She scoops up the cordless. Beat.

                         RACHEL
          Hello?

          There's a long pause on the other end.

          EXT. RACHEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          MARK on a CELL-PHONE. BRAD starts laughing next to him as
          MARK covers the receiver, gestures to ERIC and CHUCK, who
          scurry around Rachel's house.

          RACHEL (V.O.)
          Who is this?

          WITHIN THE HOUSE
          sees a SHADOW run past a window.

          MARK (V.O.)
          who is Wig?

                         RACHEL
          Knock it off. Is this you, Arnie?

          MARK (V.0)
          Ding, ding, ding. Wrgnq, guess again.

                         RACHEL
          What do you want?

          MARK (V.0.)
          (a menacing pause)
          You.
          The JIGGLING and the TAPPING starts up again, loud. The BOYS
          VOICES are heard outside chanting...

                         BULLDOGS
          Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!
          MARK (V.o.)
          Rachel, come out and play now.
          RACHEL grabs a knife from the kitchen, backs into...

                         HER BEDROOM
          where a bandaged WALTER is on the bed, looking alarmed.
          RACHEL keeps backing up, nearing her open closet door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RACHEL
          I'm calling the police.
          She hangs up, dials 911, fumbling with the knife.

                         UT TO:

          INT. PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT

           A beer-and-slice emporium. JESSE'S at a payphone, hearing a
          bus y sianal on RACHEL Is line. He hangs up.

           INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          A horror-movie-moment as RACHEL waits for 911 to pick-up.
          Behind her, a HAND is reaching through the open sash window,
          pulling it up to gain entrance.

          RACHEI.

                         (INTO PHONE)
          I have an emergency. Now, right now!
          Yes, 3366 Elm Street...
          She turns, sees the HAND at the window.

                         RACHEL
          No!
          The WINDOW SMASHES down on the intruder's HAND. There's a
          muffled YELL outside and the HAND is extracted.

          EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Headlights light up MARK's face as BOYD and EMILYN's beat-up
          STATION WAGON approaches the house.
          MARK whistles loudly.
          And takes off, joined by ERIC, clutching his injured hand.

          â¢ SE - NIGHT
           RACHEL, still stunned by what just happened. The cordless in
          her hand speaks:

           911 OPERATOR (V.O. )
           Hello? Hello, :Ma'am, you still there?
          RACHEL slowly moves to tier bedroom doorway. BOYD comes in
          the front door.

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Yes. It's okay. Things are fine.
          She hangs up as a clueless BOYD takes in her freaked-out
          appearance.

                         BOYD
          What's wrong?

                         RACHEL
          Nothing.
          She retreats into her bedroom, looks at the Window. The
          PHONE RINGS in her hand. She answers.

          MARK (V.0.)
          Don't go tellin' stories about my
          Eric.
          Click and the line goes dead. She hangs up. The PHONE RINGS
          again. She doesn't answer.

          THE LIVING ROOM
          The PHONE RINGS on another extension. EMI, swers.

                         EMILYN
          Hello... just a second. Rachel?

                         RACHEL
          curled on her bed with WALTER, calls out:

                         RACHEL
          I'm not here.

          EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - DAY

          A SCREAMING DEVIL fills the frame.
          The bed of a speeding PICK-UP TRUCK is jammed with kneeling
          TEENAGE BOYS wearing children's Halloween masks. They're
          screaming bloody murder as they fire RAW EGGS at...
          The BERGEN STUDENTS gathered at the entrance.
          The PICK-UP speeds off as STUDENTS recover, straightening up
          from their ducking positions. MARK and his cohorts go
          running after the truck.

                         TRACY
          Carlin creeps!
          At Freak Hall, ARNIE rises, wipes egg yolk from his hair.

          Hormonally-charged mo,,,ï¿½r 'âns. Why do the
          innocent always get hit in a drive-by?
          RACHEL looks up, sees JESSE approaching. Her eyes flare.

                         JESSE
          Hey, what happened to you last night?
          I waited.

                         RACHEL
          You tell me what happened last night.

                         JESSE
          What?
          ON RACHEL and JESSE as she tells him what happened last
          night. He gets more and more agitated.
          TRACY is wearing her glasses as she and MONICA watch JESSE
          from the Patio.

                         TRACY
          What is wrong with this movie:
          does he see in her?

                         MONICA
          Come on Trace, you're caviar, she's
          cheeze whiz. He'll come around. He's
          just letting little Jesse do the

          Okay, don't worry, I'll talk to Mark,
          I'll take care of it

                         RACHEL

                         (FRUSTRATED)
          No, don't... maybe all this isn't such
          a good idea.

                         JESSE
          All what?

                         RACHEL
          I mean, guys like you are supposed to
          date girls like Tracy.

                         JESSE
          I'm picking you up tonight. We're
          gonna have a nice, mellow date.
          RACHEL stands, silent, torn. The BELL RINGS, everybody
          starts filing in.. She moves, he smiles, blocks her way.

                         JESSE
          I'm not going anywhere till you
          say yes.

                         RACHEL
          (looks away, looks back, smiles)
          All right. Okay.
          (he doesn't move a muscle)
          Yes.
          JESSE lets her pass, with a chivalrous after-you sweep of his
          hand, then falls in next to her. RACHEL'S arm is grabbed
          by...

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

          RACHEL crossing and uncrossing her legs, it's the last place
          she wants to be. She idly plays with the forest SNOW DOME.
          SUE doesn't look so comfortable herself. She's holding a
          stack of index cards.

          These are just an exercise that will
          let me know how to help you better.

                         RACHEL
          You're wasting your time.

                         SUE
          Just answer true or false to these
          statements.

          "Sometimes my thoughts assume the form

                         RACHEL

          I have a dog.
          SUE nods, watches RACHEL closely as she takes her time with
          this one, not reading off a card.

                         SUE
          Sometimes I can move things with my

          Beat. RACHEL stares at her, a million thoughts racing.
          Another beat.
          The only sound is the clock ticking on SUE's desk. RACHEL
          grabs her backpack and stands.

                         RACHEL

                         FUCK THIS--

          RACHEL turns to go. SUE jumps up, grabs her arm, and...

          on the desk EXP DES, splattering water and white flecks all
          over the desktop. RACHEL looks at it.

          JESSE looks at the styrofoam cooler on the bench.
          A few of the nearby PLAYERS begin their barking chant.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         JESSE
          Can't, Coach.

                         WALSH
          Say what?
          The barking trails off. The other boys are stunned.

                         BRAD
          Oh, shit.

                         JESSE
          Well, I'm not a dog today, Coach,
          I'm a vegetarian.

                         WALSH
          Since when? Don't give me that.
          Show me you're a dog, Ryan.

                         JESSE
          Sorry, Coach. No can do.

                         Â¢ WALSH
          Your attitude sucks. Hit the showers.
          Get outta my sight.
          JESSE doffs his helmet, jogs to the bench. He douses his
          head with water, sits there, looking angry.

          INT. LOCKER ROOM -

          PLAYERS goof around, snap towels at each other. Clanking
          steel and grunts from the boys at the weight machines.

          LOCKER ROOM SHOWERS
          The mist in a shower, through which are glimpses of a lean
          male figure with rippling stomach muscles. It's JESSE. MARK
          and BRAD enter the showers.

                         BRAD

                         (TO JESSE)
          Yo, lover boy, whatsa matter? Didn't
          ya nut that tattoo chick yet?

                         MARK
          Brad, how many points he gonna get for
          straightening a dyke?

                         BRAD
          Twenty, no, thirty.
          They fingertip high-five each other.

                         BRAD
          Jess, you score the skank yet?
          JESSE just glares at him, walks away.

                         MARK
          What's with him?

                         BRAD
          Must be that time of the month.

          THE LOCKER ROOM
          JESSE finishes dressing between the lockers. MARK, wearing a
          towel, approaches him.

                         MARK
          Jess, what's the matter?

                         JESSE
          You. What's with the stunt you pulled
          last night?

                         MARK
          What? Papering McCabe's house?
          I asked you if you--

                         JESSE
          What you did at Rachel's.

                         MARK
          what? We were just sendin' her
          a message.
          JESSE slams his locker closed.

                         JESSE
          Tell me, I'll pass it on.

                         MARK
          Look, man. She's getting Eric in all
          kinds a shit. I mean, if he gets
          charged with rape, there goes any

                         CHANCE OF--

                         JESSE
          Screw Eric, he's a big boy. He made
          his own decisions, he's gotta live
          with 'em. And stay away from Rachel,
          or deal with me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         MARK
          What are you getting bent for? She's
          just a burnout, a slut--
          BANG as JESSE shoves MARK against a locker. MARK shoves him
          back. The rest of the PLAYERS in the background go quiet.

                         JESSE
          (low, intense)
          Don't call her a skank, don't call
          her a slut.

                         MARK
          What's wrong with you?

                         JESSE
          We screw with girls, use them, because
          it makes us feel like big men--

                         MARK
          Get to the bad part.

          ' - JESSE
          I'm tired. I'm tired of all of it.

                         MARK
          What are you talking about? We're
          friends, we're all friends.

                         JESSE
          No. We just grew up together.
          And he walks away. On MARK. Pissed. He sees JESSE left his
          letter jacket behind, hanging on the locker.

          (thinks, then)
          Well, first, I thought I saw the devil

          people's faces looking... deformed,
          like they'd had plastic surgery, or the
          bones were moving under their skin.

                         (LAUGHS)
          For a while, I thought I had this bi

          There is something different about

          The headline identifies her as the girl thought responsible

          I heard about the good work you're
          doing at the high school.
          The PATIENT turns and softly starts thudding his forehead

          I'm just trying to help Rachel. She
          seems very troubled and I'm worried
          about her.

          I did tell Rachel how I met him. He
          said it was love at first sight.
          I was his waitress. I insisted he try
          the cherry pie, 'cause I'd baked it
          myself. He said, with every bite of
          that pie, he could see our future
          together. By the time he got to the
          crust, he could see what I would look
          like, all old and saggy... and he
          still loved me.
          (her smile fades, then)
          He left me after Rachel was born.
          I never told her because, people
          around here aren't too fond of Carrie
          White, for what she did. I didn't
          want her having to grow up with that.

          EXT. WITHIN JESSE'S CAR - NIGHT

          JESSE driving. RACHEL has her hand on the big HURST
          stickshift between the two bucket seats. He accelerates and
          RACHEL expertly shifts the gear.

                         JESSE
          You are good. I'm impressed.

                         RACHEL
          My foster-dad taught me on his semi
          truck. Where we going?

          EXT. THE HILL - NIGHT

          The twinkling lights of Bergen below. Stars above. RACH
          and JESSE lay on the hood of his car, leaning against the
          windshield.

                         JESSE
          Before he sold cars, my dad wanted to
          write this book: One Hundred Senators
          Pick Their Favorite Restaurants.' So,
          he wrote, to all of them.

                         RACHEL
          All of them?

                         JESSE
          Dear Senator So-and-so, I am writing
          a book.

                         RACHEL
          Anybody answer?

                         JESSE
          Yes. No. Sort of.
          She laughs.

                         JESSE
          He got two letters back. one was a
          form letter which said, 'Thank you
          for your support.'

                         RACHEL
          And the other?

                         JESSE
          The other was from Hubert Humphrey.

                         RACHEL
          Who?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         JESSE
          He was the vice-President once.
          He wrote back a three page letter,
          raving about a place called Wally's
          Burger Hut. My dad was knocked-out.

                         RACHEL
          So your dad wrote a book, color me
          impressed.

                         JESSE
          He never wrote it. Or he was going
          to, and then my sister was born, and
          then I was born. And there was this
          car dealership, and it was security.
          So your dad wanted to be a writer.
          How'd his kid end up being this sweaty
          armpit jock?

                         JESSE

                         (BEAT)
          Sometimes when they throw me the ball,
          it feels like time just slows down.
          And I know where to be and how to get
          there. When I have that feeling I
          catch it. Always. Every time.

                         RACHEL
          And you like that.

                         JESSE
          Yeah, I love it. Except. My dad.
          He's got my life all mapped out. He
          wants me to take over the business.

                         RACHEL
          What's wrong with that? Sounds like a
          nice life.

                         JESSE
          Selling used cars is not what I want.
          And, unless I nail that football
          scholarship,' that's what I'll get.

                         (EXHALES)
          Wow. I can't believe I'm telling you
          all this. I've never said any of this
          out loud to anyone before.
          (takes a long look at her)
          Must be great not having to be like
          anyone else.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         RACHEL
          It's not so great. Sometimes I wish I
          could just be one of the shiny, happy
          people. Does that surprise you?

                         JESSE
          Everything about you surprises me.
          There's the soft pops of rain hitting the car as it begins to
          drizzle, then it comes down hard.

          WITHIN THE CAR
          RACHEL and JESSE are in front, facing each other, leaning
          against the doors as rain streams against the windows.

                         RACHEL

                         (SITS FORWARD)
          I used to know this guy, could suck a
          strand of spaghetti through his mouth
          and out his nose. He called it Brain
          Flossing.
          JESSE smiles.

                         RACHEL
          He had a talent. You. You got
          football. It'll get you outta this
          place. You can make your own path
          after that. Write your own book.

                         JESSE
          Yeah? Want to come with me?
          She smiles. He leans forward. And she pulls away-, afraid,
          then decides to let him. They kiss. Then she pulls away.

                         JESSE
          What?

                         HEL
          This...
          She indicates the gear shift.

                         HEL
          is poking me right in the ribs.
          JE55E's eyes flicker to the back seat.

                         RACHEL
          Um, I don't know how to say this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         JESSE
          Yeah?

                         RACHEL
          But I've never...

                         JESSE
          Oh.

                         RACHEL
          And, I'd want it to be special. Like
          you ring the doorbell, with flowers
          in your hand.

                         JESSE
          Right. So... what's your favorite
          flower?

                         RACHEL

                         (SMILES)
          Daisies.

          in his car. The street's wet, but it's stopped raining.
          RACHEL gives him a quick kiss goodnight.

                         RACHEL

                         SEE YOU--

          She pulls away, exits, closes the door for the--

          INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          RASE sleeps fitfully, tangled in her sheets.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. THE WOODS - NIGHT

          A massive GOTHIC BED sits incongruously in a clearing.

          RACHEL AND JESSE
          are making love. She's on top, her hands on his chest.
          Their glistening bodies catch the light of a RING OF FLAMES
          bursting around the bed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         RACHEL'S HANDS
          suddenly sink into the flesh of JESSE's chest.
          She SCREAMS as she tries to extract them,. but strips of his
          flesh stick to her like flypaper.
          RACHEL twists violently as her torso melds into his.
          Their bodies fuse, a grotesque apparition with four legs and
          two heads.
          Her mouth presses into his as their faces merge.
          The ring of fire leaps inward, consuming the bed.

          RACHEL sits, lost in thought. JESSE nears. She stands up.

                         JESSE
          So, you're coming to the game, right?

                         RACHEL
          I don't really get football.

                         JESSE
          C'mon. I need you, for good luck.

                         RACHEL
          All right. I'll be there.

                         JESSE
          Good. I have practice today, but I
          can pick you up later, seven thirty?

                         RACHEL
          Sure, go practice. Go be great.
          Live the life you want.

                         JESSE
          What kind of life do you want?

          I don't know. I have a hard time
          picturing it.

                         JESSE
          Well if you can't, I'll do it for you.

                         RACHEL
          What do you mean?

                         JESSE
          I will predict your future.

                         RACHEL
          Uh-huh. Can I get a hint?

                         JESSE
          'm in it.
          ON THE PATIO -- are TRACY, MARK and MONICA, watching the.

                         TRACY
          If he's gonna do it, you know, be seen
          talking in public with someone else,
          he should show some respect.
          (a slow boil)
          He should show me the respect, at
          least, to be seen with someone pretty.
          Someone cool. Someone who counts.
          Amy or you, you know, ate.
          Instead, it's Its. And I feel...

                         MONICA
          Disrespected?

                         TRACY
          That's right. I wish there was
          something I could do to make him come
          to his senses.
          On MARK's face, a slow, insidious grin that seems to spread
          into eternity appears.

                         TRACY
          What?

                         MARK
          Let's nail the bitch. Plan
          a way to screw her like she's
          screwing us.

          A dark smudge is spread on the empty parking space where LISA

          A DREAM-LIKE GLIDE past SUE's VOLVO, parked on the roadside,
          and through the trees.

          SUE (V.0.)
          This used to be the school for the

          There was a fire here that year.

          people died. A few of us survived.

          INT. THE DESTROYED GYM - DAY

          Dark; full of exposed wires, metal rods and pipes, countless
          empty beer cans. Two mattresses are laid out amid the

          SUE stands on a pile of rubble, next to RACHEL. There's a

          Sounds of horrible SCREAMING.
          Flashes of.KIDS stampeding. Burning. Dying.
          A fire rages behind CARRIE as she steps off a platform, turns
          and looks at us with the face of an avenging angel.

          BACK TO.

          THE DESTROYED GYM,

                         SUE
          I haven't really been here in over
          twenty years. But it feels like I've
          been back here every day since.

                         RACHEL
          Happy homecoming. Can we go? This
          place is spooky. Gives me the creeps.

                         SUE
          Do you know what happened here?

                         RACHEL
          You just said. A fire.

                         SUE
          What caused it?

                         RACHEL
          They think a boiler blew up, okay?
          Am I gonna be graded on this?

                         SUE
          Come on, you've heard of Carrie White.

          It fell.

                         SUE
          We both saw it.
          RACHEL looks at her, isn't going to talk about this.

                         SUE
          I know everything there is to know
          about Carrie White. She did this.
          It began with what you did, with
          the snow dome. Then it got out
          of control.

          It's a genetic recessive trait. The
          male is the carrier, when he combines
          with the right female, the trait
          surfaces in their offspring, usually
          in women. Like King's Disease,
          hemophilia.

                         RACHEL
          What are you saying I have?

                         SUE
          Its a trait, Rachel, you inherited.
          Telekinesis.

                         RACHEL
          With all respect, lady, you're
          seriously bat-shit. I'm walking,
          back to the real world.
          SUE's voice is low, quiet.

                         SUE
          Your mother told me your father was
          Ralph White. Carrie's father.
          It stops RACHEL in her tracks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         RACHEL
          I don't believe you. She never told
          me, why would she tell you?

                         SUE
          You need help--
          Like what? Like they helped you?

                         SUE
          Yes. No.

                         RACHEL
          So then it's Arkham for me?

                         SUE
          No. I can help you, get it under
          control.

                         RACHEL
          You want to know what I'm feeling
          today? `Happy. Happier than I've
          ever been. So I don't want or need
          your help.
          RACHEL runs off. SUE follows, trips on the rubble, falls.

                         SUE
          Rachel!

          INT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - DAY

          JESSE stands at his locker, dressing. MARK approaches.

                         MARK
          Hey.
          (no response from Jesse)
          Just wanted to say two things.
          I'm sorry. Maybe I overreacted.

                         JESSE
          Don't play with me.

                         MARK
          I'm not. We've been friends since
          we could both pee standing up. And I
          thought we'd be best friends forever.

                         (BEAT)
          Never thought some girl could come
          between that. Look, I know I'm scum.
          I'm lower than scum, I'm smegma, I'm
          butt lint.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         JESSE
          (smiles in spite of himself)
          Keep going.

                         MARK
          I'm sorry.

                         JESSE
          I'm not the one you should be
          apologizing to.

                         MARK
          You're right. I'll come up with a way
          to make it up, to b of you.
          (smiles, full charm)

          INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE - DUSK

          Light streams in through the slatted blinds. The young D.A.
          is at his desk. MR. STARK, Eric's attorney father, sits
          across from him with ERIC. SHERIFF KELTON and COACH WALSH:
          also sit in chair's.

                         STARK
          You're not really thinking of pressing
          charges against my son.

          D.A.
          We're doing more than just thinking.

                         WALSH
          I need the boy for the game.

                         STARK
          Robbie, we've known each other a long
          time, since you were a Bulldog.

                         KELTON
          Save it, Lou. Sue Snell told me there
          were other girls--

                         WALSH
          Those kinds of girls know what they're
          getting in to. Eric's a good kid, he
          may be guilty of some youthful

                         TRANSGRESSIONS--

                         KELTON
          Youthful transgressions? A girl
          killed herself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         73
          The door opens and the town's MAYOR walks in, grey-haired,
          distinguished, with an air of authority.

          D.A.

                         (NODS)
          Mr. Mayor.

                         MAYOR
          Sit, everybody, sit, 'm just
          listening in.
          He leans against the desk, arms folded..

                         STARK

                         (BEAT)
          Okay. Cards on the table. My boy
          isn't going down alone then.

          D.A.
          Go on.

                         STARK
          He hasn't done anything other boys on
          the team haven't done. Eric can even
          get proof of it. Mark Bing, Jesse
          Ryan, Chuck Potter, Brad Winters.

                         (PAUSES)
          Now, there will be college scouts at
          the game Friday. Eric takes a fall,
          I'll make sure they all do. You want
          to be responsible for tarnishing all
          these boys lives?

                         MAYOR
          Well. I think that about sums it up.
          He looks at the D.A., as if to give him his cue.

          D.A.
          Robbie, I just don't think I have
          enough evidence to ruin this boy's
          reputation.

                         KELTON

                         BUT--

          D.A.
          That's it, Robbie. That's all.

                         MAYOR
          Lou, thank you for coming in.
          I'll walk you out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
          They all stand and shakes hands.
          KELTON sits; seething as he realizes the fix was in before
          ever entered this room. he
          He looks across at ERIC, sitting, a smug look on his face.

          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

          MARK intercepts JESSE as he nears his car.

                         MARK
          Hey, man, I got it. This girl, this
          Rachel, is special to you, huh?

                         JESSE
          Yeah.
          MARK extracts a KEY RING from his jacket, pulls a KEY off.

                         MARK
          The cabin. My folks aren't there.
          Get away from all of us idiots.
          Go have a romantic time.
          JESSE looks at him. MARK tosses the key, JESSE catches it.
          MARK smiles.

                         MARK
          And bring her to my party. I'll show
          you we can be one big, happy family.

          EXT. STREET/TRACY'S BMW - DAY

          TRACY driving with MONICA as they follow a walking RACHEL.
          RACHEL crosses the street.

                         MONICA
          Finally, she's going into the mall.

                         TRACY
          (an evil smile)
          Perfect. We have the homefield
          advantage.

          INT. SHOPPING MALL, DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

          The cosmetics department of an upscale store, mirrors on
          every counter. A SALESwoMAN sprays perfume samples on
          passing shoppers. She pulls up short as she encounters...
          RACHEL wandering by, out-of-place in her street urchin wear.
          The PERFUME WOMAN watches RACHEL pass.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          Stopping at a counter, RACHEL takes in the vast array of
          makeup, the models on the displays. She sees a YOUNG COUPLE
          go by, very J. Crew, very much in love.
          She turns to her own visage reflected in several mirrors on
          the counter.

                         RACHEL
          (under her breath)
          You're normal.
          At the end of the counter, the PERFUME WOMAN approaches a
          SALESWOMAN helping MONICA.

                         PERFUME
          Karen, watch the girl in black, make
          sure she doesn't pocket anything.
          MONICA turns around to see...
          RACHEL -- staring at a row of-lipsticks. She's startled

                         BY-

                         SALESWOMAN
          Can I help you?

                         RACHEL
          Uh, just looking.
          The woman gives her a smile of devastating insincerity,
          crosses her arms and just stands there. RACHEL gets her
          drift.
          MONICA walks up behind RA

                         MONICA
          Oh, hi. Karen, this is a friend
          of mine from school.
          The SALESWOMAN nods, moves away.

                         RACHEL
          Thought she was gonna frisk me.

                         MONICA
          She does Step Class with my mom.

                         (SMILES)
          You should see the scars from her
          liposuction.
          RACHEL edges way, checking out the lipsticks, but MONICA
          trails her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         MONICA
          What are you looking for?

                         RACHEL
          Nothing. Just lookin'.

                         MONICA
          Is it perhaps, something to wear on a
          date? Perhaps with a certain jock-
          hunk we all know?

                         RACHEL
          (smiles, nervous, nailed)
          No.

                         MONICA
          You know, Tracy isn't universally
          loved.

                         RACHEL
          There's a shock.

                         MONICA
          Exhibit A. I think she's a Melrose
          Place superbitch.
          RACHEL cracks a hint of a smile.

                         MONICA
          You have great lips.

                         (BEAT)
          No, really. Look, this shade would
          look very kissable on you. Soft.
          MONICA goes to apply the lipstick on her. RACHEL pulls away.

                         MONICA
          Trust me. See, Tracy tried to steal
          Brad from me. Now hold still.
          And RACHEL does.

                         MONICA
          So, he invite you to the game? Just
          nod.
          RACHEL nods.

                         MONICA
          Well, there's a big party after. I
          hope you can go. I know it would mean
          a lot to Jesse if we all got along.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         RACHEL
          Uh-huh.

                         MONICA
          Good. See?
          Checking in a mirror, RACHEL sees she's right.

                         MONICA
          Here, these two would also rock
          on you.
          The SALESWOMAN reappears.

                         SALESWOMAN
          Can I ring those up?

                         RACHEL
          Um, sure. How much are these?

                         SALESWOMAN
          Twenty-two fifty. Each.
          RACHEL sets the lipsticks down. MONICA smiles at the

          SALESWOMAN.

                         MONICA
          Maybe next time. Bye.
          She pulls RACHEL away. As they walk the SALESWOMAN keeps
          looking at RACHEL with distaste.

                         MONICA
          (a conspiratorial smile)
          Here, I kleptoed it for you.
          She slips RACHEL the lipstick.

          INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          RACHEL before the mirror, applying the lipstick. A P.J.
          HARVEY song plays under, slow, insistent, seductive:

          P.J. HARVEY
          She's burst/ dropped off! picked the
          fruit! realize! I'm naked / I'm naked
          too./ So cover rrry body/ dress it fine/
          hide my linen and lace.
          She pulls on a silver, thrift-shop SLIP DRESS, moves a slee ve
          to cover her tattoo.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          P.J. HARVEY (cont'd)
          So fruit flower myself inside out/ I'm
          happy and bleeding for you / fruit
          flower myself inside out / I'm tired
          and bleeding for you...
          She slips off her nose stud.

          EXT. RACHEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          JESSE waiting in his car. He looks up --
          RACHEL stands under the porch light in her dress. A lanky
          gangster girl, with. one leg planted on a step like a cocked
          gun. She's bone-chillingly beautiful.
          He gets out, opens the car door for her.

                         JESSE
          What happened to that little thing you
          wear, that, uh...
          He gestures to hib'nose, indicating her stud.

                         RACHEL
          Took it off.

                         JESSE
          Too bad. I like it. It's different.
          RACHEL looks at the car seat. On it are DAISIES.

                         JESSE

                         (SMILES)
          Just, you know, throw'em in the back.

          EXT. A CABIN - NIGHT

          A small cabin in the woods. Fire light in the window.
          JESSE's CAR is parked in t;^.e gravel alongside.

          INT. THE CABIN - NIGHT

          JESSE is stoking a fire in the fireplace. There's a MOOSE
          HEAD TROPHY on the wall. RACHEL's sitting on a bed, draped
          with a chenille spread.

                         JESSE
          It was nice of mark to lend us the
          place. He's really tryin' to make
          peace. Invited .s to his party. But
          we won't go if y;,u,d be uncomfortable.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          He moves to the bed.

                         RACHEL
          No. Let's go.

                         JESSE
          Great.
          (looks at her)
          What's wrong?

                         RACHEL
          I feel like.., we're being watched.
          She looks up at the MOOSE HEAD's MARBLE EYES, reflecting
          firelight. JESSE drapes his jacket over the MOOSE HEAD.

                         JESSE
          Sorry, Bullwinkle, lights out.
          (sits on the bed)
          Feel better?

                         RACHEL
          Feel scared.

                         JESSE
          Funny. He too.,
          He leans in to her. She backs away, like a skittish doe.

                         RACHEL
          I'm sorry, I just feel... weird.
          I don't know. Oh, wow, I am really
          losing my mind here.

                         JESSE
          It's okay. Rachel, it's okay. It
          doesn't have to be tonight. Whenever
          you're ready. And, hey, you know
          what, you're the sanest person I know.
          And that's exactly what she needed to hear. She cups the
          back of his neck and pulls his lips to hers. They kiss; a
          deep, healing kiss.

                         HER HAND
          brushes aside one of the straps to her dress,, which slips off
          her shoulder.
          JESSE tenderly runs his hand over her HEART-THORN TATTOO.

          CLOSEUPS OF RACHEL AND JESSE
          in the bed, making love. Firelight playing over their skin.
          It's beautiful. what we all wanted our first time to be.
          They move slowly, as if all the pain in the world could be
          erased, ï¿½f only they could become one. JESSE watches RACHEL
          Her face open, vulnerable.

                         RACHEL ASLEEP
          seems peaceful, holding on to JESSE like a child, they're
          covered by the chenille spread. Their sweat clings to them
          like the softest of prisons. He's awake, studying her. He
          gently runs his fingertips across her brow.

          out.
          There's the gaping lens of a VIDEO CAMERA visible in the

          window. trying to be mouse quiet. She gets safely inside
          when her bedroom door opens.
          BOYD stands in the doorway. She's busted.

                         BOYD
          You were out all night.
          RACHEL nods, defiantly. He walks over to her and, without
          warning, slaps her.

                         BOYD
          You're grounded. No school today.
          You don't move from this room.
          He turns on his heel, walks out. The dog looks as stricken
          as she does.

          A SERIES OF DISSOLVES:
          Of RACHEL in her bedroom, as the day passes.
          The sun moves across the floor as a ghostly RACHEL and her
          dog FADE IN-AND-OUT around the room. She lays in bed,
          staring at the ceiling. Paces her room like a prisoner.
          FINALLY -- It's nightfall.
          RACHEL slips out her window.

          Dimly lit as SUE SNELL sits with

                         SUE
          Rachel needs help. She doesn't
          believe me and I'm afraid for her.
          I want you to tell her who her
          father was.
          Why?

                         SUE
          She'll believe it from your lips.
          Mrs. Lang, I really need your help,
          before it's too late. I can take you
          to her. Will you help me?
          BARBARA slowly nods, yes.

          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM, STANDS - NIGHT

          The entire town has showed for this traditional rivalry and
          there's Bulldog paraphernalia galore. RACHEL appears in the
          stands, looking a bit lost. Down front sit MONICA and AMY.
          On the field are TRACY and her fellow CHEERLEADERS.
          MONICA nudges AMY and waves to

                         MONICA
          Rachel, Rach, over here.
          Hey. Grab a seat.
          Looking around, RACHEL sees she's surrounded by Patio People.

                         RACHEL
          Thanks, but...

                         MONICA
          Oh, please, you're.not gonna sit by
          your lonesome. There's plenty of room,
          if Amy;here slides her bubble butt.

                         (DRY)
          Very witty, Ms. Bulimia.
          But she moves over. RACHEL tentatively sits.

          INT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

          JESSE enters, mounds of hair are at his feet. He looks up.
          MARK and most of the BULLDOGS have shaved their heads and are
          working on the last players. They turn to him in unison.
          CHUCK grins, runs his hand over his scalp.

                         CHUCK
          We did it for the big game.

                         MARK
          C'mon, Jess, you're up.
          JESSE stares in horror at how identical they all look now.
          Then he starts to... giggle, then breaks into laughter, turns
          and walks away.

                         A P-ALN
          Man, he'll ruin the whole effect.

          MONICA and RACHEL.

                         MONICA
          No, no, it's an extra point when
          you score the kick after the touchdown.
          A safety is when you get tackled with
          the ball in your own end zone.

                         RACHEL
          Thought that was a bunt.
          What?

                         RACHEL
          I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

                         MONICA
          Okay, listen. Here's what Brad told me
          to say, doesn't matter if something good
          or bad happens, just say "You. gotta be
          fuckin' kiddin' mel" No matter what,
          just say that. It'll sound like you know
          what's going on.

          INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - NIGHT

          JESSE and the team move through a dark tunnel and onto...

          THE FOOTBALL FIELD
          with all the pageantry and sheer rush of a hometown crowd.
          The school band plays like they're going to bust a gut.
          Hysteria and bloodlust fill the air as the crowd starts a
          barking chant.

                         JESSE
          on the sideline bench. He scans the crowd behind him,
          sees.
          A NOTRE DAME SCOUT, wearing a "Fighting Irish jacket, toting
          a clipboard.
          JESSE then spots RACHEL in the stands, gives her a reassuring
          grin. She glances at the SCOUT, smiles back at JESSE.
          TRACY sees them, is none too happy.
          SLOW MOTION -- A whistle sounds as a FOOTBALL is kicked to
          start the game. The BALL spins end over end until...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          It's caught by a BULLDOG receiver who starts his return, then
          is popped hard and FUMBLES. An OPPOSING PLAYER leaps onto
          the ball on the muddy quagmire of a field.
          n the stands...

          RACHEL, MONICA, AMY
          (in accidental unison)
          You gotta be fuckin' kiddie' me!
          They turn to each other, burst into laughter.
          MONTAGE -- of the punishing game. Epic warfare with
          grunting, spitting and cursing as LINEMAN butt heads and.
          -- A CARLIN RUNNING BACK steamrolls through the BULLDOGS for
          a touchdown.
          -- RACHEL, MONICA and AMY do their You gotta be fuckin'
          kiddin' me routine.
          JESSE catches a pass, and is immediately slammed hard

          CARLIN PLAYER.
          RACHEL looks like she's been kicked in the gut.

                         RACHEL
          Do they have to hit him that hard?

                         MONICA
          Amy, Rachel's worried about Jesse.

                         AMY
          Don't worry, i always looks worse
          than it really

                         CUT TO:
          TRACY and the other CHEERLEADERS leading a cheer as...
          JESSE glances at the sideline, where the NOTRE DAME FOOTBALL
          SCOUT watches him, writing notes on his clipboard.
          THE HALF-TIME SCOREBOARD and the BULLDOGS trail 7-
          On the sideline, MARK SMASHES his helmet to the ground.

                         DOCTOR
          Well... I understand you need to take
          out Mrs. Lang, to do a drug-abuse
          intervention with her daughter. But
          while she's doing well, her condition
          may be fragile.

                         (BEAT)
          In good conscience, I could only
          release her in your custody for
          two hours.

                         0
          Thank you.
          SUE jumps to her feet to leave.

                         DOCTOR
          Hold on. You have a bunch of release
          forms to sign. I'll go get them.
          On SUE, sitting, knowing she-may be running out of time.

          EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

          The BULLDOGS prove their worth with brutal play as they cream
          the CARLIN QUARTERBACK for a big loss.
          THE FOURTH QUARTER SCOREBOARD -- the BULLDOGS trail 7-3.
          RACHEL sees...
          The Notre Dame FOOTBALL SCOUT writing notes as he watches...
          JESSE cutting across the middle of the field.
          He catches a pass, but two DEFENSIVE BACKS converge on him
          and he gets bone-jarringly plastered.
          JESSE hits the ground with such force his helmet flies off.
          For a moment, it looks like he's been decapitated.

                         RACHEL

                         (STANDS)
          Jess!
          THE HOMETOWN CROWD rises to their feet as...
          JESSE stays down, hurt.

                         RACHEL
          Oh, no.
          RACHEL strains to see him as the team circles around JESSE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          FOUR PHOTOGRAPHERS rush along the sideline to snap shots,
          their cameras flashing.
          JESSE sits up, stands, shakes his head to clear it as he jogs
          to the sideline.

                         RACHEL
          Thank, God. He's okay.

                         CUT TO :
          THE SCOREBOARD CLOCK -- loudly TICKING from 0:09 to 0:07.
          JESSE -- running. He looks up to...
          THE NIGHT SKY -- A FOOTBALL silently arches up, spinning an
          achingly beautiful spiral in SLOW MOTION.
          THE SCOREBOARD CLOCK -- a booming TICK from 0:05 to 0:04.
          JESSE makes a spectacular one-handed catch on the run,
          streaking along the sideline.
          Ahead of him, a monstrous CARLIN LINEBACKER closes in on him
          with murder in his eyes.

                         RA
          Look out !

          THE LINEBACKER'S P.O.V. --
          All the PHOTOGRAPHERS on the sideline have their CAM g
          FLASHES flare in unison, without their snapping them!
          The blinded LINEBACKER plows into the SIDELINE PHOTOGRAPHER
          JESSE scores a touchdown.
          And the CROWD goes berserk as the BULLDOGS throw their
          helmets in the air.

                         (STUNNED)
          You gotta be... wow.
          RACHEL stands there, open-mouthed, relieved, but unsure if
          she had anything to do with what just happened.

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

          The Bulldogs are still whooping it up as COACH WALSH
          approaches JESSE.

          wants to talk to you first.
          JESSE nods, turns to BRAD.

                         JESSE
          Brad, can you tell Rachel I'll be
          out soon? Have her wait for me.

          INT. STADIUM CORRIDOR - N

          RACHEL and MONICA stand in the hoard waiting for the players.
          TRACY passes, soggy, muddy, yet still radiating a cool
          confidence in her beauty. She gives RACHEL, a shark's smile.
          BRAD exits the locker room, goes to RACHEL's side.

                         BRAD
          It's gonna be a while, Jess is talkin'
          to the scout, he said for you to go
          ahead to the party.

                         (WARMLY)
          Rachel, did you hear that, Jesse's
          talking to the scout, isn't that great?

                         RACHEL
          Yeah.

          No, this couldn't be it. Rachel said
          it was a real nice house, surrounded
          by trees, with a pool in the back.

          A herd of parked cars and throbbing music indicate MARK's

          CHUCK cuts through, sees someone jostle a table lamp.

          How come she gets to go in?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         MONICA
          (rais6s a toast)
          To new friends.
          They raise their glasses and RACHEL joins in with a hesitant
          smile. Their glasses clink together for the...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          JESSE crosses the near empty lot, hair wet from his shower.
          He stops dead.

                         JESSE
          Damn it.
          Under a pool of lamplight -- HIS CAR has had its tires
          slashed and someone has sprayed in red Carlin uies!â 
          across the door.
          TRACY pulls up in. her BMW, wearing her cheerleading outfit.

                         TRACY
          Oh, wow, that sucks. Further proof
          Carlin guys are gravy sucking pigs.

                         JESSE
          Yeah.

                         TRACY
          Need a ride?

                         JESSE
          You goin' to Mark's?

                         TRACY
          Wouldn't miss it. Hop in.
          As he gets into her car, TRACY has one hand on the wheel, the
          other hanging out her window. She drops something as JESSE
          closes the door.
          REVEAL a CAN of red spray paint TRACY dropped onto the
          parking lot's tarmac.

                         TRACY
          Just a quick stop at my house,
          want to change my outfit.
          Her car pulls off...

          WIPING THE FRAME TO,

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

          INT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          RACHEL and MONICA chat with AMY and two other PATIO GIRLS.
          AMY takes RACHEL 's hand.

                         AMY
          I really like your nail color.

                         MONICA
          Check out the tattoo on her arm
          wild huh?

                         AMY
          Yeah. Did that hurt?

                         RACHEL
          No. Well, yeah, actually some.

                         AMY
          Oh, it's just too cool.

                         MONICA
          I'm dying to get one, but my mom
          would have a shit fit.

                         AMY
          So would mine. She says I'm not
          that type of gi rl.

                         RACHEL
          What type is that?
          There's an awkward pause which MONICA breaks.

                         MONICA
          A slut.
          (throws an arm around Rachel)
          That's why you should take all
          of us in for tattoos!
          AMY and the other GIRLS laugh. RACHEL softens, joining in.
          She looks around at everyone at the party, laughing, dancing.
          The shiny, happy people. it feels weird, but here she is.
          She smiles, takes a sip of her drink.
          By the stereo, MARK cranks up the music as CHUCK dances over
          to AMY, pulls her into the dancing CROWD. BRAD grabs MONICA.

                         BRAD
          C'mon, wench, let's dance.
          He pulls MONICA into the crowd, and she gestures for RACHEL
          to join them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         RACHEL
          No, I'd rather wait for Jesse.

                         MONICA
          Oh, c'mon, Rachel. He'd want you
          to have fun.

                         AMY
          Yeah, c'mon, Rach.
          There's a chorus of "C'mon, Rachel" from the guys and some of
          the other DANCERS join in. An embarrassed RACHEL surrenders,
          sets down her drink and enters the dancing group.

                         MONICA
          All right, girl.
          RACHEL smiles. BRAD starts dancing before RACHEL.
          SLOW MOTION -- CLOSE on RACHEL's face, dancing, beaming. For
          a few moments, everything seems perfect. And she throws her
          head back and laughs.
          MARK dances into the group.

                         MARK
          Hey, Chuckzilla, why don't you
          put on the highlights tape?

                         CHUCK
          You mean tonight's game?
          MARK shares a laugh and a glance with MONICA and B

                         MARK
          Yeah, tonight's game.

                         CHUCK
          Okay. Let's go to the videotape:
          He dances out of the group over to the VCR where he pops out
          a tape and inserts a tape marked "Bulldogs Highlights".
          RACHEL turns around, sees the large screen TV PLAYING images
          of the Bulldogs playing football.

                         RACHEL
          Is that tonight's game?

                         MARK
          No, it's the other game.
          Still dancing, she turns back to the group.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         RACHEL
          What other game?

                         MARK
          The game you were in.
          The others laugh. She smiles, confused.

                         RACHEL
          What?

                         BRAD
          The one you played.

                         MARK
          Yeah, yeah, what was the score?
          Chuckie, pass me the scoreboard,
          I wanna show Rachel how she helped
          Jesse win the game.
          CHUCK pulls the BLACK NOTEBOOK next to the CD's off a shelf,
          pretends he's a quarterback hiking a ball.
          Twenty-four, twenty-six, hut, hut,
          hut.
          He drops back to pass the NOTEBOOK.

                         CHUCK
          Go long, Bradzilla.
          MARK laughs as BRAD circles around RACHEL, twists between
          other dancers. CHUCK tosses the NOTEBOOK over RACHEL and
          BRAD leaps up to catch it.

                         BRAD
          Post-pattern, Mark!
          Ducking around DANCERS, MARK raises his hands for the pass.
          KIDS start to notice their antics and start laughing.
          BRAD passes the book over to MARK who catches it, mimes
          spiking it for a touchdown and does a silly victory dance.
          MONICA laughs and turns to RACHEL, who laughs, even though
          she still looks a bit befuddled.

                         MARK
          Rachel, catch!
          He throws the NOTEBOOK through the air, where it tumbles end
          over end for a few slow beats, then is caught by her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          BEHIND RACHEL --
           THE TV SET -- keeps playing football highlights, but suddenly
          there's an almost subliminal --
          FLASH of TWO INTERTWINED BODIES.
          RACHEL holds the NOTEBOOK, unsure of what to do with it. The
          boys are a little out of breath, but still grinning and
          dancing.

                         MARK
          Open it. Go 'head, read off the
          scores.

                         BRAD
          Start with Eric.

                         CHUCK
          Yeah, start with poor Eric.
          She opens the book, looks at the pages with a quizzical
          expression. She sees the Bulldog names across the top of the
          page with lists of girls beneath each one. Every girl has a
          number next to her with a total at the bottom.

                         MARK
          What's Eric's score?

                         RACHEL
          Twenty-two?
          RACHEL stops dancing as she spots LISA PARKER's name at the
          bottom of ERIC's column with the number four next to it.

                         MARK
          What's up, Rach? You know someone on
          that list?

                         RACHEL
          (under her breath)
          Lisa.

                         MARK
          Oh, yeah, Lisa, forgot about her.

                         CHUCK
          How many points was she?

                         BRAD
          Four. But maybe he shoulda lost
          those when she offed herself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         MARK
          Rach, look under Jesses's name, how
          many points you get?

                         MONICA

                         (CHEERLEADING)
          Two, four, six, eight--

                         AMY
          Who do we appreciate!
          RACHEL looks down JESSES's column sees-her name with thirty
          points next to it, then, above hers, sees TRACY with ten.

                         MARK
          No, more than that, remember, we
          thought Rach was a dyke. He got
          extra-points for the conversion.

                         BRAD
          points?
          Try thirty.
          RACHEL stares at the book, stunned, trying to make sense of
          it.

                         MONICA
          Look at her face, this is priceless.
          At the front door, JESSE walks in, TRACY behind him. He
          looks around, hasn't seen what's going on yet. ERIC
          intercepts him, turning JESSE away from the TV.

                         ERIC
          Hey, man, what did the scout say?
          Behind Rte...
          THE TV SET -- between shots of players grunting, tackling
          and smashing into each other, longer and longer segments
          appear of...

          A COUPLE MAKING LOVE --
          from the waist up, with thick scan lines that almost make it
          look surreal. It's obvious that the girl is RACHEL, and the
          boy is JESSE.
          DANCING KIDS notice what's on the TV and start to point and
          laugh at the set. RACHEL is completely unaware of what's
          going on behind her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         9

                         MARK
          See, we didn't think Jess could do i
          so he offered to get evidence, proof
          that he'd scored you.

                         MONICA
          Here comes Jesse's big play!

                         MARK
          Lookie, lookie, Rachel.
          RACHEL realizes people are watching something behind her,
          then laughing at her. She turns and sees...
          The IMAGES of her and JESSE on the TV.
          Her face goes slack with horror.

                         RACHEL
          Oh, God
          MARK leans in to RACHEL, who hasn't noticed JESSE.

                         MARK
          Jess was disappointed with the picture
          quality, but I told him it was better
          than Pam and Tommy Lee's tape.

                         CK
          Rach, was it good for you too?
          Sure looks like it, don't it?

                         MARK
          Why don't we ask Jesse?
          He turns and calls out.

                         MARK (CONT'D)
          Hey, Jesse! Over here!
          JESSE looks over and his eyes meet RACHEL's, but she just
          stares back, horrified. Then he sees the TV set behind her

                         JESSE
          What...
          JESSE pushes his way through the crowd, trying to get to
          RACHEL. TRACY throws an arm around him, kisses his neck.

                         TRACY
          He told me he was thinking of me
          when he fucked you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          Seeing MARK laughing, JESSE realizes what's going on.

                         JESSE
          Rachel...
          He tries to shrug off TRACY, but ERIC and CHUCK grab his arms
          and pull him back into the crowd.

                         JESSE
          Rachel!
          MARK pushes RACHEL towards BRAD.

                         MARK
          Rachel! Rachel!
          She tries to get away, but BRAD pushes her into MONICA who
          shoves her to AMY as they join in the chanting.
          Rachel!

                         MONICA
          Rachel!
          Rachel!
          Drowning out JESSE's cries.
          RACHEL's P.Q.V. -- spinning around. A NIGHTMARISH GALLERY of
          dancing, jostling torsos, TWISTED FACES and LAUGHING MOUTHS,
          smirking and pointing at her.

                         INTERCUT WITH:

                         FAST CLOSE-UPS
          of RACHEL and JESSE making love. The assault of music,
          chanting and images crescendo with...
          BRAD grabbing RACHEL's bare arm below her HEART-THORN TATTOO
          forcing her to face the TV screen.

                         BRAD
          Hey, is that a zit on your ass?
          RACHEL has tears streaming down her face for the first time
          since she was four years old.
          She bows her head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          A LAUGHING BRAD
          glances down at RACHEL's arm.
          The THORN VINE around the HEART TATTOO looks bigger, edging
          up her arm.
          He looks away, shares a laugh with MARK, looks back and...

          THE HEART TATTOO
          on RACHEL's upper arm is growing, etched from within, the
          thorn covered vine snaking like a tendril up her arm.

                         BRAD
          Holy shit.
          He releases her.
          RACHEL raises her head, eyes glowing with pain and rage, her
          broken heart turned to stone.,
          The delicate THORN VINE has grown across her chin, cheekbone
          and forehead, swirling around to end on her other cheek.
          A stunned BRAD backs away from her.
          JESSE breaks free of ERIC's grip, slugs CHUCK and pushes his
          way towards RACHEL.
          Her HEART POUNDS at an alarming rate as she slowly turns and
          sees JESSE coming at her, his arms out to take her in his
          embrace.

                         A KNIFE
          on the bar dances and rattles, then...
          A WHIP PAN finds...
          JESSE, as his back arches in pain and he screams. The KNIFE
          embedded in his open palm, nailing his hand to the wall.
          MARK and the other boys stare in shock.

                         MARK
          What the fuck?
          ON JESSE -- as he screams again.
          A CORKSCREW has pierced his other hand, at waist level. The
          SCREW spins around, burrowing into his flesh.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          Everyone on that side of the room stops dead, taking in the
          bizarre sight.
          RACHEL straightens up and...
          The kitchen door CLOSES...
          The glass doors to the back yard slide SHUT...
          The front door SLAMS.

                         TRACY

                         (LOOKING AROUND)
          What's going on Mark?
          I dunno.
          The floor starts to shake like a small earthquake. All the
          PARTYGOERS go still, looking around at each other. The room
          is frozen, even though the music keeps pounding.
          MARK looks at RACHEL, her disheveled hair partially obscures
          her features, but her eyes are glowing.

          THE GLASS WINDOWS
          surrounding the room, begin to RATTLE, then CRACK in a spider-
          web pattern. Then...
          THE WINDOWS BURST inward.
          FOLLOW the deadly hail of shards as they cut through the

          CROWD.
          FROM ABOVE -- The outer edge of the CROWD are mowed down as
          if by a machine gun and...
          A WHIP PAN -- Finds a BOY impaled by a large, jagged shard.

                         TWISTED SHADOWS
          are splayed across a wall of KIDS falling to the ground. The
          hard-edged music keeps playing while...
          CHUCK's decapitated head rolls across the floor and onto...
          A plate.
          The BEEFY BOY spins around, clutcning at a shard protruding
          from his neck, his carotid artery spewing blood like a lawn
          sprinkler.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.
          On a GIRL as his blood sprays across her face and...
          The BOY turns, arcing blood across...
          The Jackson Pollock PAINTING, which blends into the multi-
          colored canvas.
          Reeling into the stereo, the BOY scatters CDs everywhere.
          On RACHEL, clothes spattered red, tears streaming down her
          cheeks.
          TRACY straightens up, having been protected by MONICA, who`s
          screaming, her face a lacerated pulp with glass, shards
          sticking out of it like a pincushion.
          Surviving PARTYGOERS panic as they struggle to their feet and
          try to flee, stampeding over each other.
          , TRACY, ERIC and BRAD shove their way through the crowd.

          EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          As SUE and BAR.BA k leap from the Volvo.. SUE hears the
          screams from within the house, takes in the shattered
          windows.

                         SUE BARBARA
          Oh, not Rachel!
          They race to the door as...

          WITHIN THE HOUSE
          BRAD runs to the front door.
          An IRON FIREPLACE POKER lifts up one end, then flies like a
          javelin towards BRAD's back as...

          DOOR - N
          BARBARA and SUE approach the door when the end of the
          bursts from the center of it, nearly spearing a surprised
          BARBARA in the face as it sticks out about a foot.
          She jerks back, then pushes the door open with an effort.

          WITHIN THE HOUSE --
          They enter and freeze as the door slams shut behind them,
          revealing a dead BRAD speared through the throat, pinned to
          the door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.
          Oai, my god. Where's Rachel?
          They see JESSE, then RACHEL covered in tattoos.
          A panicked itMY smashes into BARBARA, then runs toward a
          window.
          RACHEL sees AMY and her eyes narrow...
          MUSIC CDs fly off a shelf and...
          Spin through the air at high velocity.
          One of the deadly frisbees buries itself in AMY's back,
          spinning her around. More CDs embed in her stomach, chest
          and throat.
          MARK and ERIC smash their way through the chaos as MARK's
          eyes flash from a collapsing AMY to RACHEL

                         MARK
          God, it'ls her! She's doing it!
          SUE moves towards RACHEL.

                         SUE
          Stop! Stop it!
          RACHEL has her gaze locked on...
          MARK, who realizes he's a dead man. He moves toward a
          shattered window, through which some PEOPLE escape.
          But RACHEL turns her head slightly and...
          A TELEKINETIC PULSE travels across the row of LIQUOR BOTTLES
          at the bar, exploding them one-by-one, spraying alcohol which
          douses SUE.
          A FLAMING LOG erupts from the fireplace...
          Striking the alcohol-drenched BAR, setting a blazing trail
          and lighting the curtains on fire, creating a wall of FLAMES
          before the windows.

                         SUE
          Stop it! You don't want to--
           And RACHEL snaps her head around, launching another LOG from
           the fireplace which strikes SUE in the back, whose alcohol
          drenched clothes catch flames... and she , A.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          A screaming SUE pitches forward, rolls on the floor to put
          out the flames, but caly succeeds in lighting another trail
          of liquor which creates a barrier to the backyard windows.
          In the eye of the storm is BARBARA, shaking her head in
          denial, muttering, as her mental state rapidly deteriorates.

                         BARBARA
          No, this isn't happening. It isn't
          happening, isn't happening...
          MARK pulls ERIC by the shirt collar and they careen down...

                         A HALLWAY
          where each of the DOORS ahead of them SLAM SHUT as they
          approach.
          Utter CHAOS, but RACHEL calmly turns into the hallway,
          following MARK, as if in a trance.

                         I

                         MARK
          lowers his shoulder, crashes through a closing door into.

                         A DEN
          where the walls are decorated with deer heads and hunting
          trophies. MARK and ERIC are smashing a standing glass case
          containing pistols and rifles.
          TRACY leans panting against the wall.
          MARK slips a HANDGUN into his belt.

                         TRACY
          Screw that, get the shotguns!
          Shaking, freaked out, they gather weapons.

                         THE HALL
          d ERIC see RACHEL the end of the hall, silhouetted
          from behind. They take off in the other direction, TRACY
          bringing up the re
          Barrelling shoulders first into a door, the boys burst
          through and into...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

          EXTâ¢ THE BACK YARD - NIGHT
          Where they almost stumble into the swimming pool.
          Toting their rifles, MARK, ERIC and TRACY turn to find
          RACHEL, at a gunfighter's distance, coming towards them.
          TRACY and BRAD cock their weapons and bring them to their
          shoulders. TRACY slips on her glasses.

                         MARK
          Wait till she's closer.
          TRACY tightens her finger on the trigger.
          RACHEL's eyes narrow and...
          TRACY's glasses shatter into her eyes, spewing blood
          milky fluid.
          Aaaaa...
          She staggers, fires her shotgun into ERIC's groin and he
          lands sitting next to the pool. A dying ERIC stares at his
          shredded lap, then falls over.
          MARK looks at his dead friend.
          Oh, shit.
          .recovers, and swings his aim back at RACHEL. But his
          rifle goes sailing over his head and into the grass twenty
          feet behind him.
          He makes eye-contact with a grim RACHEL advancing toward him,
          and hauls ass.
          RACHEL glances at a coiled GARDEN HOSE and it springs to
          life, slithering through the grass and across the concrete at
          high speed to wrap around MARK's ankle and trip him up.
          He hits the ground hard and rolls over to find the hose
          twisting around his legs and up his waist like a python.

                         HIS HAND
          grasps for the rifle, but falls short as the hose pins his
          other arm to his side, then curls around his windpipe in a
          stranglehold.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          His eyes widen as the life is squeezed from him and he sees
          RACHEL standing over him.
          He gropes for the shotgun again... and finally grabs it.
          RACHEL looks at the rifle and it flies from his hold,
          splashing into the pool.
          But she jolts on two...

                         GUNSHOTS
          RACHEL looks down. MARK had pulled the handgun from his belt
          with his pinned hand and fired.
          She's holding her belly, gutshot, staggers and falls into the
          pool, disappearing amid a swirl of blood.
          MARK yanks the hose from his neck as it goes slack. He
          gasps, points the gun into the pool and FIRES until it's
          silent and he's left pulling the trigger on empty chambers.
          He gets his breatking under control, leans over to look into
          the water of the deep end. He Aar on the sound of a
          mechanical whirring, and turns.
          A POOL COVER starts to unfold.
          At that moment...

          RACHEL'S BLOODY ARM
          bursts from the water and grips his neck. MARK grabs her
          forearm as her other arm yanks him into the pool.

                         UNDERWATER --
          As RACHEL drags MARK down, he kicks and pummels her, but she
          holds on. The POOL COVER steadily closes over them, shutting
          out the light from above.
          MARK finally frees himself and lunges for the surface, but
          the POOL COVER blocks his escape.
          He desperately pushes at it, eyes bulging, lungs burning, as
          his feet kick to keep him afloat.

          ON THE SURFACE --
          The POOL COYER closing as RACHEI, hauls herself from the
          water, barely making it out. MARK'S HAND, grabs her leg,
          slides, then clutches at the edge of the pool. His fingers
          slip under as the cover completely shuts.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          M RX's head bulges the POOL COVER, then his hands punch
          feebly at it a few times. Then... nothing.

          BARBARA (O.S.)
          Rachel!
          A weakened RACHEL lays by the pool. She seems to be snapping
          out of her trance as she rolls over and sees BARBARA.
          RACHEL shudders and suddenly just looks like a wet, scared
          little girl reaching for her mother.

                         RACHEL
          Mama. Maury?
          BARBARA'S P.O.V. o
          but it's a FOUR-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, pristine, without tattoos.
          BARBARA blinks and her P.O.V. is of a TEN-YEAR-OLD RACHEL,
          reaching for her.
          Mama, please.
          BARBARA blinks and it's now...
          The 17-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, covered in blood and tattoos.
          She looks her daughter in the eyes, backs away in terror.

                         BARBARA
          What are you? You're not my little
          girl. No. The devil's in you.

                         RACHEL

                         (CRYING)
          Don't leave me, mama.
          But her mother disappears into the shadows.

                         RACHEL
          Please, I don't have... anyone.
          She rolls onto her back, looks up at the STARRY NIGHT.

                         RACHEL
          Please, God, let me die...
          And she tightly shuts her eyes.

          DISSOLVE BACK TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

          THE LIVING ROOM
          A vision of hell -- crimson-stained walls and piled bodies.
          The fire is spreading, licking its way across the burning
          SCOREBOARD NOTEBOOK, and along the floor toward...
          JESSE, in pain, still pinned to the wall. He raises his head
          and starts in fear as...
          o the center of the room, facing him.
          He sees the gunshot wounds in her stomach, then follows her
          gaze to...

          THE TV SET
          with a cracked screen, but still playing the tape of their
          intimate moment at the cabin, with a sleeping RACHEL laying

                         ON JESS
          He looks back at her.

                         JESSE
          Rachel, listen. I swear, d
          know they were taping us. d
          never hurt you.
          She looks at his pleading eyes.

                         JESSE

                         I LOVE--
          The TV SET now has the video footage of...

          INT. THE CABIN - NIGHT

          JESSE looks at RACHEL clinging to him, asleep, peaceful. He
          gently runs his fingers across her brow.

                         JESSE

                         (SOFTLY)
          I love you .
          And oulls her closer.

          HACK TO -- -
          RACHEL staring at the TV. And the VCR rewinds and replays..
          ON TV -- the moment of JESSE saying 'I love you" to her while
          she was asleep.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.
          RACHEL falls to her knees, tears running down her face. She
          turns back to JESSE, amazed.
          A BLAZING CHUNK of ceiling falls near her.

                         JESSE

                         (COUGHS)
          Rachel. Gat out, now. Go.
          And the KNIFE and the CORKSCREW drop away, releasing him.
          He falls to the floor, drags himself over... and takes RACHEL
          in his arms. He cradles her. She whispers and he bends over
          to hear. She whispers again...

                         RACHEL
          .love you.
          JESSE tenderly kisses her lips.
          And all the TATTOOS fade from her face and body
          Love.
          Her face is serene.
          JESSE traces his fingers across her brow, embraces her, the
          flames start to encircle them, just like in RACHEL's
          nightmare.
          JESSE pulls RACHEL over the debris ridden floor toward the
          back windows, but stumbles and goes down. Her eyes flutter
          open.

                         RACHEL
          Leave. Get out
          Instead of leaving her, JESSE hugs RACHEL closer. The sleeve
          of his jacket catches flames. And he accepts his fate.
          RACHEL shuts her eyes, gives one last TELEKINETIC PUSH...

          EXT. THE BACKYARD - NIGHT

          And a BODY is flung out the back window like a rag doll,
          clothes in flames.
          The BODY goes fifteen feet and falls onto the pool cover, its
          weight bowing the cover enough for water to rush over it.

                         BACK T0:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

          INTâ¢ THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          RACHEL on her back, looking up, eyes open, a slight smile on
          her lips.

          SHE SEES --
          The BURNING CEILING collapse, raining death on her.

          EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

          .is now a burning inferno. A funeral pyre.

          BACK YARD - THE POOL
          At water level. All is quiet, there's only the sounds of the
          crackling fire and faraway sirens of firetrucks. Suddenly --
          JESSE HURTS up on the --

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. THE HILL - NIGHT

          From miles away -- the LIGHT given off by the BURNING HOUSE
          rises over the treeline.

                         CLOSE ON
          A dejected ARNIE and the two uncool BOYS who couldn't get
          into the party, leaning against a van, staring in amazement.

                         ARNIE
          Man, we are missing one killer party.

          FADE TO BLACK:

          EXT. NOTRE DAM UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

          A CHURCH TOWER with a BELL overlooks the student dorm
          buildings. The darkened campus is tranquil, still.

          INT. HALLWAY, STUDENT DORM BUILDING - NIGHT

          MOVING down a. dormitory hall. The room doors feature rock
          posters and "Fighting Irish" stickers and pennants.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          JESSE is slumped over, asleep on a desk layered in textbooks
          and a notebook. An all-night study session.
          His hair is shor., he's wearing a beard. His face is more
          mature, sadder. The beard largely hides some burn scars on
          one side of his face.
          Over the desk is a MIRROR and a "Fighting Irish" pennant.
          The only light comes from his desk lamp.
          He jerks awake with a spasm, glances at a digital clock
          glowing on his desk: 11:S$ A.M.

                         JESSE
          (rubs his eyes)
          Jesus.
          WALTER, Rachel's dog, hops on his lap, licks at.his face.
          The sad-eyed DOG whimpers'and,JESSE scratches him.
          In the distance the CLOCK TOWER BELL can be heard CHIMING
          MIDNIGHT: One, two...
          As JESSE looks down and his eyes widen in surprise:
          Somehow, he's scrawled on the notebook paper on the desk in
          front of him:
          kINg of HELL
          Or, if you only look at the capitalized letters, it reads:
          Around it, the same phrase is written over and over again:
          kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL
          kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL
          kINg of HELL kINg of HELL
          JESSE lowers the dog
          How did...
          Trails off as he stares at the page.
          The CLOCK BELL in the background is still CHIMING: give, six,
          seven and...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.
          T h e F R E N C H DOORS fly o behind JESSE. ns.
          It's the wind. The DOG starts barkin

                         JESSE
          (shushes the dog)
          Ssshhhh. Relax, boy.
          He takes a-deep breath, flips the page on the notebook,
          resumes his cram session.
          On the floor, the DOG looks at the open French doors, then
          scurries under the bed.
          JESSE is writing, in the MIRROR above h
          A WOMAN' s FIGURE
          anding in the French doors, her face hidden
          up, sees the WOMAN reflected, spins to watch
          her stop forward into the light.
          It's RACHEL, in hAk slip dress.

                         JESSE

                         (STUNNED)
          Rachel?
          RACHEL smiles. She lifts her arms to him.

                         JESSE
          (with growing joy)
          Rachel.
          He rises, envelops her in his arms, and kisses her.
          He pulls back to take her in.
          T!!s two of thaw are reflected in ANOTHER MIRROR behind the
          r 's door.
          opens her mouth to speak --

          A LARGE SNAKE
          FLIES out and jams itself into JESSE's mouth, throwing him
          back.
          Ho aacs. clutching at the SNAKE as it slithers down his
          throat, and qmIS'3i$ into the desk and mirror, shattering it
          on the --

          SLAM CUT TO

                         

                         

                         

                         
          INT . DORM ROOM, NOTRE DAME - NIGH a'
          A LOUD SCREAM as JESSE jerks awake at his desk. His heart
          FATIM like it's about to explode from his mouth.
          He looks down at the paper in front of him. Filled only with
          his study notes.
          The dog, WALTER, is awake on the bed, blinking, having been
          stirred by the scream.

                         JOS
          He recovers, runs his hands through his hair. Starts
          reading.
          The DIGITAL CLOCK reads: 11:59 A.M.
          In the distance, the CLOCK BELL begins'chiming midnight: One,
          three...
          JESSE reads, but in his ayes he's waiting for the savant
          chime.
          The BELL CHIMES: Four
          The FRENCH DOORSNinat
          JESSE spins. The wind. Nobody there.
          He turns back to his reading, his heart BEATING WILDLY again.
          Glances up at the mirror. Nothing.
          His HEARTBEATS and the BELL CHIMES get increasingly LQ=
          as,.. .
          He reads, glances up at the mirror, shivers, and it isn't
          in the cold.

          Move, to ANOTHER ANGLE :
          Where his image is MULTIPLIED TO INFINITY in the two mirror!
          Fear is written on his face.
          And we know he'll be looking over his shoulder...
          Until the day he dies.

                         SLOW FADE
THEY
 
 
 
 
 


 
 THEY
  
 FADE IN:
 INT. BEDROOM - DAY Tiny golden wheels and gears turning lazily upon metal rods. Mechanical pieces. Small and intricate. Glittering in the sunlight.
 REVEAL
 The gears are turning within an ANTIQUE DESK CLOCK sitting on a book shelf, a small pendulum swinging back and forth behind the glass housing.
 The room is barren except for a pair of open suitcases and a bed that's been stripped. Sitting on the mattress is ...
 JULIA LEVIN ... Smart and clever. Dressed in a graduation gown and staring out the window. She seems to be lost in thought, immobile, until the bedroom door swings open and ...
 CONNOR LEVIN, aged seventeen and wearing a suit and tie, steps inside.
 CONNOR
 Dad says we gotta get moving. We're late.
 JULIA
 I'm getting ready.
 CONNOR
 You're sitting on the bed.
 JULIA
 (dryly)
 Thanks for clearing that up. I'll be right down.
 He steps out.
 Julia takes a framed picture out of her suitcase -- a candid shot of herself standing with her MOTHER, forties, a healthy and vibrant woman.
 JULIA (cont'd)
 Sure do miss you.
 Above her, a CEILING FAN rotates. Creating a soft HUMMING.
 EXT. WESTWOOD - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY Julia walks out of the building where her father, GUY LEVIN, an older man with a kind face, waits. Connor is checking his reflection in the car window, adjusting his tie, fussing with his hair.
 GUY
 You ready?
 JULIA
 All set. I packed up everything.
 (remembering)
 Oh, except Mom's clock -- I think there's something wrong with it. It's not telling the right time.
 GUY
 I'll get it fixed. Probably just needs a few new parts.
 Guy smiles at Julia for a moment. Very warmly.
 GUY (cont'd)
 You look just like your mother.
 Julia is momentarily uncomfortable. But she recovers, smiles and kisses her father on the cheek.
 JULIA
 We'll be late.
 EXT. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES - CAMPUS - DAY Students dressed in graduation caps and gowns are gathered on the campus grounds.
 Julia stands by herself, taking pictures with a professional Nikon camera. She focuses the camera upon ...
 TERRY ALBA, 22, beautiful and sexy. Very particular and demanding. She smiles perfectly as Julia snaps the picture. But her boyfriend, SAM BURNSIDE, cute and mischievous, sporting pink hair and loud clothes, makes a face.
 Winding her film, Julia searches a moment, then smiles. Raising her camera lens, she snaps a picture of ...
 PAUL LOOMIS ... Early twenties. Dark hair. Strapping and perfectly handsome. He wears a blue and gold striped tie with his starched white shirt and graduation gown.
 He kisses her. Passionate and gentle.
 PAUL
 You packed up?
 JULIA
 Ready to move in. I'll be storing some of the stuff you've already got. Television. CD player. Microwave.
 PAUL
 (suggestively)
 Bed.
 Julia smiles at him.
 JULIA
 Bed.
 PAUL
 Med School doesn't start until August. At least not for the freshmen, so we've got plenty of time to see Europe, take the car trip up north ...
 JULIA
 I hope it won't be a drag. There's a lot of stuff to move out of my mother's cabin.
 PAUL
 Our friends will be there. It'll be fun.
 JULIA
 I hope so.
 Beat.
 PAUL
 You okay?
 JULIA
 Tense.
 PAUL
 Would it help if I massaged your breasts?
 JULIA
 No.
 PAUL
 Because it would help me.
 JULIA
 (stifling laughter)
 Maybe later.
 The students start forming into lines.
 JULIA (cont'd)
 Hey, I saw your Mom and kid sister. Where's your Dad?
 Beat.
 PAUL
 He's not coming.
 JULIA
 But it's your graduation.
 Paul shrugs again. A brief sting of hurt on his face.
 PAUL
 Wasn't a good enough reason in High School either.
 Paul looks away. Julia knows how painful this is and won't insult him by trying to diminish it.
 Julia smiles and runs her finger across his tie knot.
 JULIA
 I like your tie. UCLA colors.
 PAUL
 School spirit. I am a Bruin.
 The lines start moving towards the stadium. Hundreds of CHEERS rise up from the graduating students.
 As she walks, a sound draws Julia's attention. Standing on the lawn is a SMALL BOY, no more than four years-old, SOBBING and clinging to his mother's legs.
 Julia stops walking as she gazes at the child. The line comes to a halt behind her.
 PAUL (cont'd)
 Julia. We can't graduate unless you move.
 JULIA
 Sorry.
 She stalks walking again. Paul puts his arms around her.
 EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY A big, traditional house nestled in the hills. PARENTS and graduating STUDENTS exchange polite conversation in the yard.
 EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - DAY Sitting between a pair of open french doors is "the gang" consisting of Julia and Paul and Terry and Sam. They throw around conversation, ignoring the party.
 TERRY
 It's secluded? Nobody said anything to me about the cabin being secluded.
 JULIA
 I said it was a cabin in the woods. I thought seclusion was a given.
 TERRY
 I'm no good out in the woods. You know what lives in the woods? Animals that sting. Animals that bite.
 PAUL
 So avoid the animals.
 JULIA
 I really appreciate you guys helping me. I couldn't move everything alone.
 SAM
 Hey, it's our last chance to be together. Terry and I are excited.
 (turns)
 Aren't we, Ter?
 She's not excited.
 TERRY
 Can I bring my cotton bedsheets to the cabin? If I try to sleep in anything but cotton, I get hives.
 JULIA
 Whatever makes you happy.
 Sam grabs a large drawing pad from the steps. He opens it.
 SAM
 Speaking of which, I've got your graduation gift. As specified.
 JULIA
 Let's see.
 Sam holds up a sketch of Clark Kent changing to Superman.
 SAM
 Like it?
 JULIA
 It's great. Thanks Sam.
 Paul checks out the drawing. His nose crinkles.
 PAUL
 Superman? Why'd you want a drawing of Superman? 
 JULIA
 He's very attractive.
 PAUL
 (staring)
 You're kidding.
 JULIA
 No.
 PAUL
 He's not even real.
 JULIA
 I think most women tend to wonder if Superman is super in every way.
 TERRY
 I don't.
 PAUL
 You see. There goes your argument.
 TERRY
 (thoughtfully)
 But Spiderman has a nice ass.
 Off everyone's LOOK -- TERRY (cont'd)
 What?
 INT. SAM'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY Julia finishes washing her hands. Dries them. Grabbing her camera and the drawing, Julia opens the bathroom door ...
 INT. SAM'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ... and freezes. Standing within an open bedroom is ...
 A BLOND STUDENT. Another college graduate. Tan and attractive. Dressed exactly like Paul -- identical white shirt, gold and blue striped tie. He pulls off his tie and unbuttons his shirt.
 Julia doesn't move.
 The student peels off his shirt. Her eyes are drawn to a Superman "S" insignia tattooed on his shoulder.
 The student catches sight of Julia in the hallway. Her face turns bright red immediately. She starts to laugh.
 He smiles at her. A bit flattered. Flirting.
 STUDENT
 Changing into something more formal.
 He holds up a pair of ripped jeans.
 Julia backs down the hallway. Still laughing. Embarrassed.
 JULIA
 I'm sorry. I was just using the ...
 (laughs)
 Really. I'm sorry.
 STUDENT
 I'll forgive you this once.
 She quickly leaves.
 The blond student watches her go. A grin on his face.
 EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY Julia walks out the back door. Stifling her laughter.
 Paul is talking with Guy on the lawn. Julia SNAPS a picture of them together, winds her film, and notices ...
 A LITTLE GIRL ... Sweet and innocent. Sitting on a bench. Motionless.
 Julia walks towards her. The little girl is staring across the lawn at a pool shed. Transfixed. A group of children are playing on the grass in front of it.
 The girl becomes aware of Julia's presence and turns around.
 JULIA
 Hi.
 GIRL
 (quiet)
 Hi.
 Silence.
 JULIA
 You sitting here all by yourself?
 The girl slowly nods "Yes."
 JULIA (cont'd)
 Don't you want to play with the other kids?
 The girls shakes her head "No."
 JULIA (cont'd)
 Want me to leave you alone?
 The girl shakes her head "No."
 More silence.
 JULIA (cont'd)
 Want to mix this up and ask me something?
 The little girl notices the camera.
 GIRL
 Are you taking pictures for Sam's family?
 JULIA
 No, I'm just ... (then)
 I'm a friend of Sam's. But I'm also a photographer. I take pictures.
 Beat.
 GIRL
 Will you take a picture of me?
 JULIA
 Why?
 GIRL
 So you won't forget me.
 JULIA
 (surprised)
 Why would I forget you?
 GIRL
 Because they're coming for me.
 A long beat. Julia sits next to her.
 JULIA
 Who is?
 GIRL
 The monsters.
 JULIA
 What monsters?
 GIRL
 There. Behind the door.
 The girl points towards the pool shed. The rusted door of the shed is slightly open. Just a crack.
 JULIA
 Those other kids don't look too scared.
 GIRL
 They should be.
 Beat.
 JULIA
 (playing along)
 So how come only you can see them?
 THE GIRL LEANS FORWARD AND SPEAKS IN A HUSHED WHISPER. GIRL
 Because I know they're real. I used to have a little brother, but they came and got him. Now my parents say I never had a brother before.
 (pause)
 Soon ... my parents won't remember me either.
 Something about the girl's tone of voice is unnerving. As if she's resigned herself to this.
 A slight wind HISSES through the trees. The girl rises.
 GIRL (cont'd)
 I gotta go. They know I'm talking about them.
 JULIA
 Wait a second.
 Julia SNAPS a picture of the girl.
 JULIA (cont'd)
 Feel better?
 The girl stares at her.
 GIRL
 Are you scared of monsters?
 JULIA
 No.
 Beat.
 GIRL
 I am.
 The girl turns and runs across the lawn.
 Julia is left sitting on the bench. She glances over at the pool shed again. Raises her camera and focuses on the door which is still cracked open.
 She snaps the picture.
 CLICK!
 INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Julia and Paul are romantically entangled as they enter the apartment. A little drunk. Kissing and frolicking. She strips off his jacket and tie. Paul abruptly stops.
 PAUL
 Wait a minute ... (grabbing both sides of his shirt)
 This is a job for ...
 Paul rips his shirt wide open. Buttons popping everywhere. They both start laughing. Joining together, he guides her towards the bathroom.
 The wind gently HISSES on the balcony. Windchimes spinning.
 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT A cloud of hot steam. The soothing rush of warm water running over tanned and naked skin.
 Julia stands underneath the shower, her body relaxing into Paul's chest, his muscular arms encircling her body, his lips buried in her neck and shoulders. Her eyes are shut. Her expression is calm.
 INTERCUT - BLOND STUDENT Standing in the guest bedroom at Sam's house. Young and muscular. Bathed in sunlight. The tattoo on his shoulder.
 BACK TO JULIA Her eyes still pressed closed. Smiling a little.
 Water continues rushing from the shower head, creating a HISS that eventually becomes THE ROAR OF THE OCEAN. DISSOLVE TO:
 EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DUSK The setting sun blushes crimson across the rolling waves of the Pacific. Streaking along the highway is a RANGE ROVER, packed with luggage, headlights on.
 INT. RANGE ROVER - DUSK Paul sits behind the wheel. He's bopping and RAPPING with Sam to HIP-HOP that BLARES from the speakers. Very energized.
 Julia sits on the passenger side, leaning against the window, trying to shut out the music. Terry looks just as miserable. Finally, Julia turns off the radio.
 A silent beat. The guys catch their girlfriends' expressions.
 PAUL
 Sorry.
 SAM
 (overlapping)
 Sorry.
 Terry leans forward between the seats.
 TERRY
 So the cabin has electricity, right? And plumbing? Everything we need?
 JULIA
 Uh-huh.
 TERRY
 So it has everything.
 JULIA
 It has everything.
 SAM
 Wait a minute. I hear a shoe about to drop.
 JULIA
 Except a phone.
 SAM
 BAM! There it is.
 TERRY
 (scandalized)
 I need a phone. It's like family to me. Mom, Dad, my brother .... phone.
 JULIA
 So you're roughing it.
 TERRY
 The last time I tried to rough it, I was in therapy for a year. Why didn't your mother have a phone?
 JULIA
 I guess she wanted to be left alone.
 At least until she got sick.
 Paul looks to her.
 PAUL
 This won't be too hard on you, will it?
 Staying at her place?
 JULIA
 It's okay. I'm enjoying this.
 Julia smiles at him. Paul smiles back.
 PAUL
 Good.
 He switches the radio back on and continues RAPPING with Sam. Julia and Terry both stare straight ahead, ears pounding. This is turning into a LONG trip.
 EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT Paul's Range Rover makes its way down a long, winding road. The Rover's headlights illuminate the woods lining the road on both sides.
 INT. RANGE ROVER - NIGHT The inside of the Range Rover is dark. Only the faint glow from the dashboard lights provides any ambient illumination. Sam and Terry are snuggled together in the back seat. Everything is quiet.
 Julia is thinking. Finally, she breaks the silence.
 JULIA
 Do you believe in monsters?
 A beat. Everyone else in the car trades looks.
 PAUL
 We've been in the car too long.
 JULIA
 I'm just asking.
 PAUL
 Like what? The Boogeyman?
 JULIA
 The Boogeyman. The thing under the bed. The monster hiding in the closet.
 TERRY
 What made you think of that?
 JULIA
 A little girl at Sam's house. She was convinced there was a monster trying to get her.
 PAUL
 You're saying you believe her?
 Julia is suddenly on the spot. She backtracks.
 JULIA
 Of course I don't. There are no monsters. Not really.
 SAM
 Sure there are. Ted Bundy. Son of Sam.
 Ed Gein.
 TERRY
 Who was Ed Gein?
 SAM
 He was a mass murderer. This old hermit who'd kill people and take the parts he wanted. Heads. Livers. Intestines. Sex organs.
 TERRY
 Why did he use the parts for?
 SAM
 Everything. The police found a skull that was used for a soup bowl. Faces were stuffed and mounted like hunting trophies on the wall. Bones were used for furniture.
 PAUL
 He also wore their skin. Like clothes.
 Terry recoils into her seat. Grossed out.
 TERRY
 Sorry I asked.
 SAM
 You wanted proof. There it is.
 JULIA
 But it's not like he's a monster under the bed.
 SAM
 So?
 JULIA
 So why are kids afraid of that? 
 SAM
 Because they live in a completely different world than we do.
 (then)
 Think about it. Why do kids pick up on things that we can't? ... Bumps in the night? ... footsteps in the hallway? ... A thumping inside their closet?
 PAUL
 Overactive imagination.
 SAM
 Wrong. Perfect awareness.
 (beat)
 Kids have a perfect awareness of everything around them. Every sound. Every shadow.
 Everything gets quiet.
 SAM (cont'd)
 The Boogeyman could be real. So could monsters. Just because you've never seen them doesn't mean they aren't there.
 Silence. The car engine purrs softly. This is starting to make sense. And it's spooky.
 PAUL
 All right. I'm creeped out. But my bullshit alarm is going off.
 SAM
 You just can't handle it.
 PAUL
 Right. Because it's bullshit.
 JULIA
 Serial killers aside, my take on this subject is very simple. If I don't have a picture of it -- it's not real.
 TERRY
 Okay, is this conversation like a radio station? Can we just change the channel? Because personally, I'd like to get to sleep tonight.
 Terry has just finished saying these words, when --
 AN ANIMAL runs out of the woods into the middle of the road. A black shape in the headlights. Eyes flashing in the dark.
 PAUL
 JESUS CHRIST! Paul SLAMS on the brakes. Too late.
 WHAM! The RANGE ROVER SMASHES into it, throwing the shape into a ditch at the side of the road.
 The Range Rover swerves and comes to a SQUEALING HALT.
 INSIDE THE ROVER Everyone catches their breath. A moment of dead silence.
 PAUL (cont'd)
 Everyone okay?
 TERRY
 (nods)
 We're fine.
 JULIA
 What was that?
 PAUL
 I think it was a dog.
 Julia unlocks her door.
 JULIA
 We'd better check the car.
 She steps out of the Rover. The others follow.
 EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT The hazard lights are switched on. Paul walks around to the front of the Rover.
 The bumper is dented.
 PAUL
 Look at that. There's a couple thousand dollars out of my wallet.
 TERRY
 You can probably get someone to pop it back.
 PAUL
 Sure. For a couple hundred dollars.
 Sam looks down the road. He can barely make out a large form resting lifeless in the ditch.
 He starts walking towards it.
 JULIA
 I'm sorry about your car, Paul ...
 PAUL
 (begrudging)
 Yeah, well. Shit happens.
 The conversation becomes distant as Sam walks slowly up the road, moving past the yellow flashing HAZARD LIGHTS which CLICK rhythmically ... click, click, click ... Sam approaches the ditch. Darkness is all around.
 .... click ... click ... click ...
 He kneels down alongside the body of the animal. Very little is visible of the corpse except for its dark, mangled form sprawled across the dirt.
 Sam picks up a stick and pokes at the body. Nothing happens.
 He pokes at the corpse again.
 The hind legs of the corpse suddenly twitch. A reflex action. Sam leaps back. The life nearly scared out of him.
 A flap of hairless skin slides away from one of the animal's hind legs. Sam leans forward to get a better look, becoming simultaneously repulsed and fascinated.
 SAM
 Hey guys!
 PAUL
 What?
 SAM
 Take a look at this.
 JULIA
 Is it a dog?
 Sam glances at the dead corpse and back to his friends again. He looks shaken.
 SAM
 I don't know.
 The rest of the group moves down the road. A weird unease has started to settle in.
 Paul and Julia kneel down in front of the corpse. It's almost unrecognizable. The darkness smothering the road keeps them from getting a handle on any of the body's features.
 PAUL
 It looks like a dog to me.
 SAM
 Did you see the leg?
 PAUL
 What about it?
 Sam takes the stick and gently pushes away the flap of torn skin for a better look. The group leans forward.
 A deep bleeding wound has been exposed. Through the torn flesh and blood pumping over charcoal skin, the group can see bones flashing into the moonlight. But intermingled with the animal's skeleton are ...
 PIECES OF METAL ... Glittering and clean. A series of connected stainless steel threads and pallid bone that have grown together.
 SAM
 Ever seen anything like that?
 PAUL
 No.
 SAM
 It looks like steel. Like someone put steel into its body.
 PAUL
 I don't think it was put in there. It looks like it grew that way.
 JULIA
 That's impossible. What kind of animal has steel in its skeleton?
 Terry steps forward tentatively.
 TERRY
 What are you looking at?
 JULIA
 Are you sure it's dead?
 PAUL
 Come on, honey. It's a dog. Not a zombie.
 SAM
 Julia? Where's your camera?
 JULIA
 It's in the car.
 PAUL
 I've got it.
 Paul races back to the Range Rover and opens the passenger door. He withdraws Julia's camera.
 Julia takes a step back into the middle of the road. The wind is sifting through the trees, creating a soft HISSING noise as the branches dance and twist in the shadows.
 Paul returns and hands the camera to Sam.
 SAM
 You want to turn it over?
 PAUL
 I'm not touching it.
 Sam kneels down. He points the camera and shoots.
 The camera flash cuts through the darkness and falls upon the corpse. But only for a millisecond of clarity.
 Twisted metal. Skin. Appendages. Madness.
 Both of the young men stand frozen, thunderstruck, staring down at the misshapen shape in front of them. A long period of amazed silence follows.
 SAM
 That's wrong. That's all wrong.
 Paul shakes his head.
 PAUL
 That's not a dog.
 TERRY
 (stunned)
 What were those things coming out of its back?
 Paul starts recoiling. His stomach is getting weak.
 PAUL
 That's not a dog.
 The cool summer wind WHISTLES through the trees around them.
 SAM
 (sickened)
 That doesn't even make sense.
 JULIA
 Paul ...
 Paul looks over at her.
 JULIA (cont'd)
 Let's get in the car.
 SAM
 We need some flashlights.
 TERRY
 (hushed)
 Screw the flashlights.
 SAM
 What the hell is it?
 PAUL
 Dude. We're outta here.
 Julia and Paul walk briskly to the Range Rover. Sam and Terry follow them, glancing back over their shoulders.
 SAM
 What the hell is it?!
 Paul tosses the camera into the Rover's back seat. He SLAMS the door shut. Julia opens the front passenger door.
 A soft THUMPING from the woods. Almost like footsteps.
 JULIA
 Get in the car.
 Julia hops into the front seat and SLAMS her door.
 INT. RANGE ROVER - NIGHT The atmosphere is quickly turning into panic. Paul jumps behind the wheel as both Sam and Terry close their doors.
 SAM
 I want to know what that thing was.
 Paul presses the automatic door lock. THUNK.
 JULIA
 Paul, start the car.
 PAUL
 Keys ...
 He searches his pockets. They're empty. He checks his jacket.
 SAM
 I want to know what it was.
 PAUL
 Will you shut up?
 Paul fishes out the car keys from his jacket pocket. He starts the ignition. The engine ROARS to life.
 JULIA
 Go.
 A heavy THUMP. Right outside the back window. Sam and Terry instinctively look towards the rear hatch.
 TERRY
 There's something behind the car.
 JULIA
 GO!
 Paul hits the gas.
 EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT The Range Rover disappears into the night.
 The calm and unnerving quiet of the woods are left behind. The wind WHISTLES softly.
 EXT. SANTA MIRA - FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT A fast food joint at the side of the road.
 INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT Everyone is sitting quietly at a table. Fast food leavings are littered across their plastic trays. Nobody is saying anything or looking at one another.
 Finally ...
 SAM
 I want to get the body.
 Everyone's face drops into shock. Paul almost laughs.
 PAUL
 You do that. We'll wait for your ass right here.
 Sam leans forward in his seat. Intense.
 SAM
 Nothing about that thing looked right. Absolutely nothing. There was metal in its skeleton.
 TERRY
 Maybe it wasn't metal. It might've just looked like metal.
 SAM
 There were fucking gears, for Chrissake.
 PAUL
 Fine. Go back out there. Do whatever the hell you want. But count me out. I'm done.
 JULIA
 We've already got a picture, Sam.
 SAM
 Let's get a few more then. I want to get a good look at that thing up close.
 TERRY
 (adamant)
 I'm not going back there.
 SAM
 Let Julia decide. It's her camera.
 The group stares at Julia. She remains silent.
 PAUL
 Your call.
 Julia stares back at all of them. A moment.
 A small CHILD begins CRYING and SCREAMING in the restaurant. Julia flinches at the unexpected sound, glancing over at the child's parents as they quiet him down.
 She rises from the table. 
 JULIA
 I have to use the bathroom.
 She walks straight into the bathroom.
 After she's gone ...
 TERRY
 I'm not going back there.
 INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - BATHROOM - NIGHT Large and poorly lit. Several closed bathroom stalls face a row of sinks and a huge mirror.
 A toilet FLUSHES. Julia leaves one of the stalls and pulls the door closed behind her. She moves to the mirror, washes her hands, and retrieves a brush from her purse.
 Water DRIPS from one of the leaky pipes in the bathroom while the fluorescent bulb over the mirror CRACKLES softly. Julia is about to brush her hair, but something unnerves her. She cocks her head slightly. A feeling.
 She turns around and checks out the bathroom. The doors to the stalls are all closed shut. Empty and quiet.
 She starts brushing her hair. A few moments pass. Then, she stops and listens to the water DRIPPING from the pipe. Julia turns back around and looks at the bathroom.
 One of the stall doors all the way at the end is now slightly open. Not much. Just enough to reveal a patch of darkness and gloom within.
 The sound of water dripping abruptly stops. Silence follows.
 Julia looks like she's about to crawl out of her skin. She quickly shoves her brush back into her purse and leaves.
 INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT Julia walks towards her friends as they collect themselves. Everyone is slow getting their stuff together.
 JULIA
 I want to leave.
 PAUL
 Hold up. We're coming.
 The CHILD starts CRYING again. Pointing at the bathroom.
 This disturbs Julia further.
 JULIA
 Paul?
 PAUL
 Okay. Slow down.
 The group leaves the table.
 EXT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS The group emerges from the restaurant. The parking lot is almost deserted. No people are in sight.
 Julia moves leisurely towards the Range Rover, just ahead of Terry and Sam -- but she'd walk a lot faster if Paul's arm weren't draped around her shoulder. She looks tight and nervous. Her eyes scanning the parking lot.
 The cars are empty. Sidewalk litter dances in the wind.
 Inside one of the parked cars, a featureless SHAPE is sitting behind the wheel. The shape turns and stares at them.
 Everyone piles into the Range Rover. Julia throws a nervous glance back at the SHAPE in the car.
 He's still watching them.
 Everyone piles into the car.
 INT. RANGE ROVER - CONTINUOUS Paul starts the engine and pulls out of the parking lot. Julia relaxes into her seat, relieved.
 EXT. SANTA MIRA - TOWN STREET - NIGHT The Range Rover heads off into the woods.
 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING A rustic home surrounded by huge pine trees and beach grass overlooking the ocean. There are no neighbors in sight. Paul's Range Rover is parked out front.
 INT. CABIN - BASEMENT - NIGHT The basement is saturated in a bright red light. Julia is developing a photograph within a small basin. Paul and Terry are seated on the stairs. Sam is pacing.
 SAM
 How much longer?
 JULIA
 Thirty seconds. It's coming out.
 SAM
 I still think we should get the body.
 We could drive out there, haul it into the car ...
 PAUL
 I'm not loading that thing into my car.
 I don't give a shit what it is. It's not coming back here.
 Julia lifts the developed picture out of the basin.
 JULIA
 Done.
 She switches on the light. The group crowds around her.
 SAM
 What is it? What does it look like?
 The photograph is blurred. The body is indistinguishable.
 JULIA
 Damn.
 SAM
 What happened to the picture?
 JULIA
 Out of focus.
 SAM
 What do you mean it's out of focus? I took the picture. The flash went off.
 JULIA
 Sam, this is a professional camera with a zoom lens. You can't just point and shoot.
 A quiet moment as they stare at the picture.
 PAUL
 Well, so much for that.
 Sam looks at the picture, then at his friends. With a look of somber frustration, Sam quietly turns and charges up the stairs, taking two at a time.
 After he's gone ... TERRY
 It's not a big deal. Whatever it was.
 (then)
 He'll get over it.
 EXT. SANTA MIRA COASTLINE - BEACH - DAY Cloudy and overcast. A set of colorless waves CRASH into the rocks. Sam and Julia and Terry walk just beyond the rippling surf, arguing with each other.
 SAM
 I can't get over it. That thing looked wrong. Completely wrong.
 JULIA
 Of course it looked wrong. Paul rammed it with his car.
 SAM
 What about the blood? It wasn't red ... it was black -- it was like ... oil coming from a busted engine.
 JULIA
 I must've missed that.
 SAM
 Let's find it. Cut it up. Study it.
 TERRY
 (measured)
 Sam, I realize that you're an extroverted comic book artist and I'm a neurotic. But it's only now at this moment that I'm wondering why we're dating.
 Sam turns back to Julia --
 SAM
 I'll pay you to take me back.
 JULIA
 You don't have to pay me. Take the car.
 SAM
 The Rover's a shift. I can only drive an automatic.
 JULIA
 Ask Paul.
 SAM
 He's out running. Besides, you heard him last night. He'd never do it.
 Julia stares at him.
 JULIA
 It's a dead animal. 
 SAM
 So come with me. You take the pictures this time. If it's just a dead animal, then you're right and I'm wrong. But if it's not, we've got a picture of it.
 JULIA
 A picture of what?
 Beat.
 SAM
 A monster.
 A set of foaming waves HISS as they slide along the sand.
 Julia stands with her arms folded. There's something really creepy about it which she doesn't want to admit.
 JULIA
 Monsters don't exist. 
 SAM
 What...?
 (pause)
 Sayin' yes ... or saying no?
 Julia stares at him, deadpan. Sam just stares right back.
 EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY The same lonely stretch of road from the night before.
 The Range Rover appears around a corner and pulls over to the side of the road. Julia opens her door, camera in hand, and gets out. Sam follows her lead.
 SAM
 This is it?
 JULIA
 I think so. You can see the way the road turns sharply to the left. The rest of the drive was straight.
 SAM
 You've got film, right?
 JULIA
 A new roll. You can have all the pictures you want.
 Julia and Sam start searching the ditch. Feet crunching in the dirt. Moving away from the car.
 A soft THUMP echoes from somewhere in the woods. A place just beyond the wall of pine branches and shrubbery that shivers in the breeze.
 Sam and Julia look around. They wait. Nothing. Nobody.
 SAM
 (slight grin)
 The Boogeyman lives here.
 JULIA
 So will you if you keep talking like that.
 They keep walking. A beat passes.
 SAM
 Julia? Can I ask you something?
 JULIA
 Go ahead.
 SAM
 Last night on the road, after I took the picture and we started walking to Paul's car, did you have the same feeling?
 JULIA
 What feeling?
 SAM
 That we were being chased.
 Julia doesn't say anything.
 She stops cold in her tracks. Just ahead of her, resting motionless in the ditch, is ...
 A BODY ...
 Swathed in dark fur, twisted at a pathetic angle, huge gashes in its side. The corpse of a Doberman pinscher. Flies are BUZZING and swarming over the dog's open wounds.
 Julia and Sam move towards the dog's lifeless form.
 JULIA
 There's your monster.
 SAM
 That's a dog.
 JULIA
 Right.
 Sam kneels in front of the corpse. Waves off some flies.
 SAM
 That's not what I saw.
 JULIA
 I don't see any other corpses on the side of the road, do you?
 A long moment. Sam stares back down at the Doberman's body.
 SAM
 That's not what I saw.
 CLOSE ON THE DOG Eyes slightly open. A misshapen form plagued with flies.
 The sound of INSECTS SWARMING drowns out the WIND HISSING through the trees.
 EXT. FOREST - WALKING TRAIL - DAY Paul is jogging through the woods. A light mist hangs in the cool air. The sounds of the forest surround him.
 Suddenly, the birds stop singing. Paul becomes aware of this. He stops running and looks around. The forest is deathly still.
 The sound of a TWIG being crushed underfoot. Then nothing.
 Another moment. Paul keeps going, a chill on his spine, looking back over his shoulder.
 EXT. SANTA MIRA - TOWN SQUARE - DAY A picture postcard community consisting of quaint storefront shops and manicured parks.
 Paul stands right in front of a freshly painted realty office building with a picketed fence, sipping a Coke, watching a HOMELESS WOMAN across the street screaming and shouting at traffic. She's right next to the parked Range Rover.
 Julia walks out of the realty office.
 PAUL
 Finished?
 JULIA
 Done. The cabin has a buyer.
 PAUL
 What about the movers?
 JULIA
 They're coming on Sunday afternoon so we'll have to start packing.
 The homeless woman starts walking off down the sidewalk. Moving away from the Rover's parking space.
 PAUL
 Good. She's leaving. I thought we were gonna have to make a run for the car.
 JULIA
 I feel sorry for those people.
 PAUL
 Me too. But that doesn't mean I want to get screamed at.
 JULIA
 People are ignoring her. Maybe that's the only way she can get attention.
 PAUL
 She's doing a good job. Kept me away.
 They start crossing the street towards the car.
 JULIA
 How does someone end up like that?
 PAUL
 I think we're witnessing it first-hand with Sam. What did you guys find on the road anyway?
 JULIA
 A dog.
 Paul stares at her. Surprised.
 PAUL
 Really?
 JULIA
 Yeah. Personally, I'm glad we didn't find Frankenstein's monster.
 PAUL
 You just like being right.
 JULIA
 (grins)
 Damn straight.
 EXT. CABIN - WALKING TRAIL - DAY Sam heads away from the cabin, his drawing sketch pad under his arm, moving into the woods.
 INT. CABIN - BASEMENT - DAY A picture is lifted out of the developing basin. The shot of the little girl from the party. Her expression is distant. Tortured.
 Bathed in the red light, Julia gazes at the picture for a moment, then places it to the side. She goes to work on the next piece of developing paper into the basin. She waits. Rocks the basin a bit.
 The TIMER in the basement TICKS.
 The picture starts to manifest. The photo of the children and pool shed at Sam's house.
 Julia frowns slightly. Something is wrong with the photograph as the details become more tangible. She lifts the photo out of the basin. Mystified.
 CLOSE ON: THE PHOTO Standing just inside the shed's door is a BLURRED FIGURE. Featureless. Barely distinguishable. Hiding in the dark.
 EXT. WOODS - WALKING TRAIL - DAY Sam is sitting on a fallen tree trunk, sketching on his drawing pad with a feverish intensity.
 CLOSE ON: THE DRAWING A rough drawing of the animal's leg, intertwined with steel rods and metal threads which culminate in a large pulley where the hip bone should be.
 INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT A warm and comfortable cabin. Simple and subdued.
 Paul is seated on the couch, typing into his powerbook which is hooked up into a phone jack in the wall. Julia stands next to him, holding the photograph.
 JULIA
 I've never seen anything like this before. I thought it might be a flaw in the negative, but now I'm not so sure. Will you take a look?
 PAUL
 (not paying attention)
 Okay.
 He keeps watching.
 JULIA
 Today.
 PAUL
 I'm busy.
 JULIA
 You're in a chat room with a bunch of strangers.
 PAUL
 (defensive)
 They're friends.
 JULIA
 Oh yeah? What are their last names?
 They sit face to face. Paul is speechless for a moment, then impatiently takes the photograph and looks at it.
 PAUL
 I don't see anything.
 He puts the photo down and gets back to the chat room.
 JULIA
 You didn't even look.
 PAUL
 (he didn't)
 I looked.
 JULIA
 There's somebody in the shed. I couldn't see it when I took the picture, but now it's there.
 PAUL
 I know. Usually when you take a picture, you can't see a blur.
 Paul smiles at her. Completely smug. Julia stares right back.
 JULIA
 Give your "friends" my best.
 Julia takes the photograph and leaves. Paul types into his computer: "JULIA SENDS HER BEST." The message pops up next to his user name. Within seconds, several other user names in the chat room respond with "WHO'S JULIA???"
 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT Terry is sitting on the counter, twirling her hair and chatting on a CELL PHONE. Julia enters the kitchen.
 TERRY
 (on the phone)
 I'm not kidding, Dana. There's no phone.
 (beat)
 There's a jack and the phone line works, but there's no phone. Uh-huh. Paul was able to get on the internet. I'm using his cell.
 JULIA
 (quietly)
 I need you to look at something.
 Terry nods.
 TERRY
 Hold on.
 JULIA
 Here.
 Julia holds out the picture. Terry looks it over briefly.
 TERRY
 (polite)
 Nice picture.
 She gets back to her phone conversation.
 TERRY (cont'd)
 I'm back.
 (beat)
 I don't know if he has any free minutes, but he definitely won't after this conversation. Uh-huh. Thank God for AirTouch.
 Frustrated, Julia takes the picture and leaves the kitchen.
 EXT. CABIN - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT The air is completely still. A hush has fallen. The only sound is the ocean and crickets chirping in the grass.
 Julia wanders outside holding some of the developed photographs from the party. Sam is sitting on the front steps, working on his drawing.
 JULIA
 Sam? Could you look at...
 Sam looks up from his drawing pad.
 SAM
 What?
 Beat.
 JULIA
 Never mind.
 Julia sits on the porch glider and looks through the photos. The little girl looking back over her shoulder. The blurred shape inside of the shed.
 A moment passes. Julia shuts her eyes as a slight breeze comes up. She slips into a dream-like state, calm and relaxed, before opening her eyes to find ...
 THE BLOND STUDENT Sitting back on the hood of a sports car. Wearing a white tank top undershirt. The tattooed "S" insignia visible on his shoulder. Bathed in soft moonlight. He even looks good in the dark.
 Their eyes meet. Smiles are traded between them. The wind sifts gently over the porch.
 It's all very dream-like.
 INT. CABIN - BEDROOM - NIGHT A spacious bedroom. Typical. 
 Julia is already in bed and wearing a night shirt. Paul is grinding out a set of crunches.
 JULIA
 It just would have been nice if somebody had looked at it. You were on the internet. Terry was on the phone. I felt like I was living with a bunch of machines instead of people.
 PAUL
 Someone's overreacting.
 JULIA
 Would you look at it again?
 PAUL
 I already did. And I still don't see anything. 
 Paul gets into bed.
 JULIA
 That little girl said there was a monster in the shed.
 PAUL
 (kisses her)
 It was probably another dog. Good night.
 He switches off the light. Paul turns over and goes to sleep.
 Julia sits for a moment in the dark. Alone with her thoughts. She looks over at the walk-in closet across the room.
 The closet door is slightly open. Just a crack. Not enough to provide any clear view of what lies within, but just enough for something -- monsters included -- to peek out.
 Julia stares at the closet. Spooked. She knows better, but it's dark and her primal fears are taking control.
 JULIA
 (to herself)
 Stupid.
 She gets out of bed and tiptoes to the closet, shutting the door. Then she gets back into bed. Smiling to herself, she goes to sleep.
 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT The wind is picking up. Trees rustle.
 INT. CABIN - BEDROOM - NIGHT The clock on the night table reads 3:15 AM. Julia turns over in her sleep and stirs awake. She groggily looks over towards the closet. Julia practically sits up in bed.
 The closet door is wide open.
 A childhood nightmare come to life. Julia's breathing quickens. She reaches towards the other side of the bed.
 JULIA
 (a whisper)
 Paul?
 Her hand finds nothing but sheets and empty space. There's nobody there. She quickly turns to locate her boyfriend. But he's gone.
 She tries to switch on the light. CLICK.
 The light stays off. She tries again. CLICK.
 Nothing happens.
 Then, she hears it. A faint sound. Almost like a shuffling. The sound of something dragging itself lightly across the floor to the edge of the bed.
 Julia's throat has gone dry. Carefully, she creeps towards Paul's side of the bed and checks the floor.
 There is nothing in sight. The only sign of movement are the shadows from the trees outside.
 There is only one place left to look. Julia cautiously steps down to the floor. Sinking down on her knees, she gently lifts up the dust ruffle and looks into the inky darkness underneath the bed. The space is empty.
 Julia drops the dust ruffle and sits up, GASPING.
 A BLACK SHAPE IS STANDING BEHIND HER. Then, a familiar voice comes from it.
 PAUL
 Hey ... it's just me.
 Paul switches on the light. He's wearing a UCLA sweatshirt.
 JULIA
 The light wouldn't turn on.
 PAUL
 Works now.
 Julia catches her breath. The fear finally draining from her.
 JULIA
 Where were you?
 PAUL
 I was cold so I got a sweater from the closet. And I went to the bathroom. Why were you looking under the bed?
 Julia isn't quite sure how to answer. She's embarrassed.
 JULIA
 I thought there was something in the room.
 PAUL
 (skeptical)
 Something? Like what?
 INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - DAY SHRRRIIIIPPP. Packing tape is pulled back from a roll.
 Julia finishes taping up a cardboard box. Terry is packing some books into another box of her own.
 TERRY
 You thought there was a monster in the room? And you admitted it?
 JULIA
 I didn't know what else to say.
 TERRY
 Advice. When you don't know what else to say, you lie.
 JULIA
 But I really did hear something.
 TERRY
 You're worse than my boyfriend.
 Julia looks towards the front door.
 Sam is sitting on the porch steps, sketching on his pad, oblivious to everything around him.
 JULIA
 He's in his own world, isn't he?
 TERRY
 That's an understatement. I have a sinking feeling that sex is out of the question for this trip.
 This sparks something in Julia. She hesitates, looking through an open doorway where Paul can be seen packing some clothes. Julia speaks to Terry in confidence.
 JULIA
 Do you fantasize about other people?
 TERRY
 If I haven't yet, I probably will by the time we're ready to leave.
 Hesitant beat.
 JULIA
 I've been fantasizing about a guy.
 TERRY
 Anyone we know?
 JULIA
 Blond. Good looking. Nice body.
 TERRY
 I'd like to know that.
 JULIA
 (hushed)
 He has a Superman tattoo on his shoulder.
 Terry's mouth drops. The girls move closer together.
 TERRY
 No.
 JULIA
 Yes.
 TERRY
 No.
 JULIA
 Yes.
 TERRY
 When did this start?
 JULIA
 Sam's party. I walked out of the bathroom and he was changing out of his suit. He lost his tie, his shirt ... and then he spotted me.
 TERRY
 What did you say? Keep going?
 JULIA
 I got out of there. But I've been fantasizing about him ever since.
 TERRY
 Fuck yeah. Power to the people.
 JULIA
 But Paul is the perfect boyfriend. Top to bottom. He's gorgeous. He's smart. He's gonna be a doctor.
 TERRY
 (continuing)
 He never gets upset about anything ...
 JULIA
 What the hell is wrong with me?
 TERRY
 It's just a fantasy.
 JULIA
 Yeah, but when I made love to Paul on grad night ... I thought of him.
 Terry stares.
 TERRY
 Wow.
 JULIA
 I know. Don't tell Paul about this. I'd rather not test the whole "he never gets upset about anything" part.
 TERRY
 Are you okay?
 JULIA
 I don't know. I think I'm flipping out. Seeing things in pictures. Thinking that there's a monster in my closet.
 TERRY
 (rising)
 You're being too sensitive. We woke up with our closet wide open and I'm not upset about it.
 Julia reacts.
 JULIA
 Your closet was open?
 TERRY
 Having to wash my hair without an all-natural conditioner. That upsets me.
 She walks out. Julia sits quietly in the living room, left alone with her own puzzled thoughts.
 INT. CABIN - HALLWAY - DAY Julia is walking down the hallway. She happens to pass the bathroom door which is slightly open.
 JULIA'S POV
 Within the bathroom. The BLOND STUDENT is toweling off. Completely naked. The tattoo plainly visible on his shoulder. His eyes lock on hers.
 Julia REACTS, and runs straight into Paul. She JUMPS.
 JULIA
 Jesus. You scared me.
 PAUL
 I'm sorry.
 JULIA
 It's okay. I wasn't looking.
 PAUL
 I'm going for a run.
 JULIA
 Okay. See you when you get back.
 (remembers)
 Oh, Paul? Don't leave the closet door open anymore, all right?
 PAUL
 (confused)
 Huh?
 JULIA
 The closet. Last night. You left it open.
 PAUL
 I closed it after I got my sweatshirt.
 JULIA
 Did not.
 PAUL
 Serious. I thought you opened it.
 JULIA
 Wasn't me.
 A moment.
 PAUL
 Well damn, Julia. Your monster isn't just noisy, he's also inconsiderate.
 He kisses her on the cheek and takes off. Julia stands alone in the empty hallway, a chill running down her spine.
 INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - DAY The door slowly creaks open. Julia stands in the doorway, surveying the closet -- a cluttered and claustrophobic space despite its size. Clothes draped on hangars. Cardboard boxes stacked on shelves. Shadows.
 Julia moves inside and pulls a string hanging from a light bulb which acts as a switch. Tick-tick. The bulb stays dark. She tries again.
 Tick-tick.
 The light still won't come on.
 Julia carefully looks through some of the clothes. Nothing. She kneels down and checks the floor.
 A long CREAKING behind her. The natural light fades.
 Julia looks over her shoulder, a bit skittish, as the closet door eases back towards the doorjamb. But there's nobody there. Just the faintest hint of a draft.
 Julia keeps searching through the clutter. Moving shoes and boxes out of the way. Searching.
 Then, she spots something glittering in the ribbon of light coming from the closet doorway. A small object resting in the corner. Julia reaches down and picks it up ...
 A PIECE OF METAL ... Small and intricate with erratic markings. Twisted and strangely ornate. The shape and texture of the metal is almost completely alien.
 Julia holds the metal into the light. Extremely curious. Behind her, a shadow moves ...
 CRASH. Julia SCREAMS, dropping the object and whirling around as a cardboard box SMASHES down behind her. Tumbling from one of the shelves above. Old shoes scatter across the floor.
 Julia catches her breath. Heart pounding.
 On the floor, the metal object sparkles in the light. A draft HISSES through the open closet door.
 EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY The Range Rover races down the empty road.
 INT. RANGE ROVER - DAY Julia sits behind the wheel. Her eyes intense. She looks over at the passenger seat where both her purse and the metal object are located.
 EXT. SANTA MIRA - FOREST ROAD - DAY The Range Rover streaks out of the woods towards Santa Mira.
 EXT. SANTA MIRA - LIBRARY - DAY Julia walks up the front steps leading to the library -- a weathered building that overlooks the town square. A banner hangs over the front entrance. It reads ...
              WELCOME TO THE FOUNDER'S DAY FAIR INT. LIBRARY - READING ROOM - DAY The stacks are deserted and still. Julia sits at a reading table, flipping through a book, surrounded by long rows of bookshelves.
 INTERCUT - THE BOOK Julia flips from page to page, allowing momentary glimpses of various drawings: vampires, werewolves, witches, a ghastly thing crawling out from under a maiden's bed.
 ON JULIA
 as she puts down the book and grabs another from a stack on the table. She opens it and starts paging through.
 CLOSE ON - THE BOOK As Julia finds a drawing of a sleeping child. Just beyond the bed is an open closet door, the horrid face a MONSTER watching the child from within.
 Julia shivers down to her soul. A familiar feeling of late.
 A slight SQUEAKING catches her attention. She looks across the reading room to find -- A YOUNG BOY
 Ten years old. Tow-haired. Sitting a few tables away but almost directly opposite her. He's wearing a Superman shirt.
 He smiles timidly and waves. Julia waves back.
 A THUMP behind her. Julia turns and looks over her shoulder. She barely catches sight of a shadow slipping across the wall in the stacks.
 The SCRAPING of chair legs against the cold floor. Julia looks back towards where the BOY was sitting. The chair is pushed back and empty.
 Another THUMPING in the stacks. Then silence.
 A feeling of anxiety washes over Julia as she grabs some of the books and leaves.
 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT It's getting dark. Moonshadows shift across the lawn.
 INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Soft rock seeps from a pair of portable compact disc player speakers. Paul removes a lid of grass and some zigzag papers and starts to roll a joint. Everyone looks pretty toasted. Cardboard boxes and candles are everywhere.
 Sam is sitting off to himself. He's still drawing on his pad. Julia is reading one of the books from the library.
 JULIA
 (takes a hit)
 Monsters. Symbols and dream images. Now you see, I don't agree with that. I think everything has some kind of physical representation. People can't just come up with this stuff.
 PAUL
 You did a good job last night.
 Julia hands him the metal object from the closet.
 JULIA
 And this? What do you make of this?
 PAUL
 Where'd you find it?
 JULIA
 In the closet you didn't leave open.
 TERRY
 What's she talking about?
 PAUL
 (wearisome)
 My girlfriend believes in the Boogeyman.
 JULIA
 I never said it was the Boogeyman. Maybe it's some primeval energy that causes a response in human beings. This could be the physical representation of that energy.
 PAUL
 Julia. It's piece of shit.
 TERRY
 I disagree.
 Julia turns hopefully to Terry --
 JULIA
 Yes?
 TERRY
 It's the physical representation of a piece of shit.
 Pot-induced laughter. Julia takes back the object.
 JULIA
 You're not being objective about this. Have either of you ever been scared? Really scared?
 PAUL
 I'm scared right now that you've smoked too much.
 JULIA
 Paul ...
 PAUL
 Okay. Sure. I've been really scared.
 JULIA
 Like when?
 Beat.
 PAUL
 Maybe when we hit the dog.
 Sam looks unsettled.
 SAM
 You mean this?
 Sam tosses his sketch pad into the center of the floor. Everyone leans forward, getting a good look at Sam's detailed drawing of --
 THE ANIMAL LEG ... Completely fleshed out with distinct mechanical parts hinged into flesh and bone. Almost as accurate as a photograph.
 SAM (cont'd)
 That thing we hit on the road. It wasn't a dog. It wasn't some primeval force, either.
 (then)
 It was a monster.
 Julia picks up the drawing as Paul peers over her shoulder. The picture looks particularly unsettling in the flickering firelight.
 It almost looks alive.
 INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT It's late. The fire is dwindling. Terry and Sam have both passed out. Julia relaxes on the floor, staring at Sam's drawing while resting in Paul's lap.
 JULIA
 I can't believe Sam drew this.
 PAUL
 I can. He's been acting like a freak.
 Beat.
 JULIA
 You think we could've been wrong?
 PAUL
 About what?
 JULIA
 About the dog. Maybe the next day when Sam and I went back to the road ... maybe we found the wrong body.
 PAUL
 Can we drop this? Please?
 JULIA
 I just want to know ...
 PAUL
 (clipped)
 Stop.
 JULIA
 I just want to know what's going on.
 PAUL
 Nothing's going on. Here, give me the drawing.
 JULIA
 I'm not done yet.
 PAUL
 Your hands are shaking. Come on, Julia. Give yourself a break.
 She hands the drawing pad to him. Paul puts it on the couch.
 JULIA
 We need to talk about this.
 PAUL
 Tomorrow. Just relax.
 Paul begins stroking her hair. Gently and repeatedly.
 JULIA
 Just for a minute.
 Julia looks really tired. She closes her eyes for a moment as Paul's steady breathing fills the room. The she opens them, turns her head and gazes at ...
 THE BLOND STUDENT ... Sitting in a chair. Smoking a cigarette. Smiling down at her.
 She cranks her head and looks deeply into her boyfriend's eyes. He smirks and gently strokes her hair.
 JULIA (cont'd)
 Nice.
 PAUL
 (soft)
 You're tired. Go to sleep.
 Her breathing becomes more steady.
 In the distance, a SOUND begins to permeate the cabin ...
 THE SOUND OF MACHINES ... Grinding and drumming like the churning of a large factory.  A calming and soothing noise, drifting over ...
 DREAM SEQUENCE - A SERIES OF SHOTS Quick FLASHES OF IMAGES which are strung together:
 (a) A turbine driven by a cloud of pumping steam.
 (b) The Superman tattoo on the Blond Student's shoulder.
 (c) A Doberman running across a road.
 (d) A man limping along wearing leg braces and using steel crutches.
 (e) A woman's hands slipping over a young man's bare chest.
 (f) A back brace being locked into place.
 INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - BATHROOM - NIGHT (DREAM SEQ.) The stall door at the far end of the bathroom eases open.
 INT. ASYLUM - SNAKE PIT - NIGHT (DREAM SEQ.) THERE IS NO SOUND except for the HUMMING OF MACHINES.
 Julia stumbles through the snake pit. MENTAL PATIENTS stagger around her. Many of them are dressed like homeless people. Staring into space. Bodies twitching and gnawing on their fingers. Lying in their own urine.
 Julia looks skyward towards a SCREEN that doubles for a ceiling. Dark figures are standing on the screen, looking down at them.
 A pair of ORDERLIES gently take Julia's arm and lead her out of the snake pit.
 Julia looks at the wall as she walks.
 JULIA'S POV - shadows move across the wall. Almost like ripples in water.
 But the shadows gradually become the GROTESQUE silhouettes of HUMAN BODY PARTS -- arms, legs, heads, feet -- hanging and rocking gently from hooks
 INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - DAY (DREAM SEQ.) Blood trickles down over the Superman tattoo.
 INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - BATHROOM - NIGHT (DREAM SEQ.) Clawed fingers slide around the open stall door.
 INT. ASYLUM - CORRIDOR - NIGHT (DREAM SEQ.) A HOMELESS PERSON is having a seizure. Propped against the wall. Shaking horribly. His head and body are entirely covered with braces that form a metal exoskeleton.
 INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT (DREAM SEQ.) A gynecology exam. A woman's legs are held open by stirrups. A pair of hands protected by rubber gloves cruelly insert a large alien-looking METAL OBJECT -- which is nothing but sharp tentacles and angles -- between the legs. 
 INTERCUT - A SCREAMING FACE A woman shrieking through rotting teeth and blood. 
 INT. ASYLUM - SURGICAL ROOM - NIGHT (DREAM SEQ.) Julia steps into the surgical room.
 The LITTLE GIRL from Sam's party is resting on a gurney. Her small body is clamped down with metal bands. Her blonde curls draped over the edge. Her eyes open and staring at nothing.  
 SOMETHING ELSE LURCHES INTO the room. MOVING IN THE SHADOWS. A SURGEON ENCLOSED IN METAL BRACES AND HOLDING a pair of ALIEN-LOOKING shears in HIS HANDS. 
 THE SURGEON OPENS THE SHEARS OVER THE GIRL'S FOREHEAD.
 Julia tries to scream. No sound comes out. The shears close.
 Several drops of BLOOD ... then a BLONDE CURL ... hit the tile floor.
 The SOUND of the MACHINES is interrupted by GLASS BREAKING. INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOm - NIGHT
 Julia lurches awake.
 Paul and Terry are lying immobile on the floor. Hundreds of candles have been placed throughout the room, bathing the cabin in a dull amber glow.
 There is NO SOUND. Julia starts to rise to her feet. Her fingers graze something sharp. She winces and snatches her fingers away from ...
 A BROKEN WINE GLASS ... Julia discovers a small ribbon of blood trickling from her index finger. She sucks on it, and notices --
 SAM ...
 Sitting behind the couch. His eyes are intense as he erases something from his drawing pad. Julia walks around him until she can see the sketch.
 THE DRAWING IS JULIA'S PORTRAIT. Sam erases the picture, working from the shoulders up.
 There is still NO SOUND. Julia is dumbfounded. She hears a slight noise coming from somewhere in the cabin. A small HISSING sound. Soft and unobtrusive.
 Julia looks around. The sound seemed to come from behind her. But there's nothing in the room. Her friends are still asleep. Sam is concentrating on his drawing.
 More HISSING. Unmistakable this time. A diminutive SCRAPING, almost like fingernails raking on icy glass, slithering out from a darkened hallway.
 She moves towards the sound.
 INT. CABIN - HALLWAY - NIGHT Julia creeps into the hallway until she can barely see the rows of bedroom doors. All of them are closed shut.
 The SCRAPING sound rises up again. Much closer. Behind one of the bedroom doors. Beckoning.
 Julia reaches out for the doorknob.
 INT. CABIN - BEDROOM - NIGHT The door opens. Julia's stomach rises into her throat. Terror floods her face.
 Resting on the bed is a BODY BAG. So smeared with blood that the corpse inside isn't visible except for its massive bulk.
 Something SCRATCHES on the BODY BAG from INSIDE. Julia's body goes rigid. She can't force herself to move.
 The body bag is slowly unzipped from the inside. Stretching down the length of the plastic until the bag is wide open. The corpse inside is still hidden. 
 As if drawn by some alien force, Julia moves to the bed. Her entire body is shaking.
 She reaches out and carefully peels back the plastic.
 Resting within the body bag is THE LITTLE GIRL. Eyes puffed shut. Hair slicked with blood. Her skin is livid. Her face is ghostly white and smeared with crimson gore.
 Julia is frozen in place. Heart pounding. Terrified.
 THE GIRL'S EYES BLINK OPEN AS SHE SHRIEKS BLOODY MURDER. INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - MORNING Julia is startled awake and groggily looks around the room. Paul and Terry are still in the process of getting up.
 PAUL
 Look who's up.
 (smiles)
 You sleep well?
 Julia STARES back. She looks pretty freaked.
 PAUL (cont'd)
 Uh-oh.
 TERRY
 I didn't sleep well either. I dreamt that all these cockroaches were eating my legs.
 PAUL
 You want to trade? Right before I woke up, my head exploded and all these snakes came out.
 TERRY
 Where's Sam?
 PAUL
 Probably went to bed.
 Terry nods as she rises to her feet.
 TERRY
 I need a hairbrush. And a facial.
 She stumbles into the hallway. Paul turns to Julia.
 PAUL
 You had nightmares too?
 JULIA
 Worst ones I've had in a long time. I thought I was hallucinating.
 Paul winces and rubs his temples.
 JULIA (cont'd)
 What's wrong?
 PAUL
 Headache. I'll be fine.
 Terry briskly walks out the hallway. She looks alarmed.
 TERRY
 You guys. Something's wrong.
 INT. CABIN - HALLWAY - DAY The group walks towards one of the bedroom doors.
 TERRY
 It's Sam. I can't get the door open.
 Paul tries the doorknob. The door won't budge. Paul KNOCKS.
 PAUL
 Sam, open up.
 No answer. He POUNDS harder.
 PAUL (cont'd)
 Sam?
 TERRY
 He won't answer.
 JULIA
 Maybe he can't answer.
 Paul shoves hard against the door. But it still won't give.
 PAUL
 What about the bathroom door? It connects to your room.
 TERRY
 I tried it. It's locked.
 Paul turns the doorknob and throws all his weight against the door, trying his best to bust it down. No such luck.
 PAUL
 (voice rising)
 Sam?
 He tries again and again. WHOOMPH! .... WHOOMPH! ....
 WHOOMPH! The door inches open. Just a crack.
 PAUL (cont'd)
 Help me out with this.
 Paul and Julia push on the door, forcing it wider.
 INT. CABIN - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY Paul struggles through the aperture, slipping underneath a mattress that's been placed against the door, and stumbles into the room.
 The bedroom is a disaster area.
 Clothes and smashed glass cover the floor. Mirrors have been shattered. Most of the furniture and portions of the bed have been piled in front of the door, creating an almost impassible barricade. The window is wide open, the curtains billowing in the breeze.
 Julia and Terry make their way into the room. Stupefied.
 PAUL
 Careful of the glass. Don't step on it.
 Total silence. The group stares at the room. Taking it in. Trying to comprehend it.
 JULIA
 What happened?
 PAUL
 (frozen)
 You got me.
 EXT. WOODS - WALKING TRAIL - DAY Paul and Terry are walking along the trail. Searching.
 TERRY
 (calling)
 Sam?
 No reply. Her words sound hollow in the empty forest as they keep moving, passing behind huge pine trees that obscure them from view.
 A soft breeze rises up and HISSES through the trees.
 INT. CABIN - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY Julia is cleaning the mess in the room. She's just finished tossing a few shards of broken glass into a garbage bag when she FLINCHES and draws her index finger back.
 The finger has a scab on it. Exactly where she cut it in the dream. Dried blood marks the wound.
 INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - DAY Terry looks beside herself. Paul and Julia are seated.
 JULIA
 He must have gotten out through the window. That's the only thing I can figure.
 TERRY
 We have to call the police.
 JULIA
 You looked everywhere?
 PAUL
 Everywhere near the cabin. But we can't cover every square inch of forest out there.
 TERRY
 He might be sick. He might need help.
 JULIA
 I can't understand why he'd do something like this.
 PAUL
 He was acting nuts. Really nuts.
 TERRY
 (impatient)
 I need a phone.
 PAUL
 Wait. I've got my cell.
 Paul fishes the cell phone out of his pocket. He hands it to her.
 AND THE PHONE RINGS. Almost on cue. Terry glances over at her friends, then clicks the receiver.
 TERRY
 Hello?
 (beat)
 Sam? ... Julia and Paul sit up in their seats.
 TERRY (cont'd)
 Where are you? ... No, where are you? ...
 (beat)
 How did you get there? ...
 Terry hurriedly grabs a pen. She starts writing on a pad.
 TERRY (cont'd)
 Just a minute. I'm writing it down. Market Street. The Ramada. I think I know where it is.
 (beat)
 Sam, what's going on? What happened? ...
 (then)
 Sam? ... SAM? ... She hangs up the phone.
 PAUL
 Where is he?
 TERRY
 San Francisco.
 JULIA
 What?
 TERRY
 I don't know. He wants me to meet him. My brother has an apartment up there. He's out of town, but I have a spare key. I guess I could stay there.
 Beat.
 JULIA
 You still want to call the police?
 Silence. Terry doesn't respond to this.
 Outside an open window, the WIND HISSES through the trees.
 EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT An empty bus station consisting of a single room with a CLERK sitting behind the front desk. Julia and Paul are sitting on a pair of chairs, waiting patiently.
 Terry is using a phone booth outside. She hangs up and walks into the depot.
 JULIA
 Did you get his parents?
 TERRY
 It was the wrong number.
 JULIA
 Didn't Sam give you that number?
 TERRY
 Maybe I wrote it down wrong.
 Terry winces a bit. She massages her legs.
 PAUL
 Are you okay?
 TERRY
 My legs are killing me.
 JULIA
 You sure you don't want us to drive you?
 TERRY
 Nah. You have to stick around for the movers. I'll be fine.
 The bus arrives in front of the depot.
 TERRY (cont'd)
 There's my ride.
 Terry grabs her suitcase. Julia hands her a slip of paper.
 JULIA
 This is Paul's cell number. You call us. Let us know what happens.
 TERRY
 I just need to talk to him. Don't call the police or anything until I've had a chance to do that.
 JULIA
 Okay.
 TERRY
 Thanks.
 Terry hugs Julia. Paul gives her a quick kiss on the cheek.
 PAUL
 Remember. Call us.
 TERRY
 I will.
 Carrying her suitcase, Terry backs toward the door, smiling sadly at Julia and Paul as she opens it.
 TERRY (cont'd)
 It'll be okay. Everything's okay.
 Her voice resonates with desperate hope rather than confidence. She leaves the depot.
 Paul places his arms around Julia as they watch the bus leave the station, trailing smoke.
 INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - DAY Julia is cleaning up. She kneels down and picks up some of the melted candles and beer bottles.
 Paul walks into room holding a broken picture frame.
 PAUL
 I talked to the movers.
 JULIA
 Why didn't they show up?
 PAUL
 The company has no record of the order.
 Beat.
 JULIA
 What?
 PAUL
 I know. It's crazy.
 JULIA
 Are they coming now?
 PAUL
 It'll take them a while to work us into the schedule -- get a van out here to pick up everything.
 JULIA
 How long?
 PAUL
 Three days.
 JULIA
 (exhausted)
 Shit.
 Paul holds out the mangled frame.
 PAUL
 I also found this in the guest bedroom. Sam knocked one of the packing boxes over. This was inside.
 Julia takes a look at the frame. It's the same picture from her room of herself with her mother. The broken glass has torn the photograph.
 PAUL (cont'd)
 I wasn't sure if you wanted to keep it.
 JULIA
 No. I've got one.
 Beat.
 JULIA (cont'd)
 You know this is the only picture I have of my mother?
 (beat)
 She was always taking pictures of us, but we never got any of her.
 (emotional)
 If I didn't have this, I couldn't prove that I had a mother.
 PAUL
 That's not true.
 Another beat.
 JULIA
 I'm so worried about Sam.
 Julia drowns in her thoughts. Paul touches her cheek.
 PAUL
 Let's get outta here.
 JULIA
 (smiles)
 Good idea.
 PAUL
 I'll get my keys.
 Paul walks out. Julia places the frame on the coffee table.
 She notices something on the floor. Julia squints. It's a small object resting in the corner ... almost hidden from view. Julia reaches into the shadows and picks up ...
 ANOTHER PIECE OF METAL with STRANGE markings. EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE FROM THE CLOSET.
 Julia stares at the object in her palm. Surprised.
 JULIA
 (to herself)
 Where are these coming from?
 EXT. SANTA MIRA - PARK - DAY A warm summer afternoon. The entire town has congragated in a park with a breathtaking view of the ocean. MUSIC and NOISE. A huge banner draped over the street reads ...
 SANTA MIRA CELEBRATES THE 45TH ANNUAL FOUNDER'S DAY FESTIVAL Julia navigates her way past the booths and thrill rides that have been erected on the lawn. She watches some passersby.
 JULIA'S POV ... as A MOTHER talks on a cell phone while her six year-old DAUGHTER tugs at her sleeve. Trying to get her attention. The mother keeps pushing the child away as she talks.
 Julia observes this scene until she hears ...
 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) I'm your mother.
 Julia steps out of the crowd. Searches for the voice.
 A HOMELESS WOMAN is shadowing a COLLEGE-AGE GIRL walking with her boyfriend. They're trying to ignore her.
 HOMELESS WOMAN I'm your mother ... I'm your mother ... I'm your mother ...
 The couple walks faster. The Homeless Woman is left behind.
 HOMELESS WOMAN (cont'd)
 (futile)
 I'm your mother ... Julia stares helplessly.
 EXT. PARK - CAROUSEL - DAY Spinning merrily in the center of the park. Bright lights. Loud CALLIOPE MUSIC. Young kids and teenagers occupy the horses and benches.
 Julia slowly walks towards the carousel, snapping pictures of the children and whirling lights. Behind her, the sound of a SCREAMING CHILD rises above the music and laughter. She turns and finds a two year old BABY sitting on her father's shoulders, crying and pointing at --
 THE YOUNG BLOND BOY ... Wearing his blue Superman shirt. He's sitting on a swing set by himself. Sad and alone.
 He makes eye contact with Julia. Waves timidly. She smiles at him and waves back.
 CLOSE ON: THE CAROUSEL Gears turning. The poles spearing the horses rising and falling into the floor. The platform rotating near the grass.
 The CALLIOPE MUSIC becomes the HUMMING of MACHINES.
 EXT. SANTA MIRA - PARK - NIGHT Julia is wandering through a maze of shooting galleries. She searches through the crowds of teenagers and children at the booths. Finally, she locates ...
 PAUL ...
 Approaching her with a large Teddy Bear under his arm.
 JULIA
 Where did you go?
 PAUL
 Basketball toss. I won this for you.
 Julia smiles at the bear.
 JULIA
 You sure you want to give him up?
 PAUL
 (nice smile)
 I think he'd crowd my Barbie collection.
  
 Julia kisses him. He kisses her back and winces in pain.
 JULIA
 You okay?
 PAUL
 Head still hurts.
 JULIA
 Need some aspirin?
 PAUL
 Already took some. I'll be okay.
 Paul notices that they've wandered into a row of PSYCHIC and TAROT CARD BOOTHS.
 PAUL (cont'd)
 Hey, look. Want to get your palm read?
 JULIA
 As long as you're feeling up to it.
 PAUL
 I am. Come on.
 Julia spots another booth with a sign overhead: "THE PAST THROUGH POSSESSIONS."
 JULIA
 Just a minute. You go to the palm reader. I want to check out this one.
 PAUL
 "The past through possessions?"
 (unimpressed)
 Scam city.
 JULIA
 And palm reading isn't?
 She's got him there.
 PAUL
 All right. I'll meet you over there.
 JULIA
 Thanks.
 She kisses him quickly. They split up.
  
 EXT. PALM READER'S BOOTH - NIGHT Paul approaches the booth.
 An African-American woman in her mid-forties, TESS, sits behind the counter. Loose and upbeat. Wearing more colors in her clothing than even a rainbow could provide.
 PAUL
 Can you read my palm?
 She grins.
 TESS
 You got five bucks?
 EXT. PSYCHIC BOOTH - NIGHT Julia walks to the front counter of the booth.
 A pair of women are sitting behind the counter, but the one who sticks out is ROSEMARY, sixty, psychic and clairvoyant. She wears a purple kaftan which barely hides her weakness for ice cream and cookies.
 ROSEMARY
 Can we help you, honey?
 JULIA
 You can tell me things just by holding something of mine. Right?
 ROSEMARY
 Absolutely. I have a perfect track record. I found two missing children in the spring of '74, and helped the state police catch a murderer in '81.
 JULIA
 Wow. That's amazing.
 ROSEMARY
 (sourly)
 My grandchildren aren't quite as impressed.
 (a little brighter)
 What did you want me to look at?
 Julia reaches into her pocket and gently places something on the counter in front of Rosemary.
 THE METAL OBJECTS FROM THE CLOSET AND THE LIVING ROOM. EXT. PALM READER'S BOOTH - NIGHT Tess takes Paul's hand.
 TESS
 So what do you want to know?
 PAUL
 It's kinda stupid. But I sorta wanted to know about my Dad. If I should see him.
 TESS
 (knowingly)
 You and your father don't get along.
 PAUL
 No.
 TESS
 Something happened?
 PAUL
 My parents got divorced when I was sixteen. I got into a fight with him. Said some stuff.
 He bows his head a little. A tough subject for him.
 TESS
 Let's take a look ...
 Tess cocks her head a little to the side. She looks confused.
 TESS (cont'd)
 (soft)
 I'll be damned.
 PAUL
 What's wrong?
 TESS
 Well kid, you might be the first person to make me hang up my fortune telling degree. Usually the palm makes sense, and this one doesn't.
 PAUL
 How do you mean?
 TESS
 According to this, you don't exist.
 OFF Paul, his face turning white.
 EXT. PSYCHIC BOOTH - NIGHT Rosemary handles one of the metal objects, turning it over in her palm. Julia watches her as she goes through this ritual.
 ROSEMARY
 This is interesting.
 JULIA
 Let me guess. They came from a vacuum cleaner, right?
 Beat.
 ROSEMARY
 Machines.
 JULIA
 Excuse me?
 ROSEMARY
 This came from a machine. But not a household appliance.
 JULIA
 Where did it come from?
 Rosemary turns the object over in her palm. Over and over.
 ROSEMARY
 Something that was alive.
 Julia leans forward in her seat.
 JULIA
 But you just said it came from a machine.
 ROSEMARY
 I know.
 JULIA
 So how can a machine be alive?
 ROSEMARY
 I don't make the news. I just report it.
 JULIA
 I found the larger one inside of a closet. Do you know how it got there?
 Rosemary continues meditating. Turning the object over between her fingers. Staring at it.
 Gradually, she falls into a trance. Her breathing slows.
 ROSEMARY
 We shed our parts.
 JULIA
 What?
 ROSEMARY
 And our skin.
 JULIA
 I'm sorry. What are you talking about?
 Rosemary is oblivious to anything around her.
 ROSEMARY
 But they need to be replaced. Some of the parts we can find.
 (beat)
 Others need to be harvested.
 The other PSYCHIC seated next to Rosemary throws her a curious glance as she counts up some money.
 ROSEMARY (cont'd)
 We'll wait on the side of the road. Until one of the machines come.
 (beat)
 One of us will be sacrificed. That will stop the machine. Then we can take whatever skins are inside.
 (softer)
 We can use their parts.
 Paul walks up.
 PAUL
 Julia?
 She motions for him to be quiet.
 ROSEMARY
 We stopped the machine. But there are more of the skins than we thought ...
 PAUL
 Julia. Let's take off.
 JULIA
 Hold on.
 ROSEMARY
 We must wait. More of us are needed to capture them.
 PAUL
 What's she talking about?
 JULIA
 Wait just a minute. Please.
 Beat.
 The objects continue turning in her hand ... and turning ... and turning ... and turning ... ROSEMARY
 There are more of us now. We've surrounded them. But they're leaving too quickly.
 PAUL
 Julia?
  ... and turning ...
 ROSEMARY
 We'll follow them. We'll watch them.
 (beat)
 We'll take them as the need for parts becomes necessary ...
 PAUL
 (louder)
 Julia?
 The wind gently HISSES through the booth's tent.
 ROSEMARY
 Maybe we'll only take one ...
 (beat)
 Maybe we'll take another ... and another ... and another ... and another ...
 A sudden gust of wind rises through the tent as ...
 THE POWER FAILS THROUGHOUT THE PARK. LIGHTS START GOING OUT IN SECTIONS UNTIL THE ENTIRE FAIR IS PITCH BLACK. The sound of mumbling and confusion seethes from the crowd. Julia rises out of her chair. Paul takes her into her arms as CHILDREN can be heard CRYING throughout the park.
 Above them, the wind HISSES through the trees.
 EXT. CABIN - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT Julia sits on the porch. Paul is stretched out on the grass looking up at the stars.
 PAUL
 So the power went out. That doesn't mean anything.
 JULIA
 Did you hear what she said?
 PAUL
 No.
 JULIA
 She was talking about the accident. The night you hit that thing on the road. She knew about that.
 PAUL
 Julia, a psychic tells you some random shit and then lets YOU make sense out of it.
 JULIA
 She said it was waiting for us.
 PAUL
 Oh sure. An animal was waiting for us to come along and run it down. What was the explanation? Rotten home life? Was it taking Prozac?
 JULIA
 It wanted to stop the car.
 PAUL
 Why?
 JULIA
 Something about needing parts.
 PAUL
 If it needed parts, it shouldn't have committed suicide. 
 JULIA
 She said there were more of them.
 PAUL
 Who cares what she said? It doesn't mean anything.
 JULIA
 But it's not just that.
 Julia's voice becomes soft. As if she were telling a secret.
 JULIA (cont'd)
 I've also had this feeling. Ever since Sam disappeared. I can't shake it.
 PAUL
 What is it?
 JULIA
 I feel like something's missing.
 PAUL
 Something?
 JULIA
 I don't know. It's on the tip of my tongue. I just feel like ever since we woke up that morning, something's not right. Like ... there's someone who should be here ... PAUL
 Right. Sam.
 JULIA
 It's not Sam.
 (then)
 Did that palm reader say anything strange to you. Anything at all?
 Paul hesitates. He looks back at the night sky.
 PAUL
 No.
 Beat.
 JULIA
 Can I use your phone?
 INT. LEVIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT A traditional home. The phone rings and Connor comes charging down the stairs. He answers it.
 CONNOR
 Hello?
 INT. CABIN - BEDROOM - NIGHT - INTERCUT Julia is sitting on the couch.
 JULIA
 Connor. It's Julia.
 CONNOR
 Oh. I thought you were someone else.
 JULIA
 Nice to hear your voice too.
 CONNOR
 You having fun?
 JULIA
 (understated)
 Not exactly.
 CONNOR
 I got my PSAT's back. 720 verbal. 690 math. You think that's good enough to get into Berkeley?
 JULIA
 You'll get in. Listen, is Dad there?
 CONNOR
 No.
 JULIA
 Well could you leave him a message?
 CONNOR
 Uh-huh. 
 JULIA
 Tell him that the movers didn't come, so I'll be here a few more days. Tell him that I have some stuff of Mom's that he might want.
 CONNOR
 Okay.
 JULIA
 Don't forget.
 CONNOR
 Jesus. Show a little faith. When have I ever forgotten something?
 INT. DARKROOM - DAY A piece of developing paper is slipped into the tray basin.
 Julia gently rocks the basin back and forth. A picture starts to manifest on the paper.
 INT. CABIN - BATHROOM - DAY Paul splashes his face with water. He looks worse than he did the night before. Weaker.
 He grabs some aspirin from the medicine cabinet.
 INT. DARKROOM - DAY Julia leans forward to get a better view of the developing picture. An image is slowly forming -- carousel horses, the vague outlines of poles and children.
 INT. CABIN - BEDROOM - DAY Paul is shirtless and doing one-armed push-ups. His muscles churn. His body rises and falls like a piston.
 INT. DARKROOM - DAY The picture has come into view. The carousel. The children laughing as they ride the horses.
 And something else ...
 An irregularity. A dark form in the center of the carousel.
 INT. CABIN - BEDROOM - DAY CLOSER ON Paul's arm as he does push-ups, sweat beading on his biceps, muscles rippling.
 The SOUND of MACHINES pulsates and segues into ...
 INT. DARKROOM - DAY Julia takes the picture out of the developing basin.
 WE MOVE INTO THE PHOTO - There's a dark SHAPE standing in the middle of the carousel. Blurred and indistinct. ALMOST LIKE A SILHOUETTE OR A SHADOW.
 EXCEPT THAT it's waving at the camera.
 INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - DAY Paul is sitting on the couch, wearing a UCLA cross country tank top and tying his shoes. Julia enters from the basement. She's carrying a stack of developed pictures.
 JULIA
 Paul, you have to see this. The picture came out, but there's something really strange in the middle of it. Just like the other one of the shed.
 He looks at the picture.
 PAUL
 Looks like someone on the carousel.
 JULIA
 But there's no features. It's like a shadow.
 PAUL
 So there wasn't enough light.
 Paul rubs his forehead. Julia is genuinely concerned.
 JULIA
 What's the matter?
 PAUL
 My head feels worse.
 JULIA
 Maybe you should lie down.
 PAUL
 I have to go running.
 JULIA
 No you don't.
 PAUL
 Of course I do. Your body's like a machine. It needs upkeep.
 JULIA
 Not when you're physically ill.
 PAUL
 I'll be okay.
 JULIA
 Paul ...
 PAUL
 I'll be okay.
 (about the picture)
 Is that it?
 JULIA
 Not exactly.
 (beat)
 When I saw this picture, I decided to look at the other one. Just for comparison's sake.
 PAUL
 So?
 Julia takes out another photograph.
 JULIA
 I pulled this one by mistake. The picture of that little girl from the party.
 She hands him the picture.
 JULIA (cont'd)
 Look.
 Paul's face collapses into slack disbelief.
 THE LITTLE GIRL HAS DISAPPEARED from the photo. Vanished.
 Paul turns to Julia as she looks into his eyes with a mixture of fear and apprehension.
 JULIA (cont'd)
 What's going on?
 This time, he doesn't have an answer.
 EXT. WOODS - WALKING TRAIL - DAY Murky and still. A few shafts of sunlight permeate the gloom.
 Paul is jogging along the trail, keeping a steady pace, the sounds of the forest all around him.
 EXT. CREEK BRIDGE - DAY The trail snakes towards a wooden bridge that spans over a trickling creek. Paul runs across, the soles of his sneakers SLAPPING on creaking wood.
 He moves deeper into the woods.
 EXT. WOODS - TRAIL - DAY A lonely part of the woods where almost all the daylight is blocked out by the trees.
 Paul jogs along the trail when he slows to a halt, sweaty and out of breath. His skin is pale. His limbs are shivering. Paul cradles his head, shutting his eyes, suffering from obvious pain.
 PAUL
 (very soft)
 Oh God .... make it stop ...
 He starts walking forward again. Very slowly.
 A slight TINKLING sound as he kicks something at his feet. His eyes blink open as he looks down ...
 There are several pieces of metal littering the trail. Almost like nuts and bolts, but alien in their design.
 Paul reaches down and picks one of the bolts up. Studies it. He keeps walking, following more pieces of metal that lead off the footpath.
 EXT. FOREST - DAY A darker spot enclosed by pine trees. A few birds are singing overhead.
 Paul enters the forest, pushing back branches, following the trail of discarded metal until he freezes ... his eyes staring directly ahead at ...
 CLUMPS OF BLACK SKIN ... Hanging from branches. Scattered on the ground. Like the skin of a snake which has been shed.
 Paul is completely unsettled. He kneels down, picking up a flap of skin from the ground, peeling it away from a steel ROD dripping with oozing slime. Holds it up. It's still black in color but almost transparent in the murky light.
 The wind HISSES through the trees, mussing Paul's hair.
 Paul drops the piece of skin on the ground.
 The birds abruptly stop singing in unison. The WIND CEASES.
 Paul looks around the forest. The sudden quiet has got him spooked. His arms and legs stiffen. Paul can't even bring himself to move or breathe ...
 UNTIL SOMETHING DROPS ON HIS SHOULDER ... Paul freaks and whirls around, grabbing his shoulder to find
 A PIECE OF SKIN ... Clinging to him. He rips it off and sprints for the footpath.
 EXT. WOODS - FOOTPATH - DAY Paul sprints out of the forest, running with blinding speed and adrenaline. He doesn't look back.
 Behind him, the wind HISSES through the trees again.
 INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - DAY Julia comes up from the basement. She hears COUGHING coming from the bathroom.
 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT Julia enters the bathroom. Paul is retching and coughing into the toilet. Hair plastered to his forehead. Pale as death. Shaking badly.
 JULIA
 Paul? What's wrong?
 PAUL
 (feeble)
 Sick.
 She goes to him. Rubs his shoulders as he COUGHS again.
 JULIA
 Oh baby ...
 Julia brushes the hair from his forehead. She freezes.
 Just above his temple is a SCAB. No bigger than the head of an eraser. Identical to the one on Julia's finger.
 JULIA (cont'd)
 Paul? Where did this come from?
 PAUL
 What?
 JULIA
 This scab.
 Julia runs her finger over the scab. Paul immediately reels from her touch, pain shooting through his head, furious.
 PAUL
 Jesus! Fuck!
 Julia is shocked by the severity of his reaction.
 JULIA
 I'm sorry.
 Paul holds his head tight. Almost near tears. Fighting pain.
 PAUL
 Just don't touch it.
 JULIA
 How long has it been there?
 PAUL
 Ever since my head started to hurt.
 (then)
 I think I'm hallucinating.
 JULIA
 What did you see?
 PAUL
 Skin ... like it was shed ... and all of these metal pieces ...
 Julia is terribly concerned now. His description frightens her, but she maintains a visage of calm.
 JULIA
 Do you want to see a doctor? I know there's one in Santa Mira.
 PAUL
 I can see a doctor in Los Angeles.
 (then)
 Look, I want to get out of here, okay? Let's go home.
 Beat.
 JULIA
 Okay.
 She squeezes his shoulder and walks into --
 INT. CABIN - BEDROOM - DAY Julia pulls out their duffle bags and suitcases.
 Paul's cell phone RINGS on the table. Julia snatches up the phone and answers.
 JULIA
 Hello? ... Yes? ... (then)
 Wait a minute ... slow down, I can't understand what you're saying ...
 Complete astonishment storms Julia's face. Paul wanders in.
 PAUL
 Who is it?
 JULIA
 It's Terry. Something went wrong.
 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - ESTABLISHING - DAY Gloomy and overcast. Storm clouds are brewing.
 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - STREET - DAY The Range Rover pulls down a crowded street.
 INT. RANGE ROVER - DAY Julia is sitting behind the wheel. Navigating traffic.
 Paul sits on the passenger side, leaning against the window, his face pressed against the glass. Somber and weak.
 THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD The twisted remains of a car accident has brought everything to a near standstill. Police are everywhere. An ambulance is parked along the curb, lights flashing.
 Julia leans forward to get a better look.
 JULIA'S POV
 A TEEN ACCIDENT VICTIM presses a white towel against his thigh. Blood gushes from it. A huge metal ROD sticks out of his leg.
 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - STREET - DAY The Range Rover moves past the shredded cars involved in the accident. Twisted metal covers the street.
 EXT. PACIFIC HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON Summer rain is falling. THUNDER ROLLS overhead.
 The Rover pulls up to the sidewalk, directly in front of an extremely opulent upper-class house.
 INT. RANGE ROVER - LATE AFTERNOON Julia turns to Paul who sits silently in the passenger seat. He doesn't move.
 JULIA
 Sure you don't want to come with me?
 PAUL
 I'm too sick. I need to stay someplace.
 JULIA
 I'm worried about leaving you here.
 PAUL
 (shrugs)
 It's not like he'll disown me.
 JULIA
 I know.
 PAUL
 And I really need him right now.
 More THUNDER. Julia kisses his cheek.
 JULIA
 I'm taking the cell phone. You call me.
 PAUL
 Promise.
 JULIA
 See a doctor.
 PAUL
 I will.
 Paul opens the passenger door and steps out into the rain. Julia watches him approach the house. Then, she pulls away from the curb.
 INT. PACIFIC HEIGHTS RESIDENCE - FOYER - LATE AFTERNOON A nice house. Large and affluent.
 The DOORBELL CHIMES. A few moments pass before a sullen FIGURE arrives at the front door and pulls it open, revealing ...
 PAUL
 standing on the front porch. His wet hair plastered to his forehead, rain streaming off his cheeks, his handsome face turned pallid and colorless.
 He manages a sheepish smile.
 PAUL
 Dad.
 Standing at the door is a man in his mid-fifties, MR. LOOMIS. A severe presence with a soured and weathered face. He stares at Paul without any sign of emotion.
 Paul notices the slight. He presses onward. A bit haltingly. Still hopeful and trying to connect.
 PAUL (cont'd)
 I was hoping we could talk ...
 (beat)
 I know we haven't done much of that recently, but still ...
 (beat)
 I was hoping.
 Beat.
 PAUL (cont'd)
 I'm in a lot of trouble. I'm getting sick ... and I was hoping ... 
 (beat)
 I was hoping you could help.
 Paul is having difficulty speaking. He's almost reduced to tears as he stands in the cold, stinging rain.
 PAUL (cont'd)
 I want to come home. Please Dad.
 (desperate)
 Please let me come home.
 A moment of silence.
 PAUL (cont'd)
 Please?
 His father stands steely eyed. His voice is icy and distant.
 MR. LOOMIS
 I don't know you.
 Paul is devastated. He can barely utter a sound.
 PAUL
 I'm your son.
 Agonizing beat.
 MR. LOOMIS
 I don't have a son.
 (then)
 I don't know you.
 He slowly closes the door. Paul begins weeping openly.
 PAUL
 Dad ...
 The door is shut in his face. Nothing can be heard except for the rain falling outside.
 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - MARKET - LATE AFTERNOON
 Julia is standing near the entrance. Waiting patiently.
 A figure across the street catches Julia's attention -- a HOMELESS MAN stumbling down the sidewalk, talking to himself, shaking a rattle.
 VOICE (O.S.) Julia?
 Julia turns around, searching, not immediately recognizing the figure that briskly approaches her --
 It's Terry. But her once perfect appearance has become harsh and drawn. Her blonde hair has been colored dark brown. There are sagging circles under her eyes. Her skin is colorless. She moves quickly. Nervously.
 Julia is shocked.
 JULIA
 Terry?
 Terry's hands tremble.
 TERRY
 I'm glad you came. You don't have any idea how scared I've been.
 JULIA
 Why did you change your hair?
 Terry is about to answer when a BABY starts crying in the market. Fear takes control of her face.
 TERRY
 We can't stay here.
 JULIA
 Why?
 TERRY
 Where are you parked?
 JULIA
 On the street.
 TERRY
 Good. If we keep moving, they might have trouble tracking us.
 Terry takes Julia's arm and leads her out of the market.
 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - STREET - CONTINUOUS Terry is moving at a swift pace. She keeps looking back over her shoulder as Julia tries to keep up. Rain drenches them.
 JULIA
 What the hell is going on? Where's Sam?
 TERRY
 He's dead.
 This almost sends Julia reeling. Her mouth falls open.
 JULIA
 What?
 TERRY
 There's three things you should remember. Three things.
 JULIA
 What happened to Sam?
 TERRY
 First, whenever you see a baby or a kid crying, keep moving. Children can sense them. That's your warning.
 JULIA
 Warning against who?
 TERRY
 Second, they can control anything electrical or mechanical. Lamps. Cars. Phones. 
 JULIA
 Terry, you're not making any sense.
 TERRY
 Third -- they can change things. They can make you disappear. 
 JULIA
 Tell me what happened to Sam.
 TERRY
 I am telling you.
 (terrified)
 They took him. They made him disappear.
 Julia stops walking. Speechless.
 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - COFFEE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON A young COLLEGE STUDENT is typing on his powerbook, oblivious to the TRANSIENT sitting on the sidewalk, head buried in his knees, a sign at his feet reading "HELP ME."
 CLOSE ON THE POWERBOOK. A soft whirring noise seeping from the computer as the student types.
 The WHIRRING becomes the HUMMING OF MACHINES.
 The Range Rover appears on the street and moves past.
 TERRY (V.O.) They take away your identity. People stop remembering you. Your place in society vanishes.
 INT. RANGE ROVER - SAN FRANCISCO - MOVING Julia is behind the wheel. Terry is devouring a cigarette.
 TERRY
 That's how they get you. By making people not even care about you anymore.
 JULIA
 Did you try Sam's parents? Did you get the right number this time?
 TERRY
 The number I called at the bus station was his parents.
 (cryptic)
 We didn't hit a dog on the road.
 JULIA
 But I saw it.
 TERRY
 They switched bodies.
 JULIA
 Who are "they?" A cult? Killers?
 Terry starts laughing to herself. Tears welling in her eyes. Hopeless. Terrified.
 TERRY
 You have no idea. No idea what you're dealing with.
 (then)
 They don't even belong here. They're like ... like machines. That's what Sam said. Like machines with all this skin and moving parts.
 JULIA
 They're machines?
 TERRY
 Monsters. They're monsters, Julia.
 Julia stops at a light.
 A YOUNG GUY crosses the street in front of them. He's just a yuppie with a cell phone. But Terry stiffens in her seat, watching him suspiciously.
 Then, almost as an aside, he winks at her.
 TERRY (cont'd)
 Drive.
 JULIA
 I can't. There's a red.
 TERRY
 Then make a right. Just keep driving.
 Julia is growing frightened by Terry's paranoia.
 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - STREET - LATE AFTERNOON The Rover makes a right turn and cruises down another block.
 INT. RANGE ROVER - LATE AFTERNOON Terry keeps her eyes riveted on the PEOPLE on the sidewalk. She's practically in tears.
 TERRY
 Remember when we hit that thing with the car? 
 (hushed)
 It wasn't an accident. It was a set-up. They planned it all along.
 JULIA
 How do you know this?
 TERRY
 Sam told me. He figured everything out.
 JULIA
 Why are they coming after us? What do they want with us?
 TERRY
 They have flesh and metal parts in their bodies. Sometimes they shed what they don't need. But other parts keep getting worn out or lost. So they take people constantly to get new parts.
 JULIA
 (soft)
 That's not possible.
 TERRY
 They wear the skin. That's why you don't notice them. Half of the time they're wearing people's skin. Or they're hiding in dark places. Alleys. Closets.
 Julia is horrified.
 JULIA
 Terry ... please stop.
 TERRY
 They take other parts too. Whatever they need. They're scavengers. No sense of compassion. No remorse.
 JULIA
 I don't believe this.
 TERRY
 That's why they came after us. They got Joey first. At the cabin.
 Julia is dumbfounded. 
 JULIA
 Joey?
 TERRY
 That's what Sam saw. That's why he left. He woke up and got a look at them -- at what they were doing to Joey ...
 JULIA
 Terry ...
 TERRY
 Stripping him ... taking his skin off ...
 Julia pulls over to the curb and stops.
 JULIA
 Who is Joey? What are you talking about?
 TERRY
 (amazed)
 You don't remember?
 JULIA
 No.
 TERRY
 There were five of us. He came up in his own car. He was Paul's best friend -- they always wore the same thing for Christ sakes.
 JULIA
 There were only four of us. You. Me. Paul. Sam.
 Terry is shaking now. Complete fright.
 TERRY
 They got to you. They got to you.
 JULIA
 Nobody got to me.
 Terry starts collecting her things.
 TERRY
 Look, could you drop me off at my brother's apartment? I need to pick up some things before I go to the airport.
 JULIA
 Where are you going?
 TERRY
 To see my parents.
 JULIA
 You can't just leave.
 Terry starts weeping. Grabbing her legs and squeezing them.
 TERRY
 They put things in my legs so they can track me. It hurts.
 JULIA
 (very concerned)
 Terry? What can I do to help you?
 Terry takes her hand. Her eyes pleading.
 TERRY
 Remember me. Please remember me.
 From the street outside the car, the sound of a TODDLER CRYING can be heard. Terry's head snaps around. She stares out the windshield at the screaming child.
 TERRY (cont'd)
 They found me again.
 Before Julia can react, Terry bolts from the car.
 JULIA
 Terry!
 Julia pursues.
 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - STREET - LATE AFTERNOON Julia pushes and shoves her way along the sidewalk. Terry is running like a madwoman. Pure unabated terror.
 Terry rushes down into a subway entrance. Julia follows.
 INT. SUBWAY STATION - LATE AFTERNOON People are crowded on the platform, waiting as a BART train rushes into the station.
 The doors open. Passengers move off the train. Others get on.
 Julia rushes down the stairs and pushes past the arriving commuters. There's no sign of Terry. Julia keeps searching. Looks right. Then left. Finally, she spots Terry boarding the BART train.
 JULIA
 Terry! Wait!
 Julia rushes forward, squirming through the crowd, until she reaches the doors just as they SLAM CLOSED. She looks through the windows, trying to find Terry amongst the crowd inside.
 The train starts to move.
 Standing at one of the train's passenger windows, his face and palms pressed against the glass, is --
 THE BLOND BOY IN THE SUPERMAN SHIRT. Staring directly at her. Dark circles around his eyes.
 He smiles at Julia.
 His teeth are made of metal.
 Julia stands thunderstruck. The BOY in the window moves past.
 The train shoots into the awaiting tunnel. Julia is left standing frozen and immobile on the platform.
 Near the subway entrance, a HOMELESS MAN with HOOKS FOR HANDS is convulsing as he sits against the wall. Eyes wide open. Shaking horribly and staring at nothing.
 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT Quiet and dimly lit. Several of the lights are burnt out, leaving the hallway drowning in shadows.
 The elevator doors open. Terry exits and moves quickly down the hallway. Her face is terrified. Sick.
 She arrives at an apartment. Terry fumbles with her keys.
 A soft THUMPING in the hallway. Deep and hollow. Terry spins around, the keys JINGLING in her hand.
 Nothing there. The hall appears to be empty and dark. One of the lights overhead is flickering and buzzing softly, providing scant illumination.
 She takes a step back ...
 A soft TINKLING sound at her feet. Terry looks down to find a few pieces of METAL littering the floor. Nuts and bolts. Rods. Alien in design.
 Terry's paranoia rises to a fever pitch. She turns the key in the lock. Opens the front door.
 INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 Terry shuts the door. Locks it. Switches on the lights. Drops her KEYS and CELL PHONE on a coffee table.
 She moves briskly into --
 INT. APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT An open suitcase on the bed. Terry snatches up a PLANE TICKET and jams the ticket folder into her purse. Slams the suitcase closed.
 INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Terry leaves the bedroom, carrying the suitcase, and walks straight towards the front door. She collects her keys and her cell phone from the table.
 The lights in the apartment simultaneously go out.
 Terry is caught entirely off guard. She spins around to face the living room. Nobody's there. Nothing.
 SOMETHING BANGS AT THE FRONT DOOR. A STEADY POUNDING. THE BANGING GOES ON FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN STOPS DEAD. Terry's breathing quickens. She puts the suitcase down.
 A crack of THUNDER reverberates outside.
 Moving with the cautious steps of a small child, she walks towards the front door. Foot by foot. The only sound is her FRIGHTENED BREATHING. She arrives at the peephole and looks out into the empty hall.
 SOMETHING STARES BACK AT HER THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE. Moving right in front of the door. One of its yellow eyes piercing through ... surrounded by midnight skin pierced with metal bolts and rods.
 TERRY SCREAMS HER LUNGS OUT. The DOOR RATTLES like it's going to break off its hinges. Something SLAMS REPEATEDLY against the wood.
 Terry tears through the apartment, feet POUNDING. She rushes into the bedroom.
 The front door in the living room BREAKS OPEN.
 INT. APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS Terry SLAMS the bedroom door and locks it. Backs away towards the bed, when ...
 A HAND REACHES OUT FROM UNDER IT ... Grabbing hold of her ankle. Fused together from rotting flesh, human parts, and metal pieces. Terry pitches forward, SCREAMING, falling to her hands and knees.
 The hand starts dragging her under the bed.
 Terry kicks and claws on the floor. Somehow manages to free herself from the hand's grip. She goes for the window and pulls it open. Steps outside.
 The entire bed is OVERTURNED and tossed aside.
 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT Terry is immediately drenched by the storm. The door within her bedroom can be heard CRASHING OPEN, followed by a ROARING unlike anything on this earth.
 Terry rushes down the fire escape, FEET BANGING on the metal steps. But she stops dead in her tracks when she notices --
 SEVERAL FIGURES ... Standing in the alley far below. Looking up at her. Waiting.
 A sound rises up behind her. THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS BANGING DOWN THE FIRE ESCAPE IN PURSUIT. TERRY
 (horrified)
 Oh God ...
 Terry desperately goes to a window. She pulls it open, stepping inside, THE BANGING FOOTSTEPS RIGHT BEHIND HER. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT The apartment floor is being renovated. Plastic tarps cover the doors and windows. Terry races through the hallway, SCREAMING WILDLY as she POUNDS on the doors.
 TERRY
 HELP ME! PLEASE HELP!!! Terry rockets around the corner. She presses the elevator door button frantically.
 The sound of CROAKING and HISSING fills the hallway.
 The elevator doors slide open.
 Terry lunges into the elevator, hits for the lobby, then starts BEATING FRENZIEDLY on the door close button.
 Several shadows appear in the hallway. Getting closer.
 Terry SCREAMS WILDLY and keeps pounding the button.
 The bizarre HISSING becomes a FRIGHTFUL ROAR just as ...
 The elevator doors pull shut. Closing on the unseen things in the hallway.
 INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
 The car starts going down. Floor lights blink above the door.
 8 ... 7 ... 6 ...
 Terry punches out 9-1-1 on the  cell phone's keypad. Nothing comes through the receiver. Only static.
 TERRY
 Come on ... come on ...
 She dials again.
 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... More static over the cell phone. Terry has started crying in anguish when the elevator comes to an abrupt halt.
 The doors stay closed.
 Terry looks above the elevator doors. The floor light reads --
 "B" (Basement)
 Terry starts pressing for the lobby. The elevator won't move. She presses the "door open" button, the alarm button, anything at all. Nothing responds.
 TERRY (cont'd)
 HELP! SOMEBODY! HELP ME!!! Nothing. Futile silence. She's about to try dialing on the cell phone again, when ...
 WHUMP. A heavy thudding sound above the elevator car roof. The light overhead flickers like a candle. Terry gazes at the failing light, then tracks her eyes towards the trap door in the roof.
 A few more hollow THUMPS.
 Terry is petrified. She takes a step backward. The light flashes off and on again ... creating a strobe light effect.
 Behind her, the elevator doors silently pull open.
 Terry's gaze is still focussed on the ceiling trap door. Behind her, the basement is pitch black. She continues moving backwards towards the open elevator doors, step after step, completely unaware ...
 UNTIL SOMETHING LEAPS OUT OF THE DARK AND GRABS HER. In the moment it takes to draw a breath and scream, it's already over.
 The light goes out.
 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT The lobby is vacant and terribly still. The elevator doors remain closed, a few THUMPING sounds coming from the shaft far below.
 Then nothing.
 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - STREET - NIGHT The sound of a PHONE LINE RINGING. Julia is sitting inside of the parked Range Rover, the cell phone pressed against her ear.
 MAN'S VOICE
 (from phone)
 Hello?
 JULIA
 Hello ... is this Mr. Alba?
 MAN
 Yes.
 JULIA
 I'm sorry to call you so late ...
 MAN
 (overlapping)
 Who is this?
 JULIA
 This is Julia Levin. We met a few days ago at graduation. I'm a friend of Terry's.
 Beat.
 MAN
 Who?
 JULIA
 Terry. Your daughter?
 More silence.
 JULIA (cont'd)
 Hello?
 MAN
 I don't have a daughter.
 JULIA
 Excuse me?
 MAN
 You must have the wrong number.
 JULIA
 (beat)
 No, this is the right number ...
 CLICK! The MAN hangs up the phone on the other line.
 JULIA (cont'd)
 Hello?
 Julia stares at the cell phone in stunned confusion, until a sharp pain courses through her hand. She FLINCHES and nearly drops the phone. Julia checks her pricked finger.
 The WOUND HAS GROWN. An infected red spot with a open hole in the center. The skin actually seems to be rotting around it, allowing the wound to expand like a sinkhole.
 INT. CORNER MARKET - NIGHT A small box of aspirin are taken from the shelf.
 Paul tightens his fist around the box, shutting his eyes, fighting the excruciating the pain in his head. He takes a deep breath and moves to the register.
 CASHIER
 Need anything else?
 PAUL
 (weak)
 No.
 The cashier rings him up.
 CASHIER
 Four thirty-two.
 Paul flips open his wallet. His face drops into shock.
 There's nothing inside his wallet. No credit cards. No money. No driver's license. Not a thing.
 CASHIER (cont'd)
 Something wrong?
 Paul can barely speak.
 PAUL
 Um ... I must've brought the wrong wallet. Sorry.
 Paul walks out of the store.
 EXT. CORNER STORE - NIGHT Paul stops outside, running his fingers through his hair, digging them into his skull.
 PAUL
 (shaking his head)
 That's not possible ... that's not possible ...
 A SHAPE grabs his shoulder. Paul spins around.
 A HOMELESS BAG LADY stands behind him. Pleading eyes. Dishevelled and caked with grime. She holds up the drooping sleeve where a hand once was.
 BAG LADY
 Help me. They took my hand.
 Paul stumbles back. Horrified.
 BAG LADY (cont'd)
 (weeping)
 They took my hand ...
 Paul turns and starts running. Faster than he's ever run in his life. Disappearing down the dark street.
 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT Small and trendy. Young clientele.
 INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT Julia sits at an empty booth. Staring at various black and white photographs of graduation. The four friends are sitting together on the back porch, smiling for the camera. She squeezes her finger to help numb the pain, her mind turning.
 JULIA
 (to herself)
 Joey ...
 (then)
 Terry, what were you talking about?
 Julia flips to another photograph. A picture of Julia, Paul, Sam, and Terry on the UCLA campus. Dressed for graduation.
 Julia shakes her head. Her eyes are locked on the faces of her friends.
 JULIA (cont'd)
 There's four of us. There's only four of us.
 Beat.
 She studies the picture ... Beat. Julia sits up in her chair. 
 A revelation crosses her face.
 JULIA (cont'd)
 (a whisper)
 Who took the picture?
 Julia looks like she's falling into a deep hole. Her mind is racing for answers.
 FLASHBACK: INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - DAY JULIA
 I've been fantasizing about a guy.
 TERRY
 Anyone we know?
 FLASHBACK: EXT. CABIN - FRONT DRIVEWAY - NIGHT The BLOND STUDENT sits back on the hood of a sports car. The tattooed "S" insignia visible on his shoulder.
 TERRY (V.O.) (cont'd)
 There were five of us. He came up in his own car.
 FLASHBACK: EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - GARDEN - DAYstyle="TEXT-TRANSFORM: none"> Paul smiling his killer grin at Julia. Wearing his white shirt and gold and blue striped tie. TERRY (V.O.) He was Paul's best friend -- FLASHBACK: INT. SAM'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY The BLOND STUDENT loosens his gold and blue striped tie from his white shirt collar as he undresses. TERRY (V.O.) (cont'd) -- they always wore the same thing for Christ sakes. INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT CLOSE ON Julia's HORRIFIED FACE. JULIA (completely lost) No ... FLASHBACK: INT. SAM'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY The BLOND STUDENT standing half-naked in front of Julia. Holding a pair of ripped jeans. JULIA (cont'd) I'm sorry. I was just using the ... (laughs) Really. I'm sorry. STUDENT I'll forgive you this once. FLASHBACK: INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Julia turns her head and gazes at ... THE BLOND STUDENT ... Sitting in a chair. Smoking a cigarette. Smiling down at her. TERRY (V.O.) It's just a fantasy. FLASHBACK: INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Candles have been placed around the room. Paul and Terry are asleep on the floor. Blood drips over the SUPERMAN TATTOO on Joey's shoulder. Julia slowly awakens to the sounds of JOEY SCREAMING over sickening RIPPING SOUNDS like cloth being torn in half. There are silhouettes on the wall of THREE FIGURES tearing off pieces of something in the room. Large flaps. Chunks. Moving rapidly and ferociously. Julia spots Sam SCREAMING across the room. SAM (shrieking) JOEY! Julia turns her head in the direction of the ripping and tearing sounds. Her eyes slowly widen as her mouth drops into a soundless, petrified look of horror. A hand with midnight skin, six fingers, and punctured with steel rods covers her eyes. INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT A plate SMASHES on the floor. Julia is jolted out of her thought, looks over to find a WAITER picking up the pieces. The lights flicker in the shop. This unnerves Julia completely. She starts gathering the photographs together. She becomes aware of the pain in her finger again. Looks at the scab. JULIA (a whisper) Terry's legs ... Paul's headaches ... A thought crashes like thunder in her head. JULIA (cont'd) Oh no ... Julia quickly grabs a knife from the table. She gets up and walks straight to the ladies restroom. INT. COFFEE SHOP - RESTROOM - NIGHT Cramped and dirty. Julia holds her finger over the sink. With the point of the knife's blade, she begins digging into her finger. The pain is immediate. Julia grimaces, tears forming in her eyes, as the wound blossoms bright red. Blood drips into the sink. Julia drops the knife into the sink and pinches the wound. Squeezing hard. A speck of metal flashes inSIDE the wound. Julia continues squeezing, tears rolling, fingernails digging into the wound as ... THE TIP OF A METAL SPLINTER PUSHES UP THROUGH THE BLOOD. Julia starts pulling it out of her finger. The splinter rises from the wound ... and rises ... and rises ... More blood spatters into the sink. Julia is GASPING and CRYING as the pain becomes excruciating. The glittering splinter is five inches long and growing. The splinter is pulled out. It's seven inches long. Julia drops the splinter into the sink. She moves away from the counter, back towards the living room, unbelieving, horrified ... She stumbles towards the door. INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT Julia walks out of the restroom. Stops cold. Everyone in the coffee shop is staring at her. The customers. The waiters. The lights are dimming. A lack of power. Julia forces herself to move. She goes to her table, picks up the photographs, and suddenly notices that in the graduation pictures -- SAM AND TERRY HAVE DISAPPEARED. ALMOST AS IF THEY NEVER WERE A PART OF THE PHOTOS. PAUL AND JULIA ARE TOGETHER IN EVERY PICTURE -- ALONE. Julia grabs the photographs and turns around. The customers in the coffee shop are standing now. Their eyes are dark shadows. Something about the way they stand is completely unnatural. All wrong. Panic begins to settle in. Julia quickly walks to the door. WAITER Julia? She turns. The waiter stands behind her. Eyes burning. WAITER (cont'd) (menacing) Why'd you take it out? That's enough. Julia gets the hell out of there. EXT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT Julia bolts out the door and rushes across the street. She reaches her car, disarms the alarm, and gets inside. INT. RANGE ROVER - NIGHT Julia drops the photos into the passenger seat. Starts the car. The CELL PHONE RINGS. She answers it. JULIA Hello? EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - MARKET STREET - NIGHT Paul on a pay phone. There's panic in his voice. PAUL Julia. It's Paul. JULIA Where are you? PAUL At a pay phone. JULIA What about your Dad? PAUL He wouldn't let me in. He told me he didn't have a son. (then) Julia, everything in my wallet's gone. Credit cards. Money. Driver's license. Everything. INT. RANGE ROVER - NIGHT INTERCUT between Julia and Paul. JULIA Then it's already started. PAUL What's started? Terrified beat. Julia trains her eyes on the coffee shop. JULIA Listen. There's not much time. They're watching me right now. PAUL Who is? JULIA Just listen to me. There were five of us at the cabin. (beat) Your best friend was with us. Joey. He had blond hair. He had a Superman tattoo on his shoulder. PAUL I don't know anyone named Joey. JULIA That's because they erased your memory. If you remembered him ... if you remembered what they did to him, you might run like Sam. That would make it hard for them to hunt you down. PAUL Where's Sam? JULIA He's dead. PAUL What? JULIA They killed him. PAUL They? JULIA Monsters. Paul can barely stand up. His skull is pounding. PAUL Monsters? JULIA They really exist, Paul. They use human beings for parts. Like machines. PAUL I can't take this. JULIA What you saw in the forest wasn't a hallucination. They've been watching us the entire time. Following us. PAUL I can't -- JULIA There's a tracking device in your head. Right where the scab is. Her words sound chilling in the night air. Foreboding and deadly. Paul is filled with dread. PAUL My head? JULIA They want us for parts. That's why they're tracking us. They take the skin and wear it. PAUL Just let me think for a second. JULIA They already got Sam and Terry. And now they're making us disappear. (then) Think about it. Your wallet. Your father. PAUL It can't be true. JULIA It is true! We're next! Paul becomes upset. He nods with grave understanding. PAUL What are we gonna do? JULIA We have to get back home. They're all over the place, but we can make it. PAUL Okay. JULIA Where are you? PAUL Just below Union Square. Right near the cable cars. Where they turn them around. JULIA All right. There's a subway station near there. PAUL I can see it. JULIA Wait for me. At the top of the stairs. I'll be there in five minutes. PAUL Okay. JULIA I love you. PAUL (in pain) I love you. Please hurry. Paul hangs up. INT. RANGE ROVER - NIGHT Julia tosses down the cell phone. The car engine STOPS. JULIA What now? She tries to start the car, but it the engine won't turn over. Just as she's about to try a second time, she looks out the windshield. SEVERAL DARK SHAPES STAND IN FRONT OF THE ROVER. WATCHING. THE CUSTOMERS FROM THE COFFEE SHOP. SOME ARE STANDING RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR. OTHERS ARE SILHOUETTED IN THE STREET. Julia frantically tries to start the car again. No dice. She rips open the door. EXT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT Julia takes off running. The SHAPES pursue. EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - STREET - NIGHT Julia turns a corner and runs straight into an intersection. A HORN BLARES as a BUS barrels towards her. Julia barely leaps out of the way as the bus SCREECHES to a halt, nearly running her down. She rises to her feet as the bus starts moving again. Several of the passengers have their faces pressed against the windows. Watching her. Dark circles around their eyes. Julia keeps going. The PURSUING CUSTOMERS from the coffee shop are marooned on the opposite corner by traffic. They stand motionless. Watching her escape. EXT. SUBWAY STATION ENTRANCE - STAIRS - NIGHT A long flight of stone stairs leads down to the BART and MUNI stations below. Paul sits down on the steps. Looking. Waiting. EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - MARKET STREET - NIGHT Julia charges down the sidewalk. Weaving past bystanders. As she runs, Julia brushes past THE LITTLE GIRL from Sam's graduation party. Standing abnormally. She watches Julia race off into the crowd with cold, soulless eyes. EXT. SUBWAY STATION ENTRANCE - STAIRS - NIGHT Paul is sitting still. His head cradled in his hands. A SHAPE appears in front of him. Paul looks up. Smiles. PAUL Hey ... EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - MARKET STREET - NIGHT Julia races across the intersection and streaks towards the subway station entrance. EXT. SUBWAY STATION ENTRANCE - STAIRS - NIGHT Paul is nowhere to be found. The stairs are empty. JULIA Paul?! Julia looks around desperately. She can't find him in the crowds on the sidewalks. She turns and looks down the stairs towards the open entryway to the subway system. Paul is walking through the entryway. A friend with him is patting him on the shoulder. Just after Paul has disappeared through the entryway, the friend turns around. IT'S SAM. His lips are parched, pitch black eyes bulging, his features somehow more twisted and unfamiliar. His face twitches as he stares coldly at Julia, and he runs. Small pieces of metal drop from Sam's pants legs as he disappears through the entryway. JULIA (cont'd) PAUL! She frantically rushes down the stairs. JULIA (cont'd) THAT'S NOT SAM!!! PAUL!!! She rushes through the entryway. INT. SUBWAY STATION - UPPER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS The upper level is almost completely empty save a few kids and late-night commuters. Julia is hysterical now. The first time we've seen her lose control. She looks around frantically. Spots Paul and Sam going down the escalator together. JULIA Paul! Julia rushes towards the turnstiles. Jumps them. A GUARD steps out of his booth. GUARD Hey! You need a ticket! Hey!!! She keeps going. INT. SUBWAY STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT Paul and Sam reach the bottom of the escalators. They move towards the platform. The lights start twinkling. Losing power. PAUL (confused) I thought you said she'd be here. Sam smirks back, mute ... and GRABS HIM BY THE THROAT. The lights GO OUT. INT. SUBWAY STATION - ESCALATOR - CONTINUOUS Julia bolts down the escalator. INT. SUBWAY STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT She reaches the platform and rushes to the center. There's nobody else down there. The lights are flickering. Slowly, they return to normal. JULIA (calling) Paul?! No response. A train RUMBLES through the station. Julia moves to the opposite side and looks. Resting on the tracks, leading into the tunnel, are a trail of metal pieces. Exactly like the ones from the cabin. Julia looks back. The GUARD is coming down the escalator. Without hesitation, she jumps down to the tracks. Moving quickly and bending down to avoid being seen, she rushes into the awaiting subway tunnel. INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT Drowned in shadows. An unnatural silence fills the tunnel. Julia moves cautiously amongst the tracks. Eyes scanning the darkness. Following the trail of discarded metal. A SHARP HISSING. Julia spins around. A few more HISSING SOUNDS rise from electrical sparks on the tracks. Blue light flashes within the tunnel. Then, it ceases. She turns back to continue her search, wind sifting through her hair, when she finds -- A LARGE HOLE At the base of the subway wall. Julia reaches down and palms a few metal pieces at the base of the hole. She peers inside. A dull flickering light flashes within. Julia takes a calming breath. She moves into the hole. INT. CRAWL SPACE - CONTINUOUS A narrow and claustrophobic space. Julia squirms through the confined space, pulling herself towards the flashing light. INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Julia pulls herself through another opening and finds herself standing in the threshold of a corridor. Both the walls and floor are constructed of crude metal grates and long pipes. Anything could be hiding within. Waiting. She moves slowly into the corridor, a STROBE LIGHT flickering around her. She gropes towards another opening. The sound of her TERRIFIED BREATHING is slowly replaced by the RHYTHMIC HUMMING OF MACHINES. INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS Steam rises from the pipes. Bathing the stairwell in mist. The fluorescent lights above are glimmering in the darkness. Julia stands at the top of the stairwell. She can't even see the bottom of the steps. Carefully, she starts moving down. Her hand gripping the metal railing. The HUMMING OF MACHINES grows louder ... Her foot accidentally kicks a few pieces of metal on the steps. A light CLINKING as the metal scatters down ahead of her. The HUMMING OF MACHINES is closer now. Just beyond the sheathing clouds of blue and white mist. The metal railing is suddenly replaced by HUMAN BONES. Julia pulls her hand away from the railing. Looks skyward and discovers more BONES are being used to brace the ceiling along with metal beams. She stops. Shutting her eyes in fear. Starts to lose control. From somewhere within, she manages to steady herself. Keeps going through the awaiting steam curtain at the bottom. INT. MAIN HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS The steam parts to reveal a dark space. Cold and damp. Julia moves into the main hallway, stumbling through a hallway that can best be described as a living nightmare. Mammoth pipes and human skin has been fashioned together into a wall, pulsating with the HEARTBEAT OF MACHINES that saturates the entire hallway. Steam jets into the hallway intermittently from the pipes. Creating great clouds. Julia is beyond horrified. Her face registers a numbness. Complete and total astonishment. Human bones and body parts have been so expertly fashioned into the corridor that it's impossible to distinguish where the organic ends and the mechanical begins. She enters another corridor. Her face is struck by a JET OF HISSING STEAM. She presses onward. Slipping past the skulls and littered metal on the floor. Another BLAST OF STEAM. Something leaps out of the middle of it. Julia whirls back around a corner, pressing flat against the wall as a BLACK SHAPE moves through the steam. Unidentifiable features. Movements that suggest nothing by chaos and madness. The SHAPE HISSES and CROAKS in the hallway. Julia waits. She doesn't even breathe. The HISSING stops. She gradually turns to peek back into the hallway where the thing once stood. CLOSE ON JULIA'S EYES as she looks around the corner. The shape has disappeared. Carefully she keeps going forward. Drenched in water and sweat. Slipping through the steam clouds that mask another entrance. INT. LAIR - NIGHT A massive room where empty human skins are dangling from hooks, complete and preserved from head to toe. The skins sway and rock gently in the draft. Thousands of them. Julia moves towards the center of the room. A large OPERATING TABLE awaits. But the surface of the table is sunken like a water basin. Next to the table is a pedestal littered with BLOODY INSTRUMENTS. Cutting tools. Knives. Curved hooks. Julia notices that Paul's torn clothes are resting at the foot of the table. Shirt shredded to a rag. Sneakers orphaned nearby. Jeans spattered with blood. Her breathing quickens. Her heart POUNDING. She reaches the foot of the table. Paul is lying within the basin, completely naked and partially covered with LITTERED BODY PARTS. Organs and entrails. The basin is filled with water and blood. An immobile form is resting next to him. Julia moves quickly. She tries to wake him up. JULIA Paul. Paul, wake up. He stirs. His nose crinkles slightly. JULIA (cont'd) Wake up. She grabs him and lifts him up. He starts COUGHING. JULIA (cont'd) You've gotta hurry. (then) Here ... Julia grabs his jeans. She helps him slide down from the basin and he pulls them on. A skinned HAND grabs hers. Julia yelps a SCREAM. The other form -- a thing in the basin -- rises and turns. Slicked with blood. Empty sockets where the eyes should be. Mouth falling open. A horror that shouldn't be alive. Julia SCREAMS again. Her free hand grabs a HOOK from the pedestal and swings the blade into the thing's neck. Blood fountains up. The thing begins SHRIEKING. With Paul leaning on her for support, Julia rapidly heads for the door. INT. MAIN HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS Julia navigates her way through the hallways. Moving blindly through sudden JETS OF STEAM, the sound of MACHINES around them. Paul leans on her, his eyes remaining closed, COUGHING and stumbling. JULIA'S POV Racing through the halls. The steam clouds suddenly EXPLODING into her view. INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS Julia reaches the stairwell and helps Paul climb the steps. She looks back over her shoulder. Nothing behind them. INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Julia stops at the corridor opening. The strobe light FLASHES within. Clicking. The corridor looks empty. Nothing but pipes and shadows. JULIA We're almost there. Julia turns to Paul and finds a face with glaring yellow eyes and metal teeth. He stares back at her. A moment of sheer horror. Julia reels back into the corridor. Pressed flat against the wall. Sliding towards the crawl space opening. Paul starts advancing into the corridor. Grinning with teeth that flash with every click of the strobe light. She keeps sliding away ... He grabs his chest and RIPS IT OPEN, tearing the covering skin apart as he would a shirt. A menagerie of human bones and metal are revealed behind it. Julia tries to scream. Eyes wide. She can't make a sound. Paul tears the skin covering his chest wider. Pulling it away. Stripping himself clean. Julia reaches the crawl space. Sliding down. The last pieces Paul's skin are torn off. The thing that had been pretending to be Paul stands in his place. Only brief glimpses are allowed by the strobe light. An abysm of immemorial lunacy consisting of fashioned human parts and twisted metal. A human heart beating within exposed ribs. Bones combined with pulleys and rods. The face of a skull. A contradiction of all matter and cosmic order. Julia slips back into the crawl space. Still trying to scream. INT. CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT Julia drags herself through the crawl space. Moving quickly. Panicked. INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT Julia squeezes herself through the exposed hole. She kicks to her feet and tears off into the tunnel. INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - STATION OPENING - NIGHT Julia has almost reached the platform opening for the train. BEHIND HER, A CHORUS OF PURSUING MONSTROUS SCREAMS RISE UP WITHIN THE TUNNEL. INT. SUBWAY STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT Julia runs directly parallel to the subway platform. The lights alongside of her start flickering and go out, one by one, as she advances. THE HISSING AND SCREAMING CONTINUES TO RISE. She reaches the opposite tunnel and grabs hold of the platform, pulling herself up. The platform goes dark. Appearing out of the far tunnel are a DOZEN DARK SHAPES, scampering along the walls and running on all fours across the tracks. Their characteristics barely visible. Julia kicks back as the shrieking things bear down on her, yellow eyes flaring in the dark, metal teeth flashing. Julia tries to run for the escalator, but the things cover the walls behind the tracks. Ready to spring. Finally, one of the monsters does leap towards her ... AND IS SMASHED TO BITS BY AN APPROACHING BART TRAIN. Reducing the monster to a few vestiges of scattered metal. The other creatures on the tracks are also run down. Julia watches as the train RUMBLES past. And then, silence. Nothing is left except for a few swirling newspapers. The lights flicker and come back to life. Rising up to her feet, rescued from death by chance, Julia starts backing towards the escalator. Her eyes locked upon the darkened tunnel before she turns and races up. EXT. SUBWAY STATION ENTRANCE - STAIRS - NIGHT Rain has started falling again. Pelting the stairs. Julia dashes up the stairwell and sprints into the street. She doesn't look back. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - STREET - NIGHT The rain falls so heavily that it creates a dense, blue FOG which shrouds the entire street. Julia appears through the storm, running towards a telephone booth on the street corner. She rips open the door, steps inside, and slams the door shut. INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT She drops a few quarters into the phone. Dials. And waits. INT. LEVIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Dark and still. Lightning frames the windows. The picture of Julia and her mother rests near a phone as the line RINGS. Guy comes downstairs and answers the portable. GUY Hello? Static. GUY (cont'd) (bewildered) Is anyone there? INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT A flash of LIGHTNING outside. JULIA Daddy? ... It's Julia ... (beat) They might still be around ... feeding on power from the phone lines. Can you hear me? (beat) ... Dad? GUY (over phone) I can't hear you. Hello? Beat. JULIA Daddy, help me ... help me, please ... INT. LEVIN RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT More STATIC resounds over the phone. Guy hesitates a moment, then returns the portable to the cradle. INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT CLICK. The line is abruptly cut off. Julia begins to cry. She covers her face with her hands. The tears roll through her fingers. INT. LEVIN RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Guy stares at the phone for a moment.  A strange feeling. Something isn't right. He thinks a moment. Then shakes it off and heads upstairs, moving directly past the picture next to the phone. JULIA IS GONE. VANISHED FROM THE PICTURE WITHOUT A TRACE. ONLY HER MOTHER REMAINS. Lightning flashes across the picture's glass frame. DISSOLVE TO: INT. SAN FRANCISCO - SUBWAY STATION - DAY The afternoon rush of people trying to get home. A GROUP OF THREE COLLEGE STUDENTS come down the escalator into the station. CONNOR is among them, now eighteen and wearing a Berkeley sweatshirt. His friends are BARRY and MIKE. BARRY Why the hell didn't we bring the car? CONNOR You wanna pay for gas? BARRY Better than this shit. I hate BART. MIKE He has a point. I made the mistake of trying to use the bathroom. What do these people do? Stand with their ass hanging over the toilet and aim? Connor checks his watch. CONNOR We're late. Party started an hour ago. MIKE We'll make it. BARRY (trace of sarcasm) Yeah Connor. Relax. We might get there right after the kegs dry out. CONNOR (resigned) I should study anyway. A FEMALE VOICE calls out from across the platform. FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Connor? He turns around and scans the crowd, locating a ragged figure that moves quickly towards him. With her dirty clothing and sunken eyes, it takes a moment to register. This is Julia. Her skin is pale. Her hair is stringy and knotted. JULIA I've been looking for you. CONNOR What? BARRY (hushed) Great. MIKE Just ignore her. JULIA They tried to get me. Several times.   But I managed to get away. I've always managed to get away. A train rushes into the station. Connor is speechless. CONNOR I'm ... sorry .. JULIA But you'll help me. You will help me. Connor raises his hands and backs towards the train as the doors slide open. His friends are already aboard. CONNOR I'm sorry. JULIA No, wait ... it's Julia ... don't you remember? He gets into the train. His friends are laughing. Connor turns to his friends with a look of smirking disbelief.  CONNOR How the fuck did she know my name? BARRY She heard me say it. CONNOR Jesus Christ. JULIA (overlapping) It's Julia! I'm your sister! The doors slide closed in her face. INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY Julia begins beating on the doors to be heard. Connor and his friends are a little freaked but they're still laughing at her. JULIA PLEASE! CONNOR! I'M YOUR SISTER! The train starts to move. People inside move in front of the doors and block Julia's view of her brother. JULIA (cont'd) PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME! CONNOR! Julia runs alongside the train. Still beating on the doors. Her face awash with tears. JULIA (cont'd) THEY'RE GOING TO KILL ME!!! (shrieks) THEY ...!!!! The train picks up speed. Julia is left behind. The grinding of the wheels is heard as the train moves into the subway tunnel. The sound of machines drowns out every other sound and consumes all. BLACKOUT.     THE END

               In the winter of 1982 these men were commissioned by the 
               United States National Science Foundation to gather data 
               concerning the physical and natural sciences on the continent 
               of Antarctica.

                          THE MAIN COMPOUND OF U.S. OUTPOST #31

               The interior is a cramped and never ending maze of hallways, 
               passageways and doors which connect the many rooms and 
               compartments within the compound. Sturdy, but prefabricated 
               materials have been used in its construction.

               There is a laboratory. An infirmary. A kitchen and mess hall. 
               A communications room and sleeping quarters. Other cubicles 
               are for storage and supplies.

               The most spacious area of the building, and the main center 
               of activity, is the Rec Room. Of the many entrance ways to 
               this room can be seen the small work chambers with their 
               sophisticated computers and other scientific equipment.

               The below quarter houses the generator and still other 
               compartments for storage.

               A long underground tunnel connects the main compound to the 
               dog kennel.

               FADE IN:

               A STARRY BLACKNESS

               From out of the billions, the smallest of specks drives slowly 
               forward. It closes; getting larger; its features becoming 
               more identifiable: a vessel. Flip-flopping; out of control. 
               Its stern roaring with flame. It passes; its blue fire surging 
               into the screen.

                                       "THE THING"

               A thundering...

                                                                   FADE TO:

               BLIND AND FERAL WHITENESS

               ...Glacial desert... gusts of snow... superimpose:

                                  ANTARCTICA 1982 WINTER

               A SOUND

               Loud and strident. A helicopter streaks across frame. It 
               travels precariously close to the ground; its chassis battered 
               and swayed by the wind.

               INT. COPTER

               Red dials beam on the faces of two men. One carries a rifle 
               and searches the horizon with binoculars. The other pilots. 
               Their unkempt faces, their blazing eyes notate a wildness. 
               They bark at each other in some Scandinavian tongue. Two men 
               arguing like mad and desperate children.

               The man with the binoculars sights something.

               EXT. HORIZON - BINOCULARS' POV - A DOG

               It turns and snarls at the craft some fifteen hundred yards 
               to its rear. Then whirls and gallops off. A gun blast kicks 
               up snow at its heels.

               INT. COPTER

               Another blast of rifle fire as the man takes issue with his 
               prey. The pilot slams a fist into his gunman friend and 
               implores for better aim. The craft swoops lower and the engine 
               is put into full throttle.

               EXT. HILL - THE DOG

               running feverishly up and over a hill of ice. A weather- 
               beaten, wooden sign sticks up on the other side:

                     U.S. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION -- OUTPOST #31

               A rifle blast kicks up more snow.

               EXT. COMPOUND OF U.S. OUTPOST #31

               A large, almost snow-covered building. Not far from that a 
               tall, meteorological balloon tower.

               A scattering of several small shacks at varying distances 
               from the main compound. The smaller hovels are connected by 
               wooden planked walkways and steadying ropes. Multicolored 
               pennants stick put of the snow marking pathways and directions 
               to outdoor experiments.

               A tractor and two helicopters sit idle, covered with mounds 
               of continuously mounting snow.

               TWO MEN, NORRIS AND BENNINGS

               standing some thirty yards from the main building are in the 
               process of letting up a large red balloon. Childs, a hefty 
               black man, is twenty yards away tinkering with a snowmobile. 
               Their beards are caked with ice. It is winter and it is harsh.

               The faint sound of the copter turns their attention.

               THE COPTER

               flying ever lower now. The man with the gun leans dangerously 
               outside and fires away at the dog as it nears the outpost.

               THE MEN

               outside the compound look to one another, incredulous.

               THE COPTER

               much too low now, and chastised by the wind, attempts a high-
               speed landing, directly on the heels of the sprinting dog.  
               It bounces violently on the hard-packed surface.

               Once. Twice. Passing the dog.

               A third bounce sends it skidding. It flips; its blades 
               snapping off like toothpicks. It lands belly-up, soundless 
               except for the whine of its engine.

               The man with the gun rolls out before the explosion.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND

               The half a dozen men, playing cards, monitoring equipment, 
               listening to music -- spring to their feet, startled.

               EXT. COMPOUND

               The dog reaches Norris and Bennings, as they awkwardly wade 
               through the snow, toward the downed copter.

               THE SURVIVOR

               of the crash, his eyes crazed with determination, struggles 
               to his feet. Heedless of his companion, he double-times his 
               way to the men and the dog. He reloads his gun and bellows 
               in his Scandinavian tongue.

               Norris and Bennings have no idea what he is saying.

               The survivor waves his arms as if shooting them off, screaming 
               as he does so; his face now caked with blood.

               The two men are bewildered. The dog jumps up, licking and 
               pawing them, imploring for safety.

               Blam!! The visitor fires. The men jump back in disbelief.

                                     NORRIS
                         What the fu...

               Blam! Blam! The crazed visitor screams and fires as he stalks 
               after them. His countenance ablaze, mad. Ice and snow kick 
               up about the terrified Americans. A bullet smacks into the 
               dog's hip, sending it skidding and howling in pain.

               Childs, the black man by the snowmobile, takes cover, diving 
               behind his machine.

               Bennings is hit. Norris pulls, drags him back toward the 
               compound. The dog crawls along beside them.

               The intruder is relentless in his assail. He runs, screaming, 
               firing, screaming, reloading and firing.

               INT. COMPOUND

               Total confusion. Some watch helplessly through the small, 
               fogged-up and translucent windows. Others try to mobilize 
               grabbing for their heavy jackets.

               CLOSE ON A .357 MAGNUM

               as it efficiently breaks through a windowpane and into the 
               cold. A steady hand grips it firmly.

               THE SCANDINAVIAN

               getting closer. Kablam! Suddenly, his head jerks back. He 
               falls to his knees and then face down into the snow.

               NORRIS AND BENNINGS

               stare blankly, but relievedly at the fallen man. The dog 
               whimpers in pain.

               CHILDS

               pokes his head out from under the snowmobile.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND - REC ROOM

               The rumbling of voices fades. The men adjust their eyes to 
               station manager Garry, as he extracts his gun from the broken 
               window, relieves it of its spent shell and puts it away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BURNING COPTER

               Several men spray snow on the burning wreckage. There is no 
               hope for the pilot.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPOUND

               CLOSE ON THE PALLID FACE OF THE SCANDINAVIAN INTRUDER

               A neat round hole is set in the middle of his forehead.

               Station manager Garry holds up something akin to an ID.

                                     GARRY
                         Norwegian... Jans Bolen.

               Fuchs, a young and sensitive-looking biologist, stands closest 
               to the large area map of Antarctica. Several men sit and 
               stand around viewing the body that lies on two brought-
               together card-tables.

                                     FUCHS
                         Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.

                                     GARRY
                         How far's that?

                                     FUCHS
                         'Bout eighty kilos southwest.

                                     GARRY
                              (surprised)
                         That far?

               Garry directs his attention to Childs, the large black man 
               who had been working on the snowmobile. Next to him sits 
               Norris, the rugged-looking, fortyish, geophysicist, who was 
               one of the men being shot at.

                                     GARRY
                         You catch anything he was saying?

                                     CHILDS
                         Am I starting to look Norwegian to 
                         you, Bwana?

               Garry motions inquiringly to Norris.

                                     NORRIS
                         Yeah. I caught that he wanted the 
                         better part of my ass to come apart.

               INT. INFIRMARY

               Dr. Cooper, mid-forties, works on the outstretched leg of 
               Bennings, the meteorologist. Clark, the dog handler, is 
               mending the hip of the wounded dog off in the corner.

               Bennings lets out with an ouch.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Don't "ouch" me. Two stitches. It 
                         just grazed you.

               He helps a shaken Bennings up off the table.

                                     BENNINGS
                         What in the hell were they doing...?  
                         Flying that low... shooting at a 
                         dog... at us...

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Stir crazy. Cabin fever... Who knows.

               The dog yelps and whimpers as Clark tries to calm him.

                                     CLARK
                         I'll be here a while. Shell's pretty 
                         deep.

               INT. RADIO ROOM

               Blair, senior biologist, fifty, balding, leans against the 
               entrance door.

               He looks on as the young, bored-looking radio operator, 
               Sanchez, attends to his equipment. Bursts of static.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         It's no go.

                                     BLAIR
                         Well, get to somebody. Anybody. We've 
                         got to report this mess.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Look, I haven't been able to reach 
                         shit in two weeks. Doubt if anybody's 
                         talked to anybody on the whole 
                         continent.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Nauls, the cook, glides along on his roller stakes down one 
               of the many narrow hallways that connect the various 
               compartments of the main compound. He is black, a little 
               mischievous, about twenty-two.

               He comes to a flashy skidding stop at one of the entrances 
               to the rec room area, where the men are gathered with the 
               dead Norwegian.

                                     NAULS
                         Maybe we at war with Norway.

               Palmer, a spacy, twenty-seven year old, novice pilot and 
               mechanic, grins as he lights a joint. He directs a remark to 
               station manager Garry.

                                     PALMER
                         Was wondering when "El Capitan" was 
                         going to get a chance to use his pop 
                         gun.

               Garry rebukes him with a stern look and then turns to Fuchs.

                                     GARRY
                         How long have they been stationed 
                         there?

               Fuchs leafing through a pile of papers.

                                     FUCHS
                         Says here about eight weeks.

               Dr. Copper enters the room. Bennings limping after him 
               slightly.

                                     GARRY
                              (shaking his head)
                         That's not enough time for guys to 
                         go bonkers.

                                     NAULS
                         Bullshit, Bwana, sweetheart. Five 
                         minutes is enough to put a man over 
                         down here.

                                     PALMER
                         Damn straight.

                                     NAULS
                         I mean Palmer been the way he is 
                         since the first day.

               Palmer smiles and flips the cook the bird.

                                     GARRY
                         How many in their party?

                                     FUCHS
                              (referring)
                         Started with six. There'd be four 
                         others left.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         How do you know?

               The men's attention turn to Copper.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         ...Guys as crazy as that could have 
                         done a lot of damage to their own 
                         before they got to us.

                                     GARRY
                         Nothing we can do about that.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Yes, there is. I'd like to go up.

                                     GARRY
                         In this weather?

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (turns to)
                         Bennings?

                                     BENNINGS
                         Winds are going to let up a tad, 
                         next couple of hours.

                                     GARRY
                         A tad?

                                     BENNINGS
                         Can't condone it myself. But it is a 
                         short haul. Hour there, hour back.

               Garry still does not much like the idea. Palmer takes another 
               hit off his joint.

                                     PALMER
                         Shit, Doc, I'll give you the lift 
                         if...

                                     GARRY
                         Forget it, Palmer. Doc, you're a 
                         pain in the ass.

                                     GARRY
                              (turns)
                         Norris, go get MacReady.

               Slight laughter from some of the men.

                                     NORRIS
                              (grins)
                         MacReady ain't going nowhere. Bunkered 
                         in till spring.

                                     GARRY
                         Just go get him.

                                     NORRIS
                              (stands)
                         Anyway, he's probably ripped.

               EXT. U.S. OUTPOST #31

               Norris, bundled in his sixty-five pounds of clothing, exits 
               the main compound. He walks the prefab wooden planks up the 
               precipice; his destination is someone a hundred yards up the 
               slope -- to a shack. He grabs onto the steadying ropes and 
               pulls himself against the wind and blowing sleet.

               INT. MACREADY'S SHACK - CLOSE ON ICE CUBES

               being dumped into a glass, followed by the pouring of whiskey.  
               An electronic Voice is heard.

                                     VOICE
                         Bishop to knight four.

               MacReady takes a sip of his drink; makes his way over to his 
               electronic chess game. A large Mexican sombrero hangs on his 
               back. He is tall; about thirty-five. His shack is sparse but 
               unkempt. A few centerfolds on the wall are interspersed by 
               an occasional poster of some Mediterranean or South American 
               paradise.

               The chess game is of larger than normal size. The pieces 
               move automatically with the press of a button. He sits down 
               and chuckles over his opponent's bad move.

                                     MACREADY
                         Poor little son of a bitch. You're 
                         starting to lose it, aren't you?

               He confidently taps out his move. His companion's response 
               is immediate.

                                     VOICE
                         Pawn takes queen at knight four.

               MacReady's grin slowly fades as he examines the board. There 
               is a pounding at his door. MacReady broods for a bit, heedless 
               of his visitor and makes his next move.

                                     VOICE
                         Rook to knight six. Check.

               More impatient pounding. MacReady glares at his opponent for 
               a beat. He bends forward, opens up a flap containing the 
               chess game's circuitry and pours in his drink. There ensues 
               a snapping, popping sound as smoke and sparks rise from the 
               machine; followed by a flush of chess gibberish.

               MacReady gets up from his seat, mumbling on his way to the 
               door.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...Cheating bastard...

               He opens the door. Norris steps in followed by a flurry of 
               snow and wind.

                                     NORRIS
                         You jerking off or just pissed?

                                     MACREADY
                         We got any more of those electronic 
                         chess things down in supply?

                                     NORRIS
                         Get your gear on.

                                     MACREADY
                         What for?

               EXT. OUTPOST

               One of the grounded choppers is being readied for take-off. 
               Childs holds a huge industrial torch to the engine, warming 
               it up.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND - CORRIDOR

               Garry, Bennings, Dr. Copper, Palmer and MacReady wind their 
               way through the slender corridors on their way to the chopper. 
               Dr. Copper carries a satchel of medicine supplies. MacReady, 
               going over his flight chart, looks mad as hell. Dialogue 
               overlaps.

                         MACREADY
                 ...Craziness... This 
                 is goddamn insane...

                                                       GARRY
                                               ...Quit the griping 
                                               MacReady. Sooner you're 
                                               there -- sooner you're 
                                               back.

                                     MACREADY
                         It's against regulations to go up 
                         this time of year!

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Screw regulations! Four guys could 
                         be crawling around on their bellies 
                         out there!

                                     MACREADY
                         So, I don't want to end up crawling 
                         around with them when we go down.

                                     GARRY
                         Look, if you're going to keep 
                         bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered 
                         to take him up...

                                     MACREADY
                         What are you talking?! He's had two 
                         months training in those choppers!

                                     PALMER
                              (defiant)
                         Four!

                                     MACREADY
                              (to Bennings)
                         What is it out there, anyway? Forty-
                         five knots?

                                     BENNINGS
                         Sixteen.

                                     MACREADY
                              (disgusted)
                         And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen 
                         for how long?! You can't predict 
                         this time of year...

               INT./ EXT. CHOPPER

               Dr. Copper sits next to MacReady, who is at the controls.

               MacReady tightens the string of his sombrero around his neck 
               and starts up its choking engine.

               MacReady fights violently with the controls as he struggles 
               to get the craft into the air. It finally rights itself and 
               moves up and off into the grey-white sky.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND

               A couple of the men mingle in the area. Clark, the dog 
               handler, looks out the window.

                                     CLARK
                         Mac's really taking it up, huh?

               The dog, a large bandage on his hip, wades through the room. 
               Under tables. Past men's legs. It hobbles slightly. No one 
               takes notice.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE CHOPPER

               moves over a ridge of ice. Columns of smoke can be seen rising 
               ominously from a quarter mile off.

               INT. CHOPPER - POINT OF VIEW

               As they near, the smoke looms thicker. A black, tar-like 
               gush; billowing up into the grey sky from the whiteness below.

               EXT. NORWEGIAN CAMP

               Smoke climbs upward in the f.g. MacReady sets his craft down. 
               Pull back to reveal the camp itself: resembling the aftermath 
               of a western fort, sacked and ravaged by Indians.

               Small fires and debris are strewn everywhere. The prefab 
               Administration Building exposes gaping holes. Smoke rises 
               from the almost entirely snow-buried Quonset huts. Embers 
               swirl in every direction.

               INT. CHOPPER

               The two men look at each other in silence. They get out.

               CLOSE ON A LARGE, MAKESHIFT FUNERAL PYRE

               smoldering to a close. A hastily conceived crematorium. Wood, 
               books, furniture, tires, anything that will burn has been 
               mixed together with the charred remains of several dogs and 
               the body of a man.

               Curious mounds of a melted and blackened goo are heaped within 
               the mess.

               A small can of gasoline lies nearby. A large oil drum not 
               far off.

               MACREADY AND COPPER

               their faces ashen as they take in this grotesque sight.

               MacReady turns to view the Norwegian compound. He then 
               exchanges a look with Copper. MacReady heads back toward the 
               chopper.

               THE CHOPPER

               MacReady unhinges the shotgun that is latched to the panel 
               behind the seats.

               EXT. THE MAIN BUILDING - THE DOOR

               MacReady and Dr. Copper stand hesitantly amidst the wisps of 
               snow and embers. MacReady tries the door. It is unlocked. He 
               slowly pushes it open with his gun. A creaking. A long pitch-
               black corridor. Copper shines a flashlight.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Anybody there?!

               No answer. Just wind. They exchange a look and enter.

               INT. NARROW CORRIDOR

               The two men move slowly. It is dank and cold. Their breath, 
               bleating like exhaust. A soft, steady wind howls overhead.  
               The flashlight is not much help.

               Further down, they hear a faint hissing sound. As they get 
               closer it more resembles static. The flashlight finds a door 
               at the end of the corridor. The sputtering static comes from 
               within.

               The face of the door has been shredded. An ax sticks out 
               from its middle. MacReady wrenches out the ax. There is blood 
               on it. The men acknowledge this for a beat.

               MacReady tries the knob. It opens slightly. Something is 
               blocking it from the other side.

                                     MACREADY
                         Anybody in there?!

               Nothing.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         We're Americans!

               Nothing.

                                     MACREADY
                         Come to help you!!

               MacReady pushes against the door.

                                     MACREADY
                         Give me a hand.

               They push, shove, grunt. The door gives a bit. Finally more. 
               It widens enough for MacReady to see that a large computer-
               like machine is blocking their path. MacReady wedges in and 
               shines the flashlight.

               It is the communications room. Holes in its roof have allowed 
               in the freezing cold. The flashlight exposes the back of the 
               radio chair. One more nudge allows them into the room.

               A beat as they catch their breath. MacReady spots a Coleman 
               lantern. He lights it with a match. Holds it up. The brighter 
               light exposes the top of a man's head sitting in the radio 
               chair.

                                     MACREADY
                         Hey, Sweden...! You okay?

               The chair rocks slightly with the gentle breeze. They inch 
               closer. A yard from the chair, MacReady stops the Doctor.  
               He pokes his gun at the chair's back.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sweden?!

               Dr. Copper spots something. From the man's wrist on the 
               armrest, he follows a long, yarn-thick, red line, ending in 
               a pool of frozen blood on the floor.

               The two men step around the chair. The Norwegian stares up 
               in blanched death. A gaping black hole for a mouth.

               His throat and wrists slit. An old-fashioned straight razor 
               in his lap.

               MacReady turns off the hissing radio, and marches to the 
               other door. It is locked and barricaded.

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (more to himself)
                         My God, what in hell happened here?

                                     MACREADY
                         Come on, Copper.

               The two men free a machine-like obstacle from the other exit. 
               MacReady opens a lock and pushes the door open.

               More blackness. Stronger wind. Copper holds the lantern high 
               as they make their way down a row of wooden steps and into a 
               cavernous, underground causeway.

                                     MACREADY
                         Hey, Sweden!!!

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (irritated)
                         They're not Swedish, goddamn it, 
                         they're Norwegian, MacRe --

               Whap!! Something slaps into the Doctor's face from the 
               darkness. The lantern crashes to the ground. The Doctor 
               stumbles, falls. MacReady grabs the flashlight and whirls in 
               different directions. A panting beat. Silence.

               Dr. Copper holds up what hit him. A thick centerfold, buffeted 
               by the wind. MacReady takes it.

                                     MACREADY
                         Norwegian of the Month, Doc. Harmless.

               MacReady pockets it for further viewing.

               INT. THE NARROWEST OF CORRIDORS

               The supporting beams have long since buckled and cracked 
               from the constantly moving ice underneath. The evidence of 
               fire has further weakened the foundations. The wood creaks 
               overhead. Bits of ice and silt trickle down.

               The two men walk hunched, cautious. MacReady gingerly tries 
               to make his way around a broken and smoldering beam. He 
               brushes it gently sending a shower of debris from the yawning 
               roof.

               The two men wait until it subsides and then moves on.

               Further down. MacReady's knee bumps into something along the 
               wall, causing him to stumble slightly. He shines his light 
               on it.

               An arm is sticking out of a steel door about three feet off 
               the ground. The door has been slammed shut. The arm pinned, 
               its fist still gripping a small welding torch.

               The flame long since gone out.

                                     MACREADY
                              (wincing)
                         Holy shit...

               He tries the door. Unlocked. It opens. The arm drops to the 
               ground. It has been severed by the force of the slam.

               Its owner is nowhere to be seen.

               MacReady, sickened, coughs. Dr. Copper mumbles.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Christ...

               They step over the arm and into another slim passageway.

               Moving along they come to rest in front of a door with 
               Norwegian lettering on it.

               MacReady pushes it open with his foot. Dozens of papers fly 
               about, flailed by the holes in the Quonset hut-style roof. 
               The place is a wreck. They enter. MacReady surveying the 
               small room with his flashlight.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         ...Laboratory.

               Broken beakers, test tubes, a microscope are illuminated.

               MacReady notices a video camera.

                                     MACREADY
                         Portable video unit.

               Copper makes his way over to the main work table. He shuffles 
               through papers, glancing at the writing.

                                     MACREADY
                         Anything?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         All in Norwegian.

               Dr. Copper bends down and begins gathering the papers, strewn 
               about the room.

                                     MACREADY
                         What are you doing?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Could be important work. Might as 
                         well bring it back.

                                     MACREADY
                         It's getting late. Hurry it. I'm 
                         going to check the last few rooms.

               He exits. Amongst the rubble, Dr. Copper finds a pocket tape 
               recorder and several cassettes. He selects a tape and is 
               about to pop it in when he senses something to his rear. He 
               turns. Looks. A beat. Nothing.

               INT. HALLWAY

               MacReady shoves himself into another room.

               INT. ROOM

               Debris and wood flush down on him. The receding ceiling had 
               been blocking the door from above. He brushes his coat and 
               shines the light upwards.

               The ceiling is a shambles. He then shines the light deeper 
               into the room.

               INT. NORWEGIAN LAB

               Dr. Copper is playing the small tape recorder. A casual 
               Norwegian voice drones on as if making notes. He fast 
               forwards. The same casual drone.

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         Copper, come here!!

               INT. ROOM

               Dr. Copper enters, squeezing in, through the door. The wood 
               cracks overhead. More debris comes falling down.

                                     MACREADY
                         Careful. It's about to go.

               Copper dusts himself. MacReady stands before a huge block of 
               ice. Fifteen feet long. Six feet wide. Four feet tall.

               It has partially melted, but its thawing process has been 
               stopped by the now freezing temperatures within the outpost.

               Its one curious feature: the middle has been thawed and 
               scooped out. Giving it the appearance of a large bathtub. 
               The two men study it uncomprehendingly.

               MacReady's gaze turns to a large metal cabinet at his left. 
               He moves for a closer look. Several photographs are pasted 
               to its door. Small snapshots of the Norwegians at work and 
               play.

               He tries to open it. Stuck. The partially caved-in ceiling 
               is slightly blocking the top of the door. He tries again, 
               careful not to dislodge the wood and plaster above. Bits of 
               dust float down.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Watch it.

               His grip is too strong. It gives suddenly, unexpectedly. The 
               large metal door flies open.

               Large chunks splash from the ceiling. They come thumping to 
               the floor, behind and in front of the open cabinet door. 
               MacReady coughs and waves away the dust. He peers inside. 
               Nothing much. Some empty shelves. Some small scientific gear.

               His flashlight then locates a large photograph taped to the 
               inside of the cabinet door.

               It is a picture of five Norwegians, arm in arm, all smiles, 
               toasting each other. They are on either side of the frozen 
               block of ice, pridefully displaying it for the camera. The 
               block looks much thicker. Its interior opaque.

               MacReady looks to the block of ice and then back to the 
               photograph. He untapes it, pockets it and shuts the door.

               An armless corpse swings into his face from behind the closing 
               door. Dislodged from the ceiling, the body and MacReady go 
               crashing to the floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. U.S. OUTPOST - RECREATION ROOM

               The loud beat of Warren Zevon's song, "The Werewolves of 
               London," can be heard throughout the compound. The room is 
               empty. Close on a video pong game, its ball of light lazily 
               traveling back and forth. The dog, its tail wagging, its 
               bandage on, walks by.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Zevon's record is blasting from Nauls' stereo. He skates 
               from the big walk-in freezer and plunks down a large side of 
               beef on the wood-cutting table to thaw. He skates from pot 
               to pan keeping time with his sounds.

               He smells. Tastes. Adds a little something here, a touch 
               there. He clearly enjoys his work.

               Station Manager Garry stops past the open door.

                                     GARRY
                         Turn that crap down, Nauls. You can 
                         hear it all over the camp!

                                     NAULS
                         Oui, Bwana. Can do.

               He skates over and turns it down, but not much.

               INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

               Garry enters and sees that Sanchez has nodded off in front 
               of his receiver. His headgear is still on. Garry walks over 
               and turns up the volume, the static jolting Sanchez awake.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Hey, man...!

                                     GARRY
                         You reach anybody yet?

                                     SANCHEZ
                         We're a thousand miles from anybody 
                         else, man. It's going to get a hell 
                         of a lot worse before it gets better.

                                     GARRY
                         Well, stick to it.

               INT. COMPOUND CORRIDOR

               An empty hallway. Larger than most. Doors to several sleeping 
               quarters on either side. The dog slowly walks through.

               One of the doors is open up ahead of his left. The dog stops 
               in front of it and looks in. Someone is inside.

               Inside the small cubicle, a slight portion of a man's back 
               can be seen as he sits bent over a chair; his large shadow 
               displayed on the wall.

               Back in the corridor. The dog looks up the hall once and 
               casually to the other end. No one. He enters the room. The 
               sound of a man's voice, too indistinct to tell whose, mumbles:

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         Hello boy.

               A beat.

               The sound of a glass breaking. A muffled scuffling. The door 
               is slammed shut from the inside. And then silence.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND

               Fuchs, the young biologist, is finishing up his daily jog 
               around the compound. He stops at the end of a long Quonset 
               hut almost completely buried in the snow. The hut is fifty 
               yards long and connects to the main compound. He enters a 
               tunnel from a latch door up top.

               INT. TUNNEL

               He jogs down the steps, passing the underground dog kennel 
               and trots toward the compound through the long narrow tunnel. 
               He passes and waves to Clark, who rolls along a wheelbarrow 
               of dog food.

               CLARK

               opens the door to the small kennel and serves up the dinner.  
               The dogs, about seven of them, yelp and bark eagerly.

               INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY

               near the fuel supply bladders. Older and more rickety than 
               the quarters above.

               Childs waltzes through, humming, a big smile on his face.

               He stops at a door with six locks on it. Different kinds.

               Combination locks, key locks, etc. He opens each one 
               separately.

               INT. STORAGE ROOM

               Inside are several marijuana plants. Sun lamps beam down on 
               them. Childs inspects them with a wide grin.

                                     CHILDS
                         How my brothers and sister doing 
                         today? Doin' fine.

               He moves over to a tape deck, selects a cassette, grins back 
               at the plants and turns it on.

                                     CHILDS
                         What say to some nice Al Green for 
                         my babies, huh?

               He waters them carefully, as Al Green sings softly. He hears 
               a panting and turns around to see the dog. His bandage is 
               gone.

                                     CHILDS
                         What you...? You get the hell on out 
                         of here.

               The dog is shooed off. Childs turns back grumbling.

                                     CHILDS
                         ...Comin' in here... goin' to urinate 
                         on my babies.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND - HALLWAY

               Blair passing through, holding a chart and carrying a rack 
               of test tubes, notices a large bandage on the floor. He picks 
               it up, inquiringly. It is mangled and shredded.

               INT. GENERATOR ROOM

               Palmer works on the generator. He hears the sound of 
               approaching propeller blades from outside. And then the sound 
               of his tool box crashing to the floor. He turns to see what 
               caused the ruckus.

               The dog, who has entered the shed, has jumped on the work 
               table and upended the tool box on its eagerness to look out 
               of the above window. Palmer curses under his breath and calls 
               out.

                                     PALMER
                         Clark! Will you kennel this goddamn 
                         dog?
                              (bangs wrench against 
                              pipe)
                         Hey, Clark?!

               THE DOG

               It paws at the window and watches as the chopper, carrying 
               MacReady and Dr. Copper, fights against the newly arrived 
               heavy winds and lands safely.

               INT. STATION MANAGER GARRY'S QUARTERS

               Garry, MacReady, Dr. Copper, Norris, Bennings, Blair and his 
               assistant, Fuchs, are present. The small Norwegian video 
               unit has been set up and its contents are being viewed on a 
               TV screen. Grainy, home movie-ish, no sound.

               The proceedings are grim.

               Shots of the Norwegian's at work. Others of them playing 
               soccer on ice. Generally the footage is a prosaic record of 
               their day-to-day life.

               Norris shuffles the bundle of notes Dr. Copper brought back 
               with him.

                                     NORRIS
                         ...Seems they were spending a lot of 
                         time at a place four miles northeast 
                         of their camp.

                                     GARRY
                         What were they involved in?

               MacReady, working on the video machine, answers.

                                     MACREADY
                         Little ice core drilling... some 
                         seismology... glaciology... same old 
                         shit we do.

               The present footage is a shot of them all naked and probably 
               drunk, holding a sign across their waists as they stand 
               outdoors in super-freezing weather.

                                     BENNINGS
                         How much more of this crap is there?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         About nine more hours.

                                     BENNINGS
                         We can't learn anything from this.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Probably right.

               MacReady turns on the light and shuts off the video machine. 
               He then slides the portable tape deck across the table to 
               Dr. Copper. They exchange a look.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         MacReady and I were listening to 
                         some of these cassettes on the way 
                         back.
                              (somberly)
                         Like you gentlemen to hear it.

               A Norwegian voice drones on calmly, making verbal notes.

               Norris shrugs.

                                     BENNINGS
                         What do you want from us?

                                     MACREADY
                              (flat)
                         Just listen.

               Dr. Copper fast forwards. The calm voice continues. And then 
               a loud blast, followed by pounding. The sounds of confusion. 
               Voices. Loud. Frenetic. Men's feet running up and down wooden 
               floorboards. A gurgling. A hissing.

               Screams. And then a screeching. More blasts mixed with the 
               din of wild, carnage-wrought cries. And then more screeching. 
               A screeching unlike anything these men have ever heard.

               The men look from one another in silence as they listen.

               Dr. Copper turns it off.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Goes on like that quite awhile.
                              (beat)
                         What do you gentlemen make of it?

                                     GARRY
                         Could be anything... Men in 
                         isolation... some beef that 
                         snowballed... got out of hand...

                                     NORRIS
                         Maybe the whole camp got bent...  
                         Something they ate. What about food 
                         poisoning, Doc?

               Dr. Copper taps the tape deck pensively.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Maybe.

               He glances at MacReady, and then back to the others.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         There's something else we want you 
                         to see.

               INT. INFIRMARY

               Dr. Copper and MacReady begin dumping the heavy contents of 
               a large plastic trash bag onto the slab.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         We found this.

               Displayed on the slab is what appears to be the corpse of a 
               man. Badly charred. What is left of the trousers and shoes 
               of the bottom torso are ripped and split, as if his legs and 
               feet had burst from the inside. His upper body is an almost 
               undecipherable gnarled mass of protoplasmic mush.

               The head is strangely disfigured and looks larger than normal. 
               It is situated not on its shoulders but near the abdomen. 
               Tendon-like appendages are wrapped around the carcass and 
               sticking up and out in odd postures. One is wrapped around 
               the body's left leg.

               The shirt has been ripped and lies shredded in the tar-like 
               mess.

               The men grimace.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I know he's pretty badly burned... 
                         but could fire have done this?

               Blair, sickened but fascinated, pokes at the tendon-like 
               things and the tarry goo.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Blair, I'd like you and Fuchs to 
                         help me with autopsies on this one 
                         and the one Garry shot this morning.

               INT. REC ROOM - LATER - CLOSE ON A TABLE HOCKEY GAME

               Foosball. Nauls and Clark are going at it hot and heavy.

               Sanchez sits off in a corner thumbing through an old issue 
               of Photoplay.

               Bennings, Norris and Garry are engaged in a card game. 
               Bennings is about to play a card when he feels something 
               under the table. He looks. It is the dog.

                                     BENNINGS
                         Clark, will you put this mutt with 
                         the others where he belong?!

               INT. LAB

               larger than most of the other rooms and well-equipped.

               Dr. Copper is performing an autopsy on the Norwegian intruder, 
               killed early that morning.

               Blair sits over his microscope, while Fuchs prepares slides. 
               The other body is draped with a sheet, waiting its turn. Dr. 
               Copper pulls off his gloves.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Nothing wrong with this one.  
                         Physiologically, anyway.
                              (to Blair)
                         Find anything toxic?

                                     BLAIR
                         No drugs... alcohol. Nothing.

               INT. TUNNEL

               Clark leads the dog through the long, cold tunnel toward the 
               kennel. A new dressing has been placed on its hip.

               He unlatches the door to the kennel and leads him in.

               INT. KENNEL

               About twenty feet long, five feet wide. Poorly lit.

               Cramped with dogs. Some of them sleeping. Others pacing around 
               and curious, greet their new companion, sniffing, panting 
               and rubbing up against him. Clark pats the dog and several 
               others, then leaves, latching the door behind him.

               INT. SLEEPING CUBICLE

               Childs lies in his cot watching a small television. The show 
               is a tape of an American TV game show. He has seen this one 
               too many times, extracts the cassette and injects another 
               game show.

               Palmer is stretched out in the other cot, reading a comic 
               book and smoking a joint. Childs beckons for it and takes a 
               hit.

               INT. PUB

               A small area, just off the rec room. Set up like a bar.

               MacReady is alone looking over the rest of the videotapes 
               from the Norwegian outpost. Mundane to esoteric chores of 
               Antarctic camp life. He looks bored.

               INT. LAB

               Blair, hovering over the microscope, lays in a slide, focuses 
               and motions for Dr. Copper to take a look.

               Copper is confused as he examines. He shrugs.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I don't understand.

               Fuchs takes the opportunity to look. Blair moves over to the 
               disfigured corpse and indicates one of the fibrous, tendon-
               like appendages.

                                     BLAIR
                         It's tissue from one of these sinewy 
                         rods.

               Fuchs is befuddled as he examines.

                                     FUCHS
                         What in the world kind of cell 
                         structure is this?

                                     BLAIR
                         That's the point.

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (tired)
                         I don't get you, Blair.

                                     BLAIR
                         I'm not sure it is any kind of cell 
                         structure. Biologically speaking.

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (sighing)
                         This really isn't my field, Blair. 
                         Let's wrap for the day.

               Dr. Copper undoes his lab coat and lays it over a chair as 
               he exits. Blair stares down ominously at the mutilated body.

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

               A steady stream of sleet pounds the compound and small 
               surrounding shacks.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Vacant. The wall clock reads four-thirty.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Sleeping cubicles on either side. The sound of snoring.

               INT. PUB

               Bleary-eyed, MacReady is in the process of blowing up some 
               strange inflatable object. As he puffs away, he still keeps 
               an eye on the Norwegian video tapes. His balloon begins to 
               take shape. It blossoms into a life-size replica of a full-
               breasted woman. Something on the tape catches his eye. He 
               rewinds, then starts it forward again.

               The screen shows the Norwegians on the surface of what appears 
               to be an enormous, flat glacier. They are spread out on the 
               ice around a large odd oval shape; their arms outstretched.

               It fades to black and then a Norwegian comes on mugging 
               childishly in front of the camera, apparently quite pleased 
               with something.

               The tape fades to black again and the picture reappears.

               This time they have marked off the large oval area with flag 
               sticks.

               Closer shots show three of the men digging a deep hole into 
               the ice. There is a small patch of something dark and metallic 
               at the bottom.

               MacReady leans forward, intrigued.

               The men are now sinking something deep into the ice at various 
               points around the markings. MacReady squints and mumbles to 
               himself.

                                     MACREADY
                         Decanite...? Thermite charges...?

               The tape jump cuts again showing a long shot of the markings. 
               No Norwegian in sight. An explosion kicks up the ice. A beat 
               as the ice sprays to the ground. Then the camera appears to 
               shake as the ground beneath it quivers.

               Another immense explosion follows. An earthquake-like force 
               throws the camera to the ground.

                                     MACREADY
                         What in...

               The tape continues, distorted, unviewable. A distinct crack 
               in the lens. MacReady lets go of his companion and quickly 
               rewinds. The deflating mannequin is sent sputtering around 
               the room.

               INT. KENNEL - NIGHT

               Most of the dogs are sleeping or lounging. The new dog watches 
               them calmly, silently.

               He takes several steps towards a group of about five dogs 
               and sits upright. Completely still. He stares at them. A 
               beat. The dogs are aware of something. They begin to seem a 
               bit confused, uncomfortable.

               The new dog continues to stare. Sitting rigidly, unnaturally 
               still. His eyes dead, lusterless black spheres.

               Bewildered, a few dogs start to pace. As if sensing something:  
               a portent. A danger. But so odd. They begin a soft, purring 
               growl.

               The new dog remains a statue. The growling builds. More dogs 
               begin to pace. Nervously. Faster, encircling.

               Emitting hisses, snarls. The lack of response driving them 
               into a frenzy.

               Barks. Growls. More frenetic pacing. The din escalating. 
               Three dogs start to close in on the stranger.

               They attack.

               THE SHADOW OF THE NEW DOG

               against the kennel wall. The shadow suddenly lurches upward, 
               seeming larger.

               The kennel roars.

               INT. PUB

               MacReady is still going over bits of the same footage, 
               fascinated. He hears the far-off clamor of the dogs.

               INT. NAULS' QUARTERS

               He, too, bothered by the noise, tosses and turns in his sleep.

               INT. CLARK'S QUARTERS

               Clark snores. MacReady has entered.

                                     MACREADY
                         Clark.

               No response. MacReady nudges him. Clark rolls away, annoyed.

               MacReady pinches his snoring nose, cutting off the air.

               Clark sits up, groggy.

                                     MACREADY
                         Dogtown's going nuts. Take care of 
                         it.

               INT. TUNNEL

               Clark, sleepy, irritated, makes his way down the freezing 
               corridor. The wind soughing loudly overhead.

               CLARK

               reaches the kennel door. The savage outpouring of noise from 
               within baffles and angers him. He unlatches the door.

                                     CLARK
                         What's got into...

               Smack! Just as he opens the door, two dogs, as if jettisoned 
               from a cannon, knock him off his feet. Growls, barks, snarls. 
               And a screeching from within.

               INT. KITCHEN

               MacReady is fetching himself a beer. The sound of the far-
               off screeching. He freezes. A beat. He turns and sprints.

               HIS BEER CAN

               as it smashes the glass of the fire alarm. He pulls the lever.

               INT. TUNNEL

               The alarm is blaring throughout the camp. MacReady, Garry, 
               Norris run through the narrow tunnel led by Clark.

               MacReady carries a shotgun. Garry, half-dressed, has his 
               .44. Clark, a fire ax.

                                     CLARK
                         I don't know what the hell's in there, 
                         but it's weird and pissed off, 
                         whatever it is.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Chaos. Men, half-naked, bounce from their cubicle.

               Pulling on their pants, digging into shoes.

               INT. CHILDS' CUBICLE

               Childs is grappling with his belt buckle.

                                     CHILDS
                         Mac wants the what?!

                                     BENNINGS
                              (at the doorway)
                         That's what he said. Now! Move!

               Bennings is off.

               INT. TUNNEL

               as the men approach the locked kennel door. The two dogs, 
               thrown into Clark, back ferociously and scratch at the door 
               trying to get back in. One is badly bloodied.

               The fight inside rages on. MacReady and Clark brace themselves 
               by the narrow door. Norris and Garry hold back the two 
               hysterical dogs. Clark undoes the latch and he and MacReady 
               enter the kennel.

               The light has been broken and it is pitch black. MacReady 
               snaps on his flashlight. Norris and Garry can't contain their 
               animals and the dogs burst into the room. They smash into 
               MacReady and send him sprawling. Total confusion: the dogs; 
               the men; the screeching; the blackness.

                                     CLARK
                         Mac, where are you?

               MacReady gropes for his flashlight and rights himself. He 
               finds Clark. Then shines it around the cramped room trying 
               to get his bearings.

               The light finds a mass of dogs in a wild melee in the corner.

               Barking mixed with hissing, a gurgling, a screeching.

               Dogs being hurled about and then charging back into the fray 
               with a vengeance.

               The flashlight illuminates parts of some "thing." A dog.

               But not quite. Impossible to tell. It struggles powerfully.  
               Garry pokes his head into the blackness.

                                     GARRY
                         What's going on, damn it?

               MacReady aims his shotgun at the entire pack.

                                     MACREADY
                         I'm going to shoot.

                                     CLARK
                         No! Wait!!

               Clark wades into the pack, grabs at dogs' hides and throws 
               them back. He then wields his ax into the fray, chopping and 
               hacking away at the gurgling, hissing silhouette.

               From out of nowhere, a large, bristly, arachnid-like leg 
               springs up and wraps around Clark's ax. It sends Clark 
               smashing violently into the wall.

               OUTSIDE

               More men running, nearing the kennel. Several squeezing in 
               with Garry, trying to get a look.

               INSIDE

               MacReady fires several rounds. A dog is flung at him, knocking 
               him and his flashlight once more to the ground.

               Garry squeezes in and begins blasting away in the direction 
               of the hissing and screeching. A dog is hit. MacReady crawls 
               for his flashlight.

                                     MACREADY
                         Clark? Where are you? Clark!

               Blam. Blam. Garry continues firing at the silhouette.

               INT. TUNNEL

               Childs, huffing and puffing, lugs the huge industrial torch 
               toward the crowded kennel doorway.

                                     CHILDS
                         What's happening?

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         Childs, you got the torch? You get 
                         your ass in here!!

               INT. KENNEL

               Childs scrunches in, disoriented by the blackness, and bumps 
               into Garry, knocking him off balance.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where are you?

               MacReady signals with his flashlight and then points it at 
               the gathering of snarling dogs.

                                     MACREADY
                         Torch it over there!

                                     CHILDS
                         The dogs?

                                     MACREADY
                         Screw the dogs!! Torch it!!

               Childs lets loose with a burst of blue flame. A mewing, a 
               screeching.

               Part of the kennel starts to burn.

                                     GARRY
                              (panic)
                         We're on fire!

                                     MACREADY
                         Don't let up, Childs!

                                     GARRY
                              (to outside)
                         Extinguishers.

               Childs moves closer, continuing his assault on the hissing, 
               gurgling presence.

               Men charge into the room and begin spraying dogs and burning 
               walls. Dogs and men choke and cough amidst the smoke and 
               CO2.

               The screeching lessens. The hissing and gurgling fade. Childs 
               turns off his torch.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. REC ROOM - NEXT MORNING

               Those of the men that have gathered exhibit a pale and quiet 
               uneasiness.

               Blair, in silent awe, stands over the badly burned corpses 
               of two interlocking dogs, that lie before him on a table.

               They are connected as if they were one animal. Though, the 
               one wearing the remnants of Clark's bandage is much larger 
               and appears less dog-like. Its entire torso is cracked and 
               peeled, as if its innards were trying to burst out.

               Odd appendages, recoiled and withered by the flame, are 
               wrapped grotesquely about both bodies.

               Clark, his eyes set in glassy stare, sits in shock. Nauls 
               comforts him. Childs stands nearby smoking a joint and staring 
               at the floor.

               Blair, transfixed, continues hovering over the united 
               cadavers. Weighing. Thinking. A very worried look on his 
               face.

               The dead bodies of two other dogs from the kennel are not 
               far off.

               INT. INFIRMARY

               Fuchs is attending to the shredded bodies of three other 
               badly wounded dogs.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Nauls pats Clark on the shoulder and grins, trying to pick 
               up his spirits.

                                     NAULS
                         It's okay now, man. It's dead. It's 
                         over.
                              (beat)
                         You see.

               Clark turns to him with a childlike smile.

                                     CLARK
                         I know. Mr. Childs killed it. I saw.

                                     NAULS
                         Right, man. Right.

               INT. SMALL WORKROOM

               Norris is going through some maps. MacReady is bent over his 
               shoulder. Norris finds the one he's looking for.

                                     NORRIS
                         Here. This is where they were spending 
                         most of their time.

               Bennings pokes his head in the room.

                                     BENNINGS
                         Pretty nasty out, Mac. Thirty-five 
                         knots.

                                     MACREADY
                         Screw it, I'm going up anyway.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND - MORNING

               Station Manager Garry has joined Blair by the stuck-together 
               bodies. Blair motions to the bandage.

                                     BLAIR
                         Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?

                                     GARRY
                         I just can't comprehend any of this. 
                         It was just a dog.

                                     CHILDS
                              (evenly)
                         "tweren't no dog, Bwana.

                                     BLAIR
                         That tape MacReady showed us this 
                         morning...

                                     GARRY
                         Couldn't make much of it myself.

                                     BLAIR
                         I've asked him to try and locate the 
                         site. Okay with you?

                                     GARRY
                         Sure. You think there's a connection?

                                     BLAIR
                         Maybe.

               EXT. CHOPPER

               high above the Antarctic expanse.

               INT. CHOPPER

               MacReady pilots. Young Palmer and Norris are with him.

               It is clear but the winds are troublesome. The ride is a 
               shaky one. Norris refers to their map. He points.

                                     NORRIS
                         One of their sites would be directly 
                         over here.

               They aim for a large mountainous wall. As they go up and 
               over... they see:

               FLAT, GLACIAL EXPANSE

               On the surface, an enormous blackened oval shape.

               INT. U.S. OUTPOST #31 - LAB

               All the bodies of the dogs have been brought in. Fuchs stands 
               by as Blair studies through his microscope.

               INSERT - A MICROSCOPIC SAMPLING

               of two cells. They appear to be much different from each 
               other. They are joined at the ends but are completing the 
               process of breaking off from each other.

               ON BLAIR

               A disturbed look on his face. He checks his watch, as if 
               timing the procedure.

               EXT. GLACIER - TRACKING WITH MACREADY, NORRIS AND PALMER

               as they walk along the ice. They come to a stop at the edge 
               of a sharp drop.

               Pull back to reveal -- the massive black hole about fifteen 
               feet beneath the ice. Charred, gnarled and mangled metal are 
               all that is left of what was once an enormous sphere.

               MacReady's and Norris' eyes meet each other in silence.

               Palmer is in awe.

                                     PALMER
                         Wow...

               MacReady finds a burst thermite canister. He and Norris climb 
               down.

               They move along amongst the wreck. Almost everything but the 
               skeletal superstructure has disintegrated into a fine ashy 
               powder.

               Norris digs for ice samples at the perimeter of the wreckage, 
               while MacReady browses through the center.

               Palmer continues to marvel, as he walks around the oval, 
               atop the ice.

               MacReady returns and kneels down next to Norris as the latter 
               examines a piece of metal.

                                     NORRIS
                         Magnesium of some type... or some 
                         kind of strange alloy.
                              (looks out at debris 
                              in disgust)
                         And those poor dumb bastards had to 
                         go and blow the hell out of it.

                                     MACREADY
                         So what do you make of it?

                                     NORRIS
                         You know damn well what we both make 
                         of it.

                                     MACREADY
                         No chance it could have been some 
                         new kind of test craft?

               Norris shakes his head no.

                                     NORRIS
                         Seismic activity has been pushing 
                         this are up from way down for a long 
                         time...
                              (holds up ice sample)
                         ...This ice it was buried in...  
                         It's over a hundred thousand years 
                         old.

               Palmer calls out, waving them over.

               EXT. GLACIER

               The two men join Palmer about fifty yards from the oval.

               A large rectangular chunk has been cut out of the ice. It is 
               fifteen feet long, six feet wide and eight feet deep.

               MacReady kneels down to observe. A beat.

               A gust of wind picks up the snow at their feet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. REC ROOM - NIGHT

               Fascinated, a few of the men are reviewing the Norwegian 
               video tapes of the finding of the mysterious craft.

               MacReady sits quietly by his chess set contemplating a large 
               glass of Scotch. Clark, less interested than the others, is 
               flipping through the Norwegian nudie magazine.

               Blair, looking worried, sits off in a corner, pondering the 
               photo of the block of ice and fingering a piece of crumbled-
               up metal brought back from the site.

               Childs, viewing the tapes, can't quite believe it all.

                                     CHILDS
                         Okay now, Mac, run this by me again. 
                         Thousands of years ago this rocket 
                         ship crashes, right...? And the...

               MacReady is not listening.

                                     CHILDS
                         MacReady!

                                     MACREADY
                         Look, I'm just guessing...

                                     CHILDS
                         Well, go on.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Nauls, about to prepare dinner, scowls as he rummages through 
               his many cabinets.

                                     NAULS
                         Where's that big ol' steel pot of 
                         mine?! Damn!

               He turns to examine the cabinets above the large stove. He 
               spots something in the nearby kitchen trash can.

               Disgusted, he pulls out a torn and shredded pair of long 
               johns.

               INT. REC ROOM

               MacReady theorizes.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...So it crashes, and this guy, 
                         whoever he is, gets thrown out, or 
                         walks out, and ends up freezing.

                                     CHILDS
                         I just can't believe this voodoo 
                         bullshit. You believe this voodoo 
                         bullshit, Blair?

               Blair says nothing, lost in thought.

               Palmer, stoned, a joint dangling from his mouth, is searching 
               for information through stacks of old issues of The National 
               Enquirer and The Star.

                                     PALMER
                              (rambling)
                         Happens all the time, man. They're 
                         falling out of the skies like flies. 
                         Government knows all about it...  
                         Chariots of the Gods, man... They 
                         practically own South America. I 
                         mean they taught the Incas everything 
                         they knew...

                                     CHILDS
                         Cool it, Palmer!!

               Palmer shakes a magazine at him adamantly.

                                     PALMER
                         Read von Daniken! Have you read von 
                         Daniken? Get your facts straight!

               Clark marvels at a particular photo.

                                     CLARK
                         Jesus, why would those guys ever 
                         want to leave Norway...?

               Nauls skates into the room. He shakes the crumpled-up pair 
               of long johns in his fist.

                                     NAULS
                         Which one you muthers been tossing 
                         his dirty underwear in the kitchen 
                         trash?!

               He flings it across the room. It lands on MacReady's chess 
               set.

                                     NAULS
                         I want my kitchen clean. Germ free!

               Nauls spins on his skates and storms off. MacReady fetches 
               the strangely shredded underwear and rolls it up, while Childs 
               paces.

                                     CHILDS
                         So, MacReady, come on now. These 
                         Norwegian dudes come by... find him 
                         and dig him up...

               MacReady tosses the ball of cloth across the room into a 
               trash bin.

                                     MACREADY
                         Yeah, they dig him up and cart him 
                         back. He gets thawed out, wakes up 
                         and scares the shit out of them. And 
                         they get into one hell of a brawl...

                                     CHILDS
                         Now how's this motherfucker wake up 
                         after thousands of years in the ice, 
                         huh?

                                     MACREADY
                              (annoyed)
                         I don't know how. Because he's 
                         different than we are. Because he's 
                         a space guy. What do you want from 
                         me, anyway. Go ask Blair.

                                     CHILDS
                         You buy any of this, Blair?

               A beat as Blair stares straight ahead, transfixed. He speaks 
               softly, to no one particular.

                                     BLAIR
                         It was here... got to that dog... It 
                         was here in this camp...

               The men take in his grave countenance.

                                     GARRY
                         So...? So what? It's over with.

               Blair turns to them. A pause. The men search his face.

                                     BENNINGS
                              (edgy)
                         Well, isn't it?

               INT. LAB - CLOSE ON A SHEET

               as Blair rips it off exposing the tangled mess of interlocking 
               dogs.

               Pull back. All the men have gathered. Some of the men settle 
               into chairs, others stand.

                                     BLAIR
                         Whatever that Norwegian dog was...

                                     BLAIR
                         ...I think the whole process would 
                         have taken an hour... maybe more. 
                         And then I suppose both would have 
                         changed back to dog form.

                         Well, that Thing in the ice sure 
                         weren't no dog.

                                     BLAIR
                              (impatient)
                         Of course not... But whatever it was 
                         revived, it... Well, The Thing was 
                         probably disoriented... and realized 
                         it couldn't survive for long in our 
                         atmosphere... But being the incredibly 
                         adaptable creature it was... it tried 
                         to become something that could... 
                         Before the Norwegians killed it... 
                         it somehow got to this dog.

                                     CLARK
                         What do you mean "got" to the dog?

                                     BLAIR
                         It was a life form that was able to 
                         imitate and reproduce, whatever it 
                         ate or absorbed, cell for cell.

               Silence.

                                     BLAIR
                         The concept is staggering. I know... 
                         I... I don't fully understand it 
                         myself.

                         You're saying... that big muther in 
                         the ice, became the dog.

                                     BLAIR
                              (nodding)
                         I think we're talking about an 
                         organism... that could imitate other 
                         life forms... perfectly... It could 
                         have gone on and on... It could have 
                         become one dog... It could have become 
                         as many dogs as it wanted to -- and 
                         without losing any of its original 
                         mass...

                                     NORRIS
                         You been into Childs' weed, Blair?

               Blair slams his fist on the slab.

                                     BLAIR
                         Look, I know it's hard to believe...

                                     GARRY
                              (breaking in)
                         So what's our problem?

                                     BLAIR
                         Well... there's still some cell 
                         activity... it's not entirely dead 
                         yet.

               Several of the men nearest the carcasses jump back knocking 
               over a chair.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT - CLOSE ON THE DOG CARCASSES

               lying on the snow. Splash. They are being soaked with 
               gasoline.

                                     FUCHS (O.S.)

                              protestation)
                         You can't do this! You can't burn 
                         these remains...

               Pull back. Fuchs is beside himself. Childs has the large 
               torch. MacReady empties another can on the bodies. Dr. Copper 
               stands nearby.

                                     MACREADY
                         And the horse you rode in on, Fuchs.
                              (to Childs)
                         Light it up.

               Childs lights the tip. Fuchs makes a determined move for the 
               torch.

                                     FUCHS
                         Well, I'm not going to let this 
                         happen...

               Childs struggles with him for a beat and then flings him to 
               the ground. Dr. Copper grabs him preventing him from getting 
               back up.

               Childs splays the remains with a jet of flame. Fuchs shakes 
               his head in frustration and disgust.

                                     FUCHS
                         I just can't believe it... We're 
                         going to go down as the biggest bunch 
                         of assholes in history...

                                     MACREADY
                         Fuck history. At least we're going 
                         to live to be an old bunch of 
                         assholes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KENNEL - NIGHT

               The night feeding. Clark dishes out the food. Blair is taking 
               blood samples from the remaining three dogs.

                                     BLAIR
                              (perplexed, bothered)
                         Clark, did you notice anything strange 
                         about that dog? Just anything at 
                         all? Any little thing?

                                     CLARK
                         No. Just that he recovered real 
                         quick... That night when I found him 
                         in the rec room, he had already 
                         scraped off his bandage. Before I 
                         put him with the others, I redressed 
                         his wound and noticed it had healed 
                         up real good...

               A beat as Blair stares at Clark.

                                     BLAIR
                         That night?

                                     CLARK
                              (pets dog vigorously)
                         Yeah.

                                     BLAIR
                         What was he doing in the rec room?

                                     CLARK
                         Well, after I worked on him -- thought 
                         I'd let him rest. Left the room for 
                         a bit. When I came back, he was gone.

                                     BLAIR
                         Well, where was he? Where did he go?

                                     CLARK
                         Don't know. Looked for him for a 
                         bit... couldn't find him.

                                     BLAIR
                              (a long beat)
                         You're saying he wasn't put into the 
                         kennel until the night?

               Clark seems uneasy under Blair's intense gaze.

                                     CLARK
                         Well... yeah.

               Blair stands, his eyes still glued to Clark.

                                     BLAIR
                         How long were you with the dog? Alone, 
                         I mean?

                                     CLARK
                         Ah... He was hurt bad. Bullet nicked 
                         an artery... I don't know... An 
                         hour... hour and a half...

               Blair's eyes glaze as if in revelation.

                                     CLARK
                         What the hell you looking at me like 
                         that for?

                                     BLAIR
                         Nothing. Nothing at all.

               He backs out of the kennel.

               INT. HALLWAY - COMPOUND

               Irritated, distressed, station manager Garry moves briskly 
               down the hall. Blair, worried and pale, tries to keep up 
               with him.

                                     BLAIR
                         ...It could have gotten to somebody...

                                     GARRY
                         Anybody sick?

                                     BLAIR
                         No, I... I don't mean infection... 
                         or disease...

               Garry stops at the entrance to the communications room.

                                     GARRY
                         Any luck yet?

               Sanchez shrugs.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Couple seconds of an Argentine disco 
                         station.

                                     GARRY
                         Well, stick with it. I want you at 
                         it round the clock. We got to get 
                         help in here...

                                     BLAIR
                              (alarm)
                         No... No, you can't let anyone in 
                         here... That dog was all over this 
                         camp...

               Bennings interrupts, entering the hallway, referring to his 
               meteorological chart.

                                     BENNINGS
                              (to Garry)
                         Travel-wise, tomorrow may be okay. 
                         But after that some pretty nasty 
                         northeasterly shit's coming in.

                                     FUCHS
                         ...Goddamn fools...

               The men outside come stomping through the hallway.

                                     BLAIR
                              (pleading)
                         Listen to me, Garry. Please...

                                     GARRY
                              (to MacReady)
                         If the weather clears enough before 
                         we reach anybody -- I'm sending you 
                         and Doc up to MacMurdo...

                         BLAIR
                 No! You can't let people 
                 leave...

                                                       MACREADY
                                               I ain't going anywhere in 
                                               anything over forty knots, 
                                               Garry... 

                                     GARRY
                              (snapping)
                         The hell you won't, MacReady!

                                     BLAIR
                         Don't you understand?! That Thing 
                         didn't want to become a dog...

                                     GARRY
                              (fed up)
                         Damn you, Blair! You've already got 
                         everybody half-hysterical around 
                         here.

                                     BLAIR
                         You can't let anybody leave!

                                     GARRY
                         I've got six dead Norwegians on my 
                         hands, a burned up flying saucer, 
                         and we've just destroyed the 
                         scientific find of the century. Now 
                         fuck off!

               Close on Blair, ashen-faced, falling silent. As if in a daze, 
               he watches the men as they continue to converse. Suspicious, 
               frightened.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

               Pitch black except for the barest of lighting which outlines 
               the building. Wind. The swirl of ice.

               INT. MACREADY'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Far away from the others, MacReady sits in his little hovel 
               putting the final screw into his mended chess set.

               On the other side of the set, his busty, inflatable companion 
               has been propped up in a chair. His sombrero hangs down her 
               back, keeping her in place. Hawaiian music plays from his 
               tape deck.

                                     MACREADY
                         All set.

               He puts down his screwdriver, holds up his glass and offers 
               a toast with a big grin.

                                     MACREADY
                         To us.

               He clinks the drink he has made for her that rests on her 
               side of the board. He sips. He turns on the machine and makes 
               his first move.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now go easy on me, Esperanza. I'm 
                         just a beginner.

               The set answers for Esperanza.

                                     CHESS VOICE
                         Rook takes bishop at Queen four -- 
                         Rook take pawn at Queen two -- Rook 
                         takes Queen at Queen one -- Checkmate.

                                     MACREADY
                         Aw shit.

               He flips open the circuitry panel in disgust. He tosses his 
               screwdriver on the board and grabs his drink, downing it.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sorry, hon.

               He reaches inside his ice bucket. Empty.

                                     MACREADY
                         Never any damn ice around here...

               EXT. MACREADY'S CABIN - NIGHT

               MacReady exits. He swacks at a nearby bank of ice with a 
               small ice pick.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now in Mexico... Tahiti... They got 
                         ice... They got ice coming out of 
                         their ears.

               The sound of a clanking. He turns his attention. Metal against 
               metal. Strange. MacReady listens. It appears to be coming 
               from far off below, near the camp.

               MACREADY

               as he makes his way down with the aid of the steadying ropes. 
               The clanking louder now. He senses the direction.

               MACREADY

               at the bottom near the main compound.  The sound has stopped.  
               He looks around in the near blackness.  A beat.

               THE CHOPPERS

               sitting idle in the dark. MacReady approaches. The door to 
               one of the cockpits is slightly ajar. He opens it cautiously.

               INT. CHOPPER

               MacReady slips in. He turns on a flashlight. The controls 
               have been mangled. Beaten with something heavy. Bang!! 
               MacReady, startled, turns. Like the sound of a gun. Coming 
               from the main compound.

               INT. COMPOUND - MAIN ENTRANCE

               Confusion. Shouts. MacReady enters. He grabs Palmer as he 
               and Bennings rush by.

                                     MACREADY
                         What's...

                                     PALMER
                         Blair. He's gone berserk.

                                     BENNINGS
                         He's in the radio room. Got a gun. 
                         Beat on Sanchez something fierce.

               HALLWAY - RADIO ROOM ENTRANCE

               The men are on either side of the open radio room doorway.

               Garry peeks his head in. A gunshot blast forces him back.

               RADIO ROOM

               Sanchez lies on the floor, groaning. Blair holds the gun on 
               the door. He wields a fire ax with the other hand and smashes 
               down on the radio.

                                     BLAIR
                         Anybody interferes, I'll kill! 
                         Nobody's getting in or out of this 
                         camp...

               HALLWAY

               MacReady has joined the others.

                                     MACREADY
                         He smashed one of the choppers up 
                         good. Childs, go check the other one 
                         and the tractor.

               Childs is off.

               RADIO ROOM

               Blair crunches the ax down once again, while keeping an eye 
               on the door.

                                     BLAIR
                         ...You think I'm crazy? Fine! Most 
                         of you don't know what's going on -- 
                         but I'm damn well sure some of you 
                         do!
                              (crunch)

               BACK TO HALLWAY

                                     NORRIS
                         The back window. A couple of us could 
                         maybe surprise him.

                                     MACREADY
                         Too damn dangerous.

               BACK TO RADIO ROOM

                                     BLAIR
                         ...You think this Thing wants to 
                         become an animal? Dogs can't make it 
                         1000 miles to the sea. No skua gulls 
                         to imitate this time of year... No 
                         penguins this far inland... Don't 
                         you understand?! It wanted to become 
                         us!

               He brings the ax down hard on the radio.

               BACK TO HALLWAY

               Childs runs up, out of breath.

                                     CHILDS
                         He got both choppers and the 
                         tractor... I don't know how bad yet.

               Garry readies his large .357 Magnum.

                                     MACREADY
                         No, wait a minute.
                              (to Norris)
                         The fuse box.

               Norris double-times down the hall.

               MacReady turns the corner and into the rec room. He grabs 
               one of the thick card tables.

               MacReady returns with the table to the hallway.

                                     BLAIR
                         ...Can't you see...? If one cell of 
                         this Thing got out it could imitate 
                         every living thing on Earth. Nothing 
                         could stop it! Nothing!

                                     MACREADY
                              (humoring)
                         Look Blair, maybe you're right about 
                         this. But we've got to be rational. 
                         We've got to talk this over. I'm 
                         unarmed and I'm coming in.

                                     BLAIR
                         No, you're not! I don't trust any of 
                         you!

               NORRIS

               reaches the fuse box. He opens it.

               HALLWAY

               MacReady readies the table like a shield.

                                     MACREADY
                         If you're right we've all got to 
                         stick together.

               The lights go out. MacReady charges into the black room.

               Blair fires. MacReady barrels into him, knocking him to the 
               ground. He pummels him with a right hand and manages to 
               control the gun.

               The others dive in and pile on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND

               Heavily-clothed, MacReady, Fuchs and Dr. Copper help a dazed 
               Blair to a toolshed some seventy-five yards from the main 
               compound.

               INT. TOOLSHED

               More spacious than MacReady's. Very livable. Two windows. 
               Blair has been placed on the cot. Dr. Copper injects him 
               with a sedative.

                                     BLAIR
                         Why am I here?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         It's for your own protection, Blair.

                                     MACREADY
                         And mainly ours.

               EXT. SHACK

               Fuchs and MacReady nail boards over the windows.

                                     MACREADY
                         Leave a bit of an opening so he can 
                         see out.

               Blair's droopy-eyed, heavily drugged features loom up at 
               MacReady through the window.

                                     MACREADY
                         How you doin', old boy?

                                     BLAIR
                              (softly)
                         I don't know who to trust.

                                     MACREADY
                              (humoring)
                         Know what you mean, Blair. Trust is 
                         a tough thing to come by these days. 
                         Just trust in the Lord.

                                     BLAIR
                              (beat)
                         Watch Clark.

                                     MACREADY
                         What?

                                     BLAIR
                         Watch him close. Ask him why he didn't 
                         kennel the dog.

               Blair's face disappears from the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND - DAY

               Harsh and grey. Getting very dark as winter takes a stronger 
               hold. Bennings is dumping the trash in a large hole in the 
               snow which acts as the trash dump.

               Bennings finishes and drags the empty bins past Palmer and 
               Childs, who are fixing the wounded choppers.

               INT. RADIO ROOM

               The radio looks a mess. Norris and Sanchez, a bandage wrapped 
               around his head, examines the damage. He is in pain and still 
               looks a little groggy.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         I'll see what I can do. But they 
                         didn't teach me much about fixing 
                         these things.

               Norris smiles and pats him comfortingly.

                                     NORRIS
                         They didn't teach you much about 
                         working them either.

               INT. MESS HALL - MORNING

               CLOSE ON A BUFFET OF EGGS, BACON, TOAST, ETC.

               Pull back. The men help themselves. It is a cramped, elongated 
               room.

               Dr. Copper approaches Nauls and hands him a capsule.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Put this in Blair's juice before you 
                         take him his tray.

               Clark comes running into the room, pallid, out of breath.  
               The men turn to look.

                                     CLARK
                         The dogs...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE KENNEL

               Empty. Clark and Garry examine the latch of the kennel door.

                                     GARRY
                         Doesn't look broken.

                                     CLARK
                         No. Door was wide open. I know I 
                         latched it.

               EXT. COMPOUND ABOVE THE UNDERGROUND KENNEL

               CLOSE ON THE DOGS' TRACKS in the snow. They lead from the 
               kennel's open stairwell and out onto the ice. All the men 
               have gathered.

                                     CLARK
                         All three of them took off.

               MacReady is writing down what appears to be a list on a pad.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         How long do you suppose they've been 
                         gone?

                                     CLARK
                         I haven't seen them since their last 
                         feeding. Could be as much as twenty-
                         four hours.

                                     MACREADY
                         They couldn't have gotten that far 
                         in this weather.

               Garry and several others turn to MacReady quizzically.

                                     GARRY
                         You're not thinking of going after 
                         them, are you?

                                     MACREADY
                         I am going after them.

                                     NORRIS
                         What in the hell for? Even if Blair's 
                         right -- they'll just die out there. 
                         No food. They're over a thousand 
                         miles from anything.

                                     PALMER
                         Chopper aren't going to be ready for 
                         days.

               MacReady hands his list to Bennings.

                                     MACREADY
                         Get these things out of supply and 
                         meet me over by the snowmobiles.

                                     GARRY
                         You're not going to catch them in 
                         one of those with the start they 
                         got.

                                     MACREADY
                         Palmer, how long would it take you 
                         to strap those big four-cylinder 
                         carburetors on?

                                     PALMER
                              (grins)
                         Oh, I got you. Not too long.

                                     MACREADY
                         Then get a move on. Childs, come 
                         with me.

               He puts his arm around Childs and pulls him along. The others 
               watch them walk off, a little bewildered.

                                     GARRY
                              (shouting after them)
                         Besides, what are you going to do 
                         when you catch up to them?

               Bennings is reading MacReady's list.

                                     BENNINGS
                         Holy shit.
                              (hands list to Garry)
                         Whatever he's going to do, he ain't 
                         fucking around.

               EXT. OUTDOOR WORK AREA - CLOSE ON THE BARREL

               of the large torch. A fierce stream of flame bursts from its 
               nozzle.

               Pull back. The stream has shot out some fifteen feet.

               Childs has been modifying it.

                                     CHILDS
                         I can get maybe another five or six 
                         feet out of it.

                                     MACREADY
                         That's good enough.

               CLOSE ON PALMER

               as he works on the snowmobiles. Into frame rolls a wheelbarrow 
               on sleds. A box marked DYNAMITE is its most prominent article. 
               Pull back. Bennings reads off the list of supplies.

                                     BENNINGS
                         All right... Box of dynamite... box 
                         of thermite... three shotguns... box 
                         of flares... two flare guns... thirty 
                         cans gasoline... and a case of 
                         alcohol.

                                     MACREADY
                         Let's load 'em.

               EXT. ANTARCTICA - ICESCAPE

               The two vehicles rip across the hard, flat ice, bolstered by 
               the added horsepower. They follow the still visible dog tracks 
               in the snow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SUN

               sliding across the horizon, signaling midday. The snowmobiles 
               whoosh past. Bennings drives the one loaded with supplies. 
               MacReady and Childs double up on the other.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MACREADY

               steadying his binoculars, while Childs drives, spots something 
               up ahead. The vehicles slow down and come to a halt. Something 
               lies just ahead of them in the whiteness, in the middle of 
               the dog tracks.

               THE MEN

               kneel down by the "something." It is the half-eaten remains 
               of a dog. Its hind legs and lower stomach picked clean. Its 
               ripped hide, flapping in the wind. Its top half missing.

                                     CHILDS
                         What is it?

               MacReady follows the line of continuing dog tracks.

                                     MACREADY
                         Maybe dinner.

                                     BENNINGS
                         Dogs don't eat each other.

                                     MACREADY
                              (beat)
                         I know.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where's the other half?

                                     MACREADY
                         Probably the next meal.

               MacReady moves to the snowmobile and grabs a two-gallon can 
               of gasoline. He turns to Bennings.

                                     MACREADY
                         Where these tracks headed?

                                     BENNINGS
                         Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.

               A beat as MacReady takes this in. He pours the gas over the 
               remains and sets it aflame.

                                     MACREADY
                         Let's move.

               Childs and Bennings are not that anxious to continue.

                                     CHILDS
                         They could be hours ahead of us, 
                         Mac.

                                     BENNINGS
                         Gonna get dark soon, too. Supposed 
                         to be fifty below tonight.

               MacReady gets on and revs up the engine.

                                     MACREADY
                         Turn back if you want.

               Childs and Bennings return shrugs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SUN

               making its last pass, rolling off the horizon. Only a slight 
               orange hue left.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SNOWMOBILES

               move slower, positioned on either side of the tracks. The 
               tracks abruptly change direction. The men come to a stop.

               It is much colder now. Their beards, a mask of white powder.

               MacReady surveys the new direction. They are headed toward a 
               far-off ridge of bluffs. Large, windswept mounds of ice.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SNOWMOBILES

               as they move through a valley of newly-formed dunes and tall 
               ice cliffs. The last of the sun obscured, the headlamps are 
               turned on and pointed at the tracks.

               The men look behind, in front, and from side to side, as 
               they proceed cautiously through the maze. Up ahead MacReady 
               spots:

               A DOG

               It sits, its back to them, unconcerned, heedless of their 
               arrival. It is munching on the other half of the dog carcass.

               The men stop their machines some twenty yards from it. They 
               are hemmed in at the valley's narrowest point.

               Childs, carrying the torch, and MacReady, armed with a 
               thermite bomb, wade awkwardly but carefully toward the animal 
               in their snowshoes. Bennings stands back by the snowmobiles.

               Childs and MacReady spread out some dozen feet from the dog. 
               It continues to pay them no mind, content to chew its food.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where's the other one?

               Bennings surveys the tops of the snow bluffs that encircle 
               them with his flashlight.

                                     MACREADY
                              (to dog)
                         Where's your buddy, boy? Huh?

               No response. MacReady searches the near vicinity with his 
               light. All three are growing uneasy.

                                     MACREADY
                         Let that thing fly, Childs. Don't 
                         let up until he's ash.

               Childs turns on the gas and lights the tip.

               Bennings is still watching the bluffs. Something from beneath 
               the snow reaches up and grabs his feet. He is ripped back 
               down through the hard snow in one incredibly powerful motion. 
               He screams, his head the only thing sticking out of the ice.

               Childs and MacReady turn, confused, unable to see anything 
               be Bennings' screaming head. They rush toward him.

               MacReady stumbles.

               The sound of a snapping, a crackling to MacReady's rear.

               He freezes; turns back to the dog. Its back is still to him; 
               its coat of hair sticking up like that of a porcupine. It 
               snarls; its face turns slowly toward him.

               Its skin splitting; its mouth ripping open wildly.

                                     MACREADY
                         Childs!!

               Childs stops, confused as to who to help first. He notices 
               the dog hunched and ready to spring. He steps back toward 
               MacReady. The dog/Thing leaps for MacReady; an incredible 
               jump of some twenty feet.

               Childs lets loose a blast, hitting the dog in midair; the 
               force of the spray knocking it back and tumbling to the ice 
               in flames.

               MacReady throws his thermite canister. It discharges and 
               engulfs the screeching animal in fire.

               BENNINGS

               howling in pain. The ice underneath him thrashes violently. 
               Childs and MacReady stand by helplessly, unable to see what 
               has him or what action to take. Childs moves closer to help.

                                     MACREADY
                              (pulls him back)
                         Stay back!!

               Bennings' head disappears with a sudden jerk through the 
               ice. The ice continues to rumble like boiling water, moving 
               in different directions. Part of Bennings' body pops up in a 
               different area and is just as quickly pulled back down.

               MacReady and Childs watch on in frustration and anger.

                                     CHILDS
                         What we going to do?!

                                     MACREADY
                         How the fuck do I know?!

               Bennings' head and shoulders then surface near one of the 
               snowmobiles. Something has him. Unclear as to what. The jowls 
               of a dog. But huge. Bennings' heavy clothing begins to rip, 
               tear, as if his skin underneath was bulging out. The jowls 
               seem to be absorbing his head.

               MacReady runs for the snowmobile.

                                     MACREADY
                         Torch them!!

                                     CHILDS
                         But...

                                     MACREADY
                         He's gone already! Do it!

               Childs blasts away. The ice begins to melt as Bennings and 
               whatever has him catch fire. A screeching.

               MacReady grabs cans of gas from the snowmobiles. Suddenly a 
               steel-like, arachnid-shaped arm shoots out in pain and with 
               incredible force pierces the fiberglass chassis of the 
               snowmobile. MacReady is knocked back. He recovers and dumps 
               cans of gasoline on the writhing mess.

               He dives and rolls away from the lunging appendage.

               He and Childs watch on as Bennings and The Thing roar in 
               flame. Behind them, the other dog/Thing continues to burn. 
               The screeching, mewing and gurgling wails on, all about them.

               They look to each other in disbelief, their faces illuminated 
               by the flickering flames. The strident sounds beginning to 
               subside.

               THE SUN

               Its slim, orange arc sets, signaling the start of the Vernal 
               Equinox. And the beginning of six months of darkness.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPOUND - REC ROOM

               The men are interrogating Clark. He is frazzled and defensive.

                                     CLARK
                         ...I'm telling you I don't remember 
                         leaving the kennel unlatched...

               Childs is holding the industrial torch directly in his face.

                                     CHILDS
                         Bullshit! You left it open so they 
                         could get out!

               EXT. TRASH DUMP

               MacReady, waist-deep in trash and snow, searches for 
               something.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The interrogation continues.

                                     CLARK
                         ...Would I even have told you they 
                         were gone if I had anything to hide?

                                     GARRY
                         But why didn't you kennel that dog 
                         right away?

                                     CLARK
                         I told you I couldn't find...
                              (pushes torch away)
                         ...get that out of my face.

               Childs grabs him by the collar and rips him off his chair.

                                     CHILDS
                         Don't you be telling me...

               Nauls steps between them.

                                     NAULS
                              (to Childs)
                         Lighten your load, sucker. You ain't 
                         the judge and executioner around 
                         here!

                                     CHILDS
                         Who you trying to protect, 
                         mutherfucker? I'm telling you this 
                         S.O.B. could be one of them.

               Garry breaks it up, pulling them apart. MacReady enters from 
               the outside. A bundle is tucked under his arm.

                                     GARRY
                         Hold on, damn it. We're getting 
                         nowhere... If this bit of Blair's 
                         about absorbing and imitating is 
                         true... then that dog could have 
                         gotten to anybody.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         And if it got to Clark... Clark could 
                         have gotten to anybody.

               MacReady moves over to the table.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Theoretically any of us could be 
                         whatever the hell this thing is.

               Norris shakes his head, rubbing his chest in slight 
               discomfort.

                                     NORRIS
                         It's just too damn wild -- I can't 
                         believe it.

               MacReady pushes his sombrero back over his head.

                                     MACREADY
                         Well, you can believe it now.

               He drops the bundle he had been holding on the table between 
               the men. It is the shredded pair of long johns.

                                     MACREADY
                         Nauls found this yesterday. It's 
                         ripped just like the clothing on the 
                         Norwegian we brought back. The same 
                         thing was happening to Bennings' 
                         clothes when it got to him. Seems 
                         these Things don't imitate clothes. 
                         Just flesh and bone.

               The men look from one another. Silence. MacReady picks it up 
               and examines the label.

                                     MACREADY
                         Size large.
                              (grins)
                         What do you wear, Clark?

               Clark stews.

                                     CLARK
                         So what?

                                     NORRIS
                         I wear a size large, too.

                                     MACREADY
                         So do I. So do most of us.

               The uneasiness in the room grows.

                                     MACREADY
                         Doubt if it got to more than one or 
                         two of us. But it got to someone.
                              (beat)
                         Somebody in this room ain't what he 
                         appears to be.

               A pause as all eyes travel from man to man.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (scared)
                         Well, what we going to do?

               Norris turns to Dr. Copper and Fuchs.

                                     NORRIS
                         Can there be... some kind of test? 
                         To find out who's what?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         A serum test possibly.

                                     FUCHS
                         Right. Why not?

                                     GARRY
                         What's that?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         It's a simple blood typing test. 
                         This Thing's blood chemistry is 
                         different than ours. Basically we 
                         mix someone's blood with 
                         uncontaminated human blood. If we 
                         don't get the proper serum reaction -- 
                         then that person isn't human.

                                     CHILDS
                         Whose uncontaminated blood we going 
                         to use?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         We've got blood plasma in storage.

                                     GARRY
                         How long will it take you to prepare 
                         this?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         A couple of hours.

                                     GARRY
                         Well, get to it.

               Garry unhinges a key from his belt and hands it to Dr.  
               Copper. Dr. Copper and Fuchs head for the infirmary.

                                     PALMER
                         How's that Thing get to the dogs? I 
                         though we stopped it in time.

                                     MACREADY
                         Copper thinks they swallowed pieces 
                         of it during the fight.

                                     PALMER
                         And that was enough?

                                     DR. COPPER (O.S.)
                         Garry. The rest of you! Come here!

               INT. INFIRMARY

               The men rush in. Fuchs and Copper stand by the open plasma 
               storage refrigerator. The inside is a mess of dried blood. 
               The bladders have been ripped open. Copper is ghastly pale.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Somebody got to the blood... sabotaged 
                         it.

                                     NAULS
                         Oh, my God.

               A horrified silence.

                                     MACREADY
                         Was it broken into?

                                     FUCHS
                         No. Somebody opened it. Closed it. 
                         And then locked it.

               Sanchez twitches, terrified.

                                     MACREADY
                         Well, who's got access to it?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I guess I'm the only one.

                                     GARRY
                         And I've got the only key.

               Several pairs of eyes turn to Garry.

                                     MACREADY
                         Would that test have worked?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I think so.

                                     NORRIS
                         Somebody else sure as hell thought 
                         so.

                                     MACREADY
                         Who else could have used that key?

                                     GARRY
                         Ah... no one... I give it to Copper 
                         when he needs it...

                                     MACREADY
                         Could anyone have gotten it from 
                         you?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I don't see how... when I'm finished 
                         I return it right away.

                                     NORRIS
                         When was the last time you used it?

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (uneasy)
                         A day or so ago... I guess.

               Garry senses the nervous and inquiring eyes on him.

                                     GARRY
                         I suppose... well, it's possible 
                         someone might have lifted it from 
                         me. But...

                                     CHILDS
                         That key ring of yours is always 
                         hooked to your belt. Now how could 
                         somebody get to it without you 
                         knowing?

                                     GARRY
                              (upset, flustered)
                         Look, I haven't been near that... 
                         that refrigerator.

               Silence as the men continue to stare. Sanchez is perspiring.

                                     GARRY
                         Copper's the only one who has any 
                         business with it.

               The eyes shift from Garry to Copper.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Now... wait a second, Garry, you've 
                         been in here on several occasions...

                                     FUCHS
                         And the Doc thought of the test.

                                     CHILDS
                              (anger)
                         So what?! Is that supposed to leave 
                         him in the clear?! Bullshit!

               Sanchez bolts out the door. Stunned for a beat, the others 
               chase after him.

                                     GARRY
                         Hey, Sanchez!

               SANCHEZ

               in terror, runs at top speed through the narrow corridors.

               Opening and shutting doors. The others are in pursuit.

               They shout for him to stop.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SANCHEZ

               as he reaches a small armory. A glass case set into the wall. 
               A half dozen rarely used guns are inside. He tries the handle. 
               Locked.

               He hears the clamor of feet and voices as the others are 
               nearing. He breaks the glass and grabs a shotgun. Then a box 
               of shells. He frantically tries to load, but is too nervous.

               The others arrive at the end of the hallway. Garry pulls his 
               handgun and points.

                                     GARRY
                         Put that down!

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (trembling)
                         No.

                                     GARRY
                         I'll put this right through your 
                         head.

               No one doubts Garry's sincerity.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         You guys going to let him give orders? 
                         I mean he could be one of those 
                         Things.

               The other regard Garry tensely. No one oblivious to the fact, 
               that Sanchez just might be right.

                                     MACREADY
                              (calm)
                         Put it away, Sanchez. Just put it 
                         away.

               Still trembling, he tosses the shells back into the broken 
               case, leans the gun against the wall and begins to sob.

               Nauls skates over to comfort him.

               The men watch as Garry lowers his gun. He turns to them.

                                     GARRY
                         I don't know about Copper. But I 
                         didn't go near that plasma...
                              (beat)
                         But I guess you'll all rest easier 
                         if someone else is in charge.

               He hands his gun to Norris.

                                     GARRY
                         Can't see anyone objecting to you, 
                         Norris.

                                     NORRIS
                         Sorry, gentlemen...
                              (rubs chest)
                         ...Don't think I'd be up to it. 
                         Haven't been feeling well lately.

               Childs goes for the gun.

                                     CHILDS
                         I'll take it...

               MacReady beats him to it.

                                     MACREADY
                         Maybe it should be someone a bit 
                         more even-tempered, Childs.

               Childs glares.

                                     MACREADY
                              (to others)
                         ...Any objections?

               Roving eyes pass about the hallway. Nobody is sure who to 
               trust. MacReady seems as good as any.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The men have gathered to discuss plans. Furtive and 
               untrustworthy glances are passed around the room.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...From what we know this Thing likes 
                         to go one on one. So we stick together 
                         as much as possible. In two's and 
                         three's.

               Childs points to Garry, Dr. Copper and Clark.

                                     CHILDS
                         What do we do about those three?

                                     MACREADY
                         We got morphine, don't we.

               Fuchs nods.

                                     MACREADY
                         Well, we keep them loaded. Stash 
                         them here in the rec room and watch 
                         'em twenty-four hours.

                                     PALMER
                              (ears perk up)
                         Morphine? You know I was pretty close 
                         to that dog, too.

               Palmer is ignored.

                                     NORRIS
                         We should sleep in shifts.

                                     MACREADY
                         Right. Half of us awake at all times.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         How we going to try and find out 
                         who's... you know, who's who?

                                     MACREADY
                              (to Fuchs)
                         Can you think of any other tests?

                                     FUCHS
                         I'll try.  I could sure use Copper's 
                         help though.

                                     CHILDS
                         You can eighty-six that thought right 
                         now, man.

               Dr. Copper eyes his accuser solemnly.

                                     MACREADY
                         Also... When this Thing turns... it 
                         turns slowly at first. I think we 
                         can handle it in that state. But if 
                         it ever got to full power... from 
                         what I saw of that Norwegian camp... 
                         well, I just don't know... It would 
                         probably take it an hour or more to 
                         get like that. So no matter what 
                         anybody's doing, we all return to 
                         this room every twenty minutes. 
                         Anybody gone longer than that... 
                         anybody trying to leave... we kill 
                         'em.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND - DARKNESS

               It is the dead of winter. Six months of darkness ahead. Palmer 
               fights the cold as he works dismantling the engine of the 
               helicopter.

               He frowns, searching for something.

                                     PALMER
                              (mumbles)
                         Where's that magneto? Can't find a 
                         darn thing around here any more.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Copper, Clark and Garry sit moodily together on a couch.

               Norris awkwardly prepares to give them their injections.

               He is new at this. Childs stands guard with his torch.

               Dr. Copper offers to help.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I'll do it. You're going to break 
                         the needle in my arm.

                                     CHILDS
                         No, Doc. He's doing a real fine job.

               EXT. COMPOUND

               MacReady and Sanchez are foraging through the trash dump.

                                     MACREADY
                         Look for shoes, too. And burned cloth.

               INT. RADIO ROOM

               Norris has begun dismantling the radio. He rubs at his chest 
               as he disengages the headset.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Following Nauls as he skates through the labyrinth.

               Checking waste bins. Pausing to look behind shelves and any 
               obscure hiding place.

               MacReady passes him coming the other way.

                                     NAULS
                         That thing's too smart to be hiding 
                         any more of its clothes, MacReady.

                                     MACREADY
                         Just keep looking.

               INT. LAB

               Fuchs is poring over a book. Several others lie open on his 
               desk.

               MacReady pokes his head in the lab.

                                     MACREADY
                         How's it going?

                                     FUCHS
                         Nothing yet. But, MacReady, I've 
                         been thinking... If our dogs changed 
                         by swallowing parts of that other 
                         one... We better see to it that 
                         everyone prepares their own food and 
                         we eat out of cans.

                                     MACREADY
                         Gotchya.

               EXT. COMPOUND

               A siren goes off, signaling the end of a twenty-minute period. 
               Sanchez pulls himself out of the trash dump.

               Palmer carries a large part of a helicopter engine toward 
               the compound.

               INT. COMPOUND

               The hallway near the supply storage cubicle. MacReady holds 
               the door open as Palmer makes his way to him lugging the 
               heavy helicopter part.

               Childs passes by from the other direction.

                                     PALMER
                         Childs, where's that magneto from 
                         Chopper One?

                                     CHILDS
                         Ain't it there?

               He passes by.

                                     PALMER
                         No it ain't there. Would I be asking 
                         if it were there?

                                     MACREADY
                         Move it, Palmer.

               INT. SUPPLY STORAGE ROOM

               Palmer sets down the heavy part. Norris follows him inside 
               with a bundle of radio gear. They move back out into the 
               hallway. MacReady locks the door behind them.

               HALLWAY

               The three move down the hall toward their appointed rendezvous 
               at the rec room.

                                     MACREADY
                              (to Palmer)
                         Start taking apart those snowmobiles 
                         next, huh?

               INT. KITCHEN

               Cramped. Several of the men are preparing their food.

               Opening cans. Heating them in pots.

               EXT. COMPOUND

               Nauls wearily approaches Blair's tool shed with a tray of 
               food. He hears a pounding from within.

                                     NAULS
                         I got your goodies, superdude.

               He peeks in through the opening in the boarded-up window.

               Blair is nailing himself in from the inside. He looks pretty 
               crazed.

                                     NAULS
                         What you doin'?

                                     BLAIR
                         Nobody's getting in here. You can 
                         tell them all that!

                                     NAULS
                         Well, who the hell you think wants 
                         to get in there with you?

               Nauls slides the tray in the slot. It is immediately shoved 
               back out and topples onto the ice. Some of the food has 
               splashed on Nauls' heavy coat.

                                     NAULS
                         Now why'd you go and...

                                     BLAIR
                         And I don't want any more food with 
                         sedatives in it. I know what you're 
                         up to. Don't think I don't. And if 
                         anyone tries to get in here -- I've 
                         got rope. I'll hang myself before it 
                         gets to me.

                                     NAULS
                         You promise?

               Nauls picks up the tray, heads back mumbling.

                                     NAULS
                         Crazy white scientist motherfucker...

               EXT. COMPOUND

               Palmer works on the snowmobile. Sanchez resumes searching 
               through the trash.

               INT. BALLOON TOWER

               MacReady slashes into the huge uninflated weather balloons, 
               rendering them useless. Tanks of helium and hydrogen are 
               stacked nearby.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Nauls does the dishes. His cassette plays in the b.g.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Childs continues guarding the three men.

                                     CLARK
                         Gotta go to the can, Childs.

               Childs follows him to the other end of the room.

                                     CHILDS
                         Be quick.

               Clark walks to the head. Childs moves back to the middle of 
               the room. As the guard he is much more vulnerable in this 
               position. Being split between his prisoners.

               The lights begin to flicker. The soft purr of the generator 
               begins to fade.

                                     CHILDS
                         Oh, no.

               The lights go out. Nauls calls from the kitchen.

                                     NAULS (O.S.)
                         Childs! That a fuse?

                                     CHILDS
                         No. The generator. You got the 
                         auxiliary box just off the kitchen. 
                         Get to it.
                              (fumbling around)
                         Where's the damn flashlight?
                              (calling out)
                         You fellas okay over there?

               Dr. Copper giggles in the dark.

                                     CHILDS
                         Cut that out, Copper.
                              (beat)
                         Nauls? What's taking you?!

                                     NAULS (O.S.)
                         I'm working it! Nothing's happening!

                                     CHILDS
                         That's impossible, man! Okay, Clark, 
                         out of the john where I can see you!

                                     NAULS (O.S.)
                         It's shorted out or something!

                                     CHILDS
                              (shouting)
                         Clark, you come on out here!!

               Childs lights the tip of his torch, allowing him a strong 
               candlelight. Garry is no longer in the room.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where's... Where's Garry?

               Dr. Copper looks numbly at the empty seat next to him. Childs 
               finds the portable siren and blares it.

               EXT. COMPOUND

               MacReady, Palmer and Sanchez heed the call and head for the 
               compound.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Childs jerks his head around in different directions.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where are you, Garry? Don't you move 
                         an inch, Copper.
                              (shouts)
                         Nauls, bring me a goddamn flashlight!

               INT. KITCHEN

               Pitch black.

                                     NAULS
                         Somebody's taken it. I can't find 
                         it!

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         Clark, you want me to come in after 
                         you?!

               INT. HALLWAY

               MacReady, Sanchez and Palmer come in from the outside.

               They bump into each other trying to get their bearings from 
               the lack of light. Palmer, the only one who seems to have 
               one, turns on his flashlight.

                                     MACREADY
                              (shouting)
                         What's happened?!

                                     NORRIS (O.S.)
                         MacReady, that you?

                                     MACREADY
                         Yeah!

                                     NORRIS (O.S.)
                         It's the generator I think! No power.

                                     MACREADY
                              (to Palmer)
                         Well, let's get down there.

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         MacReady!

                                     MACREADY
                         What?

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         Garry's missing!

                                     MACREADY
                              (to self)
                         Oh, shit!
                              (shouts)
                         Well, hang on!

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         Gee, thanks!

               INT. GENERATOR ROOM

               Palmer and MacReady stumbling down the stairs. MacReady turns 
               around, looks.

                                     MACREADY
                         Where's Sanchez?

               Both look around. Sanchez is gone. Palmer's light finds the 
               motionless generator. He examines it.

                                     PALMER
                         The fuel pump... it's gone...
                              (frantic)
                         You've got to get up to supply, Mca. 
                         If we don't get this thing started 
                         soon, it'll freeze on us and we'll 
                         never get it going.

               MacReady dashes upstairs into the darkness.

               INT. HALLWAY

               The lab door is opened. Fuchs holding a small candle walks 
               out. As he passes, the shoulder of a man springs into frame.

               INT. GENERATOR ROOM

               Palmer is feverishly working underneath the generator on his 
               back.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The temperature continues to drop rapidly. Childs swats 
               himself to keep warm, while still keeping an eye on Dr. Copper 
               and the rest of the room.

               INT. HALLWAY

               MacReady rushes out of the supply room, with a fuel pump, 
               bumps into somebody.

                                     MACREADY
                         Who... Who is that?

               The silhouette moves on down the hallway.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sanchez...?  Hey, who...

                                     PALMER (O.S.)
                         Mac, where the hell is that pump!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GENERATOR ROOM

               MacReady holds the flashlight for Palmer. Their breath, puffs 
               of white smoke.

                                     PALMER
                         Somebody definitely messed with it.

                                     MACREADY
                         We going to make it?

                                     PALMER
                         Hope so. Another ten, fifteen minutes. 
                         What I don't get is...

               The sound of a screeching. From somewhere in the compound. 
               The two men's faces, locked in fear.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. REC ROOM

               The generator has been repaired; the lights within the 
               compound are back on.

               Grim and tense. Everyone is present but Fuchs. Eyes flit 
               from man to man. Palmer, Nauls and Sanchez are spread out 
               about the room, keeping as much distance as possible from 
               the rest.

               Norris and Childs are tying the Doctor, Clark and Garry to 
               the couch. MacReady prepares several makeshift blowtorches 
               as he kneels on the ground.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Where were the flashlights?

                                     MACREADY
                         Screw the flashlights. Where the 
                         hell were you?

                                     PALMER
                         Tons of stuff's been missing around 
                         here. Magnetos, cables, wire...

                                     NAULS
                         Kitchen things, too...

                                     MACREADY
                         Anybody see Fuchs... or hear him...? 
                         Huh?

               No answer as the men's faces roam the room. Childs glares at 
               Garry as he begins to tie him in.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where'd you go?

               Garry's groggy features stare blankly.

                                     CHILDS
                         I said where? Where'd you go?!

                                     GARRY
                         Was dark... find a light...

                                     CHILDS
                         You lying bastard...

               Garry struggles to his feet, affronted.

                                     GARRY
                              (slurring)
                         I rather don't like your tone...

               He grabs Childs by the collar.

                                     CHILDS
                         You sit back down...

               Childs whales on him with a right hand. Both go tumbling 
               over the couch. MacReady and Norris dive in breaking it up.

                                     NORRIS
                         Enough...

               MacReady, furious, pulls Childs away.

               Norris breathing heavily from the activity, massages his 
               chest. The strong, stormy winds overhead batter the roofing. 
               MacReady glances up. He and Childs release each other.

                                     MACREADY
                         That storm's going to start ripping 
                         any minute -- so we don't have much 
                         time.

               He thrusts one of the blowtorches hard into Childs' stomach.

                                     MACREADY
                         We've got to find Fuchs. When we 
                         find him -- we kill him.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Why?

                                     MACREADY
                         If he's one of those Things, we've 
                         got to get to him before he changes... 
                         Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check 
                         the outside shacks...

               He tosses torches to Sanchez and Palmer.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sanchez, you and Palmer search the 
                         inside...

                                     PALMER
                         I ain't going with Sanchez.

               Sanchez snaps his head toward Palmer. Palmer looks at the 
               others.

                                     PALMER
                         I ain't going with him. I'll go with 
                         Childs...

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Well, screw you, man!

                                     PALMER
                         I ain't going with you!

                                     CHILDS
                         Well, who says I want you going with 
                         me?!

                                     MACREADY
                         Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, 
                         you come with us. Norris... you stay 
                         here...
                              (refers to tied-up 
                              men)
                         Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And 
                         if you hear anything, anything at 
                         all you let loose the siren. We all 
                         meet back here in twenty minutes 
                         regardless.
                              (a beat)
                         And everybody watch whoever you're 
                         with. Real close.

               The men survey each other.

                                     MACREADY
                         Let's move.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

               MacReady and Nauls, wearing their snowshoes and using flares 
               for light, pull themselves along the steadying rope that 
               leads to Blair's shed. They are careful to keep an eye on 
               each other as they move along.

               Sanchez heads off in the direction of another shack.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPOUND - HALLWAY

               One of the many doors creak open. Childs and Palmer stealthily 
               move into the next corridor. Palmer falls a few steps behind.

                                     PALMER
                         What'd we ever do to these Things 
                         anyway...

               Childs freezes and snaps his head around facing Palmer. A 
               beat.

                                     PALMER
                         What?

                                     CHILDS
                         Don't walk behind me.

               Another beat.

                                     PALMER
                         Right.

               He moves to the other side of the wall, parallel with Childs. 
               They continue on, skimming along the sides of the corridor 
               in plain view of one another.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND

               Nauls and MacReady arrive at Blair's shack. They peer in 
               through the spaces between the boards.

               A weak light burns as Blair is seated eating out of a can. A 
               hangman's noose dangles from the ceiling nearby.

                                     MACREADY
                         Hey, Blair!!

               Blair jumps in fear, spilling his can.

                                     MACREADY
                         Has Fuchs been out here?

               Blair approaches the boarded-up window. He looks haggard and 
               afraid.

                                     BLAIR
                         I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd 
                         like to come back inside... I don't 
                         want to stay out here any more...  
                         Funny things... I hear funny things 
                         out here.

                                     MACREADY
                         Have you come across Fuchs?

                                     BLAIR
                         Fuchs...? No, it's not Fuchs... You 
                         must let me back in... I won't harm 
                         anyone... I promise...

                                     MACREADY
                         We'll see...

               He and Nauls trudges off. Blair shouts after them.

                                     BLAIR
                         I promise! I'm much better now! I'll 
                         be good!! I'm all better!! Don't 
                         leave me here!!

               INT. REC ROOM

               Norris continues his watch on the sedated trio. He anxiously 
               tries to keep an eye on the various entrances behind and in 
               front of him. He rubs his chest in pain.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I'm getting worried about you. You 
                         ought to have a checkup.

                                     NORRIS
                         Let's just not get worried about 
                         anything just now.

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (yawning)
                         After all this mess then.

                                     NORRIS
                              (nodding)
                         After all this mess.

               EXT. COMPOUND - THE SLOPE TO MACREADY'S SHACK

               The winds are thick and vicious now. MacReady and Nauls pull 
               themselves along the rope fighting their way up the slope. A 
               violent gust sends MacReady's body horizontal, but still 
               hanging onto the rope. The wind slaps him back down. His 
               flare and torch tumble back toward Nauls.

               Nauls saves the torch from rolling down the hill.

               MacReady, lying vulnerable, watches Nauls pull his way toward 
               him. He tenses. Nauls reaches him. A beat. He hands back his 
               torch. Relieved, MacReady pulls himself upright.

               INT. COMPOUND - KITCHEN - CLOSE ON THICK POWER CABLES

               that line the wall. They have been torn apart. Childs and 
               Palmer examine.

                                     PALMER
                         Auxiliary light cables...? Been cut.

                                     CHILDS
                         Cut, bullshit. Been pulled apart.

               EXT. MACREADY'S SHACK

               as they reach the top. The remaining flare their only light. 
               Very dark. They stand on either side of the door. MacReady 
               shoves it open. Pitch black inside. MacReady flips the light 
               switch. Doesn't work.

               INT. SHACK

               They enter. Hunched. Torches ready. The place is a mess. The 
               winds as strong as on the outside.

               The single flare illuminating the ceiling. Almost all of the 
               corrugated, steel roofing is gone. As if ripped off.

                                     NAULS
                              (shouting to be heard)
                         Where's the roof?!

               MacReady stares up incredulous, as they advance through the 
               room.

                                     NAULS
                         This storm do that?

                                     MACREADY
                              (shouting)
                         Couldn't be possible. Must have 
                         weighted a ton and a half...

               Nauls kicks over a chair. A naked, fleshy object bounds high 
               into the air. Nauls thrusts out his torch, catching the 
               breasts of the inflatable woman. She pops and is sucked out 
               through the hole in the roof.

               Nauls tries to catch his breath.

                                     NAULS
                         Goddamn white women.

               INT. COMPOUND

               Underground, rickety corridor. Palmer stands by as Childs 
               undoes the many locks to the room that houses his plants.

               One by one. Palmer twists his head in every which direction. 
               Nervous.

               Childs pulls open the heavy door. A flush of snow and wind 
               push them back. They wedge their bodies at the entrance to 
               the lightless room.

                                     CHILDS
                         My babies.

               They enter. The light from the hall exposes the completely 
               smashed-in window high above the plants. The plants look 
               frozen.

                                     PALMER
                         Somebody broke in.

                                     CHILDS
                         Now who'd go and do...

               Saddened, angry, Childs goes to check the damage to his 
               plants. Palmer, his face set in horror, yanks him back.

                                     PALMER
                         Childs!!

                                     CHILDS
                         Let go of me...

                                     PALMER
                         Don't get near 'em. The plants! 
                         They're alive. Those things can 
                         imitate anything...

                                     CHILDS
                         What's it going to do, being a plant?

               Palmer readies his small torch.

                                     PALMER
                         We got to burn 'em.

                                     CHILDS
                         Now hold on, you dumb...

               Palmer sprays them with flame. Childs pushes him to the 
               ground, and tries to swat out the fire.

                                     CHILDS
                         You stupid, sonofa...

               Palmer, his mouth agape with terror, screams and points to 
               the closing door to their rear. Childs whirls.

               FUCHS

               One arm outstretched, swings into view. An ax, embedded deep 
               into his chest, pins his frozen body to the inside of the 
               door.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Norris startled by the scream, turns on the siren.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PLANT ROOM

               Sanchez has joined Childs and Palmer. The body of Fuchs is 
               still pinned to the door. Sanchez tries to wrench the ax 
               loose. It is too deeply embedded and won't budge.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Whoever put this through him...

               Sanchez observes Childs' hulking frame and adds pointedly:

                                     SANCHEZ
                         ...is one bad-ass and strong muther.

                                     CHILDS
                         No one's that strong, boy!

               INT. PASSAGEWAY

               Tracking with the three men. Opening and closing doors, as 
               they make their way back to the rec room. They keep their 
               distance from each other, watching each other while they 
               walk.

                                     PALMER
                         Why didn't it imitate Fuchs? Isn't 
                         that its number -- to get more 
                         recruits.

                                     CHILDS
                         Wasn't enough time. Generator was 
                         out, what...? Thirty minutes. Takes 
                         the bastards an hour, maybe two to 
                         absorb somebody.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Why Fuchs?

                                     CHILDS
                         He was working on a test. Fuchs must 
                         have been onto something. These 
                         bastards got scared and got rid of 
                         him.
                              (suddenly realizing)
                         ...Hey... Where's...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPOUND - CLOSE ON PALMER'S FACE

               shouting down a passageway.

                         MacReady!!

               CLOSE ON CHILDS

               bellowing.

                         Nauls!! MacReady!!

               EXT. COMPOUND

               A strong driftwind streams snow across the ground obscuring 
               everything but the very top of the buildings.

               The siren screams.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Rigid, immobile faces. Listening to the storm overhead.

                                     CHILDS
                         How long they been out now?

                                     NORRIS
                         Forty... Forty-five minutes.

               Silence, as the uneasy eyes measure one another.

                                     CHILDS
                         We better start closing off the 
                         outside hatchways.

               VARIOUS ANGLES OF THE COMPOUND

               Childs, Sanchez and Palmer -- closing off and bolting the 
               entrances to the camp.

                                     NORRIS (O.S.)
                         All of you! Come here!

               INT. COMPOUND MAIN HALLWAY - POINT OF VIEW - THE MEN

               Through the fogged-up windows, a figure can be seen 
               approaching the main compound. It pulls and drags its way 
               along the guide rope, fighting the gale force winds.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MEN

               weapons in hand, huddle at the main doorway. They unbolt it. 
               Sleet and hail send Nauls rolling in from the outside. The 
               men force the door back and lock it.

               The weary Nauls kneels on the floor and gasps for air.

               The others surround him.

                                     PALMER
                         Where's MacReady?

               Nauls weighs each of them ominously, while digging down 
               underneath his heavy jacket.

                                     NAULS
                         Cut him loose of the line up by his 
                         shack.

                                     CHILDS
                         Cut him loose?

                                     NAULS
                         When we were up poking around his 
                         place... I found this...

               He pulls out a thick bundle of heavy clothing. It is mutilated 
               and partially burned. He holds out the jacket to show the 
               inside collar.

               Close on name tag -- it reads: R.J. MACREADY The men, as 
               they examine in a hush.

                                     NAULS
                         ...It was stashed in his old coal 
                         furnace... wind must have dislodged 
                         it... I don't think he saw me find 
                         it.

               The men continue to examine in various states of disbelief.

                                     NAULS
                         ...Made sure I got ahead of him on 
                         the towline on the way back... cut 
                         him loose.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (incredulous)
                         MacReady...?

                                     NAULS
                         He's one of them.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (scared)
                         When do you think it got to him?

                                     PALMER
                         Could have been anytime. Anywhere.

                                     CHILDS
                              (to Nauls, suspicious)
                         If it did get to him.

                                     NAULS
                         Look, man...

                                     PALMER
                         When the lights went out...

                                     NORRIS
                         Would have been a perfect time...

                                     PALMER
                         Right. Garry was missing...
                              (pointedly)
                         ...And Sanchez...

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (goes for him)
                         Fuck you, Palmer.

               Childs and Norris separate them.

                                     NORRIS
                         This is just what it wants... to pit 
                         us against each other.

               A pounding at the door sends the men jerking backward.

               Nauls scampers to his feet. They tense.

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         Open up!

               No answer as the men surround the door, their weapons ready.  
               Fear.

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         ...Hey, somebody! Open up, it's me, 
                         MacReady...
                              (still nothing)
                         ...Come on, damn it... The towline 
                         snapped. Been crawling around like a 
                         seal out here...

                                     NAULS
                              (harsh whisper)
                         Bullshit! He's got to know damn well 
                         I cut it!

               The men keep their voices low.

                                     PALMER
                         Let's open it.

                         Hell no.

               More pounding.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (shaking)
                         You think he's changed into one of 
                         those Things?

                                     NORRIS
                         He hasn't had enough time.

                         guideline...

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         ...Where is everybody?! I'm half 
                         frostbit!

                                     PALMER
                         Let's open it. Now...

                                     CHILDS
                              (edgy, hostile)
                         Why you so damn anxious to let him 
                         in here...

                                     PALMER
                              (slightly trembling)
                         He's so close. Maybe our best chance 
                         to blow him away.

                                     CHILDS
                         No. Just let him freeze out there.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (voice cracking)
                         What if we're wrong about him?

                                     CHILDS
                         Then we're wrong.

               The muffled breaking of a window down the hall. The men turn.

                                     PALMER
                         The supply window!

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (terror)
                         What we going to...

                                     NORRIS
                         All right... all right... we've got 
                         no choice now...

               INT. SUPPLY ROOM

               Pitch black. MacReady's voice is heard cursing as he appears 
               to be stumbling around, looking for a light switch. He 
               responds to the muffled voices at the door.

                                     MACREADY
                         What's going on out there?

               HALLWAY

               Palmer stands by as Childs tries the knob. Locked.

                                     CHILDS
                         Damn it, he's got the keys.

               Childs rips a nearby fire ax off the wall and begins hacking 
               away at the door.

               INT. SUPPLY ROOM

                                     MACREADY
                         What are you doing?

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a 
                         dead whatever the hell you are!

               MacReady begins to rummage through the supplies in the 
               darkness.

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         We found your clothes -- the ones 
                         you tried to burn.

                                     MACREADY
                         What clothes?

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         You been made, MacReady.

               Childs chops away. MacReady desperately continues rummaging 
               through the supplies.

                                     MACREADY
                         Someone's trying to mark me, you 
                         bastard... trying to frame me.

               HALLWAY

               Childs cautions to Palmer as he prepares for one last blow.

                                     CHILDS
                         Move in slow now.

               Crunch. The door gives. The men move in. Their blow torches 
               ready. They freeze.

               MacReady stands before them holding a lighted flare. His 
               hair and clothing are covered with snow; his cheeks and nose 
               blackened by frostbite. Tucked under his arm is an entire 
               box of dynamite. He holds the flare dangerously close to the 
               open box.

                                     MACREADY
                         Anyone messes with me -- the whole 
                         camp goes.

               He appears to mean it. They don't seem anxious to test him.

                                     MACREADY
                         Put those torches on the floor and 
                         back off.

               They do. He follows them out into the hall.

               HALLWAY

               The men step backwards carefully.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...back way off.

               They heed, retreating further down the hall. MacReady glances 
               behind him.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...Where's the rest...

               Nauls and Norris, who have silently crept in through the 
               supply window, come flying through the hacked-up door and 
               barrel into MacReady. Both going straight for the flare.

               MacReady spins Nauls off and rips into Norris, sending him 
               crashing violently into the wall. Nauls tackles MacReady's 
               legs, pulling him to the floor.

               The others rush him. MacReady, still in control of the 
               dynamite and flare, bellow:

                                     MACREADY
                         So help me I mean it!!

               They skid to a halt. Nauls crawls away, quickly.

                                     NAULS
                         It's cool, man. We ain't near you, 
                         man... Stay cool...

                                     PALMER
                         Yeah, man, really. Just relax.

                                     MACREADY
                         Anybody touches me... we go.

               Norris, lying on the floor, coughs as if gasping for breath. 
               He quivers for a moment and then is still. Nauls crawls over 
               to him and shakes him. A beat.

                                     NAULS
                         I don't think he's breathing.

               Nauls listens to Norris' chest. MacReady stands.

                                     MACREADY
                         Go untie the Doc. Get him in here. 
                         Bring the others, too...
                              (grins menacingly)
                         From now on no one gets out of my 
                         sight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. INFIRMARY

               Norris' body is plopped on the examination table. Copper 
               stumbles and is steadied by some of the men. MacReady 
               continues to keep his distance.

               Copper places an oxygen mask over Norris' face. He then rips 
               open his shirt.

                                     MACREADY
                         So you sweethearts had yourselves a 
                         little trial. I just may have to 
                         kill you on general principle, Nauls.

               Copper begins swathing Norris' chest with a gelatin substance.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...Ever occur to the jury that anybody 
                         could have gotten to some of my 
                         clothes and stuck them up...

                                     CHILDS
                         We ain't buying that.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Damn it, quit the bickering and give 
                         me a hand. Wheel that fibrillator 
                         over here.

               Sanchez pushes over the portable fibrillator. Copper climbs 
               up on the table and straddles Norris' chest.

               Unnoticed, Clark paws the contents of the instrument tray 
               behind his back.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Palmer, turn on that oxygen and hold 
                         the mask over his face... Childs, 
                         grab his shoulders.

               They do so. Copper holds electrical prongs over Norris' chest.

                                     CHILDS
                              (to MacReady, 
                              threatening)
                         You're going to have to sleep 
                         sometime.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Quiet down...
                              (to Sanchez)
                         ...turn that thing on.

               Sanchez depresses the "on" button.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Now hold him.

                                     MACREADY
                         I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Enough, MacReady!

               Dr. Copper presses the prongs onto Norris' chest and shoots 
               a bolt of current. Norris' body heaves upward. A slight 
               crackling sound and an odd chirp through the oxygen mask.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Again... More current this time, 
                         Sanchez...

               Buzzz. Several more jolts from the prongs. Clark's hand has 
               found a scalpel. He gently lifts it out, bringing it to his 
               side.

                                     MACREADY
                         And if anyone tries to wake me...

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Damn you, MacReady!

               Norris' body begins bounding up. More crackling and popping. 
               His chest begins to break up and spread. The mask pops off -- 
               a hideous mewing escaping from Norris' distorted mouth.

               The men jump back, incredulous. Dr. Copper scrambles off his 
               chest and flops to the floor.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         God... what...?

               They watch on in stunned horror as The Thing that was Norris 
               begins to change, to spread awkwardly on the slab.

               Its clothes tearing. A shoe splits in half and falls to the 
               floor, exposing the beginnings of a talon.

               MacReady charges toward it, shooing the men off.

                                     MACREADY
                         Get out of the way!!

               He unloads with a stream of flame. The body writhes in pain, 
               belching and hissing. The slab catches fire. It struggles, 
               lunges for the floor, straightens up, and moves a few feet.

               A black and yellow substance rips through its trousers and 
               squirts to the floor. Norris' body collapses on the 
               fibrillating machine in flames. Extinguishers are ripped 
               from the walls and put to work.

               MacReady watches the smoking particles of ooze in fascination, 
               as they twitch and mew on the floor.

               Within seconds the fire is out. The men stand around in awe 
               as they look upon The Thing that was once Norris.

               MacReady continues to observe the small particles. Their 
               tiny squeals abating into silence.

               INT. REC ROOM

               MacReady, still carrying the industrial torch, has maneuvered 
               all the men into the room. He holds Garry's .44. He has 
               untaped the explosives from his chest and laid them on the 
               nearby table next to two more boxes of dynamite.

                                     CLARK
                         What you got in mind, MacReady?

                                     MACREADY
                         A little test.

                                     PALMER
                         What kind of test?

                                     MACREADY
                         I'm sure a lot of you already know.

               He tosses a ream of steel cable and some rope to Palmer.

                                     MACREADY
                         Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone 
                         down. Real tight.

                                     CHILDS
                         What for?

                                     MACREADY
                         For your health.

                                     GARRY
                              (to others)
                         Let's rush him. He's not going to 
                         blow us all up.

                                     MACREADY
                         Damn if I won't.

                                     CHILDS
                              (a beat)
                         You ain't tying me up.

                                     MACREADY
                         Then I'll have to kill you.

                                     CHILDS
                         Then kill me.

               MacReady points the .44 at Childs' head.

                                     MACREADY
                         I mean it.

               MacReady cocks his gun. Childs holds his ground.

                                     CHILDS
                         I guess you do.

               A beat. Clark springs for MacReady. Scalpel raised.

               MacReady spins and fires three shots, point-blank, the forces 
               of the charges sending Clark flying backwards. The others, 
               themselves about to pounce, stop -- as MacReady whirls the 
               torch and gun back toward them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MEN

               being tied securely to couches and chairs.

                                     MACREADY
                         Tie up Clark, too.

                                     PALMER
                              (bemused)
                         He's dead.

                                     MACREADY
                         Norris looked pretty dead, himself. 
                         Bullets don't kill these Things.

               MacReady turns on a Bunsen burner while he cuts the rubber 
               covering off an electrical cord, exposing the copper wire.

               All the while, he keeps his eye on the men.

                                     CHILDS
                              (muttering)
                         We should have jumped his ass.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.

               Copper starts to tie Palmer to the small couch next to Childs 
               and Garry.

                                     MACREADY
                         We're going to draw a little bit of 
                         everybody's blood.

                                     NAULS
                         What are you going to do? Drink it?

                                     MACREADY
                         Watching Norris in there... gave me 
                         the idea that maybe every part of 
                         you bastards is a whole. Every piece 
                         of you is self-sufficient, an animal 
                         unto itself. When a man bleeds it's 
                         just tissue. But blood from one of 
                         you Things won't obey. It's a newly 
                         formed individual with a built-in 
                         desire to protect its own life. When 
                         attacked, your blood will try and 
                         survive -- and crawl away from a hot 
                         needle say.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SANCHEZ

               grimacing as Dr. Copper pinches a scalpel to his thumb and 
               collects a small portion of his blood in a dish.

               All the men have been tied up. Palmer, Childs and Garry on 
               the small couch. The others, including the lifeless corpse 
               of Clark, in chairs.

               Copper returns the plate to the table and sets it down in 
               line with the other plates of blood that he has collected.

               The names of each man have been scribbled onto the plates.

               MacReady slides the Doctor a fresh plate.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now you.

               Copper cuts his thumb, his blood dribbles onto the plate.

               He stands nervously for a beat.

                                     MACREADY
                         Slide it back here.

               Copper pushes it toward MacReady.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now step way back.

               Copper steps backward, moisture beginning to collect on his 
               brow. MacReady begins to heat the copper wire over the Bunsen 
               burner.

               The men watch intently. The wire begins to glow. MacReady 
               points the torch directly at the Doctor. Both of them 
               perspiring. MacReady lifts the glowing wire from the flame. 
               The Doctor is dead still. MacReady slowly touches the wire 
               to the Doctor's plate. A soft hiss.

               MacReady heats it again and tries once more. The same soft 
               hiss. MacReady and the Doctor both let out a sigh.

                                     MACREADY
                         I guess you're okay.

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (shaken, facetious)
                         Thank you.

                                     MACREADY
                         I didn't think you'd use that 
                         fibrillator on Norris if you were 
                         one of them.

               He hands Copper the torch.

                                     MACREADY
                         Watch them.

               He cuts himself with the scalpel and begins collecting his 
               own blood.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now I'll show you what I already 
                         know.

               He heats the wire and puts it to his plate. The same harmless 
               hissing. All eyes continue to watch as he tries again. The 
               same result. Childs mumbles.

                                     CHILDS
                         Load of bullshit.

                                     MACREADY
                         We'll see. Let's try Clark.

               He heats the wire and lays it in Clark's dish. The hissing.

                                     CHILDS
                         So Clark was human, huh?

               MacReady nods.

                                     CHILDS
                         So that make you a murderer.

               MacReady glances over the group.

                                     MACREADY
                         Palmer now.

               He sets Palmer's plate in front of him and heats the wire.

                                     GARRY
                         Pure nonsense. This won't prove a 
                         damn thing.

                                     MACREADY
                         Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. 
                         You were the only one who could have 
                         gotten to that blood plasma...
                              (placing the wire in 
                              Palmer's dish)
                         ...we'll do you last...

               Screech!!! The blood howls, trying to crawl off the plate.

               Palmer bolts forward with incredible force, racing for 
               MacReady; his face splitting; his mouth roaring -- dragging 
               the couch, Childs and Garry with him. He smashes into MacReady 
               knocking him over the table.

                                     MACREADY
                         Copper!!

               It's all happened too fast. Copper tries to get off a burst 
               of flame. The ever-changing Palmer breaks his bonds and leaps 
               on the Doctor.

               The others sit helpless, struggling at their bindings.

               MacReady dives on Palmer's back and the three go rolling to 
               the floor. Screeching. Crackling. MacReady pounds viciously 
               at Palmer's head. A powerful, shirt-splitting arm sends him 
               skidding across the floor.

               Copper momentarily has control of the torch. Just as he 
               positions it, Palmer's mouth splits from his chin to his 
               forehead and engulfs the entirety of the Doctor's head.

               The big torch slaps against the wall. Palmer bounds to his 
               feet, wrapping his arms around the dangling, struggling body 
               of Dr. Copper.

               The men are screaming hysterically. MacReady tries to fire 
               up the bruised torch. Busted. Won't work.

               Frustrated, he charges up behind Palmer and begins hammering 
               the thick steel instrument over his head.

               The shirt of Palmer's back erupts in MacReady's face.

               Splitting and ripping wildly, exposing the beginnings of yet 
               another orifice. A blackened, iron-strong tongue lunges 
               outward. Stunned, MacReady manages to elude it, diving for 
               the top of the table by the boxes of dynamite.

               MacReady lights the fuse of a thick roll and bounds from the 
               table. Palmer awkwardly spins in circles, swinging the 
               Doctor's body like a propeller blade, struggling to keep on 
               balance, as he advances on MacReady. The second orifice, 
               spitting and snarling as it continues to take form.

               MacReady waits until Palmer's back spins around, facing him. 
               Only two yards away, MacReady flings his lit roll into the 
               ever-evolving second mouth and leaps onto the couch covering 
               Childs and Garry with his body.

               A muffled boom, as the swallowed explosive ignites from deep 
               within Palmer and sends his flesh splattering all over the 
               room. MacReady rolls away from Childs and Garry as fast as 
               he can.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MACREADY

               perspiring profusely, his hand trembling slightly, prepares 
               to continue the test. He heats the wire.

               The men are pouring sweat, white-knuckled.

               One of the smaller torches is pointed at Nauls. He closes 
               his eyes. MacReady places the heated wire into his plate. 
               Hiss. MacReady exhales. Nauls opens his eyes.

               MacReady unties Nauls with one hand, while the torch stays 
               glued to the others.

               MacReady heats the wire once again. Both he and Nauls have 
               torches aimed at Sanchez. Sanchez is near tears.

               The wire is dipped into the plate... Hisssss.

               Sanchez breaks down and sobs.

               CHILDS

               sits stoicly, while he watches the preparations for his turn.

                                     CHILDS
                         Let's do it, Bwana.

               Nauls and Sanchez take aim five yards away. Fierce, 
               determined. The wire comes off the flame into the plate... 
               the harmless hissing.

               The muscles in Childs' face melt into a sigh.

                                     CHILDS
                         Muthafu...

               ALL EYES

               snap towards station manager Garry. Childs, suddenly realizing 
               who he is sitting next to, squirms.

                                     CHILDS
                         Get me... get me the hell away from... 
                         cut me loose, damn it!

               Nauls rips away his bindings. The other two stand guard.

               Childs scrambles off the couch and onto the floor.

               GARRY

               stares grimly ahead. Childs soaks his clothing with a can of 
               gasoline. He is then surrounded. The room tenses, adrenalin 
               pumps, breathing halts.

               The burner. The torches. The wire. The plate. Garry's face.

               Hisssss.

               MacReady tries again. Hiss. The men breathe. Their torches 
               are lowered. Nauls throws his on the floor.

               Sanchez and Childs flop down in chairs. MacReady wipes his 
               face.

               A long silence. Sanchez weeps quietly with relief.

                                     GARRY
                         I know you gentlemen have been through 
                         a lot. But when you find the time... 
                         I'd rather not spend the rest of the 
                         winter tied to this couch.

               A beat. Childs starts to giggle. The strain on MacReady's 
               jaw begins to lessen. Garry sits catatonic. Nauls scowls at 
               Childs' uncontrollable laughter.

               The infectious rasping causes MacReady a slight smile as he 
               looks up, taking comfort in the sound of the raging Antarctic 
               wind vibrating the roof. Nauls, untying Garry, grumbles, at 
               Childs.

                                     NAULS
                         Shut the damn hell up.

               Childs wipes his eyes and grins over toward MacReady. His 
               smile fades, MacReady is now stone-faced. Childs' grin goes 
               stale, in sudden realization.

                                     MACREADY
                              (almost a whisper)
                         Blair...

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

               The wind rumbles. The storm is at its peak. MacReady, Childs 
               and Nauls, guided by their flares, pull themselves along the 
               steadying rope, headed, for Blair's shack.

               BLAIR'S SHACK

               The door is wide open. They pause by the entrance, trying to 
               balance against the wind. They enter.

               INT. BLAIR'S SHACK

               Empty. A few of the floorboards are loosened. They pull them 
               up. They stare down into a large hole beneath the planking. 
               Something is down there. They pull up more boards.

               The hole is some fifteen feet deep. Its dimensions are the 
               same as the shack. Its space is almost completely taken up 
               by some strange metallic object.

               Crudely fashioned, a patchwork job, but streamlined.

               Sheets of corrugated steel are visible; but cut apart and 
               welded into the desired shapes. The object appears to be 
               unfinished.

                                     NAULS
                         What is it?

                                     MACREADY
                         Everything that's been missing.

                                     CHILDS
                         Spaceship of some kind.

                                     MACREADY
                         Smart S.O.B. He put it together piece 
                         by piece.

                                     NAULS
                         Where was he trying to go?

                                     MACREADY
                         Anyplace but here.

               MacReady pulls out a dozen tightly wrapped sticks of dynamite.

                                     MACREADY
                         But he ain't going to make it.

               Far off, amidst the howling gale -- the screeching. The men 
               jump. MacReady lights the fuse, as they make it to the exit. 
               He tosses it in.

               EXT. COMPOUND ALONG THE ROPE

               The explosion echoes behind them. The men pull along. Their 
               heads jerk in circles, searching into the blackness.

               Some twenty yards to their rear something swooshes down, 
               severing the line. The wind sends the men tumbling along the 
               ice. Childs loosens the line and is blown away, rolling out 
               of sight.

               MacReady and Nauls have lost their torches. They pull 
               feverishly along the ground trying to make it to the compound.

               The screeching closes in behind them. MacReady loses his 
               grip on the rope and is blown toward the main building.

               He crawls along looking for an opening.

               Nauls slides near the outside entrance to the dog kennel.

               He climbs down through the open stairwell.

               INT. PLANT ROOM

               MacReady has found the broken window. He rolls through it, 
               landing on the frozen plants below. Something smashes at the 
               glass above his head, trying to get in. He sprints for the 
               door. Fuchs' frozen body is still pinned to it with the ax. 
               MacReady grapples with the stiff torso which blocks the knob.

               He finally gets it open and lets himself out, slamming and 
               locking the door from the hall. Fuchs' body swings eerily, 
               back and forth.

               INT. HALLWAY

               MacReady charges up the stairs from the plant room. He zooms 
               down the twisting corridors, opening and closing doors. He 
               rounds a bend and crashes into Nauls coming the other way.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. REC ROOM - CLOSE ON SANCHEZ

               pouring gasoline into empty bottles, preparing Molotov 
               cocktails.

               Garry is connecting an electrical device: wires attached to 
               two portable generators. MacReady appears to be injecting 
               something into empty contact capsules. The men work 
               feverishly.

               Nauls rushes in with another box of dynamite.

                                     NAULS
                         What about Childs?

                                     MACREADY
                         Forget about Childs. He's over.

               Nauls begins cutting the wicks off the dynamite.

                                     GARRY
                         Make 'em short. They'll go off quicker 
                         if we need to use them.

               The wind belts into the roofing overhead. Garry sets the 
               wiring to the main doorway. MacReady begins blocking off one 
               of the other entrances with a large computer.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         What if it doesn't come?

                                     MACREADY
                         It'll come. It needs us. We're the 
                         only thing left to imitate...
                              (to Sanchez)
                         Give me a hand.

               They block off a door with two heavy electrical games.

                                     MACREADY
                              (to Sanchez)
                         You and Nauls got to block off the 
                         west side bunks, the mess hall and 
                         the kitchen.

                                     NAULS
                              (protest)
                         You crazy? He might be inside already?

                                     MACREADY
                         Chance we got to take. We got to 
                         force him to come down the east side 
                         to the door we got rigged.

               Nauls starts lacing his skates.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         He might just wait us out.

                                     MACREADY
                         I'm going to blow the generator when 
                         you get back. He'll have to come for 
                         us -- or freeze.

               MacReady further barricades the door with small couch.

                                     MACREADY
                         We've got portable heaters -- we'll 
                         last longer.

               Sanchez and Nauls start to leave.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...Hold it.

               He dispenses the capsules.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sodium cyanide. We place them between 
                         our cheeks and gums... This Thing 
                         can't imitate anything that's dead.

               A grim silence.

                                     MACREADY
                         If it gets a hold of you -- bite 
                         down... They're supposed to be fast 
                         and painless... Now move.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CORRIDOR

               Sanchez and Nauls inch their way through.

               INT. REC ROOM

               MacReady rips linen, soaks the strips in gas, and stuffs 
               them in the Molotov bottles. Garry tests the current on the 
               door. Popping, sparks, smoke.

                                     MACREADY
                         Looks good.

                                     GARRY
                         One thousand volts. Should be enough.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Nauls pushes a stove, reinforcing a locked door. Five yards 
               away, Sanchez maneuvers the refrigerator in front of another 
               outlet.

               Sanchez hears a quiet purring, bubbling sound. He turns to 
               Nauls.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         You hear that?

                                     NAULS
                         Hear what?

               A blaring. They whip their attention to stereo speakers on 
               either side of the kitchen. Rock music screams out. Top 
               volume.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The same loud music. MacReady and Garry look to the three 
               speakers attached to the walls. MacReady yells his 
               incomprehension to Garry. Garry tries to respond. Their voices 
               drowned out.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Empty. Another of the stereo speakers that line the walls, 
               thunders.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Nauls, in sudden realization, screams over the din and points 
               back in the direction they came.

                                     NAULS
                         It's got into the pub! It's turned 
                         on the stereo!

                                     SANCHEZ
                         What?!

                                     NAULS
                         It's in between us and them!! How we 
                         going to get back?!

                                     SANCHEZ
                         I can't hear you.

               INT. REC ROOM

               MacReady, cursing, rips the speakers off the wall.

                                     MACREADY
                         What are they doing out there?!

               The music is now subdued within the room, but continues 
               booming throughout the camp. Nauls' scream can be barely 
               heard.

                                     GARRY
                         What's he saying?

               INT. KITCHEN - NAULS

               at the top of his lungs...

                                     NAULS
                         MacReady! We been cut off!!

               A sharp, red, talon-like fingernail, pierces the top of the 
               door above Nauls' head. It saws downward, quickly.

               Black goo drips through the slit. The sawing obscured by the 
               music.

               Sanchez, eyes bulging, points. Nauls turns. A claw rips 
               through the wood. Nauls dives to the floor.

               In the opposite direction, behind Sanchez, another arm splits 
               through the door and the refrigerator, extends itself five 
               feet and yanks Sanchez back as if he were a puppet.

               Sanchez struggles, looking imploringly at Nauls. He bites 
               down on his capsule. Nauls takes off like a speed skater.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The sound of the screeching over the music.

                                     MACREADY
                         Got to get to the generator.

               He opens the door. Looks down the hall. No one. The speakers -- 
               blaring music.

               NAULS

               full speed down the maze. Left. Right. Totally reckless. He 
               hits a straightaway.

               SANCHEZ'S BODY

               from out of nowhere, blasts through the hallway wall, directly 
               in Nauls' path. A thick arm pins the body to the other side. 
               Unable to stop, Nauls skids out of control, banging into the 
               sides of the wall, his cyanide capsule flying out of his 
               mouth.

               Whatever the rest of it is, it starts to crumble through the 
               wall. Nauls dives over the arm, somersaults to his feet and 
               takes off.

               INT. MAIN HALL

               MacReady, running, spots Nauls careening out of a turn, 
               heading toward him.

                                     NAULS
                         Get back!!

                                     MACREADY
                         The generator!

                                     NAULS
                         Screw the generator!!

               Nauls blazes by him. MacReady hears the snarls and screeches 
               heading his way. He streaks after Nauls.

               INT. REC ROOM

               They make it in. Lock the door... MacReady tries to catch 
               his breath. Nauls shakes, pants.

                                     NAULS
                         Got Sanchez... World War Three 
                         wouldn't mess with this fucker...  
                         Can go through walls... And it's 
                         like all over the place...

                                     MACREADY
                         Calm down and get in your position.

                                     NAULS
                         Position, my ass...

               Garry fiddles with the two generators.

                                     GARRY
                         I'm going to bump this up, much as I 
                         can.

                                     NAULS
                         Boulder Dam might do it.

               The loud music in the compound is turned off. MacReady shuts 
               off the lights. The men spread out. Silence.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. REC ROOM

               The men watch all the doors. Dead silence. Dark. Whispers.

                                     GARRY
                         How long's it been?

                                     MACREADY
                         Little over two hours.

                                     NAULS
                         Maybe it ain't coming.

                                     MACREADY
                         Then we go after him.

                                     NAULS
                         Bet the last place you ever go.

               The sound of a door opening and closing. Far off.

               Another creaking door is opened. A rustling. Still far off. 
               MacReady and Nauls spread further apart.

               The soft bubbling, cooling sound. A slight scratch at the 
               door. Garry's hand tightens around the generator switches. 
               The scratching gets more pronounced. MacReady cautions Garry 
               with a whisper.

                                     MACREADY
                         Wait...

               The door begins to pound from the outside. Nauls and MacReady 
               light two cocktails each.

               The door booms. The room's foundations shake. The ceiling 
               quivers. The gas bombs are cocked.

               From the roof The Thing roars down into their midst.

               Stunned, the men stumble back. MacReady throws his gas bomb. 
               Nauls the same.

               For a moment it stands silhouetted in flame. Enormous.

               Grotesque.

               Garry bolts for the main door. The Thing's tongue spirals 
               from his mouth and spears him. The good two-thirds of its 
               body follows its tongue and engulfs Garry by the door.

               Another leg slaps Nauls to the ground. MacReady dodges still 
               another appendage, dives on the generators and throws the 
               switch.

               The current rips through the door. Garry dies instantly.

               One of The Thing's talons, still caught in the door, sends 
               it writhing in pain. It literally rips the door from its 
               latchings and pounds it to the ground, trying to shake it 
               loose. Nauls, hobbles, scrambles, out of the opening.

               MacReady dives through the window and out into the storm.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPOUND - HALL

               The distant sound of a motor. Nauls, battered and bloodied, 
               his leg apparently broken, crawls along the ground. Another 
               sound, a bubbling and gurgling is heard well to his rear. 
               But closing.

               The terror forces him to drag faster, oblivious to the pain.

               He reaches the bathroom stall. Crawls in. Locks it. The 
               gurgling nears. Leaning on the toilet seat, he looks about 
               himself, frantically.

               The Presence pauses at the door. A scratching. Nauls paws, 
               rips at a cracked and weathered slab of wood, cutting his 
               fingers as he tries to break it off the siding.

               A strong blow begins to breach the stall door. Nauls finally 
               unhinges the piece of wood, brings the jagged end to one 
               side of his throat and rips...

               INT. LAB WALL

               The motorized rumbling nears. The wall seems to explode. The 
               tractor barrels into the lab. Its enormous shovel scooper 
               tearing half the room to shreds.

               MacReady drives. His eyes glint like a wild man's; he looks 
               stark raving mad.

               His frostbite, now in an advanced stage, resembles black war 
               paint. He clenches a stick of dynamite between his teeth, 
               like a buccaneer's cutlass. Two large, compressed air tanks 
               have been tied together at the top and are draped around his 
               neck. They are marked -- HYDROGEN.

               They are used for the weather balloons.

               He pulls the tractor to a stop, yanks the stick from his 
               mouth, grins and bellows.

                                     MACREADY
                         Okay, creep! Just you and me now! Be 
                         on your toes! We're going to do a 
                         little remodeling!

               MacReady guns it through the next wall and into the infirmary. 
               Medical equipment goes flying. The machine is powerful; the 
               prefabricated walls buckling under its force.

               INT. COMPOUND

               A trail of viscous yellow ooze leads around a bend.

               Boom.

               MacReady rams into the mess hall, sweeping away tables, 
               chairs. He sings out loud the lyrics of some Mexican song. 
               All the while he keeps his eyes on everything.

               Through the kitchen. The foundation is crumbling. He sings 
               on.

               NARROW PASSAGEWAY

               Gurgling and hissing. A taloned arm slinks around a corner 
               in retreat.

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         Chime in if you know that words, old 
                         boy.

               MACREADY

               plows through several more rooms before ending up in the pub 
               area. He backs it up and retrieves a bottle of liquor from 
               the bar.

                                     MACREADY
                         You like whiskey? Come on, join me 
                         for a drink. Be good for you. Grow 
                         fangs on your chest.

               He takes a drink and rams through another wall.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The tractor blazes into the rec room. MacReady parks it 
               directly in front of the hole in the roof, created by The 
               Thing when it surprised them earlier.

                                     MACREADY
                         Damn it, ran out of gas.

               He pulls off the heavy hydrogen tanks and drapes them over 
               the tractor. As he talks his eyes move like a hawk passing 
               from roof, to doorways, to rubble.

               Wind and ice bristle through the gaping holes, stinging 
               MacReady with the cold. He winces at his mittenless, blackened 
               fingers.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sweetheart, it's going to get mighty 
                         cold in here soon... You better make 
                         your move... I mean, hell, I'm only 
                         one person...

               He takes a swig from his bottle.

                                     MACREADY
                         I know you're bugged because we ruined 
                         your trip, right? Spiffy little toy 
                         you had there.

               A slight tremor perks his eyes and ears. He looks up through 
               the hole, then around. He lights a lighter and cups it in 
               his hand near the stick of dynamite in his lap.

                                     MACREADY
                         But your real hang up is your looks...

               A stronger tremor. The adrenalin pumps.

                                     MACREADY
                              (wants him bad)
                         Atta boy. I know you're around.

               The floor shakes. MacReady stands, his head whirling around 
               the room.

                                     MACREADY
                         Come on, sucker.

               The tractor inches up off the ground. MacReady falls forward 
               and looks straight down through the chassis and into the 
               vile and grinning face below. A claw flashes up, splitting 
               the steering wheel but missing his face.

               He depresses the ignition, bolting the tractor ten feet.

               He jumps, hanging onto the edge of the hole in the ceiling. 
               The Thing's face and arms burst through the metal plating of 
               the tractor. The reaching claws just miss him as he pulls 
               himself through.

               EXT. ROOF

               He lights his fuse, drops in the stick, turns and runs.

               Half of The Thing's grotesque and angular torso bolts up 
               through the hole, howling in fury. An appendage springs 
               outward and winds around MacReady's jacket, hissing like 
               acid into the fabric.

               An immense explosion. The hydrogen tanks send a white fireball 
               fifty feet into the sky. The Thing's body disintegrating 
               almost immediately.

               The force of the blast sweeps MacReady off the roof. He and 
               the severed appendage crash to the hard ice in flames. He 
               rolls over and over trying to smother the fire and tear off 
               the insidious limb.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAMP

               A ruin. One half of it burnt almost to the ground.

               MacReady wears a thick blanket which covers him like a shroud, 
               from his shoulders to the floor.

               He walks bent over and in much pain, trying to blunt patches 
               of fire with an extinguisher. It is futile. He gives up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PUB AREA

               Mostly untouched by the fire, but like most of the rest of 
               the camp, exposed to the outside. The storm has settled 
               considerably.

               CLOSE ON MACREADY

               lighting a cigar. His hands are heavily wrapped. He pours 
               himself a drink.

               A puffy white hand, missing two fingers, enters the frame 
               and whirls a startled MacReady around. It is Childs.

               White and black blotches cover his frostbitten face.

                                     CHILDS
                         Did you kill it?

               He looks as weak as MacReady. A beat.

                                     MACREADY
                         I think so.

                                     CHILDS
                         What do you mean "you think so?"

               Both men speak guardedly and stare at each other suspiciously.

                                     MACREADY
                         Yeah. I got it.
                              (refers to Childs' 
                              condition)
                         Pretty mean frostbite.

               Childs steps back, keeping his distance. He indicates his 
               puffy white hand.

                                     CHILDS
                         It'll turn black again soon enough. 
                         Then I guess I'll be losing the whole 
                         thing...
                              (refers to feet)
                         ...Think my toes are already gone.

               MacReady, carrying the bottle and glass, limps over and sits 
               down behind a gaming table. There is a chess set and several 
               decks of cards. The two men continue to eye each other.

                                     CHILDS
                         So you're the only one who made it.

               MacReady begins setting up a non-electronic chessboard.

                                     MACREADY
                         Not the only one.

                                     CHILDS
                         The fire's got the temperature way 
                         up all over camp... won't last long 
                         though.

                                     MACREADY
                         Neither will we.

                                     CHILDS
                         Maybe we should try and fix the 
                         radio... try and get some help.

                                     MACREADY
                         Maybe we shouldn't.

                                     CHILDS
                         Then we'll never make it.

               MacReady puffs on his cigar. He reveals a small blowtorch 
               from under the table and places it beside him on top.

                                     MACREADY
                         Maybe we shouldn't make it.

                                     CHILDS
                              (beat)
                         If you're worried about anything, 
                         let's take that blood test of yours.

                                     MACREADY
                         If we've got any surprises for each 
                         other -- we shouldn't be in any 
                         condition to do anything about it.
                              (beat)
                         You play chess?

               They regard each other for a moment. Childs painfully sits 
               down across from MacReady.

                                     CHILDS
                         I guess I'll be learning.

               MacReady grins and hands the bottle to Childs. Childs smiles 
               back and takes a healthy swig.

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

               The fires smolder on. Bright embers dance in the blackness -- 
               pushed by the soughing wind.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
TIMBER FALLS

    FADE IN:

1   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1                                         1

    CLOSE ON - A YOUNG WOMAN'S EYE. Bloodshot blue. Her
    eyelashes tremble. A tear rolls out. She blinks.

    CLOSE ON - A filthy, coarse rope secures a dirty rag inside
    her mouth.

    CLOSE ON - The same type rope binds her ankles together.

    CLOSE ON HER HANDS - A mixture of blood, dirt.   IRON SPIKES
    ARE NAILED THROUGH HER PALMS.

    FROM ABOVE - The Young Woman, 20s, wearing a handmade dress
    with a small crest embroidered over the heart, lies nailed to
    a wooden table.

    AN OVERHEAD LIGHT BULB DIMS, CRACKLES.    OFF SCREEN: A BLOOD-
    CURDLING SCREAM cries out.

    The Young Woman's breathing intensifies.   She watches the
    light bulb, listens to the screams.

    The light bulb returns to normal. The screams stop.    Peace
    for a moment. But she knows that won't last.

2   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2                                         2

    A YOUNG MAN, 20s, hangs by his wrists from iron shackles
    secured to the ceiling. He's bloodied, bruised... a mess.

    CLOSE ON - The end of a pair of jumper cables. They TOUCH,
    sending SPARKS into the air. Brought together by...

    A CONCEALED FIGURE. All that's visible are his hands.    His
    left hand is SEVERELY BURNED, SCARRED, while his right
    appears normal. He touches the jumper cables together
    again... SPARKS FLY.

                         YOUNG MAN
               Please-please stop. D-don't.

    The Concealed Figure ignores his pleas, connects the left
    cable to one shackle chain... and then the right side.

    ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH THE BODY OF THE YOUNG MAN. HIS
    BODY CONTORTS. HE SCREAMS. The lights DIM and CRACKLE.

3   INT. TORTURE ROOM #1                                           3

    CLOSE ON - The light bulb DULLS.   The screams of the Young
    Man echo through the room.

                                                                2.


    The Young Woman closes her eyes. Takes SEVERAL FAST BREATHS
    then... MUSTERS every ounce of strength in her body and...

    Her right hand TREMBLES... The Young Woman GRIMACES, in
    unbelievable agony, but then... HER RIGHT HAND INCHES UP THE
    IRON SPIKE. Slowly and painfully. PIECES OF BLOOD, SKIN and
    BONE cling to spike as the hand moves up.

    The light bulb returns again to normal.   The screams stop.

    The Young Woman gives a final hard push and...   FREES HER
    RIGHT HAND. Blood pours from the wound.

    No time to waste. She turns her attention, strength to her
    left hand... ever-so-slowly (and painfully) it moves.

4   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2                                            4

    CLOSE ON - The jumper cable attaches to the metal and...
    ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH THE YOUNG MAN'S body. HE SCREAMS.

5   INT.   CABIN - TORTURE ROOM #1                                    5

    The Young Woman's left hand POPS free.    Blood oozes out.

    OFF SCREEN: SCREAMS FROM THE YOUNG MAN.

    She sits up, goes for the gag, but her fingers cramp in pain.
    Finally, she unties the knot, removes the gag. She coughs,
    tries to muffle the noise best she can.

    The SCREAMS STOP.   Lights return to normal.

    Half way free. She goes for the ropes at her ankles, unties
    them, slides off the table. She grabs a couple rags, ties
    them around her palm's wounds.

6   INT.   HALLWAY/ TORTURE ROOM #2                                   6

    The Young Woman opens the door, checks to see if the coast is
    clear. It is.

    We're at the end of a long, dark hallway (more like a tunnel,
    really). There are two more doors in the hall, one in front
    of her another to her right. The door across from her is
    slightly ajar...

    YOUNG WOMAN'S POV THRU DOOR - The Young Man dangles from the
    chains. Suddenly, the Concealed Figure appears between the
    door and the Young Man.

    The Young Woman retreats, but realizes the Concealed Figure
    has his back to her.

                                                                3.


     THE YOUNG MAN sees past the Figure, LOCKS EYES with the Young
     Woman. No hope for himself, his eyes say: Save yourself.

     The Young Woman fights back tears, mouths the words "I Love
     you". She carefully opens the door to her right, REVEAL a
     rickety set of wooden steps. She heads up, just as...

     LIGHTS FLICKER.     OFF SCREEN: The Young Man SCREAMS again.

     The Young Woman quickens her pace. The SCREAMS drown out any
     sound, until... just before she touches THE TOP STEP...

     The lights return to NORMAL.       The Young Man STOPS screaming.
     The place goes silent.

     The Young Woman's foot TOUCHES THE STEP...       A LOUD CREAK
     RINGS OUT. The Young Woman FREEZES.

7    TORTURE ROOM #2--                                                    7

     The Concealed Figure TURNS towards the sound.

8    HALLWAY, STAIRS--                                                    8

     The Young Woman holds her breath.       Did he hear her?

9    TORTURE ROOM #2--                                                    9

     A STEEL AXE/SICKLE hybrid (a scary, handmade invention),
     rusted, save for the razor sharp edge, sticks in a nearby
     wooden horse. The Concealed Figure SNATCHES the weapon.

                            YOUNG MAN
                SARAH!    RUN!

10   HALLWAY, STAIRS--                                                10

     Sarah (Young Woman) bolts up the remaining steps.

11   TORTURE ROOM #2--                                                11

     The Concealed Figure rushes for the door.      In pursuit.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

12   EXT.   FOREST - SUNSET                                           12

     SARAH races through the thick forest. Her bare, bloody feet
     and legs stomping over the hard dirt, branches, shrubs,
     anything in her way. Not too far behind...

     THE CONCEALED FIGURE... (the majority of him still hidden)
     follows her. WEAPON IN HAND.

                                                                 4.


     SARAH... pushes through some thick brush, but... trips,
     falls. She SCREAMS IN PAIN, grabs her foot, notices... A
     LARGE GASH ACROSS THE BOTTOM. Sarah turns, hears...

     THE CONCEALED FIGURE.. approaches in the distance.

     SARAH... wills herself up, limp/runs away.

13   EXT.   FOREST - CLEARING/CLIFF - SUNSET                       13

     Sarah exits the thick woods to discover, to her horror... SHE
     STANDS AT THE EDGE OF A CLIFF, takes a peek over the side...

     SARAH'S POV - JAGGED ROCKS and a small STREAM at the bottom,
     200 feet below. A WATERFALL flows steadily nearby.

     Before Sarah can fully digest the situation...

     THE CONCEALED FIGURE exits the forest, SPINS THE WEAPON in
     his hand. Anticipating its use.

     Sarah FREEZES in her spot. Breaths get shorter, heavier.
     Her eyes dart in every direction. What to do?

     The Concealed Figure TAKES ONE STEP FORWARD and... SARAH
     JUMPS OFF THE CLIFF. Rather that fate than the other.

     The Concealed Figure walks up to the edge, looks over...

     AT THE BOTTOM... Sarah's dead body lays twisted and bloody
     among the rocks. The waterfall crashes next to her. BLOOD
     mixes with the water turning it a deep RED.

14   EXT.   HIGHWAY - WEST VIRGINIA - DAY (HELICOPTER 2ND UNIT)    14

     A black four-door VW Passat cruises the interstate.     A Gortex
     duffel is strapped to the roof.

15   I/E.   PASSAT (MOVING) - DAY                                  15

     MIKE WARREN, late 20s, with a devilish grin and looks to
     kill, sits at the wheel. Even a flashy pair of sunglasses
     can't mask the twinkle in his eye.

     SHERYL JAMES, late 20s, rides shotgun. This beauty's got it
     all: toned bod, sharp mind and a heart-stopping smile.

     An opened bag of chips sit in her lap. A couple of Diet
     Cokes in the cup-holders. She cradles a cellphone MP3
     player.

                                                   5.


                    MIKE
          Come on, hit me.

                    SHERYL
              (Flipping through tunes)
          Chill...I gotta find -- alright.

                    MIKE
          You got one?

Sheryl hits the "Play" button.

                    MIKE
          "Warning Shots", Thievery Corporation.

Mike grins.   Sheryl rolls her eyes.

                     MIKE
          Come on.   Next one.

Sheryl scrolls again, hits play.

                    MIKE
          "Bullets" by the Editors.

Sheryl frowns.   Mike grins and shoots her a wink.

                    SHERYL
          You loaded these songs. You don't
          need to be so impressed with yourself.

                    MIKE
          I know I don't have to be.

                    SHERYL
          I haven't even heard of half these
          bands.

                    MIKE
          It's called good music. You should
          try to familiarize yourself with it,
          instead of listening to the crap you
          do.

                    SHERYL
          I listen to crap?

                    MIKE
          Hurts me to be the one to tell you.

                    SHERYL
          I'm sure it does.

                                                        6.


                      MIKE
           You gotta be more like me, baby.
           Think new, fresh, cutting edge. I'm
           looking for the next Beatles, U2 or
           Radiohead.

Sheryl scans through the MP3 player, spots one and smiles.

                     SHERYL
           So, where does this band fall into
           that group?

The music starts. BOY'S DON'T CRY, "I WANT TO BE A COWBOY"
blares.

                     SHERYL
           Fresh, new or cutting edge?

Mike immediately begins to backtrack.

                     MIKE
           How'd that get on there?

                     SHERYL
           You loaded the songs.   You tell me?

                     MIKE
           Must be a mistake.

                     SHERYL
           Says here you've listened to it 86
           times.

Busted.

                     SHERYL
           Is this true? Have you always wanted
           to be a cowboy?

Sheryl spies more...

                     SHERYL
           You also got "Men Without Hats"
           greatest hits? I didn't know they
           qualified for a greatest hits album.
           Can you break me off a little "Safety
           Dance"?

Mike reaches for the MP3 player.

                     MIKE
           Okay, give me that.

The Passat speeds past a "West Virginia" state sign.

16   EXT.   NATIONAL PARK ENTRANCE - DAY                           16

     The sun BURNS above.   The Passat turns into the park.

17   EXT.   PARKING LOT, RANGER STATION - DAY                      17

     The Passat rolls into a dirt parking lot. Next to the lot is
     the Ranger Station.

18   INT.   RANGER BASE STATION - DAY                              18

     Maps and local artifacts adorn the walls. A display of some
     of the local animals, stuffed of course, including a giant
     bear, fill in the gaps.

     Mike and Sheryl enter. They take in the place. Mike heads
     toward the Ranger's desk while Sheryl eyes the decor.

     SAM, 65, a round-faced RANGER with a grumpy disposition, a
     hearing aid in his right ear, sits behind a desk. He
     continues working, scribbling on something as Sheryl and Mike
     wait. And wait. Then...

                          MIKE
                Good morning.

     Sam holds up a "wait a second" finger.     After a beat...

                          SAM
                Now what can I do you two for?

     Sheryl spots some fliers tacked to a bulletin board. Hiking
     gear for sale, Tour Info, National Park History, etc.

                          MIKE
                Well...ah...

                          SAM
                First time here and you're not quite
                sure where to begin.

     Sheryl grabs a National Park Information flier.

     ANGLE ON - There are pictures, an Emergency Contact
     Information, Guided Tour Info, etc.

                          SAM
                Something like that.

                          SHERYL
                Precisely like that.

     Sam stands, grabs his lower back, a recurring discomfort.     As
     he digs around for something...

        SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006          8.


Sheryl notices, on the board...

ANGLE ON - A flier for a young missing couple.     Below that...

ANGLE ON - A photo of a girl: "Sarah Travers"(from the
opening scene).

Sheryl studies it and shakes off any concern by locking arms
with Mike at the desk.

                    SAM
          Get you started with one of these.

Sam grabs a map and lays it out in front of the couple.

                    SAM
          How long you folks hiking for?

                      MIKE
          Two days.    Heading out early Sunday.

                    SAM
          Well, if you move at a decent clip,
          you could hit the summit by midday
          tomorrow. Should still give you time
          to take it all in and make it down.

                    SHERYL
          Any particular path?

                    SAM
          You folks experienced hikers?

                    MIKE
          We've done some ah--

                    SHERYL
              (interrupting)
          No. Nothing like this.

                    SAM
          For first-timers, I recommend either
          Willow Creek Bridge or Donner Trail.

                    SHERYL
          Donner Trail? As in "The Donner
          Party?"

                    SAM
          I'm not sure of the name's origin.
          They're the two paths we regularly
          patrol. Something happens and you're
          on one of the other trails, it might
          be awhile before we find you.

                                                     9.


                    MIKE
          Where do we camp?

                    SAM
          Unless it says not to, you can set up
          where you like. Just make sure when
          you turn in that you extinguish your
          fire. Oh, and this here's bear
          country. They're not animals to fool
          with. You see one, you head the other
          way, especially if he's feeding. If
          the bear thinks you're getting in the
          way of his food, that's all she wrote.

Sheryl warily eyes the stuffed Bear in the station.

                    SHERYL
              (Sarcastic)
          Great.

                    SAM
          You got yourself a first aid kit?

                    MIKE
          Nurse Betty here's my first aid kit.

Sam looks confused...

                    SHERYL
          Don't mind him. I'm a nurse.

                    SAM
          Good for you. The question was, do
          you have a first aid kit?

                    SHERYL
          Yes, we have a first aid kit.

                    SAM
          Great, see how easy that was.
              (Moving on)
          It's off-season, park's pretty quiet.
          Even more than usual. You may run
          into a few locals, but--

                    SHERYL
          People live up here?

                    SAM
          We have a few generations of families
          that have called these mountains home.
          Most of `em are friendly. Respect their
          land and they'll respect you.

                                                              10.


     Mike twangs and air banjos, "Dueling Banjos" from
     `Deliverance.' Sam is not amused. Sheryl fights her
     temptation to laugh.

                           MIKE
                Sorry.

                          SAM
                    (Moving on)
                Base is just outside, to the left. At
                about two miles up there'll be a
                junction where you can pick your path.

                           MIKE
                Thanks.

     Mike and Sheryl offer a smile and quickly exit.

19   EXT.   RANGER BASE STATION - DAY                              19

     Mike and Sheryl exit.     They burst out laughing.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

20   EXT.   PARKING LOT, RANGER STATION - DAY                      20

     Mike digs through his backpack, double-checking everything.
     What he doesn't show Sheryl... wrapped in some socks: a .38
     Revolver. He tucks it discreetly away.

     Sheryl checks her bag as well. She clips a blue hikers' towel
     to her waist. Mike checks his cell phone. No service.

                          MIKE
                You getting anything?

     Sheryl checks her phone and shakes her head "no."

                          MIKE
                I'll lock them in the car.

                          SHERYL
                I'll take mine.

                           MIKE
                Why?

                          SHERYL
                Just to annoy you.

                          MIKE
                Seriously...

             SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006         11.


                          SHERYL
                In an emergency, I'd rather have a
                phone that may not work up there, than
                not have a phone that may work up
                there.

     Huh? Mike shakes his head, puts his phone in the glove
     compartment.

     Sheryl tucks her phone and the flier into a side pocket of
     her backpack. Zips it shut.

     ANGLE ON - Mike's keys and his Boston Red Sox key chain.
     Mike locks the door.

                          MIKE
                Okay, we all set?

                             SHERYL
                       (Excited)
                Yup.

                          MIKE
                Let's do this.

     Mike pulls on his backpack, starts walking. Sheryl doesn't
     move. She eyes their tent still resting on the car's roof.

                          SHERYL
                Hey, Einstein. What do you think,
                leave the tent or maybe take it with
                us?

     Mike swallows his pride and retreats to the car.

                           MIKE
                I was just seeing if you were paying
                attention.

     Mike comes back to the car for the tent.   Sheryl shakes her
     head and smiles.

21   EXT.   BASE TRAIL #1 - DAY                                   21

     The mountain is breathtaking.    Nature at its best.

     Mike and Sheryl have begun their ascent.

                          SHERYL
                It could be fun.

                          MIKE
                Not a chance. High School reunions
                serve only two purposes... to try to

                                                     12.

                    MIKE (cont'd)
          rehash so-called glory days if you
          were popular or to gloat if you were a
          spaz and are now filthy rich, banging
          a super-model.

                    SHERYL
          So what were you?

                     MIKE
          Me?   I was a stoner.

                    SHERYL
          So what does that mean?

                    MIKE
          How the hell am I supposed to
          remember? I was high all the time.

Sheryl swallows some water, checks her compass.

Sweat rolls down Mike's forehead, stinging his eyes. Sheryl
doesn't have that problem. She's wearing a red bandana.

                    MIKE
          Where'd you get that bandana?

                    SHERYL
          It's cute, right? I stopped by that
          Army-Navy store on Grover yesterday.
          Keeps the sweat out of your eyes.

                    MIKE
          And when you were buying it, you
          didn't think that maybe...

                    SHERYL
          Oh...well...it was the last one...

                    MIKE
          The last one?

                     SHERYL
          Yeah...

                    MIKE
          The entire Army-Navy store... sold out?

                    SHERYL
          Completely. There was some sort of
          run on bandanas at the last minute.

Sheryl stifles a CHUCKLE. Mike shakes his head, then... she
pulls out a GRAY BANDANA, hands it to him.

              SHOOTING SCRIPT               OCTOBER 17, 2006   13.


                           SHERYL
                 Here... You big baby.

      Sheryl turns, as she does... Mike pinches her behind, she
      playfully SHRIEKS, hustles away from him, but he pursues her,
      as they both CRACK UP, they spill off the trail...

      OFF THE PATH... Mike and Sheryl continue their horseplay,
      when... SHERYL LOOKS DOWN, SCREAMS!

      A BLOODY, MUTILATED FOX LAYS INSIDE A RUSTED BEAR TRAP. The
      Steel jaws of the trap have sliced the body in two. The kill
      looks fresh.

                           MIKE
                 Fucking nasty.

                           SHERYL
                 What is it?

                           MIKE
                 Looks like it's a, or was, a fox.
                 Come on.

      Mike and Sheryl head back to the path.

      ANGLE ON - The MUTILATED, BLOODY FOX.

21A   EXT.   BRIDGE ON BASE TRAIL   - DAY                         21A

      Mike and Sheryl hike over a small wooden bridge.

22    EXT.   BASE TRAIL #2 - DAY                                  22

      Mike and Sheryl reach a small clearing. There are a number of
      signs pointing toward different trails. (Donner Trail, Willow
      Creek Bridge, Timber Falls, etc.)

      Sheryl grabs the map and some water. Mike swigs some water,
      munches on trail mix, takes a peek in the guidebook.

                           SHERYL
                 What do you think?    "Cannibal" Trail
                 or the other one?

                           MIKE
                 Guidebook says a couple of these other
                 trails lead to some pretty sweet
                 views.

                           SHERYL
                 We're not Lewis and/or Clark. We're
                 gonna stick to one of the ones the
                 Ranger said.

                                                    14.


                    IDA (OS)
          You folks need some help?

IDA FOSTER, 40s, approaches, wheeling some supplies in a
handmade wagon. She is worn, haggard, but has a friendly,
smile. She wears a flannel shirt, old jeans and dirty boots.

                    MIKE
          We're just going over our options
          here.

                    IDA
          Well, take it from me, any way you
          choose, you can't go wrong.

                    SHERYL
          The Ranger at base suggested Donner
          Trail or...

                    IDA
          ...Willow Creek Bridge. I think Sam
          only knows those two trails. Well.
          Between those, I'd pick Donner Trail.
          Willow Creek will shoot you to the
          top, but there's not as much to see.
          Donner weaves through Peddler's Point,
          it's a better hike and prettier all
          around view.

                    SHERYL
              (To Mike)
          What do you think?

Then, she notices a ring on Sheryl's finger.

                    IDA
          That's a pretty ring.

                       SHERYL
          Thank you.

                    IDA
          Not your traditional wedding ring, but
          it's all the same in the Lord's eyes.
          How long have you two been wed?

Sheryl and Mike trade looks.

                    SHERYL
          Oh... we're not married.    Not yet
          anyway.

Mike shoots her a look: "not yet?"

                                                      15.


                       SHERYL
             It's a ring my father gave me for
             graduation.

                        IDA
                 (embarrassed)
             Oh, I'm sorry. You just looked like
             you was married is'all. Both so
             beautiful.
                 (Beat)
             I'm just an old fashioned silly-bird.
             I need to mind my own business.

                       SHERYL
             No, it's fine.

                        MIKE
                 (changing topics)
             Which one of those trails got the best
             clearings?

                       IDA
             Clearings? Neither will give you much
             in the way of clearings. But, there's
             another path, this one here.
                 (Points to the map)
             Timber Falls. Its got some beautiful
             vistas and one of the prettiest falls
             you'll ever see.

                       MIKE
             Sounds perfect.
                 (To Sheryl)
             Yeah?

                       IDA
             Well, I'll leave you to it. Last
             thing you need is me fussing'round
             you, taking you from your private
             time.

              SHERYL                           MIKE
Thank you.                        Yeah, thanks for the tip.

Ida walks off, but stops only a few feet away.

                       IDA
             I'm just gonna say it and go, but if
             you two were to marry... I bet the
             Lord would bless you with a happy,
             healthy and handsome child. Good luck
             and God bless you both.

                                                              16.


     Sheryl and Mike don't know how to respond.      Ida leaves.   Once
     out of earshot...

                          SHERYL
                I suddenly feel the need for
                confession.

                          MIKE
                    (Still lingering on...)
                Not yet? Love taking your shots,
                don't ya?

     Sheryl shoots him a stern, but playfully sexy, look.

                          SHERYL
                When I see an opening.

                          MIKE
                    (Checks map)
                That path she was talking about winds
                through these falls. What do you
                think?

                          SHERYL
                I think... if you get eaten by a bear
                and there isn't a Ranger around, I'm
                not carrying what's left of you down
                this mountain.

                          MIKE
                And they say romance is dead.
                    (Smiling wide)
                Timber Falls it is.

     They throw on their backpacks and head on their way.

                          MIKE
                Who's Lewis and/or Clark?

                          SHERYL
                You really were stoned through high
                school.

     As Mike and Sheryl trek up the path...

     ANGLE ON - The directional sign, "Timber Falls"

23   EXT.   TIMBER FALLS TRAIL #1 - DAY                              23

     Looking back down on the thin path. FIND - Sheryl and Mike
     continuing their trek. (SPLINTER UNIT)

     Mike maneuvers around a massive tree. He freezes. Gestures
     for Sheryl to be quiet and mouths the words, "Don't Move."

                                                      17.


Sheryl stops, startled.     Mike motions towards...

A MOUNTAIN STAG, with magnificent antlers, chews on a plant
in the distance.

Sheryl quietly slides out her digital camera.    Snaps a photo
of the animal.

The Stag stops chewing and looks at them.    After a long beat,
the Stag skips away through the trees.

Sheryl watches the animal disappear, smiles.

Mike removes his backpack and crosses to Sheryl. He helps
remove her backpack and kisses her. She kisses him back.

ANGLE ON - Sheryl's heart-shaped locket through her shirt.

                    MIKE
          You're going to lose that out here.

                    SHERYL
          It's fine. I never take it off. Not
          since you gave it to me. Betcha don't
          remember...

                    MIKE
          ...February 27, 2006.

Sheryl stares incredulously, romantically at Mike.
Speechless.

                    MIKE
          I remember every moment with you.

                    SHERYL
          I've got you so whipped.

They kiss. Sheryl climbs onto Mike's lap. He leans back,
better positioning, places his hand down, when...

                     MIKE
          OUCH!   FUCK!

Mike brings his hand back up.    BLOOD trickles out of a SMALL
CUT across his palm.

                     SHERYL
          What?

                    MIKE
          My hand... Something stuck it.

                                                             18.


     Sheryl quickly examines the cut. Mike quickly becomes
     flustered, woozy. He turns away from the wound.

                         SHERYL
               It's okay. It's not too deep.      Let me
               get the first aid kit.

     Sheryl rummages through her bag. Mike, in more psychological
     discomfort than physical, looks away wincing.

     Sheryl returns, wipes the blood away best she can.    She
     applies some peroxide...

                          MIKE
               Fuck.   That stung.

                         SHERYL
               Gotta clean the wound, baby.

24   OBSCURED POV - THROUGH TREES--                                24

     From a distance... A SICKLE BLADE enters frame, pulls a
     branch aside. Sheryl attends to Mike's wound.

     The POV narrows... solely on SHERYL.

25   TIMBER FALLS, TRAIL #1--                                      25

     Mike looks at Sheryl, a twinge of embarrassment in his eyes.

                         MIKE
               You know me and blood... we don't do
               so well.

                         SHERYL
               I know.
                   (She finishes)
               All done.

     OFF SCREEN: CRUNCH of something stepping on a thicket.

     Sheryl glances toward the sound.    Mike admires the dressing
     of the wound.

                         MIKE
               Not bad, Nightingale.     Not bad at all.

                         SHERYL
               Did you hear something?

     Mike follows her eye-line.   There's a softer CRUNCH.

                         MIKE
               It's probably the deer.

                                                       19.


                    SHERYL
          The deer went in the other direction.

Mike's demeanor suddenly becomes cold, creepy.

                    MIKE
          Maybe it's someone, or something,
          stalking us.

                       SHERYL
          Quit it.

                    MIKE
          Something inhuman watching our every
          move.

                    SHERYL
          I said, knock it off.

                    MIKE
          Something coming for you, Sheryl.

Sheryl straps on her backpack.

                    SHERYL
          Just when I think there's hope for
          you.

                       MIKE
          What?

                    SHERYL
          You're an asshole.

Sheryl walks away.

                    MIKE
          This is a joke. You're not really mad,
          are you? Sheryl...?

She turns the corner and is out of sight.

                     MIKE
          I'm sorry!
              (Under his breath)
          Unbelievable.

Mike's in disbelief.    He grabs his backpack, heads after her.

                       MIKE
          Sheryl!

He turns the corner, looks up, but doesn't see her.   The path
winds like a snake.

             SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006        20.


                           MIKE
                 Sheryl, wait up!

     Mike moves up the winding path.    He stops, eyes searching.
     Something's wrong.

     The path opens up. Mike can now see a hundred yards ahead,
     but... No sign of Sheryl.

                           MIKE
                     (Calls out)
                 Sheryl?! This isn't funny.

     Silence.

     Two birds SCREAM and fly from their perch overhead. Mike eyes
     the birds, then takes off.

     Mike's heart-rate increases. He moves quickly up the path, a
     steep incline. He brushes past a bush and stops. Lying just
     off the path... SHERYL'S BLUE HIKER'S TOWEL. He picks it up.

                              MIKE
                 Sheryl?!

     No reply.   His heart now POUNDING.

     Mike moving faster. Up ahead, he stops again, finds...
     SHERYL'S RED BANDANA.

                              MIKE
                 Sheryl!

     Silence.

     Mike picks up the bandana. He's flying.     He cuts through
     some tiny evergreens, off the path...

26   EXT.   JUST OFF THE TRAIL, TIMBER FALLS #1 - DAY               26

     Mike freezes when he sees... Sheryl's backpack lies against
     a tree. A few feet farther along, her cut-off jean shorts.
     Next to them... her shirt. But no Sheryl, until...

                           SHERYL (OS)
                 Good old Hansel. Following the trail
                 of bread crumbs.

     Mike turns to see Sheryl lying against a rock, wearing just
     her bra and panties. She smiles at him coyly. Mike exhales
     deeply. Relieved, but fuming.

                              MIKE
                 You bitch.

       SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006          21.


                    SHERYL
          Doesn't feel good to be teased, does
          it?

Okay, he had that coming.

                     MIKE
          Truce?

                     SHERYL
          Truce.

He takes her in.   She's quite a sight. He sits down next to
her. They kiss.    Then... Mike breaks the embrace.

                    MIKE
          Don't disappear on me again.

Sheryl mouths the words, "I promise."    Crosses her heart.

He leans in, they kiss again.   Soft and sweet at first.   Then
it deepens.

Sheryl rubs his chest and removes his shirt. They kiss
again. Harder this time. Their hands all over one another.

Mike slides his hand under Sheryl's panties, between her
legs. She moans softly. Sheryl unhooks her bra and is about
to remove it, when:

                    DARRYL (O.S.)
          Hey, Brody, Lonnie. Check this out.

DARRYL, 30, a skinny local with a twisted smile and LONNIE,
20's, a slob, emerge from the forest. They are followed by...

BRODY, 35, scruffy and unshaven, their ringleader. Brody
clutches a shotgun in one hand and a weathered sack in the
other.

                    DARRYL
          Looks like we got ourselves a little
          party.

Brody and Darryl ogle Sheryl. She tucks herself behind Mike,
who shifts quickly into protective mode. She snaps her bra
back closed.

                    MIKE
          We were just moving our way up the
          mountain.

                                                          22.


                    LONNIE
          You were moving your way'round more
          than just that.

Sheryl eyes her discarded clothes.   Darryl spots them too.
He grabs the shorts, SNIFFS them.

                    DARRYL
              (Referring to the smell)
          Like a peach.

Mike tries to seem relaxed and friendly.

                    BRODY
          You folks best be careful about what
          you do up here... Never know who's
          watching.

                    MIKE
          Appreciate the advice...I think we
          learned our lesson.

Brody nods as he looks them up and down.

                    LONNIE
          You city folk, ain't ya? Up from
          Charleston roughing it, seeing how the
          "other" half lives?

                    MIKE
          No, we're from Virginia, just up for a
          weekend trip. And, uh... you folks
          live up here?

Brody glances at Darryl and Lonnie, then back at Mike.

                    BRODY
          It's easy to spot the city folk. It's
          like they're trying to be friendly,
          when really they don't want to be.

                    MIKE
          I think you just startled us is all.

Sheryl looks over at...

...Lonnie sticks his tongue between his fingers, rapidly
flails it about.

Uncomfortable silence.

                                                       23.


                       MIKE
             We'll just be on our way.
                 (Re: Sheryl's shorts)
             May I have those?

A bold move from Mike.

                       DARRYL
             Finders keepers.

Long beat.    Tension high.

                       BRODY
             Darryl.

Brody concedes, gestures to Darryl to give the shorts back.

Darryl reluctantly obliges.

Mike passes them to Sheryl who slides them on. Darryl and
Lonnie soak in every inch of Sheryl as she does.

Mike takes Sheryl's hand. They make a move, but... Brody
stops them with the barrel of his shotgun.

                       BRODY
             Where you runnin' off to?

                       LONNIE
             Yeah, we just getting acquainted and
             shit.

Mike glances down at the barrel that runs across his chest.
He can no longer hide his fear.

                       MIKE
             We just want to get a little further
             along before the sun sets.

Darryl eyes the sky.    The sun beams down through the trees.

                       DARRYL
             Plenty of time'fore that.

                       MIKE
             Look. We don't want any trouble.   We
             just want to be on our way...

                       BRODY
             And why do you suppose we mean to make
             trouble?

Mike looks down at the gun.     Brody smiles a yellow smile.

       SHOOTING SCRIPT               OCTOBER 17, 2006     24.


                    BRODY
          You folks enjoy the spirits?

                       MIKE
          Excuse me?     The what?

                       DARRYL
          Spirits.

                       LONNIE
          Booze!

                      MIKE
          Sure.    Yeah.

Brody hands Darryl the shotgun and drops his sack. Brody
pulls a mason jar with clear liquid out of the sack.

                    BRODY
          Why don't you try a taste of this?

Brody unscrews the cap and offers the jar to Mike. Mike eyes
Sheryl. Clearly she doesn't think it's a good idea.

Mike accepts the jar, hesitates, then takes a sip. He
squirms, winces, but forces it down. Mike turns red and
coughs. Brody and Darryl are loving it.

                    DARRYL
          Betcha never tasted nuthin'like that?

Darryl would win that bet.

                    BRODY
          Fifty bucks.

Mike has no idea what he's talking about.

                    BRODY
          I'll sell you the jar for fifty bucks.

                    DARRYL
              (Ogles Sheryl)
          Or maybe we could do us a little
          trade.

                    MIKE
          Let me get my wallet.

Mike opens a zipper on his backpack, rummages around.

ANGLE ON - INSIDE THE BAG... the .38 Revolver.

                                                       25.


Mike thinks about grabbing it.     Sheryl shocked to see the
gun. She tenses up.

ANGLE ON - Brody.   The shotgun.

Mike thinks, then...

                    SHERYL
          Fifty bucks sounds like a bargain.
              (To Mike)
          Pay the man.

Mike reaches past the gun and grabs his wallet. He counts
out the cash, hands it to Brody. Brody smiles, hands the jar
to Mike.

                    BRODY
          Pleasure doing business with ya.     Take
          care now.

Brody nods at Mike and Sheryl, walks off down the trail.
Darryl grins at Sheryl, follows Brody.

                    LONNIE
          Should you tire of your present
          company... just holla and I'll come
          running with bells on darling.

He smiles a creepy wide smile.     He turns and catches up to
the others.

Once they are out of sight... Mike takes a moment to gather
himself. Sheryl grabs her shirt still on the ground, puts it
on.

                    MIKE
          Are you okay?

                    SHERYL
          You brought a gun?

No response.   Sheryl picks up her towel and bandana.

                    SHERYL
          Why did you bring a gun?

                    MIKE
          Same reason you brought your
          cellphone. Better to have it and not
          need it. To protect us.

                    SHERYL
          Lotta good it just did.

                                                             26.


     Sheryl turns from Mike, walks back to the path.

                          MIKE
                    (Then, call out)
                You want to go back?
                    (No response)
                Sheryl? I'm sorry.

                          SHERYL
                We should have stuck to one of the
                patrolled paths.

     Sheryl charges ahead, back to the path.

                          MIKE
                    (Under his breath)
                Fuck.

     Mike gets up, grabs his bag and follows Sheryl.

27   EXT.   MOUNTAINS - DAY (2ND UNIT)                             27

     The sun begins to set, basking the mountain range in a
     magnificent light.

28   EXT.   WATERFALL - TIMBER FALLS TRAIL #2 - DAY                28

     Mike and Sheryl move right along.     Still not speaking.

     The path forks at a BEAUTIFUL WATERFALL. Mike stops, faces
     the falls, turns to see... Sheryl behind him, catching up.
     As she does, she slips...

                          MIKE
                You alright?

                          SHERYL
                    (balances herself)
                Yeah.

     She's about to walk past him, but he reaches for Sheryl's
     hand and holds it.

                             MIKE
                I'm sorry.

                          SHERYL
                Do you know how many times I've had
                someone die on me? How many children?
                I stopped keeping count.

                          MIKE
                I thought... I wasn't thinking.       What
                do you want me to do?

                                                          27.


                    SHERYL
          Get rid of the gun.

                    MIKE
          What... now? Out here?

She holds firm.

                    MIKE
          I can't just leave it here in the
          woods, some kid could find it.

                    SHERYL
          Then get rid of the bullets now and
          when we get home, you get rid of the
          gun.

Mike thinks about it.    His instincts SCREAMING not to do
this, then...

                       SHERYL
          Please.

Mike relents. He removes his backpack, ZIPS it open.    He
pulls out the gun, opens it, spills the bullets out.

Mike WITH A DEEP BREATH, TOSSES THE BULLETS into the woods.

                    SHERYL
          Was that all of them?

                       MIKE
          Yes.

Mike steps back to Sheryl, they hug.

                       SHERYL
          Thank you.

CRACK! A strange sound, like wood snapping, startles Sheryl.
Mike turns as well. Their eyes WIDEN.

CRACK! The FIGURE emerges from the clearing, practically
landing on top of them. It's...

CLYDE, a Park Ranger, mid-50's, friendly. He's got a weed
cutter in his hands, wears a PAIR OF WORK GLOVES. He's just
as surprised to see them.

Sheryl and Mike breath a sigh and offer him a smile.

                    CLYDE
          Oh. Didn't mean to startle you folks.
          Just clearing some of the brush off
                    (MORE)

SHOOTING SCRIPT        OCTOBER 17, 2006    28.

            CLYDE (cont'd)
  the path. We had some heavy rains
  this past week, knocked some trees and
  branches down. One of the new
  recruits was supposed to do yesterday,
  but... if you want something done
  right, you gotta do it yourself.

            MIKE
  It's fine. We were led to believe
  this trail wasn't regularly patrolled.

            CLYDE
  It's not, but... It's one of my
  favorite spots, so I often find an
  excuse to swing by.

            SHERYL
  It's gorgeous.

            CLYDE
  Yup. There are a couple more falls in
  the park, but none quite so...
  inviting as this one. Now don't take
  my word for it, you can see for
  yourself... How long's your stay?

            SHERYL
  Just til Sunday.

            CLYDE
  Yeah, no. The other falls are clear on
  the other side. It would take you a
  couple nights just to get there.

            SHERYL
  Maybe next time.

            MIKE
  This is a quickie trip. Just getting
  out of the city for a couple days.

            CLYDE
  The city, huh. Which? If it's
  Charleston, I wouldn't blame ya.
  Whole place smells like feet. I gotta
  haul myself all the way down to the
  hospital there for my yearly because
  the darn HMO's rules and regulations
  won't let me visit the local Doc. Not
  my cup of tea at all, but if you like
  it there, then...

            SHERYL
  No, we're not from Charleston.

       SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006             29.


                     MIKE
           But apparently we look like we are.

                     SHERYL
           We live in Alexandria.   It's just
           outside of D.C.

                     CLYDE
           Oh. I've been there, few years back.
           Now that city I like. Lotta beautiful
           churches if I recall correctly. Which
           congregation do y'all belong to?

                     MIKE
           Um... Not sure. Sheryl keeps track of
           all that for us. Sheryl?

Sheryl gives Mike the "you're an asshole" look.     Then...

                     SHERYL
           Uh... We're between congregations at
           the moment.

Awkward.

                     CLYDE
           Well... I should get back to work.
           Sun'll be down soon and that path
           ain't gettin'clear on its own.

Clyde walks off, until...

                     SHERYL
           Excuse me... Sir?

Sheryl doesn't know his name.   Clyde stops, turns back.

                     CLYDE
           The name's Clyde.

                     SHERYL
           Clyde, would you recommend a nice spot
           nearby to make camp for the night?

                     CLYDE
           Be happy too... Let's see... Oh, I
           got it. "Five Corners" will be
           perfect. It's just a bit up the ways
           here, near the Lake. It's five large
           rocks which sit in a clearing with a
           view of the whole park. The rocks
           retain the heat from the day, so if
           you set up camp between them you won't
           be so cold.

                                                             30.


                          SHERYL
                Sounds perfect.

                            MIKE
                Thanks.

                          CLYDE
                Just doing my job. You have fun and
                be careful. Good evening.

     Clyde tips his cap and disappears.

29   EXT.   FIVE CORNERS - DAY                                      29

     Mike and Sheryl hike up a steep slope.      As they step through
     the woods, they look upon...

     FIVE LARGE ROCKS, arranged in an awkward semi-circle.

     They walk into the circle, take off their backpacks.

                          SHERYL
                This is incredible.

     Mike opens the tent pouch, starts removing the many parts.

                          SHERYL
                Ranger said there's a lake near by.

                            MIKE
                What?

                            SHERYL
                The lake.    I'd kill to rinse off.

     Sheryl makes a move...

                          MIKE
                Whoa. Wait a sec. It'll be dark soon.

                          SHERYL
                Where's your sense of adventure?

     She takes off.

                         MIKE
                Sher. Seriously.       Let's wait `til
                morning.

30   OBSCURED POV--                                                 30

     On SHERYL as she stops.       Looks out towards the water.

                                                              31.


     CLOSE ON - THE CONCEALED FIGURE'S EYES. Two different
     colors, with his left being void of almost all color. Also
     notice SCARRING around the left eye, there's no eyebrow and
     his skin is pale and splotchy.

     The Concealed Figure holds all his attention on...

31   FIVE CORNERS--                                              31

     Sheryl realizes he's right and walks back over to Mike.

                           SHERYL
                Fine.

     Mike stares at the many assorted parts of the tent, the sheet
     of instructions laid out. He holds one of the poles, which
     consists of separate links connected by a string. He has no
     idea where to begin.

                          SHERYL
                Do you know what you are doing?

                          MIKE
                I think its pretty obvious that I
                don't.

     Sheryl laughs.

32   EXT.   TREES, OUTSKIRTS OF FIVE CORNERS - CONTINUOUS        32

     The Concealed Figure retreats into the forest.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

33   EXT.   FIVE CORNERS - NIGHT                                 33

     STARS FILL THE SKY. Crickets chirp, but aside from that,
     peace and quiet reign.

     A fire CRACKLES. A tent for two has been pitched. Dirty
     pots, pans litter the area. Dinner's over and done.

     Mike and Sheryl cuddle by the fire.   A sleeping bag wrapped
     around them.

                          MIKE
                That was... the worst dinner ever.

                           SHERYL
                    (Beat)
                You cooked.

                                                               32.


                           MIKE
                Yeah, I'm aware.
                    (Beat)
                You know what would make this evening
                perfect? Moonshine. I got a whole
                jar of it. There's a sentence I never
                thought I'd say. "I have a jar of
                moonshine." Matter of fact, I've got
                enough to share with our entire
                congregation...

                          SHERYL
                ... in Charleston.

                          MIKE
                Our home city, of course. But I
                should start with you... Would you
                like some moonshine?

     Sheryl smiles, shakes her head playfully.

                          MIKE
                Then what would you like?

                          SHERYL
                I'd like to fuck you.

                          MIKE
                Not very Christian of you.

                          SHERYL
                I'm more Old Testament.

                          MIKE
                What's that mean?

                          SHERYL
                Not sure. But I think it's the
                nastier of the two books.

     Sheryl pulls Mike into her, they kiss. Strong and deep.
     Sheryl abruptly breaks the kiss, enough foreplay. She stands
     up, pulls Mike into the tent with her.

34   INT.   TENT - NIGHT                                            34

     Sheryl pulls off her sweatshirt, then the T-shirt.    Mike
     kicks off his shoes, drops his pants.

     Mike unbuttons Sheryl's jeans, tugs them off.

     Sheryl unhooks her bra, tosses it aside.    Mike slides her
     panties down her legs and off.

                                                                 33.


       Few things in life can be described as perfect.         Sheryl's
       naked body is one of them.

       Sheryl pulls Mike's boxers down, climbs on top of him.        She
       reaches down and slides Mike inside her.

       Sheryl KISSES Mike. He slides his hands around Sheryl's
       butt. Sheryl paws his chest, bites his lower lip HARD.

       The lovers move in unison.    Perfection.

35     EXT.   TENT - FIVE CORNERS - NIGHT                                 35

       Inside the tent, Mike and Sheryl continue.      Their campfire
       still burns. Suddenly...

       A SHADOW creeps into frame.    Then a BOOT.    Someone's outside
       their tent.

36     INT. TENT - NIGHT                                                  36

       Breaths get shorter, stronger. Sheryl and Mike build to
       climax. They don't/ can't notice...

       A SHADOW passes across the wall of the tent.

       The last final moments before... climax. The lovers EXHALE.
       Sheryl crashes on top of Mike. He wraps his arms tightly
       around her.

                                                               TIME CUT TO:

36 A   EXT.   TENT - NIGHT                                            36 A

       The last FLAMES on the fire slowly BURN OUT.

36 B   INT.   TENT - NIGHT                                            36 B

       Mike and Sheryl spoon, their hands and fingers messed
       together as one.

                            MIKE
                  I was good. I mean, even better than
                  usual.

                            SHERYL
                  If you don't say so...

                            MIKE
                  ... if I don't say so myself, yeah.
                  Top notch performance. What, you
                  disagree?

                                                         34.


                          SHERYL
                Nah, it was good.   Do you think I had
                anything to do...

                           MIKE
                No.   All me.

                          SHERYL
                Fine.
                    (Beat; cautious)
                I liked what the old woman said about
                us earlier.

                          MIKE
                What did she say?

                          SHERYL
                That she thought we were married.

                          MIKE
                    (Groans)
                You are relentless.

     Mike gets up, starts dressing.

                          SHERYL
                I wouldn't be a proper girlfriend if I
                didn't nag every now and then.

                          MIKE
                I get it, but it makes me feel like
                the bad guy every time. Which makes
                me feel like shit.

                          SHERYL
                I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.       Where
                are you going?

                          MIKE
                Do out there, what you did in here.

                          SHERYL
                What's that?

                          MIKE
                Put out the fire.

     Mike exits.   Sheryl lies back down, exhales in frustration.

37   EXT.   TENT - FIVE CORNERS - NIGHT                         37

     Mike, now fully dressed, pours a bucket of water over the
     campfire. In the background, bags hang from a tree (just as
     Ranger Sam asked them to do.)

                                                             35.


     A smoldering mist of smoke is all that's left of the fire.
     Mike drops the bucket, heads for the tent, when... He
     suddenly stops, notices...

     ON THE GROUND... A FRESH MUDDY FOOTPRINT.     Mike compares his
     boot to it. It's not the same size.

     Mike surveys the area. All's quiet now. But an uneasy
     feeling has crept back into his bones. Mike climbs back
     inside the tent, zips it shut.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

     FADE IN:

38   EXT.   FIVE CORNERS - SUNRISE                                    38

     The sun peeks over the horizon and through the clouds.     A
     BIRD crows.

39   INT.   TENT - DAY                                                39

     Sheryl's eyes SNAP open. She's nestled comfortably in Mike's
     arms. He's still asleep.

40   EXT.   TENT - FIVE CORNERS - DAY                                 40

     Sheryl, now dressed, towel in hand, bandana wrapped around
     her hair, vomits behind some trees.

     After, she takes a couple deep breaths, swishes some water in
     her mouth. A beat later, she heads off.

41   EXT.   LAKE - DAY                                                41

     Sheryl stands on the lake's shore, checks a couple times over
     both shoulders. Then, she takes her sweats and bandana off.
     Lay them on top of her towel.

     Sheryl, wearing only her locket, carefully steps into the
     water... it's cold. But nevertheless her desire to feel
     clean outweighs the temperature discomfort.

     On her own little count to three... She dunks her head below
     the water. As she drops out of sight, REVEAL--

     ON LAND, IN THE DISTANCE... THE CONCEALED FIGURE STANDS ON
     THE SHORE, WATCHES HER.

     IN THE WATER... Sheryl POPS up, turns towards land and... THE
     CONCEALED FIGURE is gone.

     Sheryl comes back to land.      She grabs her towel, dries her
     hair and pats herself dry.      She pulls on her sweatpants,

                                                             36.


     starts to tie her bandana around her head, and turns straight
     into... THE CONCEALED FIGURE.

     CLOSE ON - THE STEEL SICKLE/ AXE

     SHERYL SCREAMS.     The sound resonates over...

42   INT.   TENT - DAY                                             42

     Mike opens his eyes. Something woke him up, not exactly sure
     what. He sits up and yawns, stretches his stiff body. He's
     alone in the tent.

43   EXT.   TENT - FIVE CORNERS - DAY                              43

     Mike, now dressed, stands behind a tree, takes a piss.   He
     shudders slightly. It's cold.

     Mike finishes his business, grabs his water bottle and takes
     a long drink. He peels off the bandage from his hand. It
     looks fine today.

     He looks around, but no sign of Sheryl.

44   EXT.   LAKE - DAY                                             44

     Mike walks up to the water, looks in both directions.
     Nothing. A pang of concern registers.

     He kneels down, cups some water and splashes it over his
     face, hair. As he opens his eyes, he notices something.

     In the wash of the waves, sparkling in the sunlight. It's
     Sheryl's locket. The chain broken. He picks it up...

                          MIKE
                    (Calls out)
                Sheryl!

     Mike looks around. He's completely alone.     The blood drains
     from his face. Mike pockets the necklace.

     He starts into the water... did she drown?    Just as he gets
     knee deep...

     OFF SCREEN: A SCREAM CRIES OUT!

     Mike stops, turns back looking at the forest.

                            MIKE
                Sheryl!

     He hustles out of the water, heading for the woods.

                                                               37.


45   EXT.   WOODS NEAR STREAM - DAY                                  45

     Mike hustles through the thick patch of trees and hits the
     steep little slope. He flies up the slope but loses traction
     and slips, BANGING his knee.

                          MIKE
                Fuck!
                    (Top of his lungs)
                Sheryl!

     Mike pushes himself up, continues on.

46   EXT.   WOODS NEAR STREAM #2 - DAY                               46

     Mike's really moving now. He scoots through the first patch
     of trees and hustles down a slope.

47   EXT.   CLEARING, TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY                       47

     Mike emerges from the woods, drops into a clearing.        Looking
     around wildly...

     POV OF MIKE - Has he been here before? It all looks the
     same? Not even sure which direction he just came from.

                           MIKE
                Sheryl!

     Still nothing.   Mike swallows.     What to do now?

                                                            SMASH CUT TO:

48   EXT.   WOODS #1 - OFF TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY                  48

     TIGHT ON MIKE as he races through the trees.     HIS LEGS
     trample over rocks, dirt, shrubs. Then...

     Mike TRIPS, falls down HARD. He lifts his forearm to reveal
     BLOOD, SCRAPES and a LONG SHARP SPLINTER sticking out.

     The sight of it almost makes Mike puke right then and there.

     Mike grabs hold of the splinter, turns his head... takes
     about a thousand short quick breaths and... PULLS THE
     SPLINTER OUT! BLOOD SQUIRTS ACROSS HIS FACE.

     He removes the GRAY BANDANA from his back pocket, wraps it
     around his wound.

     Mike lays back, stares up into the sky.     Tries to catch his
     breath, calm down. Then...

     Faint sound of LAUGHTER.

                                                            38.


     Mike sits up.     Again, faint sound of LAUGHTER.

     Mike stands, takes a couple of steps toward the sound. MORE
     LAUGHTER. Mike's got the scent, takes off in its direction.

49   EXT.   WOODS #2, OFF TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY                  49

     Mike follows the VOICES through a thick patch of trees.     He
     stops at the top and looks down.

     POV OF MIKE - Walking along the main path, obscured by the
     trees, is Darryl and Lonnie. They drink, LAUGH about
     something. Lonnie carries some fishing poles.

     Mike's about fifteen feet above them.      He narrows his focus
     in on...

     MIKE'S POV - Darryl twirling something in his hand.     It's
     Sheryl's blue hikers' towel.

     Mike turns red with fury.    He looks back down...

     MIKE'S POV - Darryl, a SHOTGUN slung around his shoulder.

     Mike looks around and spots a large pointed stick lying near
     a tree, parallel to him.

50   EXT.   TIMBER FALLS TRAIL #4 - DAY                             50

     Darryl and Lonnie continue along, until...

     OFF SCREEN: A LOUD CRACK.

     Darryl stops, turns.    Lonnie looks at Daryl.

                          LONNIE
                What is it? Hear something?

     Darryl holds his look into the woods, then...

                            DARRYL
                Nah.    It's nothing.

     Suddenly, Mike LEAPS from behind a tree, WHACKS the surprised
     Darryl across the face with the stick. Darryl drops like a
     sack of potatoes.

     Mike locks eyes with a terrified Lonnie.

                          MIKE
                Where is she!?

     Lonnie pauses, frozen.    He then takes off, disappearing
     through the trees.

                                                    39.


Darryl lies on the ground, MOANING. He pushes himself up to
his knees. BLOOD POURS from a fresh gash across his head.

Mike grabs Darryl's shotgun, aims at Darryl.

                    DARRYL
          Whoa... take it easy.

                    MIKE
          Where is she?

                      DARRYL
          Who?    What the fuck you talking about?

                    MIKE
          What did you do to her?

                    DARRYL
          I didn't fuckin' do nothing.

                    MIKE
          WHERE IS SHE?!

                    DARRYL
          I don't know!

Mike CRACKS Darryl across THE JAW with the barrel.

                    MIKE
          You have Sheryl's towel...What the
          fuck did you do to her?!

Darryl's a mess, his nose busted. He gags on blood and
teeth. Mike stares at the bloody desight that is Darryl.
Even Mike has to turn away for a moment for this. Then...

                    DARRYL
          Foun' towel.

                      MIKE
          What?

                    DARRYL
          I foun' the towel.

                    MIKE
          You found it? That's you're fucking
          story, you inbred fuck?!
              (Points gun at Darryl's head)
          Stop fucking lying or I will kill you!

                                                          40.


                    DARRYL
          Don' kill me...Please...I foun' it...
          Up...Up the paf back `dere...just a
          bit ago... fuckin'swear!

Mike's finger itches the trigger. He's turning red.
Breathing hard, heavy. Then... Mike relents. Lowers the
weapon, turns his back to Darryl, stares into the woods.

The tension fades for the moment.   But only a moment.

                     DARRYL
          Didn't think you had dat in you, city
          boy.
               (Looks at his shirt; the blood)
          Shit... I just got dis shirt.

Darryl, while Mike is distracted, seizes his opportunity,
reaches behind...

ANGLE ON - Darryl slides a POCKET KNIFE from his back pocket.

                    DARRYL
          Damn shame you lost dat fine piece
          o'ass. Something dat sweet don't
          come'round every day. Even for pretty
          folk like you.

                    MIKE
          Shut the fuck up.

ANGLE ON - Still concealed from Mike, Darryl opens the pocket
knife, the BLADE fully extended.

                    DARRYL
          You best hope you find her'fore I do.
          `cause I will enjoy tearing her ass
          apart.
              (Mike turns, faces Darryl)
          And when I'm done there, I will cut
          her eyeballs out and skull fuck her.
              (Mike simmers to a boil)
          Any luck, Brody's already beat me to
          it.

                    MIKE
          Sonofabitch!

Mike takes a step towards Darryl, when... Darryl LUNGES OUT
AT MIKE, POCKET KNIFE IN HAND.

Darryl misses with his initial swipe, but it's enough to
knock Mike down, the shotgun falls to the side.

                                                                 41.


     Darryl pins Mike to the ground, tries to dagger the knife
     into him, but Mike grabs his wrist. They struggle. Darryl
     PUSHES down, the knife INCHES CLOSER TO MIKE'S CHEST,
     until...

     Mike HEAD-BUTTS Darryl, sending the skinny Hick off him.
     Darryl rolls away in pain.

     Mike scrambles, crawls for... the shotgun.       He grabs it.

     Darryl regroups, turns around, but is met with...

     WHACK! MIKE bashes Darryl's face with the butt.        This knocks
     Darryl completely out.

     Mike stands over Darryl.     A beat.   Then...

                           MIKE
                SHERYL!

51   EXT.   MOUNTAINS - DAY (2ND UNIT)                                 51

     The morning fog has dissipated as streaks of sunlight pierce
     the cloudy skies.

52   EXT.   FIVE CORNERS - DAY                                         52

     Mike arrives back at their campsite, shotgun in tow.      He
     freezes, completely floored.

     Everything is gone. The tent, the backpacks, the mess kits,
     everything. Even the fire pit.

     Mike looks around, turning, looking...completely helpless.

     He SNAPS open the shotgun - he's got two shells.       He closes
     it, heads back into the woods.

53   OMIT                                                              53

54   EXT.   WOODS #3, TIMBER FALLS TRAILS - DAY                        54

     Mike moves deeper into the woods.      He's a mix of paranoia and
     determination.

     Mike pauses, catching his breath, when... A FEW BLOOD DROPS
     OF BLOOD LAND ON HIS FACE. Mike wipes his face, looks at the
     blood. What the fuck?

     A couple more DROPS hit him.    Mike LOOKS UP...

     A MANGLED, MUTILATED DEER HANGS IN THE TREES, secured by
     coarse thick ropes.

                                                               42.


     Mike takes a terrified step backwards, unaware...       A FEW FEET
     BEHIND HIM LAYS A RUSTED, STEEL BEAR TRAP.

     Mike, still mesmerized by the blood and the deer, continues
     backing up... getting closer to the bear trap... closer...
     his foot HOVERS OVER THE CENTER OF THE TRAP...

     SNAP! CRUNCH!    MIKE STEPS IN THE TRAP, THE JAWS CHOMP DOWN
     ON HIS LEG!

     Mike SCREAMS IN AGONY! He drops to the ground, stares at his
     leg, now a bloody mess of flesh and steel.

                            MIKE
                HELP!?!?!

     Mike writhes in pain on the ground.    His eyes watering.     The
     pain UNBEARABLE. Then...

     MIKE'S POV - Someone or thing appears, stepping from the
     forest. They come closer. THE SUN BLASTS DIRECTLY BEHIND
     The FIGURE keeping their identity hidden.

     Mike's eyelids flutter, can't determine who/what it is. The
     pain overwhelms him. He doesn't care any longer. Then...

     Ida bends down next to Mike.

                          IDA
                Michael, can you hear me?    Michael...

     Her words fade out.    He promptly PASSES OUT.

                                                           CUT TO BLACK.

     ON BLACK: A SHRIEKING WHISTLE SOUNDS.

     FADE IN:

55   INT.   IDA'S CABIN - DAY                                       55

     CLOSE ON - Mike's eyes SNAP open, dart side to side, blink.

     REVEAL - Mike lays on a ragged couch.    The place is dark and
     dusty. A glance around...

     Gaslights hang in the corners. A stack of logs rest next to
     an old fireplace. Just off the main room is a kitchen
     alcove, with a coal stove. On the stove a WHISTLING TEAPOT.

     Mike's memory slowly comes back.    He leans up when...

                            MIKE
                Ow!

                                                       43.


A sharp pain shoots through his body. Mike reaches for his
leg. The tourniquet conceals the damage. A damn towel is
wrapped around where the wound is. A bandage has replaced
the Gray Bandana on his arm.

Ida enters the cabin from the back door, into the kitchen.
She removes the teapot from the burner. The whistling stops.

                    IDA
          Look who's up.

                    MIKE
          Where am I?

                    IDA
          You're in my home, Michael. You gave
          me quite a scare. I thought I lost
          you.

Ida grabs a wet wash cloth, wrings it out over a basin and
walks back to Mike.

                    IDA
          Lucky the snap didn't break the bone,
          just bruised it. I know that's of
          little comfort now, but trust me, it's
          a good thing. That dirty trap
          however's prime for spreading
          infection, need to finish cleaning out
          that wound and then I'll get some
          "evening primrose" in you. Same stuff
          the Indian Tribes used it back in the
          day to heal, well... just about
          everything. So's do I.

Ida unwraps the tourniquet, examines the wound.

                    IDA
          Try and relax.

Ida cleans the wound.    Mike winces.   He can't watch.

                       MIKE
          Thank you.     For saving my life.

                    IDA
          You don't have to thank me. Up here,
          we take care of one another. That's
          the only way any of us survive.

                    MIKE
          Um...
              (Thinks...)
          I'm sorry, but I don't know your name.

       SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006      44.


                    IDA
          Oh for the sake of sunshine... how
          rude a host am I? Name's Ida Foster.

Ida moves to the kitchen, grabs a mason jar with clear
liquid. It looks just like the jar Mike bought from Brody.

                    MIKE
          Ida, I need some help.

                    IDA
          I'm moving as fast as I can, sweetie.

                    MIKE
          No, not me. It's Sheryl. My
          girlfriend. You met her with me
          yesterday. Something's happened to
          her. She was gone this morning when I
          woke up. I looked everywhere and I
          couldn't find her. We need to call
          someone. A Ranger. Somebody. We
          need to find her right away. Do you
          have a phone?

                     IDA
          I'm sorry, but I don't. Never really
          had use for one.
              (Beat)
          I do have a radio. We can call down
          to base if you'd like.

Ida comes back to the couch.

                    IDA
          After we take care of you.

                    MIKE
          I'm fine, Ida, please... if you could
          call now.

                    IDA
          You want to lose this leg? Cause
          that's what you're risking. Soon as
          we're done, I'll call. Okay?

Mike concedes.   Ida hands a second rag to Mike.

                    IDA
          Bite down on this... I ain't gonna
          lie... Lotta pain about to hit you
          sweetheart.

                                                        45.


Mike puts the rag in his mouth. Ida dips the used cloth in
the moonshine. He closes his eyes TIGHT, and... Ida applies
the moonshine to the wound.

Mike SCREAMS through the cloth.

                       IDA
          It's okay.     It's almost over.

Ida repeats. Mike SCREAMS again. His eyes water.

Ida offers her palm.    Mike opens his mouth.   The cloth falls
into her hand.

Mike BREATHES HEAVILY, coming down from the pain.

Ida crosses to the kitchen, disposes of the two wash cloths
and grabs a larger towel. She walks back to Mike and wraps
his calf with the towel.

                    IDA
          We'll get some of that primrose in you
          and you'll be good as new.

                    MIKE
          Ida? The radio. Please... Can you
          call down please?

                    IDA
          I'll take care of it right now.

Ida heads to a closed door on the far side of the room.    She
opens and enters, sure to close the door behind her.

Mike relaxes, as best he can anyway.    Until...

KNOCK, KNOCK.

                    BRODY (OS)
          Ida, you in there?!

MIKE'S POV - Through a small slit in the drapes, Brody waits
outside.

Ida exits the room, heads for the door.

                    MIKE
              (Whispers)
          He's looking for me.

                    IDA
              (Whispers; concerned)
          Why's that?

                                                        46.


                    BRODY (OS)
          Ida!

                    MIKE
              (Whispers)
          I think he had something to do with
          Sheryl going missing.

KNOCK, KNOCK.

                    IDA
              (Whispers)
          I'll take care of it.

                    BRODY (OS)
          Ida, lemme in!

                    IDA
          I'm coming!

Ida helps Mike stand, re-directs him to the kitchen alcove.
He winces all the way. She leans him up against the near
wall so that he is out of view of the door.

Ida goes to the front door, opens it halfway, revealing an
agitated Brody, shotgun in hand.

Suspicious, Brody tries to peek past Ida into the cabin.    She
doesn't budge.

                    BRODY
          What took you so long?

                    IDA
          What do you want, Brody?

                    BRODY
          I'm looking for a man hiker.

                    IDA
          This "man hiker" alone or wit someone?

                    BRODY
          He had a lady friend, but...    I'm just
          looking for him now.

ON MIKE - Listening nervously.

                    IDA
          Well, I ain't seen no one in days.

Brody glares at her. She glares right back. Brody again
tries to see past her into the cabin, but she blocks him.

                                                      47.


                    IDA
          What'd he do you for anyway?

                     BRODY
          He busted Darryl's face in with a
          shotgun. Left him a mess of blood and
          teeth. Nearly killed him.
              (Beat)
          You spot anyone you don't know, you be
          sure to find me.

                       IDA
          Fine.

Brody eyeballs Ida one last time, then leaves. Ida watches
him go, closes the door and heads to the alcove.

                    IDA
          He's gone. Brody and those boys are a
          pain in the backside. I'm sure that
          cousin of his had it coming.

Ida leads Mike back to the couch.

                    MIKE
          What did the Ranger say? Does he need
          to speak to me? When is he coming?

Ida heads back to the kitchen, grabs a mug and pours hot
water into it. She dishes a small spoonful of yellow powder
into the hot water.

                    IDA
          Sorry, I wasn't able to reach anyone.

Ida stirs the powder in as she walks back to Mike.

                    MIKE
          God damnit!

Ida pauses...then:

                    IDA
          Please don't take the Lord's name in
          vain in this house.

She GLARES LONG, COLD and HARD at Mike, until...

                       MIKE
          I'm sorry.

                    IDA
          Drink this.

                                                     48.


Ida hands him the steaming mug.    Mike's mind races.

                    MIKE
          Something's not right.

                    IDA
          I'm sure they're just on rounds and
          will be back any minute. We'll try
          them again and we'll find Sheryl.
          You'll see. She probably just took a
          wrong turn up here, ended up in the
          middle of "don't know where." Happens
          lots of times.
              (Looks to the mug)
          Please drink up, Michael, it will make
          you feel better.

Mike holds the mug, stares at the drink. He puts it to his
lips but then stops, looks at Ida. She stares at him.

Unnerved by the stare, Mike lowers the mug without sipping.

                    IDA
          What's wrong?

                    MIKE
          How did you know my name?

                     IDA
              (Confused)
          Excuse me?

                    MIKE
          Michael. You keep calling me Michael.
          You did it just now. You did before,
          just after I woke up. You called me
          Michael. Nobody calls me Michael.

                    IDA
          I'm sure you're mistaken.    You musta
          told me before.

                    MIKE
          No, I would have told you "Mike."
          Only my grandmother, who's dead, ever
          called me Michael.

                    IDA
          Well, how else could I have known your
          name?

ANGLE ON - IDA'S BOOTS.

       SHOOTING SCRIPT               OCTOBER 17, 2006    49.


                       MIKE
                 (Beat; thinks...)
             On my driver's license and credit
             cards, it says Michael. If you stole
             my wallet from the campsite... that's
             how you'd have known.

Long beat.

                       IDA
             You're accusing me of stealing your
             wallet? I saved your life. Twice.
             Why would I steal your wallet?
                 (Mike doesn't respond)
             Now, just drink your primrose...

                       MIKE
             Fuck the primrose!

Mike TOSSES the mug across the room.      It SHATTERS.

Mike lifts himself up. Despite the pain, he heads for the
room Ida went in to make the radio call.

                       IDA
             Where do you think you're going?

                       MIKE
             I want to call the Ranger myself.

                       IDA
             NO!

Ida springs to her feet, jumps in front of Mike.

                       MIKE
             I'm getting in that room, Ida.

Mike maneuvers around her, when... Ida grabs the iron fire
poker by the stove, holds it like a baseball bat.

                       IDA
             I can't let you in there.

Mike takes a step forward. Ida SWINGS the poker. Nearly
hits Mike. Mike jukes left, she SWINGS again. Misses.

                       MIKE
             Where is Sheryl, Ida?    She's in that
             room, isn't she?

                       IDA
             You sinners are all alike. I heard
             you last night. Spitting in the face
                       (MORE)

                                                                 50.

                          IDA (cont'd)
                of the Lord and his laws.      Dining on
                the sins of the flesh.

                                                           FLASH BACK TO:

56   EXT.   TENT - FIVE CORNERS - LAST NIGHT                          56

     Inside the tent, Mike and Sheryl make love.      Their campfire
     still burns. Suddenly...

     A SHADOW creeps into frame.   Then a BOOT.

     REVEAL: IDA STANDS OUTSIDE THE TENT.

                                                                BACK TO:

57   INT.   IDA'S CABIN - DAY                                         57

     Suddenly, Ida appears in a new light...

                          IDA
                You and your bitch whore girlfriend
                will atone for your sins.

     Mike LUNGES forward, grabs hold of the poker before Ida can
     swing it again.

     THEY STRUGGLE, CRASH UP AGAINST THE WALL!      The poker falls to
     the floor.

     Ida JUMPS on Mike's back, wraps her arms around his throat.

     Mike spins Ida around in circles, then SLAMS Ida up against
     the wall. The two fall to the floor.

     Mike pushes himself up, but before he can get away...

     IDA GRABS HOLD OF HIS BEAR TRAP WOUND, SQUEEZES!

     MIKE SCREAMS IN AGONY! Instinctively, Mike kicks Ida in the
     face, boot to nose. Ida's head snaps back, then falls face
     first on the floorboard.

     Mike is PANTING, glances at Ida.    She's out cold.

     Mike pushes himself up, limps to the door.      He grabs the
     handle, PUSHES IT OPEN...

58   INT.   SEWING ROOM, IDA'S CABIN - DAY                            58

     Mike enters to find a sewing machine, some yarn, an antique
     radio, but more importantly, No Sheryl. He steps over to the
     radio, when he notices...

             SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006       51.


     AN INCH THICK LAYER OF DUST COVERS THE RADIO. He swipes it
     with his finger. This thing hasn't been used in years.

     Mike turns, steps on a throw-rug laying in the center of the
     floor... HIS FOOT SINKS a little. Mike tests the floor board
     again. It's RICKETY. He pulls the rug out...

     REVEAL: A TRAP DOOR.   Mike grabs the latch, lifts it open.

59   INT.   TRAP DOOR STAIRCASE                                    59

     FROM BELOW... Looking up past a weathered, worn and wooden
     staircase up at Mike.

     Carefully, Mike makes his way down the steps, into...

60   INT.   CHAPEL - CABIN BASEMENT - DAY                          60

     Religious artifacts, lots of them. Crosses, photos of Jesus,
     statues of Mary, etc. Don the walls, shelves... everywhere.

     On the far side of the room... like an altar shrine...   NINE
     LARGE GLASS JARS FILLED WITH LIQUID...

     INSIDE EACH JAR - HUMAN FETUSES, all in various stages of
     development and DEFORMITY. Each jar is labelled with their
     own individual bronze nameplate (#1, MATTHEW... #2, JOHN...
     #3, PETER... #4, LUKE, etc...).

     THE LAST JAR - The fetus is closest to term, maybe 8 months
     along). The nameplate reads, "TIMOTHY."

     Mike, completely freaked out, backpedals, bumps into AN IRON
     DOOR. He turns the handle, opens it...

61   INT.   HALLWAY - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT                         61

     It's pitch black as Mike opens the door.   Next to the door, a
     light switch... He flips it ON.

     Sounding like small gunshots, a series of overhead lights
     TURN ON illuminating a long, narrow, curved hallway. At the
     far end... THREE DOORS. (RECOGNIZE THIS FROM THE OPENING
     SCENE.) A sound. It's distant, muffled...indistinguishable.
     Mike stirs, hearing the faint, muted sound from the end of
     the hallway.

     Mike staggers, leans against the wall for support. He's
     woozy, but determined. He proceeds down the hall, towards
     the doors.

     Just as Mike passes underneath a light... POP! THE LIGHTS
     EXPLODES. SPARKS, GLASS SHOWER onto Mike. As he brushes
     himself off.

                                                               52.


     A SCREAM cries out.

                             MIKE
                Sheryl!?

     Mike moves faster, reaches the end of the hallway, faces the
     door. He turns the knob, pushes it open, and...

62   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT                  62

     Mike steps into the room, the light from the hall SPILLS INTO
     THE ROOM, falls across...

     Sheryl, tied to a beam that extends from the ceiling to the
     floor, a coarse rope secures a gag in her mouth. She's
     bruised with a lot of nicks and scratches.

     Sheryl and Mike's eyes lock.     Euphoria, pain all at once.

                             MIKE
                Oh my God.

     Mike runs to her, touches her face.    He checks the ropes
     tying Sheryl. They're very secure.

                          MIKE
                I need something to cut you down,
                baby.

     Sheryl tries to motion to the other side of the room.

     Mike follows her gaze... Searching wildly...       scanning the
     room... a tool bench... tools... TOOLS!

     ON A TOOL BENCH - A litany of the conventional and
     unconventional. A hammer, screw drivers, axes, a FLASHLIGHT,
     then, finally... in the middle of bunch... A HUNTER'S KNIFE.

     Mike grabs the knife, hobbles back to Sheryl.      He slides the
     blade between her cheek and the rope, SLICES.      Several tense
     moments later... the rope breaks.

     Mike tosses the rope and gag away.    They kiss.

                          MIKE
                Are you okay?

                          SHERYL
                Get me out of here.    Hurry.

     Mike starts cutting the ropes around her wrists.

                          SHERYL
                He'll be back soon.

                                                          53.


                       MIKE
           Who's he?

OFF SCREEN: A LOUD THUD resounds.    Where did it come from?

Not wanting or waiting to find out, Mike doubles the effort.

                     SHERYL
           Come on, come on, come on...

SNAP!   Finally, the ropes tear.   Sheryl's free.     Just as...

ALL THE LIGHTS SIMULTANEOUSLY GO OUT. COMPLETE AND TOTAL
DARKNESS SURROUND THE YOUNG COUPLE. Sheryl lets rip a short,
but loud SCREAM. Mike quickly silences her.

BREATHING INTENSIFIES.    Mike and Sheryl take refuge in each
other's arms. Then...

Mike remembers... on the tool bench... THE FLASHLIGHT.      He
feels around for the bench, when... WHACK.

                       MIKE
           Fuck!

He banged his injured leg on something.

                     SHERYL
               (Whispers)
           What are you doing?

Mike reaches the tool bench, feels around.    Finds it.

                     SHERYL
               (Whispers)
           Mike? Mike?

Mike TURNS ON THE FLASHLIGHT.    The beam CUTS through the
darkness and onto...

The Concealed Figure, stands face to face with Mike
brandishing his axe/sickle.

SHERYL SCREAMS!

The Concealed Figure swings the axe/sickle, slices Mike
across the forearm. BLOOD SPRAYS ACROSS THE FLOOR.

Mike YELPS in pain, drops the flashlight and knife.

                     MIKE
           Sheryl, run!

But Sheryl freezes.

             SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006        54.


     He comes at Mike again, but... he eludes the attack.

     Mike grabs the flashlight, the only weapon within his reach,
     and SWINGS, STRIKING THE CONCEALED FIGURE IN THE KNEE, he
     drops to the ground.

     The Concealed Figure grabs Mike by the throat, runs him as
     hard and fast as he can against a wall!

     Sheryl's frozen in fear.

     He SQUEEZES his throat harder, tighter.    Mike can't breathe.

     Mike smacks the Concealed Figure in the face, squirms, all to
     no avail, until...

     Mike JAMS his THUMB INTO HIS EYE.   He SCREAMS, DROPS Mike.
     They both fall to the floor.

     The fallen flashlight's beam illuminates Sheryl backed in the
     corner.

                          MIKE
                    (To Sheryl)
                Get the fuck out of here!    Now!

     Finally Sheryl runs out of the room...

63   INT.   HALLWAY - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT                         63

     Sheryl feels her way out by touching the wall...

64   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT                 64

     As the Concealed Figure writhes in pain...

     Mike catches his breath, attempts to stand, only... his body
     buckles under the pain.

     He throws a look to the Figure, then crawls over to the tool
     bench. He pulls himself up using the bench for support. He
     haphazardly feels for a weapon... any weapon.

     He grabs a hammer, turns and...

     The Figure grabs Mike's wrist, then HEAD-BUTTS MIKE between
     the eyes. He falls to the floor. Out cold.

     The Concealed Figure holds his injured eye with one hand,
     grabs the SICKLE/AXE with the other.

                                                              55.


65   INT.   HALLWAY - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT                            65

     Sheryl reaches the iron door, but stops.     Looks back into the
     darkness.

                          SHERYL
                Mike?
                    (No response)
                Mike?

     Still no answer. Then... Sheryl spots the light switch,
     FLIPS IT... THE LIGHTS SNAP ON!

     Suddenly, THE CONCEALED FIGURE APPEARS OUT OF THE DARKNESS!

     SHERYL SCREAMS!

     HE LUNGES FOR SHERYL, but misses.     She runs through the door,
     into...

66   INT.   CHAPEL - IDA'S CABIN - DAY                                66

     ... Sheryl rushes into the room, but trips on something.
     When she gets up, the first thing she sees... THE FETUS JARS!

     She coughs violently, almost pukes.     She stumbles, hurries up
     the trap door steps...

     A moment later...

     The Concealed Figure pops through the iron door.       For the
     first time we see the Concealed Figure wholly...

     THIS IS DEACON. Half his body scarred, burned. He stands
     well over six feet tall, muscles rippling everywhere. A
     frightful sight.

     He peers up the trap door steps, pursues Sheryl...

67   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - DAY                                         67

     Sheryl BURSTS through the front door, running for the woods.

     Deacon exits the cabin, spots Sheryl.     Runs after her.

68   EXT.   WOODS #4 - TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY                       68

     SHERYL runs as fast as she can. Breaking branches in her
     way, leaping rocks. Anything to get away from...

     DEACON follows. This is his terrain, turf.      He moves quickly
     and efficiently through the brush.

                                                              56.


     SHERYL looks back, and as she does... trips over some tree
     roots. She falls FACE FIRST INTO A GIANT PUDDLE. She pushes
     herself out of the puddle. She's soaked, but doesn't stop.
     She resumes running.

     DEACON... closing the gap.

     SHERYL, confused, scared and lost, looks around wildly.   Has
     no idea where she's going. Then suddenly she hears
     something. She looks down a slight hill...

     SHERYL'S POV - A RANGER TRUCK drives along a gravel road.

                          SHERYL
                Thank you God...
                    (At the top of her lungs)
                HELP!

     Sheryl darts down the hill, and falls out onto...

69   I/E   RANGER TRUCK/ GRAVEL MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY              69

     The RANGER TRUCK SLAMS on the brakes, inches from running
     over Sheryl. She SLAMS her arms down on the hood.

     Clyde, startled beyond belief, looks out at Sheryl. He gets
     out of the car, goes to her. She HUGS Clyde tightly, starts
     crying. He looks at her... the blood, cuts, etc.

                          CLYDE
                Oh my stars, what happened to you?

                           SHERYL
                     (Out of breath)
                You have to help me. I was kidnapped.
                My boyfriend came... And this man's
                chasing me. He's chasing me right
                now.

                          CLYDE
                Calm down. I can't make heads or
                tails of what you're saying.

                          SHERYL
                He's coming. He's right behind me.

     Clyde looks up into the woods from where Sheryl came, but...
     all's peaceful at the moment. No Deacon.

                          CLYDE
                Look, miss, there's no one there.

                          SHERYL
                Oh my God, Mike.

                                                               57.


     ANGLE FROM DOWN THE PATH - Clyde, his back to us, consoles
     Sheryl. Deacon steps into frame. Sickle/Axe in hand. He
     starts toward Clyde and Sheryl.

                          CLYDE
                It's going to be fine, Miss. I
                promise you. Everything's going to be
                fine.

     Sheryl pries her face from Clyde's chest.

     SHERYL'S POV - Deacon's five feet behind Clyde and closing.

     SHERYL SCREAMS.   CLYDE HOLDS ONTO SHERYL.

     Off her look, Clyde turns... DEACON AND CLYDE STAND FACE TO
     FACE. The moment's frozen. For too long.

     Something's not right.

                          CLYDE
                Deacon, what's going on?    How the heck
                did she escape?

     Sheryl looks at Clyde, in shock.    Deacon lowers his head,
     ashamed.

                          CLYDE
                Want something done, gotta do it
                yourself.

     Clyde removes a black, wooden club from his belt... Sheryl
     turns, about to run, when... CLYDE CRACKS HER ACROSS THE
     BACK OF THE HEAD WITH THE CLUB.

                                                           CUT TO BLACK.

     FADE IN:

70   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY                                   70

     SHERYL'S POV - OUT OF FOCUS, WOBBLY. LIGHTS, a rainbow of
     FUZZY COLORS DANCE BEFORE US. Slowly, bring into focus...
     Sheryl coughs, gags on something.

     SHERYL'S POV - She lifts her arms to discover her wrists are
     tied together tightly.

     SHERYL'S POV - Ida enters the room carrying something.
     Sheryl's breath quickens. Ida walks right up to Sheryl.        She
     places a FLOWER WREATH in her hair, adjusts it to fit.

                                                               58.


                          IDA
                Perfect. Just perfect. You are
                lovely as a summer's day.
                    (Checks her watch)
                It's almost time.

     Sheryl catches her REFLECTION in a small wall mirror.

71   INT.   CHAPEL - DAY                                          71

     ANGLE ON - A ROPE looped through a hook in the ceiling.
     FOLLOW THE ROPE DOWN... PASS A PAIR OF BLOODY AND BRUISED
     HANDS, WRISTS... keep going... end on Mike.

     Mike's passed out. He dangles in the middle of the room. He
     wears an old, moth-eaten sports jacket and slacks. A rope
     gags his mouth.

     ANGLE ON - the SICKLE/AXE.   As it moves towards Mike...

     Deacon, a black ring surrounds his injured eye, steps in
     front of Mike, holds the blade CENTIMETERS from Mike's eye.

     An eye for an eye?

     Mike wakes and... immediately freaks out. He tries to shake
     loose, but can't. Deacon stares at him, but...

                           CLYDE (O.S.)
                Deacon!

     Clyde enters. He wears a long garment around his neck,
     carries a bible.

                          CLYDE
                That's enough. Get him ready.

     Deacon backs off. He undoes a slipknot on the far wall,
     which causes Mike to come CRASHING to the floor. Deacon
     lifts Mike to his feet, positions him.

     It's only now Mike gets a gander at the room.

     The FETUS JARS adorn the far wall. There's a giant WOODEN
     CROSS hanging over a makeshift altar. CANDLES anywhere and
     everywhere.

     An old phonograph, one that you CRANK to play, rests in the
     corner. Clyde places the needle down on a record, CRANKS THE
     WHEEL. The MUSIC kicks in, CLASSICAL RELIGIOUS... It's
     hollow, full of static and futz.

     Mike watches... HIS EYES OPEN WIDE, as...

                                                       59.


The iron door slowly CREAKS open.

ANGLE ON - A FILTHY PAIR OF WHITE DRESS SHOES. Ropes secure
the ankles so movement's limited to inches at a time.

Shimmying into the room, wearing a dusty, old wedding dress
and a flower wreath in her hair is Sheryl. Her wrists still
bound. Her mouth gagged.

Mike and Sheryl take each other in. Tears spring to Sheryl's
eyes. She takes another jerky step closer.

Ida is visible behind her, guides her towards Mike. She
positions her next to him so that both face the altar.

Clyde glances to Ida who silences the music.

                    CLYDE
          And Jesus answered and said unto them,
          "Each man should have his own wife,
          and each woman her own husband. The
          husband should fulfill his marital
          duty to his wife, and likewise the
          wife to her husband."

                    IDA
          Amen.

                    CLYDE
          And so, in the presence of our Lord
          Jesus Christ, I ask you Michael... and
          you Sheryl, do you accept the sacred
          covenant of marriage?

Mike and Sheryl stare at Clyde.   Neither flinch.

Clyde glances to Deacon, who immediately steps forward,
touches the sickle blade to Sheryl's throat.

                    CLYDE
          I'll ask again... Do you accept this
          covenant of marriage?

Sheryl nods immediately.   Mike nods too.

Clyde signals for Deacon to step back.   He obeys.

                    CLYDE
          Then by the power vested in me, I
          pronounce you man and wife.

Clyde signals to Ida.

                                                         60.


Ida removes Sheryl's graduation ring from her finger. She
then slides TWO TARNISHED GOLD BANDS, one on Sheryl's finger,
the other on Mike's.

Clyde unties the rope securing Mike's gag in his mouth,
removes it.

                    MIKE
          Why are you doing this? We did
          nothing to you people. Let us go!

                    CLYDE
          You may kiss the bride.

                    MIKE
          You fucking people are fucking sick!

Clyde's temper flares...

                    CLYDE
              (Stern and cold)
          Do not use that type of language in
          this house again. Now... kiss the
          bride or...
              (Gestures to Deacon)
          ... he'll cut off your lips.

Mike stares in horror at Clyde, turns to Sheryl.

                    MIKE
          I love you.

Mike kisses her briefly on the cheek.

Clyde smiles satisfied, nods to Deacon. He immediately lifts
Sheryl up and throws her over his shoulder.

                    MIKE
          What are you doing?

Deacon carries her from the room.   Sheryl CRIES.

                    MIKE
          LET HER GO! SHERYL!
              (To Clyde)
          Let her go!...Please, let her go!

Clyde pulls the ropes, hoists Mike back into a dangling
position. He secures the knot before exiting the room.

                    MIKE
          SHERYL!
              (To Ida)
                    (MORE)

                                                                   61.

                            MIKE (cont'd)
                  Please. Don't hurt her. Whatever it
                  is you want, I'll give it to you.

                            IDA
                  I know you will.

       She stuffs the gag in, secures it in place with the rope.
       She ties the knot. Perfect.

       Ida exits the room.     Mike is alone.

       Mike tries to yank his hands through the knot. His wrists
       and hands turn red, his face is flushed...the knot is too
       tight. He stops.

       Mike takes a breath and tries again. His face and hands are
       beet red. He pulls and pulls...but the rope doesn't budge.
       Mike exhales. It's no use. He dangles there, helpless.

72     EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                                       72

       Resting under the FULL MOON, sits the cabin.

72 A   INT.   CHAPEL - NIGHT                                          72 A

       Mike still dangles by his wrists.    Clyde enters.

       Clyde unties the end of the rope on the floor.      The rope
       UNFURLS, Mike DROPS to the ground.

       Clyde picks him up, sits him in a nearby chair. Mike's
       wrists, ankles and mouth still bound and gagged.

                            CLYDE
                  Gonna untie your mouth, now.    Have a
                  little "man to man" talk.

       Clyde undoes the gag in Mike's mouth.

                            MIKE
                  Please... It's not too late.    Let us
                  go.    We won't tell anyone.

                             CLYDE
                      (Beat)
                  How well do you know your bible,
                  Michael?

                            MIKE
                  Jesus Fucking Christ...

       Clyde SLAPS Mike across the face.

                                                                 62.


                          CLYDE
                I told you before to watch that mouth,
                mister.

                            MIKE
                Fuck you.

     Clyde PUNCHES him, not once, but twice.    He readies a third.

                          CLYDE
                You through?

     Mike spits some blood on the floor.    Nods.

                           CLYDE
                I'll ask again... how well do you know
                the bible?

                            MIKE
                Not very.

                          CLYDE
                That's okay. It's fine. That's why I
                am here... teach you the way things
                are and the way they should be.

73   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT                                   73

     Sheryl sits in a chair in the middle of the room. Still
     gagged. She wears a new outfit. A handmade dress with a
     small crest embroidered over the heart. IT'S SIMILAR TO THE
     ONE WORN BY SARAH (GIRL FROM THE OPENING SCENE OF FILM).

     Ida pulls tight the rope securing her wrists to the arms of
     the chair. Satisfied.

                          IDA
                I'll be right back.

     Ida exits the room. Deacon stands by the door.        He and
     Sheryl alone together.

     Sheryl tries not to make eye contact.

     Deacon stares at her.     Longingly.

     DEACON'S POV - On Sheryl's chest, expanding and contracting
     with every breath.

     ON DEACON - SLOWLY PUSH INTO TIGHT CLOSE UP

     DEACON'S POV - Sheryl, a heavenly glow encircles her (and her
     gag mysteriously gone), turns to Deacon. A look of calm and
     lust in her eyes.

                                                             63.


                          SHERYL
                I want you, Deacon.
                    (Jump Cut to...)
                I want you to fuck me.   Hard.

     ON DEACON - His stare deepens.

     Sheryl, the heavenly glow gone, her gag back in place.
     Watches Deacon. She squirms, cries.

74   INT.   CHAPEL - NIGHT                                      74

     Clyde sits in a chair next to Mike.

                           CLYDE
                Lord knows the will of a man gets
                tested. Cruelly most times. But the
                righteous persevere. They do what
                needs to be done, even though they
                don't want to. It's what makes a man,
                a man. Let me tell you the story of
                Judas, he was one of Jesus's apostles.
                Judas led Roman Soldiers to the
                capture and eventual death of our Lord
                Jesus Christ. And now, is supposedly
                seated next to Satan, his soul burning
                in hell forever for this sin. But I
                don't believe that's the case. I have
                my own theory. The death of Jesus was
                predicted thousands of years before
                Judas ever came along. And for the
                prophecy to be fulfilled, Jesus had to
                die. If he didn't, the gates of
                heaven couldn't be opened for mankind.
                I don't think, for an instant, Judas
                wanted to be the one, but... someone
                had to. Judas helped Jesus, so Jesus
                could die for our sins. Save us all.
                And I believe at this moment... Judas
                is in heaven, despite his sin, because
                it led to the greater good.
                    (Beat)
                Relations prior to marriage is a sin.
                You and Sheryl are sinners in the
                Lord's eyes. And because of those
                sins, your souls are damned. But Ida
                and Me, we're gonna give you a chance
                to save your souls and do the right
                thing, but... as previously stated,
                you will need to persevere and show
                the strength and will of your
                character. But you'll do it. Because
                that's what needs to be done.

                                                             64.


     Mike stares unflinching at Clyde.

75   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT                               75

     Deacon kneels before Sheryl who tries to move, but can't.

     ANGLE ON - Deacon lays his scarred hand on Sheryl's thigh.

     Sheryl squirms, but that's all she can do.       Then...

                           IDA (O.S.)
                Deacon!

     Deacon jumps up, backs off.

                          IDA
                You get away from her.    Git!   Now!

     Ida sets a tray she was carrying down, chases Deacon from the
     room. She shuts the door behind him.

                          IDA
                I'm sorry about that, Sugar.     My
                brother, he's not well.

     She retrieves the tray, brings it over closer to Sheryl.

                          IDA
                It's not all his fault. Our father
                wasn't very Christian and then there
                was the accident. Along with the
                scarring, lost use of his vocals.
                Can't speak a lick. Now, I've spoken
                to him. What happened with the others
                won't happen to you. He's promised me
                that.

     What others?   What did he do?

                          IDA
                I'm gonna take that out of your mouth
                now. I brought you some tea, got some
                primrose in it. Help you relax, get
                some rest. Okay?

     Ida unties the gag in Sheryl's mouth. She coughs a few
     times. Ida raises the mug of tea to her lips...

                          SHERYL
                Please don't do this. Please let me
                go. Please..I just want to go home.

             SHOOTING SCRIPT         OCTOBER 17, 2006             65.


                           IDA
                    (Cold)
                Drink the tea.

     Ida brings the mug to her lips again, pours some in Sheryl's
     mouth. She swallows a big gulp.

                          IDA
                That's better. Good girl.
                    (Changing topics)
                I almost forgot to ask... How does it
                feel being married?

                          SHERYL
                Why are you doing this?

                          IDA
                I thought you'd be happy about that.
                All I ever wanted out of life was two
                things... to be married and to have a
                baby. The Lord blessed me with Clyde
                and I thank Him every day for that.

     Ida pours some more tea into Sheryl.

                          IDA
                But having a baby's been...
                complicated.

76   INT.   CHAPEL - NIGHT                                          76

     Clyde walks over to the fetus jars.    Stares at them.   A
     sadness in his eyes.

                          CLYDE
                She can conceive fine... just...
                can't seem to make it all the way
                through. Timothy was the toughest...
                Made it to month eight.

     ANGLE ON - The "Timothy" Fetus jar.    The most developed of
     them all.

                          CLYDE
                City Doctor had some fancy mumbo-jumbo
                words for the condition.
                    (Beat; turns to Mike)
                Breaks my heart every time. That
                woman was born to be a mother. It's
                her calling in life. Just like you
                and Sheryl have a calling.

                          MIKE
                What exactly do you want from us?

                                                              66.


     The IRON DOOR FLIES OPEN, Deacon emerges, stands over Mike.

77   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT                                77

     Sheryl sways back and forth.     Her EYELIDS heavy.   The
     primrose "kicking in."

     Ida places her hand on Sheryl's cheek.

                          IDA
                You're young, strong... It's gonna be
                easy for you. Not like me.

                          SHERYL
                    (Barely conscious)
                Wh-what...?

                           IDA
                You're gonna have a baby, Sheryl.
                    (Beat)
                My baby.

78   INT.   HALLWAY - CABIN BASEMENT - NIGHT                       78

     Deacon drags Mike down the hall.    Clyde follows.

79   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT                                79

     The door to the room FLIES OPEN.    Deacon drags Mike inside,
     Clyde right behind them.

     To Mike's horror...

                          MIKE
                Oh my God...

     Sheryl lies unconscious on top of the table, Ida by her side.

     ANGLE ON SHERYL - Each of her limbs tied down with heavy
     rope. Her legs are spread apart.

                          MIKE
                What have you done to her?

                          IDA
                She'll be out for hours, but she's
                fine.

                          CLYDE
                Ida'll come back in a little bit,
                check to see that the deed has been
                done. If it hasn't...the next time
                you see your little lady...a piece of
                her will be missing.

                Don't test us on that one.

                          IDA
                Now, we know conception's not
                automatic. So don't feel like all the
                pressure's on right now. We're
                prepared to do this however long it
                takes. You give us the effort each
                time, eventually the magic will
                happen.

                          MIKE
                You're out of your fucking minds.

     Clyde grabs Mike's wrist, turns over his palm.    Clyde takes a
     knife from his belt, SLICES MIKE'S PALM.

     MIKE SCREAMS.   BLOOD POURS FROM THE WOUND.

                          CLYDE
                What did I tell you about the
                language?

     Ida grabs a fresh rag, wraps Mike's hand in it.

                          CLYDE
                Deacon will be right outside that
                door. The only door. This room has
                no windows and is buried twenty feet
                below ground. Cutting to the chase...
                there's no way out and you can scream
                yourself hoarse, no one will hear you.

                          IDA
                We'll let you have your privacy now.
                    (Remembers)
                Oh, almost forgot.

     Ida goes to the corner where the phonograph sits.    She cranks
     the handle, places the needle on the record.

     The record crackles, Pachelbel's "Canon" fills the room.

     Deacon, Clyde and Ida exit.   They SHUT and LOCK the door
     behind them.

80   INT.   HALLWAY - CABIN BASEMENT - NIGHT                       80

     Deacon stands by the door.    Ida and Clyde, holding hands,
     walk towards the stairs...

                          IDA
                It's gotta work this time.

                                                             68.


                             CLYDE
                It will.

                          IDA
                Promise me.
                    (Beat; he doesn't...)
                Promise me, Clyde.

                             CLYDE
                I promise.

     Clyde wraps his arm around Ida's shoulder, comforting her.

81   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                  81

     Mike makes his way to the table, to Sheryl.    He pulls himself
     to his feet.

     He takes Sheryl in. She looks peaceful. He runs his good
     hand through her hair. Tears roll down his cheeks.

     Mike checks each of Sheryl's ropes.    They are all tightly
     secured.

     Mike haphazardly checks every nook and cranny of the room.
     But Clyde was right. No way out.

     Mike stares at the phonograph...    HE KICKS IT OFF THE TABLE,
     KICKS AND BASHES IT TO PIECES.

     VFX: Mike's breathing INTENSIFIES. PUSH INTO TIGHT CLOSE
     UP... His world is not caving in, it's already caved.

82   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT TO DAY (SPLINTER UNIT)             82

     TIME LAPSE... The night sky rapidly changes from black to
     blue. The Sun RISES...

83   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY                                  83

     Sheryl's head falls to the side, bumps the table.     She wakes.

     She finds Mike is passed out sitting in a chair, his hand
     holding hers.

     The door UNBOLTS, FLIES open.

     Mike comes to and glances up as Deacon storms into the room,
     drags him out screaming.

84   INT.   HALLWAY - DAY                                          84

     Ida stands just outside the doorway, lets them pass. She
     slides some surgical gloves on, shuts the door behind her.

                                                             69.


     ANGLE ON - SHERYL as the door SHUTS.

85   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2 - DAY                                    85

     Mike, without his shirt, hangs by his wrists from iron
     shackles secured to the ceiling. (He's hooked up the same
     way the Young Man was in the opening scene of the story.)

     Deacon secures the last of the restraints.     Clyde enters,
     walks straight up to Mike...

                          CLYDE
                Was I at all unclear yesterday?

                             MIKE
                No, but...

                          CLYDE
                Did you understand what was expected
                of you?

                          MIKE
                Yes, but... How do you expect...

                          CLYDE
                Clearly you did not understand. You
                did not even attempt relations last
                evening.

                          MIKE
                What you're asking to do is sick.
                You're sick.

                          CLYDE
                You didn't have a problem when
                penetration was a sin, but when it's
                your wife, it's sick?!? Unbelievable.

     Clyde glares angrily at Mike, then heads to the door.

                          CLYDE
                You knew the rules, Michael. I warned
                you. Now, Deacon, here, will remind
                you.

     Mike turns to Deacon, who stands over the tool bench.    DOZENS
     of sharp instruments of torture lay before him.

     Clyde shuts the door on Mike.

86   INT.   MAIN ROOM - CABIN - DAY                                  86

     Clyde shuts the door.     Ida waits, helps him with his coat.

             SHOOTING SCRIPT         OCTOBER 17, 2006         70.


                          CLYDE
                I'm going to be late for work.

                          IDA
                Be home at the regular time?

     Clyde removes a set of keys from his pocket... NOTICE THE
     BOSTON RED SOX KEY CHAIN... They're Mike's keys.

                          CLYDE
                Might be a bit late. I have an errand
                that needs attending to.

     Clyde kisses Ida, exits.

87   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2 - DAY                                 87

     Deacon stands by the TOOL BENCH, his back to Mike. Deacon
     grabs several different SCARY INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE, tests
     them out.

     Mike tries to see what he's doing. HORRIBLE SOUNDS, METAL
     STRIKING METAL, BLADES SHARPENING, ETC.

     Deacon finally selects a weapon, turns around...

     Mike stares at Deacon who holds a CAT-O'-NINE TAILS in his
     hand. Deacon walks behind Mike...

                          MIKE
                You don't have to do this.    Come on.

     Deacon pulls his arm back, WHIPS MIKE ACROSS THE BACK.

     MIKE SCREAMS IN AGONY.

88   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY                                 88

     Sheryl hears MIKE'S SCREAMS, but she's in a predicament of
     her own.

     Sheryl's tied to chair. Her hand is secured to table top.
     She can't move it. Fingers separated.

                          SHERYL
                What are they doing to him?

                          IDA
                You should concern yourself with
                what's about to happen to you.

     Ida opens a SEWING BOX, but instead of needles and yarn, she
     removes a CLEAVER.

                                                            71.


     Sheryl looks at the cleaver, then... to her hand... the pinky
     finger separated and immobile.

                          SHERYL
                What are you doing, Ida?

                          IDA
                You think you're so much smarter than
                me, don't you?

                           SHERYL
                No.

                          IDA
                Yes you do. Admit it'cause I can see
                it in your eyes, darling. With your
                fancy schools and job and such.
                    (Realizes)
                You think you are better than me.

                          SHERYL
                No, I don't.

     Yes she does.

                           IDA
                    (Beat)
                Might surprise you, but I was quite
                the student back in the day. Straight
                A's. Every subject'cept for Science.
                Infuriated me how they tried to
                explain away the Lord's creations.
                Our teacher, Mr. Billings, once
                said... in the future, humans won't be
                born with a pinky finger'cause of
                evolution.
                    (Frustration building)
                Of all the... I shouted, "No! We are
                created in the Lord's image... not
                some nonsensical theory by Darwind."

     Sheryl stares at Ida, terrified would be an understatement.

                          IDA
                I suppose Mr. Billings and Mr. Darwind
                can stand up and cheer, because you,
                little lady... you're about to
                evolve.

89   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2 - DAY                              89

     Mike dangles...   HIS BACK CUT, BRUISED AND BLOODY.

                                                         72.


                           MIKE
                No more.   Please.   No more.

     Deacon faces Mike, looks him square in the eyes. He walks
     back to the tool bench, lays the whipping device down.

     Mike breathes a touch easier, until...

     Deacon reappears, A JAR OF MOONSHINE in his hands. He dips
     one of his scarred fingers into the liquid and GENTLY touches
     a wound on Mike's body.

     The liquid stings.    Mike WINCES.

                          MIKE
                What are you going to do with that?

     ANGLE ON - MIKE'S BACK.

90   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY                                90

     ANGLE ON - SHERYL'S PINKY.

     Ida sits next to Sheryl.    She raises the cleaver...

                          SHERYL
                Please Ida, don't.    Don't do this.

                          IDA
                You think I want to hurt a pretty
                thing like you? Pains me, but...
                until you and your husband obey, my
                hands, much like yours, are tied.

                          SHERYL
                I know about your condition, Ida.
                It's not your fault. There are a lot
                of women that can't carry a baby full
                term. I know how much you're hurting.

     Ida takes her attention from the finger, starts to pay
     attention to Sheryl.

                          IDA
                You don't know anything about me or
                what I've gone through.

                          SHERYL
                I'm here for you now.      I'll help you.
                Please.

     Ida stares at Sheryl...    debating...

                                                             73.


91   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2                                         91

     Deacon SPLASHES THE ENTIRE JAR OF MOONSHINE ON MIKE'S BACK.
     A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM RINGS OUT.

92   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1                                         92

     Ida and Sheryl turn in the direction of the SCREAM. This
     seems to bring Ida back from wherever she was, back to the
     matter at hand...

     Ida looks into Sheryl's tear-filled eyes.

                          IDA
                You can help...       by following the
                rules.

     Ida CHOPS off Sheryl's pinky finger. Sheryl SCREAMS.

     ANGLE ON - SHERYL'S PINKY FINGER HITS THE FLOOR.

93   EXT.   SWAMP - DAY                                             93

     The SUN burns overhead.

     Clyde stands on the banks of a algae covered swamp.     He
     stares out, nervously watching.

     Brody, in his beat-up Pick-up truck, pulls to a stop.    Exits
     the truck, approaches Clyde.

                              BRODY
                Clyde!

                          CLYDE
                G'morning, Brody.

                          BRODY
                I stopped by your place the other day.

                          CLYDE
                Ida mentioned.

                          BRODY
                So have you seen or heard anything
                about that man hiker?

                           CLYDE
                    (Beat)
                In fact I have. I saw him and his
                lady leave.

                          BRODY
                When was this?

                                                          74.


                             CLYDE
                Yesterday.     Just before dusk.

                             BRODY
                Bullshit.

                          CLYDE
                Believe what you want.

     Clyde looks out at the swamp, then back to Brody, who never
     stopped staring at Clyde.

                          BRODY
                I saw their car last night in the
                parking lot at base. So they didn't
                leave, "Just before dusk."

                          CLYDE
                Well, I was down at base this
                morning... car's gone now.

                          BRODY
                Something don't feel right here,
                Clyde. Between you and Ida...

                          CLYDE
                I don't have time for this...

     He starts to walk away, but Brody grabs his wrist tightly.

                          CLYDE
                Take your hand off me, Brody.

                          BRODY
                What do you know about that hiker you
                ain't telling me?

     Brody waits a beat, then lets him go.

                          CLYDE
                I told you, Brody...    I saw them
                leave. Let it go.

     Brody watches Clyde head off. He's even more paranoid now
     than before. What Brody doesn't notice...

     ANGLE ON THE SWAMP... Just below the water, sinking, the
     outline of the back of the Passat.

94   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT (SPLINTER UNIT)                   94

     DARKNESS envelops the cabin.     A coyote HOWLS.

                                                                  75.


95   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT                                  95

     Sheryl on table, unconscious.     Her hand/finger bandaged.

     THE DOOR'S THROWN OPEN... Deacon throws Mike roughly to
     floor. He's tied per usual.

     NOTICE:    the back of Mike's shirt SOAKED in blood.

                           MIKE
                 How do you expect me to do this?    Like
                 this?

                           CLYDE
                 Do we need to provide you with some
                 more motivation?

                           IDA
                 You wouldn't want to put that lovely
                 bride of yours through a day like she
                 had today again, now would you?

                           MIKE
                 You'll never get away with this. We
                 have friends and family. They know
                 where we went. They'll come looking
                 for us. They'll find us!

                           CLYDE
                 That may very well be... but they
                 won't find your car.

     Clyde dangles the keys - HIS KEYS - in front of Mike.
     Deacon, Clyde and Ida leave.

     THE DOOR BOLTS, LOCKS.

     Mike limps over to Sheryl, he sees her bandaged hand.

                           MIKE
                 Oh baby, what did they do to you?   I'm
                 sorry. I'm so sorry.

                           SHERYL
                     (Without moving, barely
                      audible)
                 Are they gone?

                           MIKE
                     (Surprised)
                 Yeah. You're awake?

     Their entire conversation is no louder than a whisper.

       SHOOTING SCRIPT               OCTOBER 17, 2006   76.


Sheryl turns to face Mike...       They kiss.

                    SHERYL
          I didn't swallow that shit she gave
          me.

Sheryl spies the back of his jersey in a mirror's reflection.

                       SHERYL
          Oh my God.     Mike...

                       MIKE
          It's okay.     I'm okay.

                    SHERYL
          You're not okay. We're not okay.
          What are we gonna do?

                    MIKE
          I don't know.

Sheryl takes a moment. Thinks carefully about how exactly to
phrase this... Then...

                    SHERYL
          Maybe... we should just give them
          what they want?

                       MIKE
          What?

                    SHERYL
          If it stops them from hurting you and
          me... maybe we should...

                    MIKE
          Absolutely not. No fucking way.
          Forget the fact, that the moment you
          get pregnant, they'll kill me. Then
          the moment you give birth, you're
          dead. Beyond both of those reasons...
          ain't no fucking way I am going to
          give them our child.

Tears POUR from Sheryl.

                    MIKE
          For all my coward marriage moments...
          I've thought about our child. Is that
          stupid? I picture what he'll be
          like...

                       SHERYL
          He?

                                                             77.


                             MIKE
                 Wishful thinking. I picture your
                 heart... your eyes... And I picture
                 us, raising him. Growing old with
                 him.
                      (Beat)
                 No. Ain't no fucking way I'm going to
                 give him to them. They keep talking
                 about sins... that would be the worst
                 sin of them all.
                      (Beat)
                 I'll get us out of this, Sheryl. I
                 promise you.

95A   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - DAY (MAIN UNIT)                        95A

      Birds CHIRP overhead.     Sunlight streaks through the clouds.

95B   INT.   CHAPEL - DAY                                         95B

      ANGLE ON - A FINE CLOTH rubs delicately, but firmly one of
      the fetus jars (Timothy).

      Ida finishes, steps off the small stool.     The jars sparkle
      and shine brightly.

      She gazes at the fetus jars with love, affection. The pain
      of lives unfulfilled weighing heavy on her strong shoulders.

      The trap door opens, Clyde comes down the steps.

      Ida turns to Clyde.     A beat...

                              CLYDE
                 It's time.

96    EXT.   MOUNTAINS - DAY (2ND UNIT)                               96

      The morning fog engulfs the mountains.

97    INT.   RANGER BASE STATION - DAY                                97

      SAM, the Ranger that greeted Mike and Sheryl, enters sipping
      a cup of coffee. EVELYN, 20s, a perky and adorable Ranger,
      works at the desk.

                           EVELYN
                 Good morning, Sam.

                           SAM
                 Ain't no better than any of the other
                 days, Evelyn, so bring the "glee" down
                 some, would ya?

                                                             78.


     Sam grabs some papers from his mailbox.   Evelyn's used to
     Sam's moods.

                          EVELYN
                Hey, Sam, do you remember a Virginia
                couple pass through here sometime
                Friday?

                          SAM
                Friday? Well...There was one couple,
                but they didn't say where they were
                from.

                          EVELYN
                Gal's mother's called three times this
                morning. Said she hasn't heard from her
                daughter since before she left and she
                didn't show up for work yesterday or
                today.

                           SAM
                She sure this was the park they were
                coming to?

                         EVELYN
                Yup. Woman's already offering up a
                reward.

                         SAM
                Damn it. Have her fax some photos up
                here. Notify patrol.

                          EVELYN
                Been a while since we had a couple go
                missing. Twelve months ago the last?

     Sam crosses to the bulletin board by the door. He studies the
     flier of the missing couple that Sheryl had noticed.

                          SAM
                    (Concerned)
                Nine.

99   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY                                 99

     Deacon enters.   Clyde and Ida are with him.

                          MIKE
                You don't have to check...   Nothing
                happened.

     Clyde and Ida are pissed.

                                                    79.


                    CLYDE
          We do appreciate your honesty,
          Michael. And believe me, we
          understand your extreme situation,
          but... Punishment's going to have to
          be handed down.

Suddenly, Clyde's walkie-talkie goes off.

                    SAM (V.O.)
          Clyde, it's Sam at base, come back.

                    CLYDE
          Go for, Clyde.

Mike screams trying to be heard while Clyde has button
pushed.

                    CLYDE
              (To Deacon and Ida)
          Restrain him.

Deacon holds Mike, while Ida grabs the gag.

                    SAM (V.O.)
          Yeah, morning, Clyde. Got a missing
          person's report. Young Couple out of
          Alexandria. We're printing up some
          flyers with their photos right now.

                    MIKE
          I told you. I told they'd be coming.

Ida shoves the gag into his mouth, ties it secure.

                    SAM (V.O.)
          When you get a chance, grab some and
          let's start circulating, huh?

Clyde throws a concerned look to Ida.

                       SAM (V.O.)
          Clyde?

                       CLYDE
          Copy that.

Clyde thinks a beat, then...

                    CLYDE
              (To Deacon)
          Get him in the other room.      Now.

Concern covers Clyde's face...

                                                                80.


99 A   EXT.   STREAM - DAY                                         99 A

       Brody washes out some mason jars. His shotgun rests against
       a nearby tree. Lonnie smokes pot from his handmade pipe.

       A walkie-talkie CRACKLES.    Evelyn approaches.

                             BRODY
                  Shit.   Get rid of the dope.

       Brody hides the jars in his satchel.      Lonnie quickly tucks
       his pipe away, fans the smoke away.

                            EVELYN
                  Morning, gentlemen.
                      (She eyes her watch)
                  Pardon me... Afternoon.

                            LONNIE
                  Evelyn, damn, hurts looking at you.
                  When you gonna give it up to me?

                            EVELYN
                  Now with a line like that, it's a
                  shocker I haven't already.

                            LONNIE
                  You stone cold tease.

                             EVELYN
                  Was wondering if either of you had
                  seen any hikers pass by in the last
                  day or so?

       Lonnie's about to respond, but Brody cuts him off...

                            BRODY
                  What's this about?

       Evelyn hands them a flier.

       ON THE FLIER - Photos of Mike and Sheryl, name, info, etc.

       Brody's eyes light up.

                            BRODY
                  These two are missing?

                            EVELYN
                  It would seem so.    Why, have you seen
                  them?

       Brody hesitates and then shakes his head "no".

                                                              81.


                           BRODY
                 You talk to Clyde about this?

                           EVELYN
                 All the Rangers are on the lookout.
                 Family's even offering up a reward.

                              BRODY
                     (Beat)
                 How much?

                              EVELYN
                 Pardon?

                           BRODY
                 How much they offering?

                           EVELYN
                 Don't exactly know.     I'm guessing it's
                 a fair amount.

                           BRODY
                 Well, me and Lonnie will keep a
                 lookout for you too. Anything we can
                 do to help.

      Evelyn begins walking off.

                           LONNIE
                 You change you mind, I'll ride you
                 raw.

      Evelyn ignores Lonnie, moves on her way.

                           LONNIE
                 It'd be the best fifteen seconds of
                 your life, darling!

      Brody watches her go.      As she disappears, he grabs his gun.

100   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - DAY                                     100

      Clyde comes up to Ida. She stands over a bar-b-q pit, just
      your run-of-the-ordinary backyard variety ones.

                           CLYDE
                 Noose is starting to tighten, Ida.

      ANGLE ON - A GLASS JUG OF MOONSHINE

                           IDA
                 No. You promised. You promised, this
                 time, would be the time. I want that
                 baby. You promised.

              SHOOTING SCRIPT         OCTOBER 17, 2006         82.


      Ida flips open a silver lighter, SPARKS up a flame. She
      touches the flame to a piece of kindling, drops it into the
      bar-b-q.

      A FIRE ROARS TO LIFE.

                           CLYDE
                 We're gonna have to double our
                 efforts, here.

                           IDA
                 Leave that to me.

      Ida lifts THREE IRON BRANDS from a long leather bag.   She
      places the heads of the brands into the bar-b-q.

101   OMIT (SCENE HAS BEEN MOVED. NOW SCENE # 99A)                 101

102   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY                                 102

      Sheryl sits alone, tied, gagged and confined to a chair on
      the far end of the room.

      CLOSE ON - Behind Sheryl's back. Her bloody hands, sans one
      finger, tremble softly. Her remaining digits start to LOOSEN
      her restraints.

103   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2 - DAY                                 103

      Mike hangs, once again. Clyde stands before him, Ida enters.
      She wheels the bar-b-q in the room.

      IN THE PIT - It's filled with hot, smoking coals. Also,
      THREE IRON BRANDS rest buried in the coals. All glow a FIERY
      ORANGE.

                           CLYDE
                 I think we have to have another... man
                 to man discussion, here, Michael.

      But unlike previous moments, Mike is not begging or pleading.
      He holds a calm demeanor.

                           CLYDE
                 Seems as though, time is now factoring
                 into our situation.

104   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1                                       104

      Sheryl continues working the ropes, as... THE DOOR CREAKS
      OPEN. Sheryl freezes, stops working the ropes.

      Deacon enters, sickle in hand. He's calm and determined.      He
      stares at Sheryl. Sinister thoughts in mind.

                                                              83.


      QUICK CUTS DEACON'S POV: Sheryl's mouth/ chest/ legs.

      Deacon approaches Sheryl, kneels down in front of her. He
      LAYS THE SICKLE ON THE FLOOR. Sheryl eyes the weapon.

      Deacon takes something from his pocket, lifts his arms up
      towards Sheryl's head.

      She winces, expecting the worst.

      Deacon slides Sheryl's locket around her neck.     The chain
      repaired. Deacon beams with pride.

      Deacon shifts her skirt exposing more skin and places his
      hands on Sheryl's bare thighs. She twitches instinctively
      causing Deacon to squeeze her thighs TIGHTER.

      Sheryl winces in pain, stops her struggle. Locks EYES with
      Deacon. Suddenly, an aura of CALM falls over her.

      BEHIND SHERYL'S BACK... She resumes untying the knots.

      Deacon savors every moment of Sheryl. Her smell, form. He
      glides his hands up her body, past her stomach and onto her
      breasts. He GROPES them, in his own heaven.

      CLOSE ON - The knot loosens... almost there.

105   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2 - DAY                                   105

      Ida ROTATES the brands in the bar-b-q, doing her best subtle
      intimidation.

                           CLYDE
                 We're not violent people, Michael.    It
                 pains us to pain you.

                            MIKE
                 I don't know... Seems as though
                 Deacon and yourselves get a real kick
                 out of it.

                           CLYDE
                 Now see, this is what I am talking
                 about. It's your attitude. It's the
                 disobedience, the cussing...Sooner we
                 get what we want, then no further harm
                 has to fall upon you and your wife.

                           MIKE
                 Way I see it, you need us alive. You
                 need us, period. And now that Park
                 Services and State Police are looking
                 for us, you're starting to panic,
                           (MORE)

                                                                84.

                           MIKE (cont'd)
                 knowing your whole plan's crumbling
                 down before your eyes.
                     (To Ida STRONG)
                 So you can stop spinning those fucking
                 irons thinking you're scaring me,
                 cause you're not.
                     (Beat; to both of them)
                 You're a couple of demented, sick,
                 pathetic freaks.

      Ida grabs a brand, JABS IT ONTO MIKE'S CHEST.

      MIKE SCREAMS. THE BRAND BURNS INTO HIS FLESH.     HIS EYES
      BULGE. HE VOMITS.

106   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - IDA'S CABIN                          106

      Deacon TEARS open Sheryl's blouse, exposing her bra and more
      cleavage. He slides his hands over her breasts... he's in
      heaven. Sheryl doesn't resist because...

      CLOSE ON - The knot's undone.   Her hands are free.

      Deacon looks into Sheryl's eyes.    He senses something
      different. Does he know?

      Deacon pulls himself closer to Sheryl. Their faces only
      inches apart. He PULLS her gag out of her mouth, lets it
      dangle around her neck. Sheryl swallows nervously. Resists
      the urge to scream. She's frozen. Then... Deacon leans
      in... KISSES SHERYL.

      Knowing it's now or never, Sheryl KNEES DEACON IN THE BALLS.
      He falls over in agony.

      Deacon looks up at her, when... SMACK! She KICKS him right
      in the face. Sheryl springs from the chair, grabs the
      sickle, turns and...

      CRACK! Deacon, already back on his feet, PUNCHES Sheryl hard
      across the jaw. She hits the wall, then falls to the floor,
      drops the sickle.

      ANGLE ON - A SMALL POCKET KNIFE falls off a shelf in the room
      onto the floor.

      Deacon grabs the sickle, then lifts her up BY HER HAIR and
      drags her across the room.

      He throws her face/stomach down on the table top, flips her
      dress up onto her back. He slides the sickle between her ass
      and underwear and... CUTS HER PANTIES OFF IN ONE QUICK
      MOTION, SPREADS HER LEGS APART.

              SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006         85.


      Sheryl, still stunned from the punch, only now starts to
      realize what is happening to her.

                             SHERYL
                       (Weak, soft)
                 No.

      She tries to wiggle off table or close her legs, but Deacon's
      too strong. He grabs the back of her head, SLAMS it against
      the table, pinning it in place. With the other hand, HE
      SLIDES OFF HIS PANTS.

                             SHERYL
                       (Stronger)
                 No!

107   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2 - IDA'S CABIN                        107

      Mike, his chest scarred, bloody, from the fresh wound,
      dangles helplessly. Vomit splashed down his body.

      Clyde and Ida look to one another...

                           CLYDE
                 What was that?

108   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY                                108

      Deacon slaps his left hand over her mouth, climbs on top of
      Sheryl using his weight to keep her in place. Deacon
      positions himself for penetration, when...

      Sheryl SCREAMS, but Deacon's hand muffles the cries.

      With every ounce of strength left inside her, SHERYL BITES
      DOWN ON DEACON'S HAND. He SCREAMS, falling off of her.

      CLOSE ON DEACON'S HAND - blood oozes, a large piece looks
      ripped out.

      Sheryl SPITS the small chunk of his hand out of her mouth.

      Deacon grabs the SICKLE/AXE, starts towards Sheryl...

      At the top of her lungs, SHERYL LETS LOOSE A BLOOD CURDLING
      SCREAM! And...

      Ida bursts in the room...

                            IDA
                 Deacon!   Stop right there!

      Deacon turns to Ida, stops his attack on Sheryl.

                                                              86.


                            IDA
                 Out!   Get out!

      Deacon slinks away. Sheryl curls up in a ball, emotions
      consume her. She breaks down.

109   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - SUNSET                                 109

      The Sun sinks on the horizon...

110   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1                                      110

      Sheryl's tied, once again, to the table. Mike tied to a
      chair, which is dragged into the room by Clyde.

      Sheryl sees Mike's burned chest.

                           CLYDE
                 This is getting out of hand, y'all.
                 Nobody wanted what just almost
                 happened to Sheryl to happen. But,
                 you keep dragging this thing out...
                 things are gonna... happen.

                           IDA
                 I sent Deacon away for a bit. He
                 knows he done wrong. You say right
                 now that you are ready to perform your
                 marital duties, then I'll keep him
                 away.

                           MIKE
                 Have you ever thought that God doesn't
                 want you to have a child? That's why
                 he fucking kills them before they're
                 born. Because you're fucking insane
                 monsters that don't deserve a child.

      Ida SLAPS Mike.

                           IDA
                 You take that back!

                               MIKE
                 No.

                           IDA
                 Take it back.

      Ida digs her hand into Mike's bear trap wound, squeezes.    But
      Mike doesn't scream or squirm. He endures the pain.

                                                       87.


                    MIKE
          Go ahead and torture me. There's
          absolutely no way I would ever give a
          child of mine to you.

                    IDA
          How very brave. Fine. I won't
          torture you.
              (Looks to Sheryl)
          I'll torture her. I can bring back
          Deacon. Let him have her. Plenty of
          other holes he can go into where a
          baby can't be made.

Ida grabs a nearby knife, walks up to Sheryl.

                     IDA
          Or maybe we can just start dicing.
          All we need is a healthy heart, brain
          and uterus. She don't need the rest
          of her fingers, or toes... or her
          nose, ears. I could carve out her eye
          right now.

Ida places the knife on top of Sheryl's cheek, just below the
eye. The tip just centimeters away from the eyeball.

                    MIKE
          No!

Ida takes the knife away, gets in Mike's face...

                    IDA
          Then you will give me my baby. My
          child, born in wedlock, saved from its
          sinner parents and raised to fear God
          and give him praise.

Sheryl starts LAUGHING. Inappropriate, but nonetheless,
She's cracking up. Has she finally cracked?

                     SHERYL
          That's why you married us? So we
          could conceive our child in wedlock?
          The fucking joke's on you... I'm
          already pregnant. Eight weeks
          yesterday.

Clyde and Ida stare disbelievingly at Sheryl.

                    IDA
          You're lying.

Mike stares in shock at Sheryl.

                                                                  88.


      In that look, Ida knows Sheryl's telling the truth.

                           SHERYL
                 I was trying to find the right time to
                 tell you.

      TEARS fill both their eyes.

                           IDA
                 No, no, no, no!    This can't be.   NO!

      Clyde grabs hold of Ida, tries to calm her down.        When...

      OFF SCREEN: A GLASS BREAKS.    It came from upstairs.

      IDA AND CLYDE SPRING INTO ACTION.     They exit the room, BOLT
      THE DOOR LOCKED.

      MIKE'S POV - THE POCKET KNIFE still on the floor.

111   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                                        111

      Brody and Lonnie stand on the porch.      Brody holds a shotgun,
      Lonnie a rifle.

      Brody reaches inside the broken window, unlocks it.

                           LONNIE
                 We shouldn't just go in.      Ain't right.

      Brody slides open the window.

                           BRODY
                 I'm going in. You don't want to, then
                 don't. Check round back or something.

      Brody climbs inside.     Lonnie heads around the back.

112   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1                                            112

      Mike ROCKS his chair back and forth, building momentum...
      Finally, the CHAIR tips over.

      He uses his feet to push himself along.      Heading for THE
      POCKETKNIFE.

113   INT.   MAIN ROOM - IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                            113

      Brody moves through cabin, shotgun ready.      All's calm, quiet.

114   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                                        114

      Lonnie walks in the back yard...    Nothing here, except.

      ON THE GROUND - Lonnie steps on patch of ground that's
      different than the rest.

      Lonnie peers curiously at the ground.     What's he found?

115   INT.   SEWING ROOM, IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                        115

      Brody enters... the Trap Door in the floor is open.      He
      peers inside, then proceeds down.

116   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                                     116

      Lonnie bends down, finds a handle. Lifts, REVEAL, A HIDDEN
      TRAP DOOR ENTRANCE. Lonnie peers inside...

      LONNIE'S POV - A dark staircase leads down.    At the bottom, a
      wooden door, which is closed.

                               LONNIE
                 Hello?

117   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1                                         117

      Mike hears this...

                             MIKE
                 Help!    Down here!

118   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                                     118

      Lonnie takes a step down, when...

      CLYDE APPEARS, BURIES AN AX INTO LONNIE'S HEAD.      LONNIE FALLS
      INTO THE HOLE AND DOWN THE STAIRS!

      His body crashes through the closed wooden door, into the
      hallway.

119   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1                                         119

      MIKE'S POV - UNDER THE GAP BETWEEN THE FLOOR AND DOOR,
      Lonnie's body lands. Eyes stare at Mike.

120   INT.   CHAPEL                                                  120

      Brody stares at the FETUS JARS, "WHAT THE FUCK?"

      THE IRON DOOR SWINGS OPEN... IDA, SHOTGUN IN HAND, BLASTS
      BRODY IN THE CHEST. BLOOD FLIES ACROSS THE WALLS.

121   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                                     121

      The MOON hides behind some dark clouds.

122   EXT.   WOODS BEHIND IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                   122

      A giant pile of dirt. The dead body of Brody sits inside the
      makeshift grave. Ida pushes Lonnie's carcass in next.

      Clyde watches Ida, concern in his eyes.

                            CLYDE
                 Ida...   you know what we have to do?

                           IDA
                     (Already anticipating)
                 No. I can give her an abortion. Get
                 rid of the bastard child, make them
                 conceive one in wedlock. And then we
                 are right as rain.

                             CLYDE
                 Abortion?    No. That we won't do.

                           IDA
                 It'll work. Ain't no sin to abort a
                 demon.

                             CLYDE
                 Ida, writings on the wall here.
                 Michael's right. With a reward on the
                 table, do you think Brody and Lonnie
                 will be the only two coming? Gonna
                 have lots people looking for these
                 two.
                      (Beat)
                 We're gonna have to make it so no one
                 can ever find them.

                             IDA
                 No.

      Ida and Clyde.   A sadness covers their faces, especially Ida.

                           CLYDE
                 We'll find another couple, Ida.

                           IDA
                 No. You promised me, Clyde, this time
                 was the one.

                           CLYDE
                 It's too dangerous. We'll find
                 another couple. A better one.

                           IDA
                     (Long beat)
                 It's not fair.

                                                                91.


      Clyde nods.   They hug.

      A CRACKLE OF LIGHTNING followed by a ROLL OF THUNDER.

                           CLYDE
                 I'll do what needs to be done. You
                 finish up here... And watch your
                 time, rain's coming.

      Clyde hands her the shovel.      Ida nods, tosses a pile of dirt
      into the grave.

123   INT.   HALLWAY - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT - NIGHT                  123

      Clyde walks down the hall, loads Ida's shotgun with a couple
      fresh shells.

      He unlocks, then pushes open the door to Torture Room #1.

124   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT                                 124

      Mike sits in the chair, exactly where he and Ida left him.
      Mike's head sags, he appears to be sleeping.

      Sheryl lies on the table, out cold.

      Clyde levels the shotgun to Mike's head.     But something odd
      catches Clyde's attention...

      ON THE FLOOR - Behind Mike's chair, some rope shavings,
      pieces.

                           CLYDE
                 What the...?

      Mike SPRINGS TO LIFE, GRABS CLYDE PULLS HIM IN.

      As Clyde falls into Mike's body.     The SHOTGUN FIRES
      HARMLESSLY INTO THE GROUND.

      Mike swings his hand around, PLUNGES the pocket knife into
      Clyde's neck!

      Clyde SCREAMS. The knife embedded in his neck.         He throws
      his hands to it, stumbles backwards and falls.

      Clyde tries to speak, but it comes out GURGLING and BLOODY.

                           MIKE
                 Believe me, I understand your extreme
                 situation, but... Punishment's going
                 to have to be handed down.

               SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006         92.


       Mike aims the shotgun at Clyde and... BOOM! The blast takes
       half of Clyde's head and neck apart. Mike stares at Clyde's
       body.

                              MIKE
                  One down.

125    EXT.   WOODS BEHIND IDA'S CABIN- NIGHT                      125

       THE RAIN STARTS...

       Ida stops, she heard the two shots. The deed done.   She
       grabs her shovel, walks back towards the cabin.

125A   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT                             125A

       ANGLE ON - The open shotgun as Mike takes out the two empty
       shells.

       Mike, now next to Clyde, feels Clyde's pockets for more
       shells, but there are none.

                              MIKE
                  Fuck.

                            SHERYL
                  What is it?

                            MIKE
                  No more ammo.

       Mike glances around the room, then spies... THE KNIFE he
       stabbed CLYDE with. He picks it up off the floor.

       OFF SCREEN: In the distance, the IRON DOOR CREAKS OPEN.

       OFF SHERYL AND MIKE'S LOOK, WE...

                                                             CUT TO:

126    INT.   HALLWAY - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT - NIGHT               126

       Ida approaches the room, pushes open the door.

127    INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT                              127

       IDA'S POV - The room is empty.   Except for...

       ANGLE ON - Clyde's dead body.

                              IDA
                  NO!

       SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006          93.


Ida drops by his side, cradles his body. The love of her
life is gone. Before she know what's happening, she turns...

MIKE, knife in hand, EXPLODES FROM TORTURE ROOM #2, RUNS
STRAIGHT FOR IDA, but...

Ida SWINGS THE SHOVEL, KNOCKS MIKE'S LEGS OUT FROM UNDER HIM.
He trips and falls to the floor.

Ida gets up, STOMPS DOWN ON MIKE'S HAND.   The knife drops.

FROM THE HALLWAY... Sheryl looks out, watches as...

BACK IN THE ROOM...   Ida grabs the knife, PLUNGES it deep
into Mike's calf.

                     IDA
           In for a penny, in for a pound. I
           can't save your soul now, Michael. I
           tried. I gave you a way to cleanse
           yourself of all your sins and deliver
           you to heaven... and how do you repay
           me?

Ida takes the knife, DAGGERS IT INTO MIKE'S THIGH.

                     IDA
           BY KILLING MY CLYDE?!?

SHERYL--

Spots the shovel on the floor, grabs it...

                     IDA
           There is no soul blacker than yours.
           And now, by the grace of God, I must
           deliver you to Satan myself.

Ida retracts the blade, pulls herself on top of Mike.   Ready
to stab again, when...

SHERYL SLAMS THE SHOVEL OVER IDA'S HEAD.

ANGLE ON - THE SHOVEL BLADE sprayed with blood.

Ida falls over.   Sheryl and Mike stare at her lifeless body.

Sheryl steps over Ida's legs. She takes a big step, clears
Ida's upper body...and stumbles.

Sheryl goes to Mike, wraps his arm around her, lifts him up.
But just as his foot touches the ground... A SURGE OF PAIN
CRIPPLES HIM. Mike falls back to the ground.

              SHOOTING SCRIPT                OCTOBER 17, 2006      94.


                           MIKE
                 I can't make it.

                           SHERYL
                 I'm not leaving you.

                           MIKE
                     (Thinks)
                 Clyde's walkie-talkie. It's probably
                 upstairs. Find it. Call the Ranger
                 base.
                     (Remembers)
                 My gun. See if you can find our
                 stuff. My gun's in my backpack, side
                 pocket.

                           SHERYL
                 What good's the gun?        You tossed away
                 the bullets.

      Mike turns away.   Guilt etched on his face.

                           MIKE
                 There's another box of ammo.

                              SHERYL
                 Mike...!?!

                           MIKE
                 Let's get out of this alive first,
                 then you can bitch me out, okay?

      Sheryl concedes.   She goes to the ladder, stops... turns.

      Mike looks at her.   They stare at one another.

                           MIKE
                 It's okay, baby.      Go.

      Sheryl turns, ascends the ladder.

128   INT.   MAIN ROOM - IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                        128

      Sheryl exits the sewing room, enters...

129   INT.   CLYDE AND IDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                        129

      Sheryl searches the bedroom for the walkie-talkie.

      A FLASH OF LIGHTNING, illuminates... In the window, Deacon
      appears.

      Sheryl doesn't see Deacon.       She FINDS the walkie-talkie...

                                                              95.


                            SHERYL
                      (Pushes button)
                  Hello? Come in, please.      We need
                  help. Is anyone there?

                                                          INTERCUT WITH:

130   I/E    RANGER BASE STATION - NIGHT                              130

      RAIN beats against the windows, pounds the roof. Evelyn,
      with poncho, stands outside, just locking the door, when...

                            SHERYL (V.O.)
                  Please, someone? Is anyone there that
                  can help?

      SHERYL... Lowers the walkie, waits for an answer.

      EVELYN... stops. She heard something, but not sure exactly
      what. She re-enters, heads over to the CB. Just as she
      picks up the CB Mic...

      DEACON, dripping wet, appears in doorway, lunges for Sheryl.

      Sheryl screams, drops walk-talkie, as Deacon tackles her onto
      the bed. The WALKIE-TALKIE BREAKS into pieces.

      EVELYN... Pushes the "talk button" on the CB...

                            EVELYN
                  This is Ranger Base, Go again?

      SHERYL AND DEACON... The headboard SLAMS against the wall,
      causing a Crucifix to dislodge off a nail and fall onto the
      pillow by Sheryl's head.

131   INT.    HALLWAY - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT                          131

      Mike hears Sheryl scream, realizes it must be Deacon.      He
      lifts himself up using the wall as balance.

132   INT.    CLYDE AND IDA'S BEDROOM                                 132

      Deacon strangles Sheryl with one hand.

      Sheryl's eyes BULGE out of her head, her face BEET RED.

      Deacon raises the sickle/axe into the air with the other.

      Sheryl's hand finds the Crucifix and JABS IT INTO DEACON'S
      JAW. Deacon grabs for the cross, lets go of Sheryl rolls off
      her, the bed and collapses to the floor.

                                                              96.


      Sheryl coughs, struggles for some air.      She climbs off the
      bed, runs out of the room.

133   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2                                          133

      Mike enters, scours for a weapon.     Finds a MACHETE.

134   INT.   CLYDE AND IDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                          134

      Deacon YANKS the Crucifix from his jaw.      BLOOD SQUIRTS, POURS
      from the wound.

135   INT.   SEWING ROOM, CABIN - NIGHT                               135

      Sheryl runs in, screams down the trap door hole...

                               SHERYL
                 Mike!

136   INT.   HALLWAY/ TORTURE ROOM - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT             136

      Mike exits room, passes Ida's lifeless body.     Trudges down
      the hall. Each step painful.

137   INT.   SEWING ROOM, CABIN - NIGHT                               137

      Deacon enters. One hand covers his wound, the other holds
      the sickle/axe.

      Sheryl grabs a candlestick, uses it to defend herself.

      Deacon swipes at her, but misses.

      Sheryl cracks him across jaw with candlestick... he falls,
      but GRABS ONTO SHERYL...

      THEY BOTH FALL UNCONTROLLABLY DOWN THE TRAP DOOR STEPS,
      into...

138   INT.   CHAPEL                                                   138

      Sheryl and Deacon TUMBLE, CRASH into shelf wall with the
      fetus jars. They wobble, shake, then...

      THE ENTIRE SHELF WALL CRASHES ON TOP OF SHERYL AND DEACON.

      The FETUS JARS BREAK, SPILL OUT EVERYWHERE.

      The shelf wall BLOCKS the Iron Door from opening.

139   INT.   HALLWAY - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT                           139

      Mike looks up, hears the commotion.      It only quickens his
      pace.

                                                                  97.


                            MIKE
                 Sheryl!

      A path of blood left in Mike's wake.

140   INT.   CHAPEL                                                 140

      Sheryl shakes the cobwebs free, opens her eyes, moves her
      head slightly, just as...

      SLAM. THE SICKLE BLADE SLAMS INTO THE WOODEN FLOOR AN INCH
      AWAY FROM SHERYL'S HEAD.

      Sheryl scrambles to her feet, when...

      SQUISH. HER FOOT STEPS DOWN ON TOP OF THE SMALLEST FETUS.
      PUSS AND MUCUS OOZE OUT.

      Deacon tries to push the shelf off him.   It's heavy.   It
      moves a little.

      Sheryl limps up the trap door steps.

141   INT.   HALLWAY - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT                         141

      Mike pushes up against the Iron Door, but it doesn't move.
      The shelf wall blocks it.

142   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                                    142

      Sheryl races from the cabin.   RAIN POURING DOWN ON HER.     She
      spies...

      ANGLE ON - Moonshine jar, a lighter.    The ones Ida used
      earlier.

143   INT.   CHAPEL                                                 143

      Deacon pushes the shelves again, this time success.     He gets
      to his feet, grabs his weapon.

144   INT.   HALLWAY - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT                         144

      Mike, with every ounce of strength left, PUSHES at the iron
      door. It budges, just a little. He PUSHES again and,
      finally, THE DOOR OPENS! Mike scrambles into the Chapel.

145   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                                    145

      Deacon exits the cabin, steps off the porch. He peers into
      the rain and the darkness of the woods surrounding the cabin.
      No Sheryl anywhere.

                             SHERYL (O.S.)
                 Hey!

      Deacon turns, looks up...

      ON THE PORCH ROOF...

      Sheryl, a fresh tear in her dress, holds the SILVER LIGHTER
      in one hand, the moonshine jar in the other. The Moonshine
      jar has a torn length of her dress sticking out, a homemade
      Molotov Cocktail. She glares down at Deacon, lights the
      cocktail...

                           SHERYL
                 Burn in hell you sonofabitch!

      She drops it...

      THE COCKTAIL HITS. THE FLAMES CONSUME DEACON, SPREAD QUICKLY
      OVER HIS ENTIRE BODY.

      Deacon flails wildly, trying to put out the flames, stumbles
      forward, runs off towards the forest. He trips and falls
      just as he enters.

      SHERYL... the rain pouring down, stares at...

      ANGLE ON - DEACON'S BURNING CORPSE lays in the thick brush.

148   INT.   MAIN ROOM - IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                     148

      Sheryl enters... Mike limps to her. He drops the machete,
      collapses in her arms. They hug tightly.

149   INT.   CHAPEL                                              149

      ANGLE ON - A BLOODY HAND grabs a POKER from the fireplace.

150   INT.   MAIN ROOM - IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                     150

      Mike looks, across the room...

      IN THE MIRROR'S REFLECTION - IDA, THE BLOODY MESS THAT SHE
      IS, STEPS FROM THE SHADOWS, AN IRON FIRE POKER in her hands.

      Mike pushes Sheryl to the couch, safely away just as...   IDA
      STABS MIKE IN THE STOMACH WITH THE POKER.

      SHERYL SCREAMS. SHE RUNS TOWARDS IDA, SICKLE/AXE IN TOW...
      SHE SWINGS THE BLADE... IT SLICES THROUGH THE AIR, AND...

       SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006          99.


ANGLE ON - IDA'S HEAD, SEVERED AT THE NECK, HITS THE FLOOR,
ROLLS TO A STOP.

Sheryl turns away from Ida, runs to Mike's side.

Mike's a bloody mess, his life slips from him by the second.

Sheryl TEARS Mike's shirt, BLOOD POURS from his stomach.     She
finds the wound, but has nothing to stop the blood.

                    SHERYL
          You did it, baby. You saved me. You
          said you would and you did. Stay with
          me, Mike. Stay with me.

                    MIKE
              (Barely audible)
          Love you.

                    SHERYL
          Well, if you love me... Fight.    Please
          baby, fight.

She looks around wildly, spying...   A wardrobe by the
kitchen.

                    SHERYL
          I'll be back in a second, Mike.

Sheryl jumps up, races for the wardrobe.

INSIDE THE WARDROBE--

On a shelf are some towels, linens, etc.

Sheryl grabs the towels, but as she does.   She sees, on the
floor of the wardrobe... HER BACKPACK.

Sheryl quickly rummages through her backpack. She finds...
her CELLPHONE. The fliers with the emergency contact info.

                                                     JUMP CUT TO:

Sheryl drops down by Mike's side. She leans in, listens for
breath sounds, feels for his pulse, finds one. Very weak,
but it's there.

                    SHERYL
          Don't you even fucking think about
          leaving me alone.

She PRESSES THE TOWEL against his stomach wound, all the
while the phone's pressed between her ear and shoulder.

       The "NO SIGNAL" TONE chimes in her ear.

                            SHERYL
                  Shit.
                      (To Mike)
                  Come on, baby. Fight.

       Sheryl re-dials, only to get another NO SIGNAL TONE.

                            SHERYL
                  Oh please God.

       Sheryl raises the phone into the air.

       ON THE SCREEN - ONE SINGLE BAR POPS ON.

       Sheryl hits RE-DIAL.

       ON THE SCREEN - DIALING... DIALING... DIALING... CONNECTED.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

150A   OMIT                                                      150A

151    EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                                 151

       The RAIN has STOPPED. A couple of RANGERS along with a
       PARAMEDIC UNIT surround the scene.

       SHERYL... sits, completely still, a PARAMEDIC works on her
       cuts and hand. She watches as...

       THE OTHER PARAMEDICS load a gurney into the back of the
       Ambulance. A sheet covers the body. Mike's body. Once
       inside, the Ambulance's doors close.

       Sheryl watches the Ambulance pull away. She places her hand
       on her stomach. It's just the two of them now.

       EVELYN... steps from the midst of the activity, up to Sheryl.
       She leads her away from the ambulance, towards the Ranger
       truck.

                            EVELYN
                  Called your folks. There gunna meet
                  us at the hospital. Be a while since
                  they're coming in from D.C.

       The words go straight through Sheryl.   No reaction.

                                                              101.


                           EVELYN
                 Sorry, but I just have to ask... You
                 told the Sheriff there was someone in
                 on this whole thing with Clyde and
                 Ida. Big fella, scars all over him?
                     (No response)
                 Mame?

      Sheryl's eyes meet Evelyn's. She nods about to continue on,
      until she notices Evelyn's demeanor.

                            SHERYL
                 Why?   What is it?

                           EVELYN
                     (Changing topics)
                 You've had an exhausting night, why
                 don't you...

                           SHERYL
                     (Hard, cold)
                 What is it?

                           EVELYN
                 We didn't find anybody like that in
                 the yard or the house.

                           SHERYL
                     (Concern growing)
                 No. It's not possible.

      She turns, looks around, but spies nothing...

                              EVELYN
                 Calm down.     It's gunna be alright...

                           SHERYL
                 Fuck you it's gonna be alright.

      Sheryl turns to the woods, holds her look.     As if she
      knows...

152   EXT.   WOODS NEAR THE CABIN - NIGHT                          152

      In the distance... past the trees, deep into the woods.

      COME TO A REST OVER THE SHOULDER OF DEACON. Very much alive.
      He stares at the cabin for a beat, then CROSSES out of frame.

                                                           CUT TO BLACK.

                                                              FADE OUT.

         1     EXT.   DESERT VALLEY - DAY                                   1

               The high desert -- absolutely silent -- a vast, hard land-
               scape stretching away to distant mountains.  The silence is
               broken by hoof-beats.


         2     EXT.  EDGAR'S PLACE - DAY                                    2

               It's a simple cabin dwarfed by a big, ramshackle barn.  EDGAR
               DEEMS (60s), a weathered desert rat of a hermit, is walking
               his donkey around in circles.

               Now, rattling toward them down an endless dirt road, comes an
               old, sun-bleached Buick.  It stops and out leans OLD FRED
               (70s) wearing a sweat-stained fedora.  The two friends nod.

                                          OLD FRED
                            How's she doing?

                                          EDGAR
                            She wants to lay down.  I'm a
                            little worried.

               Old Fred climbs out with a bushel basket of carrots.

                                          OLD FRED
                            Well, I brung her something I know
                            she likes.

                                          EDGAR
                            Damn, Fred, you can't give away all
                            those.

                                          OLD FRED
                            Forget it.  I got vegetables coming
                            out my ears.  Usually the varmints
                            eat up half my crop, but lately I
                            ain't so much as seen a gopher or a
                            jack-rabbit nowheres.

                                          EDGAR
                            If that ain't the truth.  And I
                            count on them for a little bit of
                            stew meat...Thank you, Fred.

               Edgar takes the carrots and feeds one to the donkey.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            Here you go, Justine.  Look what
                            Fred brought you.

                                          OLD FRED
                            We playing cards tonight?

                                          EDGAR
                            I think I'm gonna be sitting up
                            with her.

                                          OLD FRED
                            I'd do the same.  Well, catch you
                            Thursday.

                                          EDGAR
                            You bet.

               The men nod, and Old Fred drives off.

               CLOSE-UP of the donkey's hooves thumping along as Edgar leads
               her to the barn.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            Let's get you out of the sun for a
                            spell.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            I'll get you some fresh water.

               But, suddenly, we hear the donkey restlessly stomping its
               hooves and braying.  Edgar turns, concerned.  Now we hear an
               odd sound.  Distant thunder?  The wind?  The donkey gets more
               and more frantic.

               The barn shudders violently.  Frightened birds explode from
               the eaves.  Dust puffs from every old seam.  Roof shingles
               rain down.  Edgar stares in amazement.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            ...some kind of earthquake!?

               Then another sound -- the donkey starts screeching in wild
               panic.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            Justine, hang on! I'm coming!

               Edgar races back to the barn and flings open the doors.


         3     INT.  EDGAR'S BARN - DAY                                     3

               Dust swirls through the air.  But -- the barn in empty.  No
               donkey.  Now Edgar is hit by a ghastly stench.  He staggers
               back, and covers his nose with a handkerchief.  Then he sees,
               splattered across the walls -- blood!

                                          EDGAR
                            What in the name of Jehovah...?

               He raises his arms above the door frame.  When he lowers them
               he's holding a 12 gauge shotgun.  He races outside, ready to
               shoot, but there's nothing -- as far as the eye can see.


         4     EXT.  CLIFFS - DAWN                                          4

               The sun lights up spectacular sheer cliffs which plunge 1000
               feet from a ruggedly beautiful high-desert plateau.  At the
               top of the cliffs, silhouetted against the dawn, a lone cow-
               boy seems to gaze in deep contemplation at the sunrise.  As
               we MOVE IN, we realize he's actually peeing over the cliff.

               This is VALENTINE MCKEE (25).  Smart and good looking, Val
               has nevertheless managed to underachieve brilliantly.  He
               coasts through life, following the path of least resistance
               -- which has brought him to this dubious rustic existence on
               the edge of civilization.  But lately he's beginning to
               wonder why he hasn't accomplished more in his 25 years.

               As a few sleepy cows gaze at him, sleepy Val shuffles over to
               his battered old pickup truck.  A hand-painted sign on the
               door reads: "V & E -- All Type's of Job's."  Indeed, the
               pick-up bed is jumbled with tools and supplies for every
               conceivable odd job -- and the noisily snoring form of his
               partner huddled in a dirty sleeping bag.  Val raps on the
               side of the truck.

                                          VAL
                                   (softly)
                            Good morning, Mr. Bassett, this is
                            your wake-up call.  Please move
                            your fat ass.

               No response from the sleeping bag.  Val stares at the cows
               chewing their cud -- and perks up as he gets an idea.  He
               gently steps onto the truck's running board, then suddenly
               starts jumping up and down as hard as he can, rocking the
               truck violently.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            STAMPEDE!  EARL, GET OUT OF THE
                            WAY!

               The sleeping bag tries to get up and run for it.  It tumbles
               out of the back of the pickup.  While Val laughs uproar-
               iously, EARL BASSET (43) claws his way out of the bag, looks
               around wildly, and finds himself staring at three motionless
               cows.

                                          EARL
                            You dumb shit.

               Earl is a good-ol' boy who has lived his life just like Val,
               drifting from job to job.  He knows why he hasn't accom-
               plished anything, and often tries to impart his hard-won
               wisdom to Val, but the last thing the younger man wants is
               advice.

               Earl stretches.  The men begin a silent ritual:  Earl gropes
               through his pockets for a cigarette, but only finds a
               lighter.  Meanwhile, Val digs in his pockets, coming up with
               cigarettes, but no lighter.  Typical of these two, each guy
               always has half of what he needs.  Eventually they sort it
               out,  trading the necessary implements.

               Earl reaches for a coffee-pot on a battered Coleman stove on
               the tailgate.  But it's cold.

                                          EARL
                            You didn't cook breakfast?

                                          VAL
                            Did it yesterday.  Franks and
                            beans.

                                          EARL
                                   (tries to recall)
                            No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.

                                          VAL
                            Hell you did.  Your turn.

               Earl raises his fist.  This is The Challenge, and it instantly
               triggers the partners' conflict-resolution technique.  They
               solve all disputes using the children's game of "scissors,
               rock, paper."  Earl raises his fist in response.  The game is
               played swiftly and silently -- one, two, three.  On three,
               Val mimes "paper" (open hand.  Earl mimes "scissors" (two
               extended fingers).  Scissors cuts paper.  Val has lost.  He
               shrugs and starts pumping up the stove fuel tank.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Well, when I'm your age I'll
                            probably forget what I eat, too.


         4A    EXT.  DESERT VALLEY - FENCE - DAY                          4A

               Val and Earl are restringing a dilapidated, and seemingly
               endless, barbed wire fence.  A few bored cows watch them.

                                          VAL
                            How many cows does it take to make
                            a stampede?  Is it like three or
                            more?  Is there a minimum speed?

                                          EARL
                                   (shakes his head)
                            I was in one.  A bolt of lightning
                            blew up cottonwood tree.  Three
                            hundred head going hell-bent for
                            the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny,
                            I can  tell you.

               Earl's hand slips and the fence snags him right through his
               thick glove.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Ow!  God damn!  Is this a job for
                            intelligent men?!

                                          VAL
                            If there was one nearby I'd
                            probably ask him.

                                          EARL
                            I keep thinking, if we were but
                            half serious about money, we should
                            quit being hired hands and...

                                          VAL
                                   (mock serious)
                            Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.

                                          EARL
                            Whatever the hell we are, we should
                            quit and go get ourselves some real
                            employment.

               Val gestures to the vastness around them.

                                          VAL
                            What, and give up all this personal
                            freedom?


         5     EXT.  JEEP TRAIL - DAY                                       5

               Val guides the truck down a tortuous, rocky, almost impas-
               sable trail.  It takes full concentration as he fights the
               steering wheel, shifts, rides the brake and leans out trying
               to pick a decent route.  Earl braces his feet on the dash and
               munches breakfast, a raw hot dog right out of the package.

                                          VAL
                            Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every
                            year.

                                          EARL
                                   (shrugs)
                            Has a lot of rain.

               Earl pulls a box of Hershey bars from under the seat.  There's
               only one bar left.  He sets the box down between them.  Val
               glances at it -- and raises his fist: The Challenge.  One,
               two, three.  Val mimes "paper;" Earl mimes "rock."  Earl
               loses.  Val takes the bar.

                                          EARL
                                   (pointing ahead)
                            You're gonna get us hung up.

                                          VAL
                            Do not talk to the driver.

               THWONK!  The truck lurches to a stop, its frame caught on a
               big rock.  Val glares at Earl.


         6     EXT. DESERT INTERSECTION - PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY               6

               The pick-up turns from a dirt road onto an old paved road.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            What do we have next?


         7     INT.  PICK-UP - MOVING - DAY                                 7

               Earl consults a crumpled list pulled from inside his hat.

                                          EARL
                            Uh...Digging that waterhole for
                            Nestor.

                                          VAL
                            Burt and Heather's place is closer.
                            Let's do their kitchen today.  Do
                            Nestor tomorrow.

                                          EARL
                            Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We
                            don't dig today.  We don't get paid
                            today.  Damn it, Valentine, you
                            never plan ahead.  You never take
                            the long view.  Hell, here it is
                            Monday and I'm already working on
                            Wednesday.
                                   (squints dubiously at
                                    his schedule)
                            It is Monday, right?

               But Val is peering at the desert up ahead.  Off the road a
               ways is a small Toyota pick-up truck and, beside it, a lone
               figure trying to flag them down.

                                          VAL
                            Who the hell's that?  That's not
                            what's his name...the grad student?

                                          EARL
                            Nah, it's September.  Must be the
                            new one.

                                          VAL
                            The new one!  That's supposed to be
                            a girl!

               Earl braces himself, knowing what Val will do.  Val swerves
               the truck wildly off the road, barreling across the desert.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                                   (almost praying)
                            You will have long blonde hair, big
                            green eyes, nice full breasts that
                            stand up and say hello, ass that
                            won't quit.  And legs, legs that go
                            all the way up!

               Earl shakes his head, mildly bemused as they slide to a stop
               in a cloud of dust.


         8     EXT.  DESERT - RHONDA'S TRUCK - DAY                          8

               Val looks out hopefully.  The dust clears.  He sees her --
               RHONDA LeBECK, (25).  Val's eyes do an expert vertical scan:
               short brown hair, small brown eyes, so-so chest, legs hidden
               in baggy dungarees.

               Laden with a portable computer, notebooks, and some
               seismograph printouts, she stares at him through tilted
               glasses.  Her little pick-up truck is loaded with geology
               field equipment.  She shakes Val's hand firmly.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (brightly)
                            Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.
                            I'm up here for the semester...

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, geography.

                                          RHONDA
                            Right, geology.  And you have to be
                            Val and Earl.  I've heard all about
                            you.

                                          EARL
                            We deny everything.

               Rhonda smiles.

                                          RHONDA
                            Listen, got a question for you.  Do
                            you know if anybody is doing any
                            blasting or drilling or anything
                            like that?

                                          VAL
                            Around here?  Why would they?

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, I'm supposed monitor these
                            seismographs.  You know, they
                            measure vibrations...

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, vibrations in the ground.

                                          RHONDA
                            Yeah, well, I'm getting what I
                            refer to scientifically as "weird
                            vibes."  every sensor I've got is
                            giving me strange readings.  I
                            mean, the school has had these
                            machines up here three years and
                            they've never recorded anything
                            like this.

                                          EARL
                            Well, we'll ask around.  Let you
                            know if we hear of anything.

                                          RHONDA
                            Thanks.  God, I hope they're not
                            screwed up.  I might have to bag
                            the whole semester. Anyway, sorry
                            to bother you.

                                          EARL
                            No problem.  Nice meeting you.
                            Hope you get it sorted out.

               Rhonda unhappily turns back to her equipment as Val and Earl
               drive off.


         9     INT.  PICK-UP TRUCK - MOVING - DAY                           9

               Earl glances over at Val with a gleam in his eye.

                                          EARL
                            You know, if you wanted, we could
                            take a look at those seismographs
                            for her.

                                          VAL
                            What the hell do we know about
                            seismographs?

                                          EARL
                            Nothing.  But it sure might be a
                            nice way of getting to know her.

                                          VAL
                            Why?

                                          EARL
                            Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go
                            for any gal unless she fits that
                            damn list of yours A to Z...

                                          VAL
                            Well, sure.

                                          EARL
                            ...And is dumber than my hind end.
                            Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...

               Val flips down the truck's sunvisor.  Tapes to it are snap-
               shots of nearly identical blonde bimbos.  Val points to one.



                                          VAL
                                   (defensively)
                            Tammy Lynn Baxter.

                                          EARL
                            Don't matter.  They're all the
                            same: dead weight.  Can't make a
                            decision, can't walk because of
                            their shoes, can't work because of
                            their fingernails.  Make my skin
                            crawl!

                                          VAL
                            Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.

                                          EARL
                            I thought you called it your
                            pecker.  Look, don't make the
                            mistake I made.  Twenty years of
                            looking for a woman exactly like
                            Miss October 1968, and where'd it
                            get me?  Here with you.

               Val rolls his eyes -- "Give me a break."


         10    EXT.  PERFECTION - ESTABLISH - DAY                           10

               The pick-up rattles toward a tiny, utterly isolated high
               desert hamlet -- a few dozen houses and mobile homes fighting
               for shade in the vast landscape.  Its most prominent feature
               is an aging wood-frame water tower, perhaps 25 feet high,
               near the center of town.  A sign PANS into view --
               "PERFECTION -- Pop. 14."


         11    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 11

               Val and Earl head past the water tower for Pham Van's General
               Store, Perfection's main gossip stop and only business.  The
               store's sign, in English and Vietnamese, reads: "Groceries,
               Haircuts, Post Office, Town Hall, VIDEOS!"  Val and Earl park
               next to a camouflage-painted, large-tired Blazer.

               Just then they spot MELVIN, the town's surly teen-aged pain-
               in-the-ass, coming toward them, mindlessly bouncing a
               basketball off the hoods of parked cars.  As he nears their
               truck:

                                          EARL
                            Melvin, touch that truck and die.

                                          MELVIN
                            Oh, man, I'm really shaking.

               But he steers clear of their truck.


         12    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                               12

               Inside, the energetic Vietnamese owner, PHAM VAN, presides
               over his all-purpose establishment: part general store, part
               barber shop, part saloon.

               At the bar are BURT GUMMER and his wife HEATHER, two no-
               nonsense survivalists who have settled in Perfection to await
               the coming apocalypse -- a nice enough couple, but there's a
               hint of paranoia around the edges.  Burt is shoving a box of
               cartridges across to Pham.

                                          BURT
                            No, Pham, they're not hollow
                            points.  I ordered hollow points
                            and that's what I want.

               When Val and Earl enter, Pham automatically pops the tops on
               two cold beers and has them in place before the cowboys reach
               the bar.  Everyone exchanged nods.

                                          HEATHER
                            Hi, guys, what you been up to?

                                          VAL
                            Ran into the new college student,
                            Rona.

                                          EARL
                            Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's
                            getting some kind of strange
                            readings on her things.

                                          BURT
                            Damn, you know, those kids turn up
                            oil or uranium or something out
                            there...next thing the Feds will be
                            at our door.  "Sorry, time to move.
                            Eminent domain."

                                          HEATHER
                            Down, honey, down.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry,
                            you're gonna have a heart attack
                            before you get to survive World War
                            III.

               Heather and Pham laugh.  Burt smiles patiently.  Just then
               the compressor in Pham's ice cream freezer comes on.  It's a
               loud chug-chug-chug sound mixed with a high-pitched squeal.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going
                            out, you think?

                                          VAL
                            Could be.

               He starts toward the compressor, but Earl heads him off.

                                          EARL
                            Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get
                            over to Nestor's.

                                          VAL
                            Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we
                            don't do anything right now.  Earl
                            explained it to me.

               As they turn to go, Val does a take, amazed, as he spots a
               decorative bleached-out cattle skull displayed on the counter
               -- with a $29.95 price tag.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Hey, Pham Van, what the hell is
                            this?

                                          BURT
                            A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three
                            of them for the rec room.

                                          VAL
                                   (whispers to Pham Van)
                            We sell 'em to you for three bucks
                            a piece!

                                          PHAM VAN
                                   (deadpan)
                            And I appreciate it.

                                          VAL
                                   (playfully)
                            You don't get it, Pham.  The idea
                            was: we were ripping you off.

               Suddenly a car alarm blares from outside.  Burt's out the
               door in a flash.  The others follow.


         13    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 13

               Burt races out and shouts at Melvin who back guiltily away
               from Burt's camouflage Blazer.

                                          BURT
                            Melvin, you little pain-in-the-ass!

                                          MELVIN
                            It wasn't me, man!  Your truck's
                            just screwed up, that's all.

               Burt angrily switches off the alarm.  Val and Earl laugh as
               they climb into their truck.

                                          VAL
                            Why don't his parents ever take him
                            to Vegas with them?

                                          EARL
                            You gotta ask that?


         14    EXT.  PIT - DAY                                              14

               At one end of town, Earl maneuvers a huge bulldozer with a
               scoop-loader blade through a choking cloud of dust, scouring
               out a shallow pit to serve as a watering hole.  Val sights
               down a row of stakes which mark one end of the pit.  The job
               is done.  He signals Earl to cut the engine.  Both men have
               kerchiefs covering their faces and are totally encrusted with
               dust.


         15    ANGLE - TRUCK TRAILER - DAY                                  15

               Nearby is an old battered truck trailer -- the massive, solid
               steel kind used for heavy rock hauling.  Tires flat, mired in
               dried mud and weeds, it hasn't been used in years.  Now it
               provides welcome shade as the men sit sipping some coffee.

               NESTOR CUNNINGHAM drives up, surveying the pit with approval.

                                          NESTOR
                            It came out great, boys.  Should
                            fill up just fine come the next
                            rain.  Lemme have your bill.

               Earl and Val start fishing in their pockets for pen and
               paper.  Earl comes up with various pieces of paper, Val with
               three or four pens.  It's a moment before they realize each
               has the other needed implement.  Earl writes out the bill
               during:

                                          NESTOR (cont'd)
                            I'll have to send it to you the
                            first of the month, boys.

               Val and Earl exchange pained looks.

                                          NESTOR (cont'd)
                            Now, you know I'm good for it.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, Nestor, we know.  Don't worry
                            about it.  Catch us when you can.

               They amble over to their truck.  Earl takes the driver's side
               -- and starts fishing in his pockets for the key.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Are we too easy-going?

                                          EARL
                            No, we're not too easy-going.  This
                            area is economically depressed.

               Val realizes he has the key and hands it over.

                                          VAL
                            So what if we just did it...today.
                            Pack up.  Drive straight down to
                            Bixby.  Get serious.

                                          EARL
                            We could.  We could.  But we'd have
                            to get really serious.  It's gonna
                            cost twice as much to rent a place.

                                          VAL
                            So?  That car wash pays good, and
                            they're always looking.

                                          EARL
                            Car wash?!  That's got no future.
                            If we're gonna take the plunge we
                            oughta have a better plan than
                            that.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, sure.  Go ahead and plan
                            it...for a year or two.


         16    EXT.  VIOLA'S PLACE - DAY                                    16

               CLOSE ON a stencilled sign: PHAM VAN'S U-RENT -- CESSPOOL,
               SEPTIC TANKS.  PULL OUT to see Val and Earl have rented a
               portable septic pump (perhaps trailer mounted).  The aged
               machine reeks of and drips with its ignoble cargo.  The
               intake hose has been repaired so often it looks to be more
               tape than hose.  Grimacing Val threads the slimy hose down
               through the open top of Viola's cesspool.

               Beside them is Viola's well-kept mobile home on a low hill
               not far from Pham Van's store.  Well-kept flower gardens
               surround the place.  VIOLA, a sweet little old lady, watches
               the men work while straining to hold the leash of her tiny
               but ferocious dog.  The dog yaps continuously, lunging at
               Val and Earl.

                                          VIOLA
                            Stop it!  Stop it, you horrid
                            animal!
                                   (to Val and Earl)
                            I'm going to give her back to my
                            son.  I swear it.

                                          VAL
                            Hey, Viola, you've got my
                            permission.

                                          EARL
                            God almighty, my mama sure didn't
                            raise me for this.

               Val gets up and starts the pump's gas engine.

                                          VAL
                            Well, you're the one won't work in
                            the car wash.  You're the one's
                            gotta have a plan.

                                          EARL
                            Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is
                            what keeps us doing jobs like this!

               Earl angrily throws the pump valve and starts the pump
               mechanism.  He and Val on stand either side of the intake
               hose as it gurgles happily.

                                          VAL
                            What keeps us doing jobs like this
                            is you dragging your feet.  I was
                            up for going to Bixby.  I was
                            getting excited.

                                          EARL
                            In the past year I must've said a
                            hundred times "We gotta get out of
                            Perfection.  We gotta better
                            ourselves."  You gonna stand there
                            in broad daylight and tell me you
                            think I'm the reason we're still
                            here?  You want to know how close I
                            am to going to Bixby right now?

                                          VAL
                            I'll call that little bluff.  How
                            close?

               POW!  GOOOOSH!  The gurgling intake hose ruptures, showering
               them with -- well you know.  They react as if they'd been
               shot; gagging, staggering, screaming obscenities.


         17    EXT.   VAL AND EARL'S TRAILER - DAY                          17

               Val and Earl's beat-up mobile home is just down the street
               from Pham Van's store.  Val and Earl, now in cleaner clothes,
               march out resolutely.  Val has a portable TV in one hand and
               a framed COORS beer sign in the other.  Earl unhooks the
               clothes line and dumps it, clothes and all, into the back of
               their truck, on top of the rest of their belongings.

               They stare at each other for a moment.  This is it.  No going
               back.  They leap into the truck.  As they drive off, Val leans
               out and yanks their wooden nameplate ("E. Basset -- V. McKee")
               off the mailbox.


         18    EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    18

               They haven't gone fifty yards when they spot NANCY STERNGOOD
               (40s) working in front of her house.  The guys pull their
               hats low over their faces.  Earl swerves to the far side of
               the street.

                                          EARL
                            Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants
                            another load of firewood.

                                          VAL
                            Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.

               Nancy spots them and beckons excitedly.

                                          EARL
                            She's got us.  Now, listen, the
                            plan is: we have done our last job
                            in Perfection.

                                          VAL
                            That's the plan.

               They stop beside Nancy.  While they talk, Nancy's daughter,
               MINDY (9), comes bouncing along on her pogo-stick, listening
               to her Walkman and slowly circling the truck.

                                          NANCY
                            Mindy, honey, don't pogo in the
                            street.  Hey, guys, I've got a job
                            for you...

                                          EARL
                            Sorry, Nancy.  We ain't doing odd
                            jobs anymore.  We're headed for
                            Bixby permanent.

                                          NANCY
                                   (skeptical)
                            Oh, sure...
                                   (sees stuff in back of
                                    truck)
                            ...My God, you really are!

                                          VAL
                            Yep, we're relocating to an area
                            with a greater economic base.
                                   (to Mindy, over her music)
                            Hey, Mindy, what's the count?

                                          MINDY
                            Six hundred three, six hundred
                            four, six hundred five...

                                          VAL
                            Go for it!

                                          NANCY
                            Gee, guys.  I made the big
                            decision.  I'm putting in that
                            satellite dish.  I was going to
                            offer you five hundred dollars.

               Val and Earl glance at each other -- five hundred dollars!


         19    EXT.  DESERT ROAD - PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY                      19

               The truck roars toward the "Leaving Perfection" sign.  Val
               and Earl are elated, downright giddy.

                                          EARL
                            We did it!  We faced temptation and
                            we did not bend!

                                          VAL
                            Damn straight!  Now there's nothing
                            between us and Bixby but nothing!

               They zoom past the sign.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Last time we'll see that sign!

               They laugh, then are thrown half out of their seats as Earl
               accidentally hits a big pothole.

                                          EARL
                            Last time we hit that goddamn
                            pothole!


         20    EXT.  DESERT - WIDE - DAY                                    20

               As the truck streaks across the landscape.  Val and Earl
               merrily continue their good-byes to whatever is visible.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            So long, cactus!

                                          EARL (V.O.)
                            Adios, bridge!


         21    EXT.  CANYON ROAD - DAY                                      21

               On its way down from the high desert, the lonely road now
               winds through a twisting, narrow canyon.  A county highway
               maintenance truck is parked to one side and two road workers,
               CARMINE and HOWARD, repair a slide-damaged section of the
               road, Carmine breaking up asphalt with a jackhammer.  Val and
               Earl pull up, hand them each a beer, and speed away, shouting:

                                          VAL
                            Last time down this damn twisty
                            road!


         22    EXT.  SHACK - DAY                                            22

               The pick-up speeds past a small shack.  Val and Earl
               automatically roll up their windows.  In a moment we see why:
               a monster, ferocious dog comes galloping out to chase their
               truck.  Earl gives the dog the finger.

                                          EARL
                            Last chance, asshole.  Run, run...!


         23    EXT.  OLD FRED'S PLACE - DAY                                 23

               Old Fred latches the gate on his corral filled with sheep.
               He looks up as Val and Earl's truck speeds past.  Val and Earl
               honk their horn and wave happily.  Old Fred waves back.


         24    EXT.  ROAD - ELECTRICAL TOWERS - DAY                         24

               The pick-up zooms along, the road now paralleling a line of
               tall high-tension electrical towers.


         25    INT./EXT.  PICK-UP TRUCK - MOVING - DAY                      25

               The guys have calmed down, but each is still dreaming of a
               new life.

                                          EARL
                            Okay, here's the plan.  We bust our
                            tails in the car wash six months...
                            well, maybe nine...and we don't
                            spend a dime, you know?  And then
                            we go for it...down payment on a
                            tow-truck or a back-hoe or
                            something, right?  Start a real
                            business.  We can start looking for
                            something today, tonight!

               Val points up ahead -- a man is sitting near the top of a
               distant electrical tower.

                                          VAL
                            Jeez, look at that guy.

                                          EARL
                                   (shakes his head)
                            One job I'd never take is working
                            around electricity.

                                          VAL
                            Especially when it's two hundred
                            feet off the ground.

               But as the pass the tower:

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Hey, hold up...That's Edgar Deems!

                                          EARL
                            You're full of shit.

                                          VAL
                            He's only got one damn jacket.
                            That's him, I'm telling you.


         26    EXT.  ELECTRICAL TOWER - DAY                                 26

               Earl pulls over.  They climb out and peer up at the tower.
               Edgar is hard to see through the criss-crossing girders.

                                          EARL
                                   (impressed)
                            Man, oh, man.  He must've really
                            been drunk this time.
                                   (shouts)
                            Edgar!  What the hell you doing?
                            Get on down from there!

               Edgar doesn't move.  Val and Earl shift about uncomfortably.

                                          VAL
                            Well, shit, we can't leave him up
                            there.

               They stare at each other.  Someone's got to climb up.  Val
               raises his fist in The Challenge.  Their fingers fly.  Rock
               breaks scissors.  Val loses.

               Valentine unhappily climbs the tall tower while Earl watches
               from below.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Hey, Edgar, don't you move.  I'm
                            coming to get you...You damn fool,
                            you owe me on this one...

               Higher and higher Val climbs.  He tries not to look down.

               He's approaching Edgar from below and behind.  As he gets
               nearer he begins to notice forboding details: one of Edgar's
               shoes is missing, half the trouser led is torn off.. Edgar is
               strapped to a girder by his belt, his shotgun gripped in his
               hands.  A swarm of flies buzzes away.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            What the hell...

               He edges around to where he can see Edgar's face -- the
               eyes are wide open, staring.  He's dead.


         27    EXT.  OLD FRED'S PLACE - DAY                                 27

               Old Fred is now hoeing his garden.  He glances up as Val and
               Earl's pick-up roars back toward Perfection.


         28    EXT.  JIM AND MEGAN'S HOUSE - DAY                            28

               A big station wagon is parked between a small mobile home and
               a half-finished house being built by JIM and MEGAN WALLACE,
               an out-going, energetic older couple.  Lumber, cinder blocks,
               and tools are scattered around the yard.

               Jim examines Edgar's body in the bed of Val and Earl's pick-
               up truck.  Val, Earl and Megan talk in subdued tones.

                                          VAL
                            Real sorry to bother you, Megan,
                            but we figured since Jim's a doctor...

                                          MEGAN
                            No, it's fine.  You did the right
                            thing.  When Jim is done we'll call
                            the Coroner's office in Bixby.
                            We'll take care of it.
                                   (shakes her head)
                            Poor Edgar.

                                          EARL
                                   (tries to break the mood)
                            Well, I see you got all the
                            wallboard up.

                                          MEGAN
                            That was easy.  You two did the
                            hard part.  Sure sorry you're
                            leaving.

               Jim climbs out of the pick-up.

                                          EARL
                            Was is a heart attack?

                                          JIM
                                   (shaking his head)
                            He died of dehydration.  Thirst.

                                          VAL
                            But that doesn't make sense.  That
                            takes a couple of days, doesn't it?

                                          JIM
                            Three or four even.

                                          EARL
                            You mean he sat up there three or
                            four days?  Just sat there till he
                            died of thirst?

               Jim shrugs.  Everyone is mystified.


         29    EXT.  OLD FRED'S PLACE - DAY                                 29

               Fred is still hoeing.  In the nearby pen his sheep start
               acting restless.  He eyes them.  What's up?  We hear a
               strange muffled sound.  Unseen, behind him, at the far end of
               the garden, his scarecrow mysteriously tilts.

               Old Fred keeps hoeing.  He stops, his foot is caught in the
               dirt.  Suddenly he is yanked knee-deep into the ground!


         30    EXT.  CANYON ROAD - DAY                                      30

               Val and Earl's truck, again headed for Bixby, and going way
               too fast, zooms past the two workers still repairing the
               road.  The workers glance up, annoyed.


         31    EXT.  SHACK - DAY                                            31

               Val and Earl, sobered and deep in thought, drive past the
               shack where the ferocious dog lives.  They automatically roll
               up their windows during:

                                          EARL
                            Reckon he hated Perfection more
                            than us?  You suppose he wanted to
                            kill himself?

                                          VAL
                            If he did, why didn't he use his
                            damn shotgun?

                                          EARL
                            Maybe he just couldn't pull the
                            trigger...

                                          VAL
                            Oh sure, he figured it was easier
                            to die of thirst?  Come on,
                            sombody must've chased him up
                            there.

                                          EARL
                            Oh, you mean somebody who ain't
                            scared of a twelve gauge shotgun.
                            And then what did they do?  Camp
                            out down below and just wait for
                            him to die?

               Val has no answer.  It's too weird.

                                          VAL
                            Well, whatever the hell happened
                            it's just one more goddamn good
                            reason to haul ass out of this
                            place.

                                          EARL
                            You got that right.

               They are passing the shack.  Earl suddenly realizes:

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Hey, where the hell's that asshole
                            dog?

                                          VAL
                                   (looking around)
                            Probably up a pole starving itself
                            to death.

                                          EARL
                            Okay, the plan is: pedal to the
                            metal the whole way.  We don't stop
                            till we hit the carwash, not even
                            to pee.

                                          VAL
                            I'll go with that plan.


         32    EXT.  OLD FRED'S PLACE - DAY                                 32

               CLOSE ON the pick-up's tires skidding to a stop.  PULL OUT to
               see we're back at Old Fred's.

                                          VAL
                            What are you doing?

               Earl is staring wide-eyed.  Val follows Earl's gaze and is
               aghast when he sees --

               The sheep pen -- it's a ghastly, bloody mess.  Scattered on
               the churned up ground a few dismembered sheep legs and heads
               are all that remain of the flock.

                                          VAL
                                   (whispers)
                            What the hell...?

               Val and Earl leap out of the truck to investigate.

                                          VAL
                            Hey, Old Fred!  Fred!  Where are
                            you?!

               Earl dashes into Fred's house.  Val checks around outside.
               Earl comes back out.

                                          EARL
                            Not here.

               Then they spot something lying in the middle of the garden --
               Old Fred's hat.

               Still looking all around, Val squats distractedly to pick up
               the hat.  He and Earl stumble backward in shock.

               OLD FRED IS STILL WEARING HIS HAT!!  His mangled face stares
               up at them, eyes and mouth frozen open in a death grimace.

                                          EARL
                            Oh, Jesus!!

                                          VAL
                            What the hell is going on?  I mean
                            WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!!


         33    EXT. CANYON ROAD - DAY                                       33

               Carmine and Howard continue repairing the road, Carmine still
               using the noisy jackhammer.  Val and Earl drive up.

                                          EARL
                            You guys better get the hell outta
                            here!  We got a killer on the loose!

                                          HOWARD
                            What?

               Carmine stops jackhammering to listen.

                                          EARL
                            A murderer, man!  A real psycho.
                            He's cutting people's heads off!
                            I'm serious!  I'd high-tail for
                            town if I was you!

               Val and Earl speed away.

                                          CARMINE
                            They're drunk.

                                          HOWARD
                            Yeah...

               But he edges over to the truck and takes out a heavy steel
               pry-bar to keep within easy reach.

               Carmine goes back to work, pounding the asphalt with the
               jackhammer.  Suddenly the blade strikes something beneath the
               road, something soft.  We hear a strange, unearthly shriek
               from underground.  A weird orange goo gushes up around the
               blade.  Then the jackhammer takes off by itself like a
               harpoon stuck in a whale!  Carmine gets tangled in the jack-
               hammer's air-hose and is dragged along, shouting for help.

               Howard chases him down the embankment and into the scrub-
               brush.  He hears Carmine screaming.

                                          HOWARD
                            Carmine!  What the hell is it?!
                            Where are you?

               But now there is only silence.  Howard crashes through the
               brush.  All he finds is the torn end of the air-hose -- which
               suddenly sucks down into the ground.  He's momentarily
               staggered by an awful smell, but forces himself to keep
               looking.  He lets the pry-bar drag on the ground.  Then
               something -- it looks like a mouth or a horrid beak -- shoots
               out of the ground and grips the pry-bar with uncanny
               strength!  Howard drops his weapon and scrambles madly away.

               He clambers back onto the road.  But almost immediately
               cracks form in the pavement around him.  More beak-things
               break through the asphalt between him and his truck.

               He dashes across the road, scrambling up the embankment.  He
               clings precariously to a tree root, looking down -- where'd
               they go?  Suddenly the dirt around him begins to "bubble."
               Several hungry beaks break through and grab him, yanking him
               head first into the embankment.  Then the embankment gives
               way, crashing down onto the road, taking with it a nearby
               telephone pole and snapping the lines.


         34    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 34

               Pham Van is talking to MIGUEL, a local rancher.  They both
               jump as the doors burst open.  Val and Earl race in, trailed
               by Nestor and Melvin.  Val heads for the payphone during:

                                          NESTOR
                            His head?  You mean just his head?

               Val grabs the phone and digs in his pocket for change.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, really sick, man.  Sweet Old
                            Fred.

               Earl comes up with change and hands it to Val, who dials.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Something happen to Fred?

                                          MELVIN
                                   (ignoring Pham)
                            Are you serious, man?  They killed
                            him just to take his sheep?

                                          EARL
                            He didn't have nothing else to
                            steal.  Neither did Edgar.

                                          MIGUEL
                            What happened to Edgar?

               Val stares at the phone.

                                          VAL
                            I don't believe this.  The phone is
                            out!  Pham, your phone is out!

                                          PHAM VAN
                            I didn't do it!  What's going on?

               Val and Earl rush out.


         35    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 35

               Trailed by the others Val and Earl march out and leap into
               their truck , Val driving now.  He searches for the key.

                                          NESTOR
                            We've gotta get the police up here.
                            You guys gotta step on it to Bixby.

               Earl hands Val the key.

                                          VAL
                            Consider it stepped on.


         36    EXT.  CANYON ROAD - DAY                                      36

               Again the pick-up barrels through the canyon.

                                          VAL
                            Brother, we decided to leave this
                            place just one day too late, you
                            know?

                                          EARL
                                   (grimly)
                            Well, there's sure as hell nothing
                            to stop us now.  Everybody we know
                            between here and Bixby is already
                            dead.

               Earl points ahead and screams:

                                          EARL
                            LOOK OUT!!

               Val brings the truck to a squealing stop.  Ahead: the
               collapsed embankment completely blocks the road.  It's
               totally impassable.  The cowboys are dumbfounded.

                                          EARL
                            Is some higher force at work, here?
                            Are we asking too much of life?

               But Val is in no mood for philosophy.  He leaps out and peers
               into the highway maintenance truck which sits undisturbed,
               emergency lights still flashing.  There's nobody in it.  He
               starts looking around.

                                          VAL
                            Those assholes are supposed to be
                            fixing the goddamn road!
                                   (shouts)
                            Hey!  Where are you guys?  People
                            gotta use this road, you know!
                            You on a booze break or what?!

                                          EARL
                                   (whispers; urgently pointing)
                            Val!  Val!

               Val looks where he's pointing -- Howard's bloodstained
               hardhat lies at the edge of the landslide.  Val gets the
               point.  Looking around for the unknown assailant, he eases
               back into the truck.  Earl already has a pistol in his lap
               and is digging through the glove compartment.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Where are the bullets?  Don't we
                            have any goddamn bullets?

               Val quickly jockeys the truck to turn it around on the narrow
               road.  But as he backs into the hillside, we hear a strange
               grating clunk from underneath.  When he tries to pull
               forward, the truck won't move.  The engine stalls.

                                          VAL
                            Jesus!  I don't believe this!

                                          EARL
                            You're hung up again.

                                          VAL
                            I am not!

               They both lean out.  The rear tires are clear.  Val restarts
               the truck and tries to pull forward, rocking the truck
               against some unseen pull.  Smoke wells up from the clutch.

                                          EARL
                            You're hung up I tell you.  You're
                            gonna burn the clutch.

               Val slams the truck into low-range four-wheel-drive and revs
               it.  The tires dig in, fighting for traction -- and suddenly
               the truck lurches free.  We hear an eerie shriek mingled with
               gear and engine noise as Val angrily roars away.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Jesus, you can break an axle like
                            that.

                                          VAL
                            Fuck you!

                                          EARL
                            Hey, I don't want spend the night
                            out here!


         37    EXT.  PHAN VAM'S STORE - DAY                                 37

               The word has spread.  Everybody in town is gathered at Pham
               Van's.  They rush out to meet Val and Earl as they drive up.

                                          BURT
                            What the hell you doing back
                            already?

                                          VAL
                            You're never going to believe this,
                            but the canyon road...we were on it
                            not two hours ago...well, it's
                            completely...

               But he stops because they're all staring wide-eyed at the
               rear of the truck.

                                          NANCY
                            My God...!

               Val and Earl jump out and look where everyone else is
               looking.  Their jaws drop.  REVEAL: hanging from the rear
               axle of their truck and trailing out behind like a nightmare
               wedding decoration -- a sex foot long, grotesque, fleshy,
               tentacle.  The end gripping the axle looks like a vicious,
               razor-sharp beak or hook.  The trailing end is mutilated,
               oozing orange goo -- as though the creature was torn in half.



                                          MELVIN
                            Unreal!  Where'd you get it?

                                          VAL
                            Uh...didn't know we had it...

                                          NANCY
                            It's disgusting.

                                          VIOLA
                            Looks like...and eel.

                                          NESTOR
                            Naw...eels live in water.

                                          VAL
                            So...it's some kind of snake?

                                          EARL
                            Or a big mother slug maybe?

                                          BURT
                            Some kind of mutation...?

               Burt, more daring than the others, pries the thing off the
               axle with a shovel.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Don't touch, don't touch.

                                          BURT
                            It's dead all right.  Tore the damn
                            thing in half.

                                          EARL
                            It must've grabbed us.  That's why
                            the truck stalled-out.

                                          VAL
                                   (suddenly indignant)
                            Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not
                            hung up...!

                                          BURT
                            Stalled out your truck?  Have to be
                            one strong son of a bitch.

               Pham Van leaps over them.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            I give you boys five dollars for
                            it.

               Val and Earl square their shoulders.  This time they're ready
               for him.

                                          VAL
                            Twenty.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Okay, ten dollars.

                                          EARL
                            Fifteen.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Okay, fifteen.

                                          VAL
                            Damn right fifteen.

               Burt is deep in thought.

                                          BURT
                            Just one of these couldn't eat up
                            off a whole flock of sheep.
                            There's gotta be more out there, a
                            lot more.

               A cold chill spreads through the group.  They stare out at
               the vast, forbidding desert.  They suddenly feel alone --
               very alone.


         38    EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           38

               CLOSE on Rhonda's hat lying on the ground.  We think the
               worst.  Then she reaches in, picks it up and puts it on.
               REVEAL she's in a lonely corner of the valley working with a
               seismograph.  She pounds a marking stake into the dirt.


         39    INSERT - CLOSE ON SEISMOGRAPH                                39

               The needle responds to each blow on the stake.  We hear
               Rhonda stop pounding.  The needle stops.  All is silent --
               but the needle starts moving again!"


         40    BACK TO SCENE                                                40

               LOW CAMERA is MOVING in Rhonda's general direction.  She
               starts to pound another stake.  CAMERA REACTS so it is moving
               straight toward her.  As it passes a burrow, a rabbit
               suddenly scouts out.  CAMERA WHIP PANS to watch the rabbit
               scamper into the distance, then TURNS BACK to move toward
               Rhonda, who still pounding her stake.

               CAMERA passes Rhonda's seismograph.  The machine tilts
               slightly as the ground bulges up beneath it.

               Rhonda finishes pounding.  She heads for her truck, noisily
               tossing in her tools and slamming the tailgate.  CAMERA
               CLOSES IN on her, faster and faster.  It is right on her
               heels as she climbs into the cab!


         41    ANGLE - RHONDA'S TRUCK                                       41

               A beak-thing thrusts out of the ground, groping where
               Rhonda's boot just was.  Rhonda drives off, unknowingly
               running right over the thing.  We hear a shriek of pain as
               the tentacle writhes and sucks back under the ground.


         42    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - NIGHT                               42

               Mindy Sterngood poses cautiously with the bizarre hook
               tentacle.   A camera FLASHES and we REVEAL Pham Van taking
               her photo beside a sign: "Photographs -- You and the Snake
               Monster -- $2.00."  Viola and Miguel, wait in line.

               We now see the store is crowded with concerned townsfolk
               debating what to do, and how to protect themselves.  Val and
               Earl sit on the sidelines, sipping beer, gazing in awe at
               enterprising Phan Vam:

                                          EARL
                            Slick as snot and I'm not lying.

                                          VAL
                            Fifteen lousy bucks.

                                          EARL
                            A man who plans ahead.

               Dominating the discussion are Burt and Heather now armed with
               scoped, magnum hunting rifles.  Heather stands guard at a
               window, peering out into the night.

                                          BURT
                                   (to group)
                            ...Look, we organize, we arm
                            ourselves.  We go out, we find
                            those damn snake things, we make
                            'em extinct.

                                          NESTOR
                            Come on, Burt, we don't even know
                            what they are.

                                          VIOLA
                            Might be aliens.  Who knows?

                            Why go looking for trouble?

                                          BURT
                            Miguel, the trouble's come to us.
                            If we're not ready...

                                          HEATHER
                            Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on
                            our own.

                                          HEATHER
                            Come on, Nancy, don't let's get
                            personal.  We need to do something.

               Burt steps over to a faded topographic map on the wall and
               points out details during:

                                          BURT
                            Damn right.  You folks gotta
                            analyze the situation.  With that
                            road out we're completely cut off.
                            Got the cliffs to the north,
                            mountains east and west.  That's
                            why Heather and me settled here in
                            the first place, geographic
                            isolation.

                                          NANCY
                            Well...there must be dome way to

                            How, for chrissake?  You gonna walk
                            thirty-eight miles to Bixby?

               All heads turn toward Pham Van.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            You're welcome to them.  Does
                            anybody know how to ride?

               All heads turn toward Val and Earl.


         43    EXT.  JIM AND MEGANS'S HOUSE - ESTABLISH - NIGHT             43

               In the vast desert night a single floodlight illuminates Jim
               and Megan's partially finished house.  Their station wagon is
               parked out front.  A country and western tune drifts to us
               from it's radio.

               As we MOVE CLOSER, we see the floodlight is powered by a
               small, softly purring generator set maybe fifty feet away.

               Jim and Megan, both exhausted, unload a big stack of roofing
               shingles from their station wagon.  Jim starts to lift a
               package of shingles but gives up and sits on the tailgate.

                                          JIM
                            I'm dead.  Let's finish in the
                            morning.

                                          MEGAN
                            We have to go into Bixby in the
                            morning.
                                   (grins devilishly)
                            The concrete blocks are in.

                                          JIM
                            The con...!  Oh my God.

                                          MEGAN
                            Just keep looking at that beautiful
                            sky.

                                          JIM
                            What?

                                          MEGAN
                            That's the sky that's going to be
                            over our roof every night, when
                            we're done.

                                          JIM
                                   (joking)
                            Ah, but consider this, if we don't
                            finish the roof, we can looks at
                            that sky all the time.

               Just then the whirring of the generator becomes strangely
               muffled.  The floodlight flickers.  Now the generator dies.
               Darkness engulfs them.  The car radio music drones on
               incongruously.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Damn that thing!

                                          MEGAN
                                   (sarcastic)
                            We could always buy a new
                            generator.

               Jim digs out a powerful flashlight and heads over toward the
               generator.  Megan lies back, taking a welcome breather.
               After a moment:

                                          MEGAN
                            Well, what's wrong with it?

                                          JIM (V.O.)
                            It's...gone...!


         44    ANGLE - JIM                                                  44

               Baffled, he sweeps the whole area with the flashlight.  Megan
               joins him.

                                          MEGAN
                            You sure this is where it was?

                                          JIM
                            Am I sure?!
                                   (points with flashlight)
                            It was right there.  There's the
                            cord.

               The severed electric cable stops at the edge of a cone-shaped
               depression in the dirt where the generator sat.  He hands her
               the flashlight and kneels.  We watch tensely as he probes the
               loose earth with his hands.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Maybe the ground caved in.  There's
                            a lot of old mines and stuff around
                            here.

               Megan grabs his shirt, trying to pull him back.

                                          MEGAN
                            Well don't then!  You don't want to
                            fall in.

               Suddenly, about ten feet away -- WHOOMP!!  The generator
               shoots up out of the ground!  Jim and Megan dive for cover as
               it sails through the air, and crashes to earth.  They stare,
               transfixed.  The generator is dented and bent almost beyond
               recognition -- and covered with oozing slime.

                                          JIM
                            What the...?

               But Megan is all action.  She yanks him back.

                                          MEGAN
                            Come on.  Get away from it!

                                          JIM
                            God, what a stink!

               We again hear that mysterious rumbling sound.  Jim stops,
               sweeping the flashlight around them.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Hear that?

                                          MEGAN
                            Never mind!  Let's go!  Let's just
                            go into town or something!  Jim,
                            please!

               She hustles him bodily toward the car during:

                                          JIM
                            You know, I bet it's geological or
                            something, like natural gas, or a
                            geyser.  They stink like that.
                            Remember in Yellowstone...?

               Suddenly he drops knee-deep into ground!  Megan is thrown
               off balance and tumbles to one side.  The flashlight falls,
               lighting them at an eerie low angle.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Something's got me!!

               We hear sickening CRUNCHES from below the earth.  He SCREAMS
               in excruciating agony.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Oh, God!  Get me Out!!  GET ME OUT!!

               He struggles wildly, but just sinks further down!  Megan
               slides a 2X4 over to Jim.  He grabs it like a drowning man,
               trying to keep himself from being pulled down.  But he's
               pulled with suck power the 2X4 snaps!

               His head is going under.  Megan desperately tries to dig the
               smothering earth away, but she's losing.  Now only his arms
               are above ground.  She pulls with all her might, but he sinks
               inexorably down, down.  She's pulled flat on the ground.
               He's gone.

               The next instant, a vicious hook-tentacle erupts through the
               earth, missing Megan's face by inches.  She scrambles back
               frantically.


         45    ANGLE - STATION WAGON                                        45

               LOW CAMERA pursues Megan toward the car, just missing her as
               she dives in through the open tailgate.  She slams it after
               her.  The talons rake across the car, scratching the glass.

               Megan tumbles into the front seat.  Thank God the keys are in
               the ignition.  She starts the engine.  But outside the "snake
               things" attack the car in a frenzy, slashing blindly.  A rear
               tire is totally shredded just as:

               Megan floors it.  The car lurches forward but the mutilated
               tire falls apart.  The wheel rim digs into the loose earth
               and the car is stuck.  With no other recourse, Megan locks
               the door, rolls up the windows and cowers in the middle of
               the car, panting, sobbing.  The radio is still playing a
               happy cowboy tune.  She peeks out.  They gave up?  She's
               safe?  Nothing happens for a moment, then --

               The car starts to shake and shudder!  Dust wells up around the
               windows.

               Outside we see a bizarre sight.  The earth around the rear of
               the car is "boiling," dirt flying in all directions -- and
               the car starts to sink into the ground!!

               Megan wildly honks the horn!  The car looks just like a ship
               going down by the stern, hood tilting up gracefully.  The
               back windows shatter, dirt pouring in!  Megan smashes the
               windshield with a small fire extinguisher and scrambles out
               on the hood.  But there's no hope.  The car keeps sinking,
               titling now almost ninety degrees, forcing her onto a
               precarious perch on the grille -- sinking, sinking.

               Out of her mind with terror, she keeps softly murmuring the
               same hopeless phrases:

                                          MEGAN
                            Stop it!  Stop it!  Somebody stop it...!


         46    EXT.  DESERT - JIM AND MEGAN'S HOUSE - VERY WIDE - NIGHT     46

               The headlights are two ironic beacons sending their beams
               skyward through the roiling dust into the night sky.  The
               sound of the radio becomes muffled.  The headlights sink from
               view -- and then Megan's scream floats across the desert.


         47    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAWN                                47

               Out front of Pham Van's, nervous Val and Earl saddle up the
               horses while Pham loads their saddle bags with food.  Every-
               one has gathered to see them off.  There's an air of tension.

                                          VAL
                                   (eyeing the horses)
                            Pham, we don't want to be stuck on
                            a couple of canners.  They better
                            be fast.

                                          EARL
                            Relax.  A snake thing like that
                            couldn't move too quick.

                                          VAL
                            Screw you.  For all you know they
                            could fly.

               Earl pulls their old Smith and Wesson revolver and battered
               Winchester rifle out of the pick-up truck.

                                          EARL
                            You want the rifle or the Smith?

                                          VAL
                                   (definite)
                            The rifle.

               So does Earl.  He raises his hand.  They swiftly do a round
               of scissors-rock-paper.  Earl loses.  He hands Val the rifle.
               Just then, Burt and Heather pull up in their Blazer, climbing
               out with their hunting rifles.

                                          BURT
                            You guys all set?

                                          EARL
                            Ready as we'll ever be.

                                          BURT
                            Heather and I are going to drive
                            around a little, see if we can find
                            that college girl and tell her to
                            get her ass back into town.

                                          VAL
                            Good idea.  And we'll swing by the
                            doctor's place.  They were going to
                            go into Bixby but we don't know if
                            they left before the road was out.

               Val and Earl mount up.

                                          HEATHER
                            Hold on.  You guys oughta take
                            something that packs more punch
                            than that thirty-thirty.  Take one
                            of our Browning autos, or even my
                            model seventy...
                                   (offers her hunting rifle)
                            It's three-seventy-five H and H
                            mag.

               Earl takes the awesome-looking gun with a smug glance at Val.

                                          EARL
                            Gee...thanks, Heather.  Hope we
                            don't need it.

               Heather unhooks a box of cartridges from her belt and hands
               it to Earl.  Suddenly there's a blood-curdling SCREAM!  The
               door to Pham Van's flies open.  Out staggers Melvin, wrapped
               in Pham Van's hook-tentacle, writhing in apparent agony.

                                          MELVIN
                            IT'S GOT ME!  IT's GOT ME!  AAAAHGH!

               People scatter like sheep.  Burt and Heather have guns
               trained on him in an instant.  Then everyone realizes it's a
               sick joke.  Melvin collapses with laughter.  Burt is livid.
               He almost shot Melvin.  He charges over and yanks the kid to
               his feet, screaming:

                                          BURT
                            You stupid punk!  You came that
                            close, that close!!

                                          EARL
                            One of these days, Melvin,
                            somebody's gonna kick your ass.

               Pham rushes over and grabs his precious tentacle.  As people
               calm down, Val and Earl gaze nervously at the vast desert
               before them.

                                          BURT
                            Well...you fellas watch yourselves.

                                          NANCY
                            Come back with the Sheriff.

                                          NESTOR
                            Sheriff, like hell.  Come back with
                            the National Guard.

               They ride out to an adlib chorus:  "Keep your heads down;"
               "Go careful, boys;" "Keep a sharp lookout;" etc.


         48    EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           48

               Val and Earl ride along, very tiny in the vast, lonely
               landscape, and very on edge.  Constantly looking all around.

                                          EARL
                            You know, we can't possibly make
                            Bixby by nightfall.

               Val doesn't want to hear it.

                                          EARL
                            That means we're gonna be out here,
                            like, in the dark.

                                          VAL
                                   (resentfully)
                            Great.  Thank you.

               Faint Country and Western radio music drifts to them.
               They're nearing Jim and Megan's house.


         49    EXT.  JIM AND MEGAN'S HOUSE - DAY                            49

               Val knocks on the door to the mobile home.

                                          VAL
                            Hey, doctor, anybody here?

               No answer.  He opens the door and peers inside.  Behind him
               Earl steps out of the half-finished house and shrugs.  Nobody
               around.  Wind rustles the plastic sheeting over the windows.
               Strangely they can still hear the muffled radio clearly.

                                          VAL
                                   (spooked)
                            Oh, man, I hate this shit.

               They walk briskly to their horses.  Earl snatches Heather's
               rifle from its saddle scabbard.  Val pulls out the
               Winchester.  Earl tries to reassure himself.

                                          EARL
                            Car's gone.  We just missed them,
                            that's all.

                                          VAL
                            Then where's the goddamn Conway
                            Twitty coming from?

               They focus on the sound and walk gingerly toward it, keeping
               constant watch in every direction.  The ground here is all
               torn up like the sheep pen -- and the music is coming from
               underneath!  What the hell is going on?

               Val scrapes at the dirt with his boot -- and finds the
               headlight of Jim and Megan's station wagon, still on, glaring
               up at him.  He drops down and wildly sweeps away more dirt,
               revealing more of the car's grille and hood -- and blood -
               soaked dirt which sticks to his hand.  He leaps away,
               frantically rubbing the blood off on his pants.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Oh, man...oh, man...


         50    EXT.  DESERT - CONCRETE DITCH - DAY                          50

               Val and Earl are riding at full gallop.  They race alongside
               a concrete-lined flood-control ditch and veer off to follow a
               barbed wire fence which crosses the ditch.


         51    EXT.  DESERT - BARBED WIRE FENCE - DAY                       51

               They ride along the fence during:

                                          EARL
                            Here's the plan...We don't even
                            stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we
                            keep right on going.  We'll walk
                            the horses.

                                          VAL
                            That is the plan...I mean, goddamn
                            it!  What the hell are those
                            things?  How could they bury an
                            entire Plymouth station wagon?

                                          EARL
                            Why would they do it?

               Suddenly the horses stop short.  In a frenzy they wheel
               around, rear up, refusing to go on.  The cowboys fight to
               control them.

                                          VAL
                            I knew it!  Pham Van wouldn't know
                            a decent horse if...!

               But Earl's already drawing his rifle.

                                          EARL
                            Shut up!  They got wind of
                            something they don't like!

                                          VAL
                            Oh shit!

               He draws his rifle.  They look wildly in all directions at
               once -- but there's nothing, only empty desert.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            But I don't see anything!

               They keep staring.  The horses keep pacing nervously.  Then
               -- Earl's horse rears wildly and falls!  Earl goes flying.
               Val wheels around wildly, dismounts and runs to Earl, who's
               bruised and winded but basically unhurt.  They think Earl's
               horse just tripped.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Hey, you okay?  You okay?

                                          EARL
                            Yeah...yeah.
                                   (turning to the horse)
                            What about the hor...?

               Their eyes bulge.  Several "snake things" have engulfed the
               horse's head, sucking, crushing, slurping.  Val's horse goes
               berserk and gallops for the horizon.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            What in the name...?

                                          VAL
                            That's how they get you!  They're
                            under the goddamn ground!

               Suddenly they realize what that means -- the thing could
               come up under them!!  The cowboys scramble frantically away.
               But nothing pursues them.  They pause, glancing back
               nervously.

                                          EARL
                            What the hell are they?

                                          VAL
                            Sons of bitches!

               Val raises his rifle and takes a well-aimed shot, hitting one
               of them.  Orange goo spurts out.  We hear a deafening shriek
               as all the "snake things" instantly zip back underground.

               Then -- A HUGE MOUND OF EARTH RISES UP UNDER VAL AND EARL!!
               The cowboys tumble down its side, Val losing his rifle.  They
               roll over and stare dumbfounded at the mound.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                                   (gasps)
                            There must be a million of them!!

               The mound of earth turns toward them.  The ground splits open
               and out rises -- a huge head!

                                          EARL
                                   (awestruck)
                            Nope...just one.

               The monster is a horrendous thirty-foot long eating machine!
               Its head is eyeless, utterly alien, covered with tough boney
               plates which close together to form a cork-screw point.

               The cowboys stumble back toward the fence in speechless
               terror.  The creature slides toward them, pushing through the
               earth like a whale through water.  Now it opens its mouth --
               but it's like a grotesque flower, boney plates spreading open
               like petals, revealing a huge, slimy, fleshy, oozing orifice!
               And inside the mouth, a ghastly multi-tentacled tongue!
               These are the "snake things," not snakes at all but actually
               the horrid hook-tentacles that can shoot out six feet to snag
               their prey!

               The monster snorts and snuffs, throwing up plumes of dust,
               sounding like a horrendous pig.  It sinks into the earth and
               charges!  We see the hump of earth move toward them faster
               and faster but then it disappears as the creature goes deeper.

               Val and Earl leap sideways and run along the fence.  The
               creature goes straight and slams into a fencepost from below.
               All we see is the fencepost knocked at a crazy angle.

               The cowboys keep running.  The creature regroups and charges
               after them, hitting each fencepost in turn, sending weird
               sinuous shock waves along the barbed wire, making almost
               musical twanging sounds.  Val looks back.

                                          VAL
                            It's gaining on us!!

               And as if that weren't enough, Earl points to more trouble
               ahead.


         52    EXT.   CONCRETE DITCH - DAY                                  52

               The fence runs straight to the edge of the ditch, an eight
               foot wide gap yawning dead ahead.  The creature churns like
               a locomotive from behind.  They'll have to try to jump!  They
               strain desperately for every last fraction of speed.

                                          EARL
                            We can do it, we can do it!

               They leap and -- they don't do it!!  They smack into the
               opposite side of the ditch, clawing frantically at the lip,
               only to tumble to its sloping bottom.  A split second later
               the charging creature slams like a wrecking ball into the
               foot-thick concrete wall!  The wall CRACKS AND BULGES OUT!  A
               hook-tentacle flops out through one of the cracks!  Terrified
               Val and Earl scramble away.  But the wall holds together.

               And the, strangely, all is quiet.  The tentacle lays dead
               still.  Eventually, the cowering cowboys dare to creep back a
               little closer, still panting, exhausted, jumpy.

                                          EARL
                            Stupid son of a bitch...knocked
                            itself cold.

               And now orange slime begins to ooze through the cracks in the
               concrete.

                                          VAL
                            Cold, my ass!  It's dead!  We
                            killed the bastard!

               He suddenly shakes his fist at the dead beast.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            You FUCKER!!

               They allow themselves a small wheeze of nervous laughter,
               only to jump like rabbits as some pebbles rattle loudly down
               the concrete wall behind them.  They whirl to see Rhonda, up
               on the opposite side of the ditch, staring down at them.
               She's lugging a bunch of her equipment, including a small
               folding shovel.

                                          RHONDA
                            Hi, guys, how're you doing?  Look,
                            can I ask you something?  Did you
                            just notice something weird?
                            Vibrations?  You know, some kind of
                            earth tremor?

               Val and Earl look at each other, then burst out laughing.
               Rhonda spots the cracked wall.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            What's that?


         53    EXT.   CONCRETE DITCH - DAY                                  53

               The shattered concrete has been pulled away to fully reveal
               the creature's horrendous head.  Start CLOSE on it: oozing
               blood, slavering mouth plates hanging open, hook-tentacles
               lolling out.  WIDEN to see Earl and Rhonda, sweating, dusty
               and tired, staring in awe and cringing at the stench.

                                          EARL
                            Jesus Christ...think it smells like
                            that 'cause it's dead?

                                          RHONDA
                            I don't see any eyes...must be
                            totally subterranean...and those
                            tentacles...

                                          EARL
                            I think they shoot right outta its
                            mouth, hook you, and pull you right
                            in.  Good thing we stopped it
                            before it killed anybody else.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (shudders)
                            Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find me.
                                   (overwhelmed)
                            This is important, you know.  This
                            is like, well, let's say it, it's
                            probably the biggest zoological
                            discovery of the century.  The
                            century?  Forget it.  History.

               We can hear a shovel digging up above, and now Val shouts:

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            I got it!  Here's the other end!
                            Just look at what we caught here!

               Earl and Rhonda climb up.  CRANE UP with them to REVEAL the
               whole animal!  Val, digging excitedly with Rhonda's shovel,
               is just scraping away the last loose dirt from the creature's
               tail.  The whole length of the immense thirty foot beast is
               partially uncovered, in king-sized bas-relief.

                                          EARL
                                   (hushed)
                            This is one big mother!

                                          VAL
                            So this is the guy that had your
                            seismos working overtime?

               She nods, stepping down to study the creature.  The body is
               stream-lined, cigar-shaped, maybe eight feet in diameter at
               its thickest.  It's covered with hundreds of short, rear-
               pointing, retractable spikes.  Rhonda gingerly jiggles one.
               It can be pushed in and out of its socket like a plunger.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            It must push itself along with
                            these.  Hundreds of them pushing at
                            once.  That's how it can move so
                            fast.  I mean this thing was
                            tripping sensors all over the
                            valley.  No wonder I couldn't...

               A chilling thought stops her in mid-sentence.  She springs
               down into the drainage ditch to get her backpack, pulling out
               her seismograph printouts.  She studies them frantically
               during:

                                          EARL
                            Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of
                            anything like this before?

                                          VAL
                                   (elbows Earl)
                            Sure, Earl, everybody knows about
                            them.  We just didn't tell you.
                            Come on, nobody's ever seen one of
                            these!  We're really in on
                            something here!

               The guys looks at each other.  One thought immediately springs
               to their minds.

                                          EARL
                            Pham Van don't get his mitts on
                            this for no measly fifteen bucks!

                                          VAL
                            You got that right!

               While they bask in their fame-to-be, Rhonda continues to
               study the print-outs, coming to a terrifying conclusion.

                                          EARL
                            Here's the plan: we'll get a...a
                            flatbed, I guess, with a big winch,
                            figure a five ton anyway.

                                          VAL
                            Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd
                            tear it all up.  Want to lift it.
                            Some kind of crane with lifting
                            straps.

               But Rhonda interrupts -- now really scared.

                                          RHONDA
                            Hey, hey, shut up!  The way I
                            figure it.  There are five more of
                            these things!

               Val and Earl shut right up.  Earl edges up a fencepost.  Val
               sidles up onto a rock during:

                                          EARL
                            Five more?

               Rhonda paws through her unwieldy printouts, pointing out
               jagged ink lines on the graphs, comparing different ones.

                                          RHONDA
                            Yeah, darn it, look.  I've got
                            seismographs all over the valley.
                            If you compare the different
                            readings, there have to be five.
                            Here's one at two o'clock
                            yesterday, but here's another one
                            three miles away at the same time.
                            So that's two.  Now, here...

               The men leap from their perches and hustle her in the
               direction she came from.

                                          VAL
                            We'll take your word for it.

                                          EARL
                            Yeah.  Where's your truck?

                                          RHONDA
                            The other side of that dome.

               She indicates what to most of us would be a hill, dotted with
               huge boulders thrusting out of the sandy desert soil like big
               mushrooms.  The trio jogs toward the hill.


         54    EXT.  DESERT - SEISMOGRAPH - DAY                             54

               En route to the truck, they pass near one of Rhonda's
               seismographs.  Suddenly Earl stumbles as one leg drops knee-
               deep into the ground!  He screams.  Val wheels and bodily
               yanks him up.  They back away from the small hole in the
               ground, calming a little as they realize:

                                          EARL
                            Prairie dog burrow...

                                          VAL
                            Little sons of bitches.

               Rhonda tenses as she hears a sound she knows well -- the soft
               scratching of the seismograph needle across its paper
               cylinder.  She whacks Val on the shoulder and points
               speechlessly at it.


         55    INSERT - SEISMOGRAPH                                         55

               The needle is going wild!!


         56    BACK TO SCENE                                                56

               She doesn't have to explain.  All three of them dash dash for:


         57    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - DAY                                    57

               The remains of an old rail fence lay beside one of the
               boulders.  Val, Earl, and Rhonda scramble over the wood, up
               onto the rock and stand there tensely.

               In a moment, the creature gently rustles the earth at the
               base of the rock.  The monster's slimy hook-tentacles slither
               out, searching the rock base.  Shuddering, the humans move as
               high as they can, well out of reach.  The tentacles slip back
               beneath the earth.  Everyone breathes a sigh of relief.

                                          EARL
                            Well, at least the bastard can't
                            climb.  Pardon my French.

                                          RHONDA
                            Probably couldn't move too easily
                            on the surface.

                                          VAL
                            God, the live ones smell worse tan
                            the dead ones.

                                          EARL
                            Okay, now, how far's your truck?

               Rhonda points.  They can see the roof of her truck, maybe a
               hundred yards away through the boulders.  Val and Earl think
               about it.

                                          VAL
                            I don't know.  If this one's any
                            faster than that other one...

                                          EARL
                                   (nods)
                            I think we wait right here.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


         58    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - SUNSET                                 58

               It's hours later.  Stiff and uncomfortable, they have nothing
               to do but theorize.

                                          RHONDA
                            There's nothing like them in the
                            fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so
                            they predate the fossil record...
                                   (not buying it herself)
                            That'd make them a couple of
                            billion years old...and we've just
                            never seen one till now.  Right.

                                          EARL
                            I'd vote for outer space.  No way
                            those are local boys.

                                          VAL
                                   (joking)
                            Atomic testing.  Or, no, bio-
                            engineering!  The government built
                            them, a big surprise in the next
                            war.

               There's a long pause.  Earl stares at the dirt around the rock.

                                          EARL
                            Well...haven't seen a sign for
                            hours.  Maybe it's long gone.

                                          VAL
                            Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a
                            little stroll and see?

                                          EARL
                            Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, we've got to do something.

               Val gets an idea.  He grabs a post from the dilapidated fence
               and cautiously slips down near the boulder's edge.

                                          EARL
                            Watch yourself!  It's got a good
                            six foot reach.

               Val nods.  Dead silence as he reaches way out with the post
               and scrapes it on the ground.  Almost instantly the creature
               roars up, grabbing the post in a flurry of flying dirt and
               lashing tentacles, nearly hooking Val's hand.  Val
               practically falls over himself scrambling back to safety.

                                          VAL
                            Son of a bitch!

                                          EARL
                            Son of a goddamned bitch!  Been
                            waiting there all this time.  How
                            the hell's it even know we're still
                            here?

                                          VAL
                            It's been listening to us.  It's
                            got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't
                            smell anything underground, so I
                            figure...

               Rhonda stares at Val, impressed.

                                          RHONDA
                            Of course!  It can sense the
                            slightest seismic vibration...hear
                            every move we make.  Especially on
                            this rock.  It's a perfect
                            conductor.

               They all settle back, having no idea what to do next.  Rhonda
               gazes out at the desert that surrounds them like an ocean.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            I always wanted to be stuck on a
                            desert island.  But somehow I
                            always imagined, you know, water.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

         58A   EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - NIGHT                                 58A

               Our heroes are silhouetted against a huge, spectacular,
               desert night sky.  After a very long pause:

                                          EARL
                            You know, I hate to be crude, but
                            I'm gonna have to take care of some
                            business here.

                                          VAL
                                   (emphatic)
                            Me, too.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (just as emphatic)
                            Same here.

               The silhouettes shift, Val and Earl moving down one side of
               the rock, and Rhonda down the other.  We can no longer see
               them.  We just head zippers zipping down -- then soft sighs
               of relief from Val and Earl.  Then:

                                          RHONDA (V.O.)
                                   (softly)
                            Darn it!

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            You okay?

                                          RHONDA (V.O.)
                            Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you
                            ever wanted proof God is a man,
                            this is it.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


         59    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - DAWN                                   59

               Rich orange sunlight creeps silently across the deathly still
               desert.  Earl is already awake.  Val is curled up without his
               jacket, shivering.  He wakes with a start.  Where the hell's
               his jacket?

               Rhonda wakes slowly.  She's surprised to find herself wrapped
               in Val's jacket.  Touched by his chivalry, she embarrassedly
               hands it to baffled Val.

                                          RHONDA
                            Thanks.

               Val glances at Earl, who looks away.  Who, me?

                                          VAL
                                   (to Rhonda)
                            No problem.  Anytime.

               Earl gropes through his pockets, coming up with only
               cigarettes.  Val fishes in his own pockets, finding only
               their lighter.  They exchange items and light up during:

                                          EARL
                            Well, folks, what's the plan?

                                          VAL
                            First let's see if Stumpy's still
                            out there.

               This time he tosses a piece of wood out onto the sand.  With
               soft rustling, a bulge forms in the earth, moves over to the
               wood, then subsides.  Rhonda starts looking around during:

                                          EARL
                            Don't he have a home to go to?

                                          VAL
                                   (grim)
                            Well, that's why Edgar never got
                            down off that tower.

                                          RHONDA
                            I might have an idea...

                                          EARL
                                   (ignoring her)
                            We're gonna have to come up with
                            some kind of plan or it's just
                            gonna wait us to death.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, I was wondering if we
                            could...

                                          VAL
                            Well, let's just run for it.  We
                            outran that one yesterday, at least
                            on a sprint.

               Rhonda gives up on them.  She goes over and pulls a long
               cross rail from the fence during:

                                          EARL
                            Run for it?  Running's not a plan.
                            Running is what you do when the
                            plan fails.  You're not even trying
                            to come up with a plan!

                                          VAL
                            Well, it's not like we've got a
                            hell of a lot of options...

                                          RHONDA
                                   (interrupting)
                            You guys know how to pole vault?

               They watch in surprise as she hefts her pole, checks the
               balance, eyeballs the distance to the nearest boulder.  Then
               she charges between them, plants her pole and vaults smoothly
               over to the next boulder, maybe fifteen feet away.  The
               creature surfaces where her pole touched down, but too late
               -- a hook tentacle vainly sweeps the area, the disappears
               into the ground.  Val and Earl glance at each other,
               impressed.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            We just stay where it can't get
                            us...on these residual boulders.
                            My truck's parked right next to
                            one.

               Earl rushes to grab a couple more fence rails.

                                          EARL
                            Stay on those residual boulders!

               Val just stands staring across at Rhonda -- his horizons are
               broadening.  Earl stuffs a fence rail into his hands.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                                   (pointedly)
                            Tammy Lynn Baxter, she do a lot of
                            pole-vaulting?

               Earl takes a deep breath and goes for it, vaulting across to
               Rhonda.  Val follows.


         60    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - WIDE SHOT - DAY                        60

               Through the shimmering heat in the distance we see the
               strange sight of the three figures vaulting from boulder to
               boulder.


         61    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - RHONDA'S TRUCK - DAY                   61

               Val, Earl and Rhonda pole-vault their way toward the truck.
               Finally they're at the nearest boulder, but the truck is
               still ten feet away.

                                          VAL
                            Think it's still following us?

                                          RHONDA
                            Let's assume that it is.

                                          EARL
                            And once we hit that truck we gotta
                            go fast.  I say we all jump together.

               Rhonda and Val nod.  Rhonda grips her car keys in her teeth.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (through clenched teeth)
                            Ready?

                                          VAL
                            Yeah.  One, two, three...

               They all vault in unison, landing in the truck bed.  Rhonda
               scrambles up, slides open the cab's rear window, and begins
               wriggling through headfirst.

                                          EARL
                                   (whispers)
                            Come on, girl, it ain't gonna give
                            us much time...

               Dust explodes around the rear of the truck!  Hook-tentacles
               snake up on all sides, narrowly missing Val.  He and Earl
               grab whatever's handy, pounding at the tentacles with
               expensive instruments.

                                          VAL
                            GO!  GO!  GO!

               Rhonda's only half way through the cab window, still hanging
               headfirst into the cab.  She frantically starts the truck,
               dives down and punches the accelerator with her fist.

               As the truck roars away, one tentacles manages to tear off the
               the muffler.  The engine thunders like a tank.  Val and Earl
               sit back, sighing in relief, then react when they see
               Rhonda is driving upside down and blind.


         62    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 62

               Rhonda skids her noisy truck to a halt in front of Pham Van's.

                                          VAL
                            We better get everybody together.

               Val leaps out and jumps into his pick-up truck.  He searches
               for the key.

                                          EARL
                            You go north, I'll go south.

                                          VAL
                            Right.

               Val holds out his hand for the key.  Earl tosses it to him.
               Val drives off.  We FOLLOW Rhonda and Earl as they drive the
               other way, toward Viola's.

                                          EARL
                            I'll bet you're sorry the college
                            ever sent you up here.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, I'm scared, but I'm not
                            sorry.

                                          EARL
                            You know, Val went to that college,
                            too.  For a whole year.  Couldn't
                            quite sit still for it, though.
                            Had too much vinegar in his system.
                            But once he settles down, forgets
                            this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in
                            a million.

               Rhonda sees straight through Earl's clumsy attempt at match-
               making.  She can't help but smile.  Earl grins sheepishly.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            All right, I'm about as subtle as
                            a donkey's ass.  Pardon my French.
                            I'm just saying the boy's got
                            potential, that's all.

               MOVE IN on Rhonda -- her and Val?


         63    INT. PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                  63

               Nestor, Viola, Nancy, and Miguel nervously crowd around Val,
               Earl, and Rhonda.  Viola holds her yappy dog which perio-
               dically snarls and snaps at people.  Pham Van is on his CB
               radio trying to contact Burt and Heather.

                                          MIGUEL
                            You serious, Val?  You think we're
                            not even safe here in town?

                                          VAL
                            Ask me that after you meet one.  I
                            think we should all get the hell
                            out while the getting's good.

                                          NESTOR
                            Why not just take a Number Ten pick
                            axe and give it one good whack...?

                                          VAL
                            Nestor, damn it, these things are
                            bigger than an Airstream trailer!

                                          NANCY
                            God, I've got to find Mindy.

               Nancy rushes out.

                                          EARL
                            Hey, Pham, where's Burt and Heather?

                                          PHAM VAN
                                   (hangs up CB)
                            Can't raise them.  I guess they're
                            still out there somewhere.

                                          RHONDA
                            If you've got a radio, why aren't
                            you calling somebody in Bixby?  The
                            police or...

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Can't reach outside the valley.
                            You know, because of the mountains.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, Rhonda, what's the name you
                            call those things, huh?

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Where'd they come from?

                                          RHONDA
                            Huh?  I don't know.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            You're a scientist, right?

                                          VIOLA
                            You should have a theory at least.

                                          RHONDA
                            Look, these things are absolutely
                            unprecedented!

                                          NESTOR
                            Yeah, but where'd they come from?

                                          RHONDA
                                   (exasperated)
                            Where'd they come from?  Okay,
                            worms, probably in the Jurassic
                            period.  Cosmic radiation was much
                            higher then...so they mutated...and
                            they got so big they just sank
                            right into the ground and fell
                            asleep... But now continental drift
                            has brought them to the surface,
                            ready to be harvested by the
                            ancient alien meat growers who
                            planted them here.

               Everybody stares at her, then they smile, realizing she's
               pulling their legs.

                                          EARL
                            You're right, don't matter where
                            they come from.

                                          VAL
                            Right.  We need to be talking about
                            what we're gonna do.

                                          VIOLA
                            My goodness, Valentine, once they
                            see the road is out and the phone
                            lines are down, someone will be
                            along to look in on us.  Don't you
                            think?


         64    EXT.  CANYON ROAD - DAY                                      64

               We see the utility truck still parked near the landslide
               blocking the road.  REVEAL, on the far side, a telephone
               maintenance truck is now parked, emergency lights flashing --
               and nearby, amid phoneworkers' climbing and repair gear, two
               more hard hats lying on blood-soaked ground.


         65    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 65

               The crowd is still jabbering away.  Rhonda speak over them:

                                          RHONDA
                            No no no, they listen!  They can
                            sense the slightest vibration
                            through the ground.  That's how
                            they see!  That's how they hunt!

                                          MIGUEL
                            So, like we don't vibrate, right?
                            Maybe they won't even come to here,
                            huh?  Maybe they leave us alone.

               Val shakes his head, and marches over to the topographic map
               on the wall.

                                          VAL
                            They caught up with Edgar here.
                            They grabbed Old Fred here.  They
                            nailed the asshole dog here.  And the
                            doctor's place is here...

               The spots he indicates describe a line leading along the
               valley straight toward town.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            This valley's just one long
                            smorgasbord and if we don't haul
                            ass outta here we're the next
                            course.

               We hear an a eerie SHRIEK from outside.  Something shoots in
               through the window, striking Earl in the chest!!  Earl flails
               frantically at it -- but it's only Melvin's basketball.  We
               glimpse Melvin outside, doubled over with laughter.  Earl
               grabs the ball and hurls it viciously back, but Melvin easily
               dodges it.

                                          EARL
                            You little ass wipe!  You knock
                            that off or you're gonna be
                            shitting that basketball!  Pardon
                            my French.

                                          NESTOR
                                   (to Val)
                            Now, Val, let's assume they're as
                            dangerous as you say.  Where are we
                            going to go that's safer than right
                            here?

                                          VAL
                            Rhonda's got an idea about that.

                                          RHONDA
                            Yes, see, they move very easily
                            through the Pleistocene Alluvials...
                                   (off their blank looks)
                            ...the dirt...the loose soil that
                            makes up the valley floor.  But
                            they can't move through solid rock.
                            I think we should travel west to
                            the mountains.

                                          EARL
                            You know, up the jeep trail.

                                          RHONDA
                            The mountains are solid granite.
                            We'd be safe there, and we could
                            hike along them...all the way to
                            Bixby if we have to.


         66    EXT.  EDGE OF TOWN - DAY                                     66

               Nancy rushes back toward Pham Van's, still looking.

                                          NANCY
                            Mindy!  Mindy!


         67    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 67

               We're CLOSE on Melvin as he circles around the back of Pham
               Van's, bouncing his basketball, mischief in his eyes.  We can
               hear the townsfolk inside.

                                          VIOLA (V.O.)
                            No, Valentine, I'm not leaving my
                            place.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            Well, it's gonna take us days to
                            get back with help.

                                          EARL (V.O.)
                            Doggone it, Viola, it's just plain
                            crazy to stay.

               Then, to Melvin's astonishment, the steady rhythm of his
               bouncing basketball suddenly stops.  The ball just goes flup
               and doesn't bounce back up to him.  He looks down.  No ball!
               Just swirling dust at his feet.


         68    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 68

               Everyone jumps as we once more hear an ear-shattering SHRIEK
               from Melvin.  Earl snarls and heads for the door, Val right
               behind them.

                                          EARL
                            I'm gonna kick his ass!

                                          VAL
                            I'm gonna help you.


         69    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 69

               Val and Earl are well ahead of the other townsfolk as they
               march around to the side of Pham Van's.  But where's Melvin?
               Nothing out here but the oppressive, hot desert silence.
               Then they hear a soft shuddering whimper -- from above.
               There's terrified Melvin, halfway up a telephone pole,
               clinging to it desperately.

               Val and Earl freeze in their tracks and glance at each
               other, realizing instantly what's up.  Without a word they
               leap desperately in opposite directions.  Like a breaching
               whale, a creature roars up through the earth right where they
               were standing, great mouth gaping open, slimy tentacles
               lashing in all directions.

               The townsfolk scatter, some heading for their homes,
               including Viola and Nestor.  Others scramble over each other
               as they pile back into Pham Van's.  The telephone pole
               shudders.  Melvin falls and scampers for the nearest hiding
               place, a corrugated tin storage shed near Pham Van's.


         70    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 70

               Val, Earl, Rhonda, Miguel, and Pham Van rush in.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Jesus Christ!  Man, you gut a gun?!

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Big as a house!  What are we gonna
                            do...?!

                                          RHONDA
                            Quiet!  QUIET!!

               Miguel and Pham shut up.  Then we hear something new -- the
               building itself creaking and groaning like a ship.  The
               liquor bottles behind Pham Van's bar vibrate and clink.  The
               creature is moving beneath the building.  The people freeze
               like mannequins.  Now we can hear its pig-like snorting.
               Pham Van and Miguel react as the awful smell percolates up
               through the floorboards.  Val signals them to keep quiet.
               Finally, the creaking stops.

               Rhonda addresses the group in an intense whisper:

                                          RHONDA
                            Remember...no noise.  No vibration.

               Everyone stands stock still -- and sweats.  But, then, slowly
               we become aware of a faint, yet oddly familiar sound.
               Squeak, squeak, squeak -- Mindy on her pogo stick!  They all
               scramble to the windows.


         71    EXT.  MAIN STREET - DAY                                      71

               There she is, alone in the vacant street, Walkman blaring in
               her ears, merrily bouncing along to a rock 'n' roll beat.


         72    ANGLE - PHAM VAN'S STORE                                     72

               Thoughts of personal safety vanish as the horrified people
               lean way out the doors and windows and shout with one voice:

                                          CROWD
                                   (ad lib)
                            MINDY!
                            Get off your pogo stick!
                            Get in here, girl!
                            Run, Mindy!


         73    ANGLE - MINDY                                                73

               She can't hear them over her Walkman.  A tell-tale puff of
               dust spurts up not fifty feet from her!


         74    ANGLE - PHAM VAN'S STORE                                     74

               Val sees Mindy has only seconds left!  He vaults straight out
               the window and charges toward her!  Right behind him comes
               Earl and Rhonda.


         75    ANGLE - NANCY                                                75

               As she rounds a corner at the opposite end of town.  She
               spots Mindy, then sees Val running.  She starts running.

                                          NANCY
                            Mindy!  Mindy!


         76    ANGLE - MINDY                                                76

               She's lazily bouncing in circles -- squeak, squeak, squeak.
               She goes wide-eyed as she rotates to see Val coming at her
               like a mad bull, arms outstretched.  The asphalt under her
               pogo stick cracks and --

               Val tackles her, both of them tumbling head over heels.  She
               scrambles up, rubbing her skinned elbow and yelling:

                                          MINDY
                            Oww!  Val, you hurt me...!

               Val claps his hand over her mouth.  She goes wide eyed as she
               sees: her pogo stick standing straight up in the cracked
               asphalt!  Then it is sucked down like so much spaghetti!

               Nancy rushes into frame, hugging Mindy.  Val signals her to
               be quiet.  They sit uneasily.  Where's the creature?
               Suddenly the pogo stick erupts out of the earth right in
               their midst!

               Val runs one way, Nancy and Mindy the other, heading up the
               street toward their house.  Val scrambles up onto his pick-up
               truck!  The creature rams the truck, rupturing a tire.  As it
               shakes the truck violently, Val spots Rhonda and Earl, now
               standing uncertainly halfway between him and Pham Van's.

                                          VAL
                            Go back, for chrissake!

               Rhonda and Earl hesitate.

                                          EARL
                            We gotta get him off there.  It'll
                            suck that truck down!

               But Earl now hears something behind them!  Down the street,
               a little wall of cinder blocks framing Viola's driveway
               suddenly topples over.

                                          EARL
                            Oh, Jesus.  Rhonda, another one!


         77    ANGLE - LOW CAMERA - RHONDA AND EARL                         77

               CAMERA charges toward them.  Earl swerves toward Pham Van's,
               but Rhonda is cut off!  She heads toward the next nearest
               haven:


         78    EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     78

               The storage shed where Melvin is hiding.  It sits in a
               vacant, weed-choked lot.  Crashing through the weeds, Rhonda
               has almost reached the shed when she is suddenly brought up
               short and slams face down in a cloud of dust!

               She can't get up!!  Something's got her!  She's caught in an
               old rusted barbed wire fence, lying almost flat, hidden in
               the weeds.  Some strands have come loose and are curled up
               like vicious concertina wire.

               Barely has she taken this in when -- the ground caves in
               under her!  She rolls wildly to one side as hook-tentacles
               snake up, missing her by inches!  She keeps rolling-crawling-
               scrambling -- anything to get away from the awful maw -- but
               gets her legs hopelessly tangled in the barbed wire.  She
               freezes.  The creature feels around where she was.

               She calms herself, pulling gingerly at the wire, working
               tensely to free herself but --

               The creature's mouth slams shut on the fence.  Like a spider
               sensing something caught in its web, the monster knows it's
               on to something.  Its hook-tentacles shoot forward to snare
               three feet of fence, then the creature lunges up and out,
               swallowing that three feet in a big "gulp" and yanking Rhonda
               violently toward it!  She screams, pants ripped, legs slashed
               and bleeding!  GULP!  She's dragged even closer.


         79    EXT.  MAIN STREET - THE PICK-UP - DAY                        79

               The truck shakes and shimmies as Val's creature tries to pull
               it down.  Val sees that Rhonda's in trouble.  He searches
               frantically for a weapon -- and finds one -- a CHAIN SAW!  He
               leaps as far from the truck as he can and hits the ground
               running, yanking furiously on the saw's starter cord.


         80    EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     80

               Rhonda is in a dead panic, thrashing helplessly in the barbed
               wire.  The beast takes another gulp of fence, wrenching her
               within inches of a probing hook-tentacle!  Suddenly we hear a
               nasty ROAR as Val's chain saw swings in, slicing the squirm-
               ing tentacle in half, spraying gore everywhere!  The creature
               unleashes an unearthly shriek, and the other tentacles
               recoil.  The severed one writhes like a beheaded snake.

               Val yanks off Rhonda's boots.

                                          VAL
                            Come on!  Outta your pants!

               She frantically claws at her belt.  But in mere seconds:

                                          RHONDA
                                   (pointing)
                            LOOK OUT!

               Tentacles snake out to regain their grip on the fence.  Val
               grabs the saw and starts slashing wildly, but this time the
               hook-tentacles snag it and wrench it from his grasp.  It
               slams to the ground, motor dying.  The monster readies itself
               for the lunge that will suck Rhonda in.  Val grabs her under
               the arms and pulls.  Rhonda wriggles wildly to get out of her
               wire enmeshed pants.

               The creature lunges!  Rhonda pulls free!  She and Val tumble
               backward.  The creature gets only a mouthful of Rhonda's jeans.

               The next instant the second creature explodes up through the
               ground right next to fallen Val and Rhonda!  They roll
               sideways, come up running, and sprint for Pham Van's along an
               old wooden sidewalk.


         81    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 81

               Earl flings open the front door.  Val and Rhonda race toward
               the porch.  Right on their heels the creature ripples the
               boards like an ocean wave!

                                          EARL
                            Come on!  Come on!  Don't look back!
                            Just run!  Run like screaming fuck!

               They dive through the open door of Pham Van's.  The rippling
               boards zoom on past it.  Earl quickly eases the door shut.


         82    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 82

               Earl turns to breathless Rhonda.

                                          EARL
                                   (whispers)
                            Pardon my French.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


         83    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - LATER                               83

               It's a tense, edgy group.  Every movement made is in slow
               motion, every word is a whisper.   They gaze grimly out the
               windows at the silent, deserted, heat-shimmering main street.

               Val gingerly dabs iodine onto the cuts on Rhonda's legs.
               She doesn't even wince.

                                          VAL
                            You paying attention?  This oughta
                            hurt like hell.

                                          RHONDA
                            It does.

               She smiles at him.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            So, is that one of your usual jobs,
                            saving peoples' lives?

                                          VAL
                                   (embarrassed)
                            First time for me.

               She gazes at him.  He looks away.  Over at the bar, Pham
               holds up a new pair of pants for Rhonda.

                                          RHONDA
                            Oh, thank you.

               Grateful for something to do, Val eases over to get the
               pants.  Rhonda looks after him.  Then she becomes aware of
               someone staring at her.  It's Earl, giving her a big Cheshire
               cat grin that says "What did I tell you?"

               Pham hands the pants to Val.  Then Pham and Miguel reach
               simultaneously for a sods bottle and -- knock it over!  It
               rolls all the way down the bar as a flurry of desperate hands
               try to stop it.  No good.  It rolls off the end and -- CRASH!

               Everyone freezes.  Sure enough the building shudders.  Floor
               boards creak and bend as searching tentacles thump and scrape
               along under the floor.  People close their eyes, not even
               breathing.  Finally the noise subsides.  Everyone relaxes --
               a little.

                                          MIGUEL
                            So what are we gonna do, you know?
                            How long till they go away?

                                          EARL
                                   (shakes his head)
                            They got the patience of Job.  They
                            just sit and goddamn wait til they
                            hear something that sounds like
                            lunch.  We need a plan.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            I've got a plan.  You and Val take
                            your truck, get to the mountains.
                            Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.

                                          VAL
                            Those scumsuckers are my radials,
                            Pham!

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, we can take my truck then.

                                          EARL
                            No good.  You need major four-
                            wheel-drive just to get up that
                            jeep trail.

               They all shut up when they hear Viola's dog yapping in the
               distance.


         84    EXT.  VIOLA'S TRAILER - DAY                                  84

               Up the hill across from Pham Van's, the old trailer looks
               perfectly peaceful.  Except Viola's dog keeps yapping.  Then
               we hear panicked Viola.

                                          VIOLA (V.O.)
                            Quiet!  Quiet you hateful thing...!

                                          EARL
                            Shut it up!  Shut the little
                            bastard up!

                                          VAL
                            Chuck him out the door!  Like a
                            little hors d'oeuvre.



               INT.  VIOLA'S TRAILER - DAY

               We hear a loud whap!  The dog's bark simply changes to
               piercing yelps.  It would be funny except --

               The trailer suddenly bucks upward, hit from below as though
               by a pile driver!  Again and again the unseen creatures slam
               into the frail structure.

                                          VIOLA (V.O.)
                            Get away!  Get away!  Oh God in
                            heaven, help me!

               The trailer is finally knocked right off its foundation!  It
               tips over and tumbles all the way down the hill!  As the dust
               clears, all is silent.  A huge hole is torn in the trailer's
               floor.  Viola's possessions are scattered everywhere.


         86    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 86

               Everyone stares in shock.

                                          RHONDA
                            Oh my God.

                                          EARL
                            Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid,
                            scum...

                                          VAL
                            Gotta do something.  Gotta get the
                            bastards!

                                          MIGUEL
                                   (hopeless)
                            Man, what the hell can we do to
                            those things?

                                          EARL
                            Well, we're sure as hell not going
                            to sit here being quiet for God
                            knows how long.  Are we?

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Now wait a minute, Earl.  I got
                            enough food here to last us for
                            weeks.  Those damn things can't
                            wait around forever.
                                   (pause)
                            We can do it.  I mean, if we have
                            to, right?

               Everyone turns away from the windows, gingerly sitting down,
               glumly pondering this possibility.  There is a long silence.

               Then suddenly -- ROAR!  The silence is shattered as Pham
               Van's big freezer compressor suddenly comes on.

                                          EARL
                            Jesus!  Shut it off!

               Pham runs to the freezer.  Its on/off switch is buried behind
               stacks of soft-drink cases.  He tears at them like a madman,
               toppling them this way and that.  Earl and Val join him.

               But right behind Pham, the floor BUCKLES UP, a monster's
               snout BURSTING THROUGH and engulfing one of his legs!  The
               creature starts to back down into the jagged hole, dragging
               screaming Pham with it.  Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Miguel grab
               Pham's arms but are no match for the monster.  It shakes and
               spins him like some gigantic dog, effortlessly throwing them
               off, relentlessly pulling Pham down.

               The hole in the floor is too small for Pham to fit through!
               As one leg goes down, the other is bent hideously backward.
               Pham screams and screams as jagged wood tears into him, bones
               snap, ribs crack.  The others grab him again but are utterly
               helpless.  With vicious, powerful jerks the creature yanks
               his man mangled body down.  The last thing we see is his foot,
               now folded back past his head, and he's gone.

               Val is wild with helpless anger.

                                          VAL
                            Son of a bitch!  Son of a bitch!

               The floor bulges up in another place!  A second creature!
               Then a third, coming RIGHT UP UNDER THEM!  Earl sprawls onto
               the bar.  Rhonda springs onto the shelves in the middle of the
               store, knocking groceries everywhere.  Val and Miguel climb up
               shelves which cover the rear wall of the store.

               The whole building shakes and shudders, dust powdering down
               from the ceiling.  Flailing tentacles are everywhere,
               slashing open food packages; clouds of flour fill the air!

               Val spots a hatch in the ceiling.

                                          VAL
                            Everybody!  This way!  The roof!

               Earl leaps from the bar to the rear shelves.  Val and Miguel
               slide sideways till they're beneath the hatch, then use the
               shelves as a ladder, climbing up to the hatch.  Val pounds on
               it frantically.

               In the middle of the store, Rhonda leaps from shelf to shelf,
               trying to get closer to where Val is.  Soon she reaches the
               last one, balancing precariously.  But a creature tips over
               the first one!  The shelves topple like dominoes, crashing
               toward Rhonda.  She is half catapulted, half jumps right
               through an open window, ripping through the screen.

               Val sees what's happened.  With maniacal strength he smashes
               open the hatch and climbs out onto --


         87    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          87

               Val rushes to the edge of the roof shouting:

                                          VAL
                            Rhonda!  Keep moving.  Don't stop!

               He looks down where Rhonda fell.  She's not there.  He hears
               a whistle and is relieved to see:


         88    EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      88

               Rhonda is perched as high as she can get on the water tower
               near Pham Van's.  It's maybe twenty-five feet tall, a simple
               wood frame holding a big galvanized tank.  The wooden legs
               stand on big concrete anchors buried in the ground.


         89    EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     89

               Melvin peers terrified out the shed door, up at the guys on
               Pham Van's roof.

                                          MELVIN
                            Hey!  What's going on, man?!  What
                            the hell you doing up there...?!

                                          MIGUEL
                            Melvin, shut the hell up!

               It's too late.  Wham!  A creature strikes.  The little shed
               shudders, dust puffing from every old seam.  In a split
               second Melvin has climbed to the shed roof.


         90    EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    90

               Nancy and Mindy peer to the window, surprised to see the men
               on Pham Van's roof.


         91    EXT.  PERFECTION - WIDE - DAY                                91

               We hear Val's shouting to the remaining townsfolk.

                                          VAL
                            Nancy!  Nestor!


         92    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          92

                                          VAL
                            Get up on your roof!  On your roof!
                            They can come through the floor!

               The store shakes and shimmies.  We hear the monster's
               thunderous crashing from below.

                                          EARL
                            Can't you shout a little quieter?


         93    EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - DAY                           93

               Burt and Heather's place, about a mile from town, is no-
               nonsense, functional, ugly -- unpainted concrete walls, no
               yard, chain-link fence.  Burt and Heather drive up in their
               big Blazer and park right beside the house.  Hot and tired,
               they climb out, each carrying a heavy, scoped hunting rifle.
               Burt peers toward Perfection through binoculars during:

                                          HEATHER
                            I can't believe it.  No tracks, no
                            sign, no spoor.

                                          BURT
                            Yeah, whatever they are, you'd
                            think after they ate all those
                            sheep they'd have to take a dump
                            someplace...
                                   (reacts to what he sees)
                            What the hell's going on in town?


         94    EXT.  PERFECTION - TELEPHOTO - BURT'S P.O.V. - DAY           94

               The town is a very strange sight.  It's as though an
               invisible flood were in progress, driving people to high
               ground.  We see: Rhonda perched on the water tower; Val, Earl
               and Miguel on the store roof; Nancy and Mindy on their roof;
               Melvin on the storage shed; Nestor on his roof.


         95    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          95

               Val, Earl and Miguel gaze out at the town, trying to concoct
               a plan.   Suddenly Earl perks up.  The men speak softly.

                                          EARL
                            Hey, here's the plan: Nestor's
                            Cadillac.  His tires are nine
                            hundred sixteens.  We sprint for
                            it, grab the spare, put it on our
                            truck with our spare.

               Val stares at him, incredulous.

                                          VAL
                            How the hell long it take you to
                            change a tire?

                                          EARL
                                   (sighs)
                            Just about too damn long.  Bolt
                            pattern's probably wrong anyway.

                                          VAL
                            We need another plan.

               Suddenly, down in the store, Pham Van's CB radio squawks
               loudly.

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Yo, P.V., Burt here.  Come back.

               The building shudders as the creatures again smash through
               the floor inside, looking for the source of the noise.  Val,
               Earl and Miguel scramble to the edge of the roof.


         96    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 96

               The CB radio sits on a shelf near an open window.  Tentacles
               are feeling along the wall just below it.  Val appears out-
               side the window -- upside-down.  He snatches the radio and is
               hauled straight up out of frame.

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Pham?  Anybody copy?


         97    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          97

               Miguel and Earl haul Val by the feet back up onto the roof.
               Val quickly turns down the CB volume.

                                          VAL
                                   (whispers into mic)
                            Burt, now listen.  We found out
                            what's been killing people.  Over?


         98    INT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                98

               A peculiar cross between bomb shelter and blue-collar den,
               Burt's wood-paneled basement has all the comforts for post-
               Apocalypse living.  Burt talks on his CB.

                                          BURT
                            Negative copy on that, Pham, check
                            your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                                   (a little louder)
                            Burt, can you hear me now?

                                          BURT
                            Just barely, Pham.  What are you
                            all doing up on your roofs. What
                            the hell's going on?  Come back.

               A few feet away Heather works at their ammunition reloading
               bench.  She dumps a few hundred empty cartridge cases into a
               case cleaner and switches it on.  It HUMS loudly as it
               vibrates.


         99    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 99

               The groping tentacles swiftly suck back below the floor.
               TILT UP to see out the window some distance away, a couple of
               old trash cans topple over as the creature streaks past
               beneath them, making a bee-line for Burt's.


         100   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          100

               Miguel points frantically at the trash cans.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Oh man, they're going, man!  I
                            think they're going for Burt!

               Val talks a little louder into the mic.  INTERCUT as needed.

                                          VAL
                            Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of
                            your basement!!  Take your radio!
                            You and Heather get up on your
                            roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Val?  What the hell you doing back
                            already?

                                          VAL
                                   (shouts)
                            Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof
                            or someplace!  We found out what's
                            been killing people!  They're under
                            the ground!

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            What's under the ground?  We're not
                            getting up on the roof.  Earth
                            shelter's the best.  Known that
                            since I was a kid.

                                          VAL
                            Listen!  Listen!  We know what they
                            are!  They're big things under the
                            ground!  Much bigger than we
                            thought!  They're coming after you!
                            They're coming right now!


         101   INT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                101

               Hearing that warning, Burt and Heather go into a well-honed
               drill.  They grab their hunting rifles and take positions at
               basement windows.  Burt scans with the binoculars.  He sees
               nothing.  He glances at Heather.  She shrugs.  Nobody coming.

                                          BURT
                                   (into CB)
                            We don't see anything, Val.  Now
                            what the hell are you talking
                            about?  Over.

               Val is frantic.  How do you explain these things?

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            They're coming underground!  They
                            ...they can dig like a son of a
                            bitch...Big monsters under the
                            ground, Burt!  Now get the hell
                            out!  Hurry!

               Burt and Heather exchange looks.  Has Val gone nuts?  Then
               they hear a low RUMBLE, growing louder and louder.  Tools
               hanging over the work bench start to shake; the decorative
               cow skulls on the wall rattle; the overhead lights sway --
               and then -- everything stops.  Dead silence, except for the
               humming of the case cleaner.

               THEN THE WALL MOVES!!  The wood paneling bulges slightly.
               Nails pop out.  The wall is pushed again; the paneling
               cracks.  A cow skull falls.  Burt and Heather level their
               rifles and --

               A huge creature pushes right through the wall!  Fully half
               its bulbous, spiked body writhes into the center of the
               room, great multi-part jaws drooling open, hook-tentacles
               lashing out.


         102   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          102

               The three men can hear the chaos over the CB.

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Jesus Chri...!

               The CB goes dead.  The men stare numbly.  Then, drifting
               across the desert, a soft popping sound.  The men perk up;
               they know what it is -- distant gunfire.


         103   INT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                103

               The gunfire is DEAFENING as Burt and Heather blast away.
               Globby blood spurts from a dozen wounds, and the creature
               pulls back a little.  The couple keeps firing until magazines
               are empty.  The creature lunges forward again.

               PAN with Burt and Heather to REVEAL a wall of the basement we
               haven't seen until now -- a wall covered with guns -- hand
               guns, long guns, riot guns, flare guns, antique guns,
               military guns, elephant guns.

               Heather grabs an HK-91 assault rifle, slams in two magazines,
               bottoms taped end to end, and opens fire!  A hook-tentacle
               snags her boot, yanking her right off her feet.  Burt pumps
               out eight devastating blasts from a twelve-gauge riot gun,
               severing the tentacle.  Heather is on her feet in an instant.
               She expertly flops her double magazine over, loading the full
               one taped upside-down to it, and opens fire again.  Burt
               grabs an AR-15 semi-auto and joins her.  They lay down
               massive fire, virtually disappearing in muzzle flash and
               smoke.  Ejected shell cases clatter and clang all around the
               room.

               The guns are empty.  THE CREATURE IS STILL COMING!  They back
               down the wall, desperately grabbing weapons one after
               another: a lever-action, a magnum handgun, even a flare gun
               which Heather fires right into the creature's mouth.
               Shrieking in pain, the horrid thing thing KEEPS WRIGGLING
               TOWARD THEM!

               Burt and Heather scramble up over a desk to keep something
               between them and it.  Burt smashes open a fancy glass case
               holding a huge four-gauge elephant gun.  He slams in two
               gigantic cartridges nearly an inch in diameter.  He fires.
               The concussion literally shakes the building.  The recoil
               slams Burt back against the wall.

               The monster bullets tear monster holes in the monster.  Great
               gouts of curdles blood spew from it -- Burt hit an artery or
               something.  The beast convulses grotesquely, then collapses,
               deflating like a beached whale.  Burt and Heather stagger
               together and hug each other fervently.  They stare dumbfounded
               at the massive dead horror.  Burt suddenly shouts vehemently:

                                          BURT
                            Broke into the wrong goddamn rec
                            room, didn't you, you BASTARD!


         104   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          104

               Val, Earl and Miguel listen to the silence hoping for some
               sign that their friends are alive.  Suddenly:

                                          BURT (V.O. filter)
                            We killed it!  You got that?  We
                            killed that motherfucker!  Come
                            back!

               It takes a moment for this to sink in, then the men CHEER --
               as quietly as possible.

                                          VAL
                            Uh...roger that, Burt.  Uh,
                            congratulations.  Uh, be advised,
                            however, there are four more,
                            repeat, four more motherfuckers.
                            Come back.


         105   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    105

               Burt and Heather dash out onto the roof, laden with weapons,
               ammo boxes and their CB radio.  They hit the deck, assorted
               rifles and the elephant gun the ready.


         106   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          106

               Val shouts to everyone:

                                          VAL
                            They got one!  They killed one of
                            the sons of bitches!


         107   EXT.  STORAGE SHED - ROOF - DAY                              107

               Melvin pumps his fist in the air.

                                          MELVIN
                            Way to go, dudes!


         108   EXT. THE STERNGOOD HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                        108

               Nancy and Mindy hug each other.


         109   EXT.  NESTOR'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                            109

               Perched on his Spanish tile roof, Nestor pours coffee from
               his thermos and raises his cup in a toast.


         110   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      110

               Rhonda lets out a WHOOP.


         111   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          111

               The men sit, temporarily jubilant.

                                          EARL
                            Well, I guess we don't get to make
                            fun of Burt's lifestyle anymore,
                            huh?

               Val grabs the CB mic.

                                          VAL
                            Burt, any chance you can get the
                            rest of them?


         112   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    112

               Burt and Heather peer from their fortress-like roof.  Burt
               spots earth bulging up near the foundation of his house.

                                          BURT
                                   (into CB)
                            One second, Val.

               He grabs the elephant gun and takes two well-aimed shots --
               two deafening BOOMS which echo off the distant mountains.
               But the bullets bury themselves harmlessly in the dirt.  The
               bulge in the dirt moves calmly away and sinks from view.
               Heather shakes her head.

                                          HEATHER
                            You're not getting any penetration,
                            even with the elephant gun.

                                          BURT
                            Damn!
                                   (into CB)
                            Val, we can't get them.  Never
                            figured on having to shoot through
                            dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop
                            there is.  Come back.


         113   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          113

               The men are disappointed.  That's not what they wanted to
               hear from Burt.  Then Earl perks up and grab the CB mic.

                                          EARL
                                   (into CB)
                            Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget
                            shooting them.  Tell me this: can
                            you get to your truck?

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            No problem.

                                          EARL
                            Good.  You've got the only truck in
                            the valley that can make it up that
                            damn jeep trail.  So, here's the
                            plan: You and Heather go for help.
                            Get to the mountains...

               But Rhonda interrupts, pointing urgently from the water
               tower.

                                          RHONDA
                            Hey, guys!  They're up to
                            something.

               Val, Earl and Miguel rush to the edge of the roof and look
               down where she's pointing --

               A creature is running its tentacles along the building's
               foundation.  It's a strange, more studied movement than we've
               seen before.

                                          VAL
                                   (to Rhonda)
                            What's it doing?

                                          RHONDA
                            Why do you all keep asking me?

               They all stare nervously down as the tentacles feel their way
               along the wall, moving toward a corner of the building.
               Suddenly Miguel spots something down the next wall.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, there's another one coming!

               Another set of tentacles is feeling along the adjacent wall.
               The two creatures meet at the corner, their tentacles touch-
               ing rather like ants' antennae.  They they submerge; tenta-
               cles zipping into the earth.  Nothing happens for a moment.

               Then the corner of the building suddenly heaves up a couple
               of feet.  Clapboard siding splits.  A warped window shatters.
               (We don't see the creatures, only the effect of their shoving
               from below).  The men nearly lose their balance.  Then the
               corner sinks back down.

                                          EARL
                            What the hell was that all about?


         114   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    114

               Nancy and Mindy are still huddled on the roof.  They don't
               make a sound.  They're startled when the house suddenly
               groans and tilts as creatures give it a tentative shove.
               Nancy and Mindy frantically cling to the peak of the smooth
               roof.  The picture windows shatters.  We hear beams POP and
               CRACK, dishes CRASH off shelves.  The front screen door
               swings open.  At last the house slowly settles back down.


         115   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          115

               The men are watching Nancy's house tensely.

                                          MIGUEL
                            They weren't making no noise.
                            Why they bothering them for?

                                          VAL
                                   (mind racing)
                            They're studying the buildings...
                            trying to figure them out.

               Rhonda chimes in from the water tower.

                                          RHONDA
                            Yeah, they're confused.  They can
                            feel our vibrations, but they can't
                            find us.

                                          VAL
                            They're working together, too.

                                          EARL
                            Yeah, like they got a plan...

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Breaker there, Earl.  What do you
                            want us to do?

                                          EARL
                                   (into CB)
                            Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up
                            to something.


         116   EXT.  NESTOR'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                            116

               Straddling the peak of his steeply sloping roof.  Nestor
               grabs on in panic as the creatures lift the place up slowly!
               The roof warps, Spanish tiles shatter and rain down on the
               ground.

               This causes a flurry of activity.  Tentacles snake around
               where the tiles fell.  We hear creatures crash through
               inside, snorting and huffing.  They attack the house in
               earnest, shaking it violently, pushing the front wall out
               till it falls flat.  The roof collapses on that side!  Nestor
               can't hang on!  He slides all the way down, landing across a
               window on the flattened wall.  The next instant he's grabbed
               and pulled through the window, right into the ground.  He
               SCREAMS!

               DOLLY along the ground, heading toward the storage shed where
               Melvin is.  All we can see is dirt, but we can still hear
               Nestor screaming UNDERGROUND!  His screams get more and more
               faint as DOLLY ENDS on:


         117   EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     117

               CLOSE ON horrified Melvin as he rocks back and forth
               autistically.

                                          MELVIN
                            Oh, wow, man!  No way!  No fucking
                            way, man...!


         118   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                             118

               Nancy comforts Mindy.


         119   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      119

               Rhonda turns away.


         120   EXT.  PHAM CAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          120

               Val, Earl and Miguel stare in horror and disbelief.  Miguel
               crosses himself.  They're in worse trouble than they thought.

                                          VAL
                            They knocked his place down on
                            purpose, man.  They're gonna tear
                            this whole town out from under us!


         121   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - DAY                           121

               Burt and Heather's truck is parked in foreground.  The couple
               is up on the roof in background.  Burt prowls along the edge
               of the roof with the elephant gun.  Heather mans the C.B.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            Burt!  Heather!

                                          HEATHER
                            Yeah, Val.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            We're in deep shit over here.
                            Let's change that plan.

               A hump of dirt raises near the base of the house.  Burt jerks
               the rifle to his shoulder and squeezes off a shot.  The hump
               moves away from the house.

                                          HEATHER
                            Knock it off, Burt!

                                          BURT
                            I think I scared it!

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            Forget going for help.  We'll all
                            be dead long before you get back.

               Still moving away, the hump of dirt passes under the side-
               walk, rippling the flagstones gently.

                                          HEATHER
                                   (into CB)
                            We're here, Val.  Just tell us what
                            you need.  Come back.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            They're tearing down the houses
                            here!  We all gotta get outta here
                            together!  Now!

               The hump of dirt passes under Burt and Heather's truck,
               rocking the vehicle slightly.

                                          HEATHER
                            We're with you, Val.  We'll come
                            get everybody.  Just hang on tight.

               The truck's security alarm starts BOOPING!  Burt and Heather
               stare down helplessly as the noisy truck is furiously
               attacked by the frenzied creatures.  Dust flies as metal rips
               and tires shred.


         122   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          122

               Val Earl and Miguel listen in disbelief to the distant truck
               alarm.  It finally sputters and dies.

                                          HEATHER (V.O.)
                            Val, we're going to have to forget
                            about the truck...

                                          VAL
                                   (into CB)
                            Yeah, Heather, we got you.

               They've hit rock-bottom.  They sit in helpless, desperate
               silence.

               Over on the storage shed roof, Melvin is losing it:

                                          MELVIN
                            Hey, you better think of something,
                            man!  You gotta do something!

                                          EARL
                            Who?

                                          MELVIN
                            You and Val, man!

               Miguel nods in agreement.  Val and Earl stare at him,
               incredulous.

                                          VAL
                            What?!!  Since when the hell's
                            every goddamn thing up to us?!

                                          RHONDA
                                   (flatly)
                            You guys do all the odd jobs.

               Val just stares at her.

               Then -- CRASH!  The store shudders, creaks, and groans.  The
               creatures are back.  One corner of the store lifts up, beams
               splintering.  Then another corner lifts up!  The roof tilts
               like the deck of a storm-tossed ship.  From now on the
               monsters shake and ram the building almost constantly.
               Hanging on tight, the men peer over the edge.

                                          EARL
                            We don't have a hell of a lot of
                            time here.

               Meanwhile, Rhonda tries her desperate best to be logical:

                                          RHONDA
                            Look, the situation hasn't changed.
                            We still have to get to solid rock.
                            There must be some way!

                                          VAL
                                   (shouts, angry)
                            Like what?!  There's nothing left
                            that'll make it to the mountains!

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, Val, quiet, man!

                                          VAL
                            We need a helicopter is what we
                            need, or a goddamn tank...

                                          EARL
                            Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we
                            take the Cat?

                                          VAL
                                   (dubious)
                            Jesus.  It's slower than hell.

                                          EARL
                            Yeah, but it weighs better than
                            thirty tons.  No way they could
                            stop it.

                                          MIGUEL
                            We can't all fit on that bulldozer.

               But Val is warming to the idea.

                                          VAL
                            But...we could pull something!  We
                            could, I don't know, drag a car
                            behind it!

                                          EARL
                            A car, huh?  Like a big armored
                            car?  Need something bigger,
                            tougher...our truck maybe...or,
                            hell, that old semi trailer!

                                          VAL
                            Its tires are flat...

                                          EARL
                            Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull
                            anything.

                                          VAL
                            Well...all right!  We just roll on
                            out of here!

                                          EARL
                            We got a plan!

               They squint at the bulldozer -- 'way in the distance.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            'Course, that's one helluva long
                            walk.

               They stare grimly, momentarily stuck for an idea.  Then:

                                          RHONDA
                            Listen, they only respond to
                            vibration, right?  Couldn't we...
                            distract them somehow?

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, good!  Something to keep them
                            busy.  We need a decoy.

                                          EARL
                            Hey, Melvin, you wanna make a buck?

                                          MELVIN
                            Fuck you!

               Miguel grabs Earl and points down at little garden tractor in
               a jumble of Pham Van's equipment and tools near the side of
               the store.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, how about the tractor?  Start
                            him up.  Let him go by itself.  Let
                            those things chase it all over is
                            they like that noise.

                                          EARL
                                   (nodding)
                            Not bad.
                                   (to Val)
                            What do you think?

               The store takes a heavy hit.  The front porch collapses with
               a terrific crash.

                                          VAL
                            I think the ground's getting
                            closer.  I think we do it.  We're
                            gonna save our asses here!

                                          RHONDA
                            Wait!  How are you going to know
                            they're all following it?

                                          VAL
                            Good point.

                                          EARL
                            We got two right here.

               Val scrambles to the highest point of the sagging roof and
               shouts to Nancy.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Nancy, we gotta find all four of
                            them.  How many you got over there?


         123   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                             123

               The house shuddering and shaking.

                                          NANCY
                            There's one.  I think one.


         124   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          124

               Earl grabs the CB mic.

                                          EARL
                                   (into CB)
                            Burt, Heather, we got a little sort
                            of a plan going here, maybe.  Can
                            you tell if you've still got any of
                            those things out at your place?
                            Come back.


         125   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    125

                                          BURT
                                   (into CB)
                            Yeah, still got one poking around.

                                          EARL (V.O.)
                            That's four.  Let us know if it
                            starts moving, Burt.

                                          BURT
                            Roger that.


         126   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - TRACTOR - DAY                       126

               Val and Earl have lowered Miguel down to a window sill right
               above the garden tractor.  He has used his kerchief to tie
               the steering wheel to keep the front wheels straight.  He
               jams the throttle open and signals thumbs-up to Val and Earl
               above.


         127   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          127

               Val and Earl stride purposefully toward the opposite end of
               the roof.  Realizing they have the same idea, each one tries
               to edge ahead of the other.

                                          VAL
                            I'm making the run to the Cat.

                                          EARL
                            Like hell you are.

                                          VAL
                            Get real.  I'm faster than you.

                                          EARL
                            I'm best at driving the Cat.

                                          VAL
                            Only if something happens to me.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Look, you'd better listen.  I'm
                            older and wiser.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, well, you're half right.

               Earl raises a fist: The Challenge.  They do scissors-rock-
               paper.  One, two, three.  Val loses.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Damn.  Guess I have to do it.

                                          EARL
                                   (shakes his head)
                            I won.  I pick who does it.

               Val glares at him.  Earl's obviously determined.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Ready when you are, Miguel!

               Earl positions himself, nervous as hell, ready to leap at the
               right moment.


         128   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - TRACTOR - DAY                       128

               Miguel leans out precariously and pulls the tractor's starter
               cord.  Nothing.  On the second try it starts.  He slams it
               into gear and sends it out toward open desert.  The store
               shakes under Miguel, almost knocking him off the window sill,
               as two humps of dirt pursue the noisy tractor.

                                          MIGUEL
                            There they go!  They're chasing it!


         129   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    129

               A "spout" of dust erupts near the foundation as the creature
               beneath zooms away toward the new sound.  Nancy whispers:

                                          NANCY
                            It's going...
                                   (then shouts)
                            There goes this one!  It's going!


         130   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          130

               The CB radio squawks:

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Hey, this guy just took off like a
                            shot.  What'd you people do?

               Earl is poised to leap.  Val steps up and slaps him on the
               back.

                                          VAL
                            Watch your ass, shithead.

                                          EARL
                            Don't worry about me, jerkoff.

               Val instantly elbows Earl hard in the stomach.  As Earl
               doubles over, Val springs off the edge of the roof.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            You goddamn suicidal son of a
                            bitch!

               We see Val running for all he's worth -- and there's the
               bulldozer at the edge of town a long way away.


         131   EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           131

               LOW CAMERA pursues the garden tractor as it bounces along.


         132   EXT.  PERFECTION - DAY                                       132

               Val charges across the vast open area that separates him from
               the bulldozer.  We can hear the tractor droning along in the
               background.


         133   EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           133

               The tractor suddenly takes a bad bounce and flips over!  The
               engine dies.  Total silence.


         134   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          134

               Earl, Rhonda and Miguel have seen the tractor take a header.

                                          EARL
                            Oh my God!


         135   EXT.  EDGE OF TOWN - VAL - DAY                               135

               Val's crunching boots seem incredibly loud in the sudden
               silence.  He hesitates, glancing over his shoulder.  He's
               totally out in the open, halfway to the bulldozer.  Should he
               run back or go forward?  He decides to go for the bulldozer.


         136   EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           136

               All four creatures are now heading for Val.  INTERCUT four
               slightly different LOW CAMERA ANGLES speeding over the
               ground, racing after him.  He strains to the limit, breaths
               coming in painful rasps -- but the creatures are closing in
               on him with chilling ease.


         137   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          137

               Everyone watches in horror.

                                          EARL
                            He'll never make it!  They're gonna
                            get him!

                                          RHONDA
                                   (yells)
                            VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T
                            MOVE!


         138   EXT.  EDGE OF TOWN - VAL - DAY                               138

               Val hears her and stops dead.  So do the creatures.  Maybe
               twenty feet away, their giant snouts poke up out of the
               ground: one, two, three, four.  Val stands trembling.  The
               creatures softly shuffle back and forth, searching blindly
               for him, hook-tentacles feeling everywhere.  One tentacle
               sweeps toward Val's boot.  He manages to lift his foot just
               in time, letting the tentacle pass beneath it.  He balances
               precariously like a flamingo.


         139   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          139

                                          EARL
                            It worked!  They can't find him!
                                   (pause)
                            Okay, okay...uh...we gotta make
                            some noise...a lot of noise!  HEY,
                            YOU SORRY SONS OF BITCHES, COME AND
                            GET ME...!!!!

               He starts jumping noisily up and down.  Miguel joins in,
               cursing the monsters in Spanish.



         139A  EXT.   WATER TOWER - DAY                                     139A

               Rhonda kicks and shouts.  But it's obvious they need some-
               thing louder.  She spots the aging outlet pipe coming from
               the water tank.  Bracing herself, she kicks at it with both
               feet.  It finally gives way at a rusted joint.  A torrent of
               water blasts out, thundering into the dirt.


         140   EXT.  EDGE OF TOWN - VAL - DAY                               140

               All the creatures wheel about in the dirt and zoom off toward
               town.  Val breathes a big sigh of relief and sprints to the
               bulldozer.


         141   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          141

                                          EARL
                            That did it, girl!  Goddamn good
                            thinking!


         142   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      142

               A mass of tentacles and snouts swirl through the big puddle
               where the water if falling.  The creatures' breathing throws
               up spouts of muddy water.  Rhonda looks down nervously.  Earl
               calls reassuringly from Pham Van's:

                                          EARL
                            Don't worry.  No way they can lift
                            that tower.  I mean it's really
                            heavy.


         143   INSERT - CONCRETE FOOTING                                    143

               The dirt begins to cave in around the tower's footing.  The
               creatures are digging the dirt away!


         144   BACK TO SCENE                                                144

               The water tower tilts ever so slightly, creaking and
               groaning!  Rhonda frantically grabs a handhold.

                                          RHONDA
                            They're not trying to lift it!


         145   EXT.  BULLDOZER - DAY                                        145

               Val lands in the driver's seat and turns the engine over --
               it doesn't start!

                                          VAL
                            NO FUCKING WAY!

               The old machine starts.  Val slams it into reverse and backs
               up toward the semi trailer.


         146   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      146

               The water tower is starting to tilt seriously.  Water spills
               over the top edge of the tank, drenching Rhonda.


         147   EXT.  BULLDOZER - DAY                                        147

               Val has used heavy chains on the back of the bulldozer to
               jerry-rig a hitch to the semi trailer.   Now he scrambles
               back into the driver's seat.  He guns the engine, wrenching
               the old semi trailer from years of dried mud and tumbleweeds.
               Ancient tires disintegrate.  Rusted wheels screech and
               complain -- but it moves.  Val lets out a whoop and heads
               full-tilt for town.  He's suddenly shocked as he sees:


         148   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      148

               Rhonda's in big trouble.  She scrambles to the high side of
               the tower platform.  The tower's going to tip over at any
               moment!  It's roof slides off and crashes into the street!

               On Pham Van's, Miguel and Earl are tearing apart the swamp
               cooler, throwing pieces of it off the roof, trying to
               distract the creatures, but they can't compete with the noise
               from the water.

               In BG the bulldozer rumbles toward the tower at top speed --
               an excruciatingly slow eight miles per hour.

               The tremendously heavy water tank suddenly tears loose,
               sliding off its platform, nearly carrying Rhonda with it.
               She ends up hanging from a cross beam as the water tank
               splatters like an enormous egg below, sending a small tidal
               wave down the street.

               The remains of the tower tilt crazily nearly forty-five
               degrees.  The bulldozer grinds closer and closer.  Rhonda
               tries to climb up, but the jostling and shuddering of the
               tower keeps her dangling precariously.  Suddenly she falls!

               And lands in the dirt.  The creatures zero in on her!  She
               turns wildly and leaps for the blade of the approaching
               bulldozer.  The blade is only inches off the ground but Val
               swiftly raises it, lifting Rhonda high into the air just
               above the grasping tentacles!


         149   EXT.  PERFECTION - MAIN STREET - DAY                         149

               As Rhonda climbs down into the cab, Val heads the bulldozer
               over to Pham Van's and stops.  Almost as soon as he does,
               creatures attack, a frenzy of tentacles grabbing at all sides
               of the massive earth-moving machine, slithering into the
               treads.  Val and Rhonda watch this nervously as Earl and
               Miguel quickly clamber from the roof down into the protective
               steel belly of the semi trailer.

               Val mentally crosses his fingers and sends the bulldozer
               roaring forward.  It effortlessly tears loose from the
               tentacles, grinding one to pulp in its treads.  The creature
               shrieks in pain.  The humans cheer!  At last they've got the
               upper hand!


         150   EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     150

               Melvin dances merrily, and noisily, on the metal rooftop.

                                          MELVIN
                            Way to go!  Dumb fucking worms!
                            Now haul ass over here, man!  Me
                            next!  Get me off of here...!

               The flimsy shed seems almost to explode as a furious creature
               roars up inside.  The walls buckle out.  The whole structure
               sags.  Melvin scrambles to peak of the roof.

                                          MELVIN
                            Oh shit!  Oh, God!  Help!

               As the unseen creature thrashes around inside the shed, the
               walls topple outward and the roof drops to the ground like a
               pancake.  Melvin has lost all self control and just keeps
               screaming.  Val pulls along side, jumps down onto the tread,
               and reaches out to Melvin.  But just as they join hands, the
               creature hits the roof from beneath, dragging it several
               feet.  Val is yanked off the bulldozer and lands with Nelvin
               on the roof!

               The creature slams into the roof repeatedly, but the
               corrugated metal is both light and resilient.  It bends, but
               the frustrated monster can't get enough "bite" to tear
               through it.  Val and Melvin straddle the peak of the roof,
               trying desperately to hang on as it heaves up, buckling like a
               bronco.

               Earl scrambles into the bulldozer driver's seat and heads
               after them at full throttle, the big diesel roaring.

               Melvin and Val prepare to jump onto the bulldozer, but just
               before it reaches them the roof suddenly starts to slide like
               some mad flying carpet, carried from beneath by a creature!
               Val hangs on like a rodeo rider, struggling to keep fear-
               crazed Melvin from tumbling off.


         151   EXT.  DIRT DITCH - DAY                                       151

               The roof zigs and zags, spins and twists.  Melvin and Val
               won't be shaken loose.  Earl does his best to head it off,
               but it's hard to predict which way the roof will scoot next.

               The rood careens alongside the edge of a dirt-walled drainage
               ditch, then suddenly skitters sideways and plunges over the
               edge.  Melvin and Val tumble to the bottom.  As they jump to
               their feet:

                                          VAL
                            We got about three seconds!

               Val sees, almost right above them, an exposed pipe which
               spans the ditch.  He shoves Melvin toward it.  They leap up
               and grab the pipe, pulling their legs up as high as they can.
               An instant later, the creature blasts through one wall of the
               ditch, roars past beneath them and burrows into the opposite
               wall!

               Earl brings the bulldozer to a thundering stop next to them.

                                          EARL
                            Well, come on!


         152   EXT.   NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   152

               Nancy and Mindy huddle together on their roof.  The upraised
               scoop blade of the bulldozer comes INTO SHOT with Val riding
               it.  He helps them step across into it.


         153   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    153

               Burt is using a hacksaw to cut lengths from a heavy vertical
               pipe to which his TV antenna was anchored.  Heather works
               with the sections Burt has already cut off.  She is filling
               them with gunpowder from reloading cannisters and hammering
               the ends shut -- they're making bombs.

               Then they hear rumbling.  What is it, more creatures?  They're
               surprised by the odd sight of the strange contraption
               approaching.

                                          BURT
                                   (impressed)
                            God damn!  Armored transport!

               Val climbs up on the bulldozer roll cage so he's about even
               with Heather and Burt.  A creature occasionally slams into the
               underside of the bulldozer of the semi trailer, rocking them
               slightly, throwing up clouds of dust.

                                          VAL
                            Let's go you two.  We're headed for
                            the mountains.

                                          BURT
                            In a minute.

               He grabs a coil of blackpowder cannon fuse.  He cuts off a
               length and stuffs it in the end of one of the pipe bombs
               during:

                                          VAL
                            Come on, Burt, we can't hold still
                            long.  They're damn smart and
                            getting smarter by the minute.

               Burt hefts the finished bomb.

                                          BURT
                            That's fine.  We've got some new
                            things to teach them.

                                          VAL
                            Damn it!  They'll sink this rig
                            just like a boat!

               Just then the bulldozer starts to tilt sideways, creatures
               digging dirt away beneath it.  Earl guns it forward out of
               the depression they're making.

                                          EARL
                            See that?  They're doing it now!
                            They try it every time we hold
                            still.

               Burt and Heather are impressed.  They rush around the
               rooftop, gathering food, ammo, guns, the finished bombs,
               handing them to impatient Val who hands them down to people
               in the semi trailer during:

                                          VAL
                            Jesus Christ, we're only going nine
                            miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!

                                          BURT
                            Yeah, well those things are gonna
                            be on our ass every foot of the
                            way, right?

               He holds up to rifles to Heather, the HK91 assault rifle and
               another elephant gun.

                                          BURT
                            What do you think?  Max firepower
                            or...?

                                          HEATHER
                            I'd go for penetration.  The 458
                            shooting solids -- less ammo to
                            carry anyway.

               Burt nods.  Everyone on the bulldozer and semi trailer shouts:

                                          TOWNSFOLK
                                   (adlib)
                            Come on!
                            Who cares!
                            Forget it!
                            Let's go!

               Dust flies up.  The bulldozer tilts.  Earl guns it forward
               again.  Heather and Burt grab a few more things and leap down
               into the semi trailer.

                                          MELVIN
                            Give me a gun!  I'll take one!

                                          BURT
                            I wouldn't give you a gun if it was
                            World War Three.

               Earl pilots the strange looking contraption out into the
               desert.  Burt and Heather watch their fortress-home recede.

                                          BURT
                            Food for five years.  A thousand
                            gallons of gas.  Air filtration.
                            Water filtration.  Geiger counter.
                            Bomb shelter...
                                   (looks heavenward)
                            ...underground goddamn monsters?!

               Heather puts a consoling arm around him.


         154   EXT.  JEEP TRAIL - DAY                                       154

               The bulldozer easily lumbers along the really rough road we
               saw Val and Earl's truck struggle over the other morning.

               As they come closer we see Burt and Heather riding "shotgun,"
               he sitting out in the bulldozer's scoop, she on the rear of
               the semi trailer, elephant guns at the ready.  Val, Earl and
               Rhonda are in the cab.


         155   EXT.  CLIFFS - DAY                                           155

               It's late afternoon, sun casting dramatic shadows across the
               beautiful desert.  We are WIDE on the bizarre vehicle,
               resolutely grinding along not far from the cliffs, nearing
               the mountains ahead.


         156   EXT.  DESERT - BULLDOZER - DAY                               156

               As they scan the desert, the people are feeling like they may
               get out of this after all.  Earl calls back to the people in
               the semi trailer.

                                          EARL
                            Any sign of'em?

                                          MIGUEL
                            Maybe they just gave up, you know.

                                          MELVIN
                            Yeah, the bulldozer's too much for
                            them, man.

               As they top a gentle rise, Burt excitedly points ahead.

                                          BURT
                            There we go, solid rock!

               Everyone cheers.  But then Heather points up ahead to one
               side.

                                          HEATHER
                            What's that?


         157   P.O.V. - THE GROUP - DUST CLOUD - DAY                        157

               Perhaps two hundred yards from them, a huge cloud of dust
               wells up from behind big boulders.


         158   BACK TO SCENE                                                158

               Everyone stares uneasily at the billowing cloud.

                                          NANCY
                            Is it them?

                                          MIGUEL
                            What else could it be?

                                          MINDY
                            What're they doing?

                                          MELVIN
                            Maybe they're taking a dump.

                                          RHONDA
                            We're not going over there, right?

                                          EARL
                            No.  We go straight.

                                          VAL
                            Damn it.  What the hell are they
                            doing?  They're up to something.

                                          EARL
                            I don't care what they're doing as
                            long as they're doing it way over
                            there.

               Earl shoves the throttle all the way.  The engine screams.


         159   EXT.  DESERT - DUSTCLOUD - DAY                               159

               We MOVE IN through the cloud of dust.  Dirt is flying by the
               ton out of en eight foot diameter hole in the ground.  A huge
               mound of the tunneled-out dirt is already piled high.  The
               creatures are digging a tunnel -- but why?


         160   EXT.  DESERT - BULLDOZER - DAY                               160

               We watch the bulldozer rumbling along.  It seems unstop-
               able.  The mountains and safety are barely a mile away --

               when the EARTH CAVES IN!!  THE BULLDOZER PLUNGES NOSE FIRST
               INTO AN UNSEEN PIT DUG JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE!

               The machine ends up half-buried at a steep angle.  The semi
               trailer is right on the edge of the pit.  Everyone is shaken,
               bruised, bloodied.  Val, Earl and Rhonda look frantically for
               Burt, who was riding out front in the scoop.  They're
               relieved to see him clawing his way out of pit.  Val hauls
               him up and all four of them now leap into the semi trailer.
               As they come to rest, Val slowly realizes what's happened.

                                          VAL
                            They...they dug a trap!  I can't
                            believe this!

               The idling bulldozer engine coughs and dies.  There is a
               moment's crushing silence.

               Then the dreaded digging begins.  Dust boils up around the
               semi trailer -- creatures digging from below!  The semi
               trailer shakes and shudders, slowly sinking.  The people
               huddle together in sheer panic.  Val and Earl grab the
               nearest of Burt and Heather's guns and fire wildly, hope-
               lessly, down at the dirt.  Ricochets whine into the distance.

               Burt grimly digs an overloaded knapsack for one of his
               pipe bombs.  He leaps up between Val and Earl and lights the
               fuse, looking for a target.

                                          BURT
                            Hungry?!  Eat this!!

               He tosses the bomb at some churning earth and dives back into
               the semi trailer.

                                          BURT (cont'd)
                            Keep your heads down!

               KABOOM!  The explosion throws up a big plume of dust and
               rocks.  We hear a new, very strange sound of pain from the
               creatures.  The semi trailer instantly stops shaking.  The
               creatures have stopped digging.  All is quiet.

               The people peer up over the edge of the semi trailer, looking
               all around.  Then:

                                          RHONDA
                            There they are!


         161   P.O.V. THE GROUP - DISTANT CREATURES                         161

               Numerous spurts of dust mark their paths as they race madly
               away, fanning out from the semi trailer.


         162   BACK TO SCENE                                                162

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, Burt...did you get one...!

                                          RHONDA
                            No, there's still four of them.
                            See...there's like four different
                            dust trails.

                                          VAL
                            Sure got their attention, though.
                            Nice going, Burt.
                                   (to Earl)
                            Earl, what about the Cat?

               Earl's already staring down at the bulldozer.

                                          EARL
                            No way.  It's down for the count.

               Val looks around.


         163   P.O.V.  VAL - ROCK OUTCROP                                   163

               Toward the cliffs he sees a big rock outcrop.


         164   BACK TO SCENE                                                164

               Rhonda points in the opposite direction from where Val is
               looking.

                                          RHONDA
                            Here they come!  They're coming
                            back!

               Heather unexpectedly fire two deafening blasts from her
               elephant gun at the approaching creatures, then shakes her
               head, frustrated.  They're still coming.

                                          VAL
                            Come on, everybody!  We gotta run
                            for those rocks over there!

                                          EARL
                            Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.

                                          MELVIN
                            Yeah, man!  They'll get us!

                                          VAL
                            There sure as hell get us if we
                            stay here!

                                          RHONDA
                            Wait, wait, listen.  Burt do you
                            have any more of those things?

                                          BURT
                            The bombs?  Damn right I do.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, what is you throw one that
                            way, the way we want to go...
                                   (points toward rocks)
                            Then, when the explosion happens...
                            if it drives them away again...we
                            all run like goddamn bastards!
                                   (to Earl)
                            Pardon my French.

               Wham!  With a jolt the semi trailer begins shaking and
               shuddering again -- sinking, smiling.

                                          MELVIN
                            What if it doesn't scare them?
                            What if they don't run?

                                          RHONDA
                            I don't think it does scare them!
                            It hurts them!  They're  so
                            sensitive to sound, they have to
                            run!  It hurts too much!

               Glances all around.

                                          BURT
                            She's got my vote.

                                          VAL
                            Right.  We're gonna run.  Get
                            ready.

               Val squats in front of tear-streaked Mindy.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Mindy, you understand what we're
                            going to do?
                                   (off her nod)
                            And don't worry, they can't get us
                            once we're on those rocks.

                                          MELVIN
                            I don't know, man.  They're too
                            fast!  You can't outrun them, no
                            way!

               As Burt readies another bomb, he pauses to hand bug-eyed
               Melvin a huge Ruger Super Redhawk 44 magnum handgun.

                                          BURT
                            Here, kid.  This'll make'em think
                            twice.

               Melvin's eyes bug out further.  Burt lights his bomb.

                                          BURT (cont'd)
                            Heads down!!

               He hurls the bomb.  Wait.  Wait.  WHOOOM!  Again we hear the
               creatures' unearthly shriek of pain.  Rhonda's on her feet
               before the rocks stop falling.  She spots the creatures.

                                          RHONDA
                            It worked!  There they go!

                                          VAL
                            LET'S DO IT!

               Earl lets out a war wild WHOOP.  It's infectious.  CRANE UP
               with them as everyone piles out of the semi trailer like
               soldiers out of a trench -- they charge across no-man's-land.

               Melvin runs like a demon.  He tries to shoot at the first
               thing he sees but the gun just clicks over and over -- empty.

                                          MELVIN
                            Burt, you bastard!

               Enraged, he doubles his speed, trying to overtake Burt.

               Mindy can't keep up.  Nancy tries to pull her along.  Val and
               Earl swoop in, grab Mindy under either arm, and carry her
               between them.


         165   ANGLE - THE CREATURES                                        165

               The ground heaves violently as the retreating monsters
               angrily wheel about and charge back after the humans.


         166   EXT.  DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - DAY                            166

               Big slabs jutting this way and that -- a rock iceberg in a
               sand ocean.  The people scramble onto it amid whoops of joy
               and relief.  Melvin charges up to Burt:

                                          MELVIN
                            You asshole!  There's no bullets in
                            this gun!

                                          BURT
                            Got you moving, didn't it?

               Burt's line gets a laugh from people, but then tentacles
               burst up on all sides of the rock, probing, feeling.  The
               effect is instantly sobering.  Burt swiftly grabs out his
               remaining bombs -- six of them -- and holds one ready.  But
               they're in no immediate danger.

                                          EARL
                            So...now what?

                                          RHONDA
                            Could we make it to the mountains?

                                          VAL
                                   (gestures to Burt's bombs)
                            No way.  We'd need fifty of those
                            things.

               The hopelessness of the situation suddenly hits Val, Earl,
               and Rhonda.  After a moment:

                                          EARL
                            Well...that's it.  We're not
                            getting off this rock...

                                          VAL
                            Not going to pole vault anywhere.
                            That's for sure.

                                          HEATHER
                            What's the matter with you?  What
                            are you talking about?!

                                          RHONDA
                            They'll just wait out there till
                            we're dead.  That's what they do.

               As this sinks in, Burt loses his cool, igniting an argument.

                                          BURT
                            What?  Well, for chrissake, we
                            could have made a stand at our
                            place!  We had food, water...

                                          EARL
                            You can't fight'em that way...

                                          BURT
                            You two jackasses hauled us way the
                            hell out here...!?

                                          VAL
                            BACK OFF, BURT...!

                                          BURT
                            Well, who put you two in charge?

                                          NANCY
                                   (shouts)
                            Burt!  Those animals would have
                            killed you!

               Everyone stares in surprise at normally quiet Nancy.

                                          NANCY (cont'd)
                                   (softly)
                            You haven't seen what they can do.

                                          VAL
                                   (calmer)
                            They'd have dug your place out from
                            under you in half an hour!

               There's a long, grim silence.  Everyone sits glumly.
               Finally, Burt picks up a bomb and contemplates it:

                                          BURT
                                   (losing it)
                            If it comes to starvation, I know
                            what I'm doing.  Take one of these.
                            Walk right out there with the fuse
                            lit.  Stuff it down my pants and
                            let 'em take me down.  BOOOOM!

               Heather puts a soothing hand on his shoulder.

                                          HEATHER
                            Jesus, honey!

               But now Earl brightens a little.

                                          EARL
                            You know, that's not a bad idea!

               The others react.  Is Earl nuts?

                                          EARL
                            No, I mean, it gives me an idea...
                            going fishing like...


         167   EXT.  DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - LATER                          167

               In the open desert, a rock lands.  Then another.  Val and
               Rhonda are throwing them from the rock outcrop.

               Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Burt have moved away from the main
               group to another section of the rock outcrop where
               intervening boulders will protect everyone from an explosion.

               Earl has tied a bomb to some nylon rope form one of Burt's
               knapsacks.  Burt places the other bombs safely out of the way
               behind a ledge.  Meanwhile, Val and Rhonda keep throwing
               rocks.  Soon, the ground shifts.

                                          VAL
                            There!  Right straight out in front
                            of you.

               Burt has his coil of fuse.

                                          BURT
                            How much you think?

                                          EARL
                            I don't know...  They're pretty
                            quick...fifteen seconds?

               Burt nods, expertly eyeballing a fifteen second length and
               snipping it off.  As he stuffs it into the bomb:

                                          EARL
                            What the hell is that, anyway?

                                          BURT
                            Cannon fuse.

                                          EARL
                            What do you use it for?

                                          BURT
                                   (matter of fact)
                            My cannon.

               The bomb is ready -- it's moment of truth.  Earl digs in his
               pocket for the lighter -- but Val has it.  Val nervously
               leans over to light the fuse, but then frowns as he sees how
               Earl is holding the rope.

                                          VAL
                            Come on, you're not going to do
                            your lasso thing...?

                                          EARL
                            Hey, just 'cause you're no good
                            with a rope...

               Val shakes his head and lights the fuse.  Earl whirls the
               bomb on the end of its rope like a lasso, and lets it fly out
               as far as he can.  Then he starts pulling it back in along
               the ground like a fishing lure.  Rhonda stares at her watch
               as they all sink down behind the protective boulder.

                                          RHONDA
                            Come on...come on...

                                          BURT
                            Take it...take the bait...

               Suddenly a snout subtly surfaces and gulps down the bomb.  A
               tense two seconds later -- KABOOOM!  Bullseye!  It's a
               volcano of gory creature parts.  They splatter all over!  The
               remaining creatures shriek and race away again.  The people
               cheer wildly.

                                                                    CUT TO:


         168   EXT.  DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - LATER                          168

               Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Burt prepare to try again.  This time
               Val has the rope and a new bomb.  Rhonda stands by him, ready
               with the lighter.  Earl lobs rocks out into the desert.

                                          EARL
                            Where the hell are they?  Hope they
                            didn't wise up.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (pointing)
                            Nope, there!  That's one.

               Rhonda shakily lights the fuse.  Val heaves the bomb out and
               starts trolling.  The creature swallows it.  Everyone drops
               down behind the boulder, Val impulsively grabbing a second
               bomb. They tense with anticipatory glee -- but the creature
               suddenly spits its bomb back out!  It sails back right over
               their heads.  It strikes the rocks above them, skittering
               down a crevice and landing in -- BURT'S PILE OF BOMBS!

               Val, Earl, and Rhonda scatter.  Burt dives backward over a
               rock ledge.

               BABABAMMM!!  All the bombs explode, throwing rocks every-
               where.  The creatures streak away.  Val, Earl and Rhonda
               sprawl into the dirt, half stunned.

               When the panic is over, Val and Earl realize where they are --
               fifty yards out in open desert!  So is Rhonda, off at an
               angle from them!  Only Burt is safe on the rock outcrop.

               And the creatures are coming back fast!

               The stranded trio starts back for the outcrop, but the
               creatures burst up ahead of them -- one blocking Rhonda's
               path, the other two cutting Val and Earl off!  The creatures
               roar toward their easy prey!

               Val and Earl freeze.  The ground bulges as the creatures
               "skid" to a halt not ten feet from them.  Rhonda stands stock
               still some fifty feet away, eyeing her own creature.

               Over on the outcrop with the main group of people Heather
               sizes up the situation.

                                          HEATHER
                            Make noise.  Everybody!  COME ON!

               Everyone starts hopping up and down, yelling, screaming, and
               clapping.  Burt even runs a few feet out from the rocks,
               firing a pistol into the dirt.

                                          BURT
                            COME ON, YOU SLIMEBAGS!  OVER HERE!
                            FRESH MEAT...!

               The crowd keeps up the ruckus.  The creatures are distracted
               by the noise, but this time they don't automatically go after
               it.  Their big snouts turn uncertainly this way and that.
               But they just stay where they are.  Their hook-tentacles
               slide out, feeling all around.  Earl whispers:

                                          EARL
                            They're not falling for it!

               Heather takes careful aim with her elephant gun.

                                          HEATHER
                            I'll make'em pay attention
                            goddamnit...

               But before she can fire, the creatures mysteriously sink from
               view.  Val, Rhonda, and Earl remain frozen.  What the hell is
               going on?  Nothing happens -- then --

               A HUGE HUMP OF EARTH suddenly wells up near Rhonda.  It sinks
               back down as fast as it appeared.  It's like the creature
               suddenly lifted its whole body almost to the surface then
               submerged again.  Another hump rises and falls right near Val
               and Earl.  There's a pause as the men whisper:

                                          VAL
                            They're...they're trying to make us
                            move!

                                          EARL
                            Or just knock us over.  Look, use
                            the bomb!

                                          VAL
                            It's out last one.  We can't kill
                            them all.

               The creatures try another random "barrage" of humps, some
               coming perilously close.  They know they'll eventually topple
               their prey.  One comes so close to Val and Earl that pebbles
               roll down its sides into their boots!

                                          EARL
                            Use the fucking bomb!

                                          VAL
                            So, we get back on that rock and in
                            three days we're dead anyway.

                                          EARL
                                   (slowly; terrified)
                            I want to live for the three days.

               More humps rise and fall.  Val gives in.  He signals Rhonda,
               gesturing with the bomb.  She understands.  He'll set it off,
               driving away the creatures, and they'll all run back to the
               outcrop.

               Val digs for the lighter.  Doesn't have it.  Earl digs for
               it, too.  But he doesn't have it either!  They go dead pale.
               How can that be?  They look across fifty feet of deadly open
               ground -- trembling Rhonda holds up the lighter!

               Over on the outcrop, Burt shouts:

                                          BURT
                            What's wrong?  Use the bomb, for
                            Godsake!

               Val signals to Rhonda to throw the lighter.  She nods.  But
               just before she does, A HUMP STARTS RISING DIRECTLY UNDER
               HER!  She fights to keep her balance -- struggling to keep
               from taking that single step which will instantly tell the
               creatures where she is.

               But there's no hope.  The hump jerks higher.  Her boots slip
               down the gravelly side!  Instantly the creature twists toward
               her, its hungry mouth erupting out of the dirt.  She screams
               and dashes for Val and Earl.  They run to meet her.  The
               other creatures surface.  The trio is cut off from the rock
               outcrop!

               Val and Earl link up with Rhonda and they all run madly while
               Rhonda tries to light Val's bomb fuse.  But suddenly Val
               yanks the bomb away.

                                          VAL
                            No wait!  This way!

               He veers off in a new direction.  Startled Earl and Rhonda
               have no choice but to follow.  As they desperately try to
               catch up to Val:

                                          EARL
                                   (gasping)
                            What the hell are you doing?!!

                                          VAL
                            I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!

               Earl looks up ahead.  They're headed right for --


         169   EXT.  THE CLIFFS - DAY                                       169

               The massive cliffs.  Earl's eyes bug out.  In seconds they'll
               be right at the brink with nowhere to run.

                                          EARL
                            This better be one great plan!

               As they skid to a stop at the very brink, Val breaks off the
               bomb fuse, leaving only one inch of it.  He whirls to check
               the progress of the advancing creatures.

                                          VAL
                            Get ready!

               He holds the bomb out to Rhonda.  She instantly tries to
               light it.  He grabs her wrist so hard it hurts.

                                          EARL
                            Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!

                                          VAL
                            Not yet, not yet...

               The charging creatures are almost underfoot.  Finally Val
               pulls Rhonda's hand over to light the fuse.  Instantly he
               hurls the bomb as far as he can, behind the creatures.

                                          EARL
                            Too far!  You threw it behind them!

               The ground opens under their feet!  Tentacles snake toward
               Val and Earl.  A horrid mouth clamps onto Rhonda's boot.  She
               screams as it starts to pull her down.

               WHOOOM!!  The bomb explodes!  The creatures shriek in pain,
               instantly releasing their prey and racing away from the
               painful shock wave in the only direction they can --


         170   EXT.  CLIFFS - WIDE LOW ANGLE - DAY                          170

               Right out through the face of the cliffs!!  The huge,
               shrieking creatures seem to hang in mid-air for a moment,
               their grotesque bodies undulating in pain.  And then they
               fall!  And fall and fall -- a thousand feet!


         171   EXT.  BOTTOM OF CLIFFS - DAY                                 171

               The creatures land on massive jagged rocks, exploding like
               immense, horrid watermelons.  Multi-colored gore festoons the
               whole cliff face.

               TILT UP to see three tiny figures standing at the top of the
               cliff.


         172   EXT.  CLIFFS - DAY                                           172

               Val peers down at the distant creatures for a long time.  Then
               he notices Earl and Rhonda are staring at him.  Where the hell
               did he get an idea like that?  After a moment:

                                          VAL
                            Well, it just suddenly hit me, you
                            know?  Stampede?

               They turn and head back toward the others.  They laugh as
               they realize how stealthily they are walking.  Val starts
               taking big, exaggerated stomping steps.  Rhonda and Earl
               follow suit.  The trio goes off arm in arm, stomping merrily.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


         173   EXT.  PERFECTION - MAIN STREET - DAY                         173

               Val and Earl roll two scavenged truck wheels down the street
               toward their own truck; which is up on jacks, two wheels
               missing.

               Mindy races past excitedly.

                                          MINDY
                            Look!

               A highway maintenance truck is rolling into town followed by
               a police car.  The townsfolk happily swarm around the
               MAINTENANCE MEN and POLICE OFFICER who gape at the destroyed
               town.

               Val and Earl eagerly start bolting on one of their new wheels.

                                          EARL
                            Road's in!

                                          VAL
                            Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit
                            Bixby we start making phone calls.
                            We could make some real money off
                            this whole thing, get in People
                            magazine...

                                          EARL
                            People?  Hell, National Geographic.

                                          VAL
                            Sell the movie rights.  We're going
                            straight from blue-collar to white
                            -collar.

                                          EARL
                            Yeah...but no ties.

                                          VAL
                            No ties.

               Rhonda pulls up in her truck, leans out and snaps their
               picture with a top-of-the-line Nikon.

                                          RHONDA
                            Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his
                            camera.

                                          EARL
                            Howdy, Rhonda.

                                          RHONDA
                            You're really leaving, huh?

                                          EARL
                            You bet.  You gonna be staying up
                            here?

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, yeah!  There's going to be
                            major research up here.  First
                            thing is to get some pictures of
                            that one we dug up.

               An awkward pause.  Finally she extends her hand to them.  Val
               just gives it a quick shake.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            Uh...well, maybe I'll see you two
                            sometime...
                                   (to Val)
                            And thanks for everything, you
                            know, saving my life and stuff.

                                          VAL
                                   (awkwardly)
                            Well...you're welcome.

               She gazes at him, just a hint of something in her eyes.  Earl
               springs to attention.  Is the boy blind?  Then Rhonda snaps
               out of it.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well...see ya.

               They nod.  She drives off.  Earl stares at Val who starts
               putting the second wheel on the truck.

                                          EARL
                            Christ, Val, maybe she's not your
                            type, but you could, at least, be
                            civil.

                                          VAL
                            Civil?  I'm civil.

                                          EARL
                            You're not civil, you're glum.  We
                            got the world by the tail with a
                            downhill pull and all of a sudden
                            you go glum on me.

               Earl freezes as a bell goes off in his head.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Oh my God.  She got to you.  You do
                            like her!

                                          VAL
                            Somebody paying you to do this?

                                          EARL
                            She just practically asked you for
                            a date.  What the hell is wrong?!

               Val glares at Earl for a moment.

                                          VAL
                            Earl, get real.  What does she need
                            with a guy like me?

               Earl is dumbfounded.

                                          EARL
                            What was that?  All this time she's
                            not good enough for you.  Now,
                            suddenly, you're not good enough for
                            her?  God, my work is never done.
                            You don't decide is you're
                            worthless, she does.  But you gotta
                            give her a chance!

               Val lowers the jack letting the truck down.

                                          VAL
                            Earl, I'm not gonna make a fool of
                            myself!  You got that covered.

               Earl stands there fuming, mind racing.  A last ditch idea
               hits home -- we see a devilish glint in his eye.

                                          EARL
                            Fine, make the mistakes I did.
                            I think I'll just be playing this
                            hand myself.

                                          VAL
                            What?

                                          EARL
                            She likes both of us.  We both
                            helped her out.

                                          VAL
                            You are so full of shit...

                                          EARL
                            Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She
                            ain't as narrow-minded as you.
                            I'll lay odds she's looking for
                            character in a man.  For my part,
                            I'd be proud to have her.  I'd
                            goddamn worship her.

               Earl hops into the truck.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            I'm going out there right now, help
                            her take those pictures...set up her
                            seismo-jiggers.  Whatever she
                            wants.  Who the hell knows what'll
                            happen?

               Earl starts to drive off.  Val springs into the passenger
               seat.  Through the truck's rear window we see Val raise his
               hand in The Challenge.  They do a round of scissors-rock-
               paper -- but it's a tie.  They go again.  Another tie.  They
               keep playing and tying as they drive off into the distance
               and we --

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                          THE END
BENEATH PERFECTION

         1     EXT.   DESERT VALLEY - DAY                                   1

               The high desert -- absolutely silent -- a vast, hard land-
               scape stretching away to distant mountains.  The silence is
               broken by hoof-beats.


         2     EXT.  EDGAR'S PLACE - DAY                                    2

               It's a simple cabin dwarfed by a big, ramshackle barn.  EDGAR
               DEEMS (60s), a weathered desert rat of a hermit, is walking
               his donkey around in circles.

               Now, rattling toward them down an endless dirt road, comes an
               old, sun-bleached Buick.  It stops and out leans OLD FRED
               (70s) wearing a sweat-stained fedora.  The two friends nod.

                                          OLD FRED
                            How's she doing?

                                          EDGAR
                            She wants to lay down.  I'm a
                            little worried.

               Old Fred climbs out with a bushel basket of carrots.

                                          OLD FRED
                            Well, I brung her something I know
                            she likes.

                                          EDGAR
                            Damn, Fred, you can't give away all
                            those.

                                          OLD FRED
                            Forget it.  I got vegetables coming
                            out my ears.  Usually the varmints
                            eat up half my crop, but lately I
                            ain't so much as seen a gopher or a
                            jack-rabbit nowheres.

                                          EDGAR
                            If that ain't the truth.  And I
                            count on them for a little bit of
                            stew meat...Thank you, Fred.

               Edgar takes the carrots and feeds one to the donkey.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            Here you go, Justine.  Look what
                            Fred brought you.

                                          OLD FRED
                            We playing cards tonight?

                                          EDGAR
                            I think I'm gonna be sitting up
                            with her.

                                          OLD FRED
                            I'd do the same.  Well, catch you
                            Thursday.

                                          EDGAR
                            You bet.

               The men nod, and Old Fred drives off.

               CLOSE-UP of the donkey's hooves thumping along as Edgar leads
               her to the barn.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            Let's get you out of the sun for a
                            spell.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            I'll get you some fresh water.

               But, suddenly, we hear the donkey restlessly stomping its
               hooves and braying.  Edgar turns, concerned.  Now we hear an
               odd sound.  Distant thunder?  The wind?  The donkey gets more
               and more frantic.

               The barn shudders violently.  Frightened birds explode from
               the eaves.  Dust puffs from every old seam.  Roof shingles
               rain down.  Edgar stares in amazement.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            ...some kind of earthquake!?

               Then another sound -- the donkey starts screeching in wild
               panic.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            Justine, hang on! I'm coming!

               Edgar races back to the barn and flings open the doors.


         3     INT.  EDGAR'S BARN - DAY                                     3

               Dust swirls through the air.  But -- the barn in empty.  No
               donkey.  Now Edgar is hit by a ghastly stench.  He staggers
               back, and covers his nose with a handkerchief.  Then he sees,
               splattered across the walls -- blood!

                                          EDGAR
                            What in the name of Jehovah...?

               He raises his arms above the door frame.  When he lowers them
               he's holding a 12 gauge shotgun.  He races outside, ready to
               shoot, but there's nothing -- as far as the eye can see.


         4     EXT.  CLIFFS - DAWN                                          4

               The sun lights up spectacular sheer cliffs which plunge 1000
               feet from a ruggedly beautiful high-desert plateau.  At the
               top of the cliffs, silhouetted against the dawn, a lone cow-
               boy seems to gaze in deep contemplation at the sunrise.  As
               we MOVE IN, we realize he's actually peeing over the cliff.

               This is VALENTINE MCKEE (25).  Smart and good looking, Val
               has nevertheless managed to underachieve brilliantly.  He
               coasts through life, following the path of least resistance
               -- which has brought him to this dubious rustic existence on
               the edge of civilization.  But lately he's beginning to
               wonder why he hasn't accomplished more in his 25 years.

               As a few sleepy cows gaze at him, sleepy Val shuffles over to
               his battered old pickup truck.  A hand-painted sign on the
               door reads: "V & E -- All Type's of Job's."  Indeed, the
               pick-up bed is jumbled with tools and supplies for every
               conceivable odd job -- and the noisily snoring form of his
               partner huddled in a dirty sleeping bag.  Val raps on the
               side of the truck.

                                          VAL
                                   (softly)
                            Good morning, Mr. Bassett, this is
                            your wake-up call.  Please move
                            your fat ass.

               No response from the sleeping bag.  Val stares at the cows
               chewing their cud -- and perks up as he gets an idea.  He
               gently steps onto the truck's running board, then suddenly
               starts jumping up and down as hard as he can, rocking the
               truck violently.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            STAMPEDE!  EARL, GET OUT OF THE
                            WAY!

               The sleeping bag tries to get up and run for it.  It tumbles
               out of the back of the pickup.  While Val laughs uproar-
               iously, EARL BASSET (43) claws his way out of the bag, looks
               around wildly, and finds himself staring at three motionless
               cows.

                                          EARL
                            You dumb shit.

               Earl is a good-ol' boy who has lived his life just like Val,
               drifting from job to job.  He knows why he hasn't accom-
               plished anything, and often tries to impart his hard-won
               wisdom to Val, but the last thing the younger man wants is
               advice.

               Earl stretches.  The men begin a silent ritual:  Earl gropes
               through his pockets for a cigarette, but only finds a
               lighter.  Meanwhile, Val digs in his pockets, coming up with
               cigarettes, but no lighter.  Typical of these two, each guy
               always has half of what he needs.  Eventually they sort it
               out,  trading the necessary implements.

               Earl reaches for a coffee-pot on a battered Coleman stove on
               the tailgate.  But it's cold.

                                          EARL
                            You didn't cook breakfast?

                                          VAL
                            Did it yesterday.  Franks and
                            beans.

                                          EARL
                                   (tries to recall)
                            No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.

                                          VAL
                            Hell you did.  Your turn.

               Earl raises his fist.  This is The Challenge, and it instantly
               triggers the partners' conflict-resolution technique.  They
               solve all disputes using the children's game of "scissors,
               rock, paper."  Earl raises his fist in response.  The game is
               played swiftly and silently -- one, two, three.  On three,
               Val mimes "paper" (open hand.  Earl mimes "scissors" (two
               extended fingers).  Scissors cuts paper.  Val has lost.  He
               shrugs and starts pumping up the stove fuel tank.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Well, when I'm your age I'll
                            probably forget what I eat, too.


         4A    EXT.  DESERT VALLEY - FENCE - DAY                          4A

               Val and Earl are restringing a dilapidated, and seemingly
               endless, barbed wire fence.  A few bored cows watch them.

                                          VAL
                            How many cows does it take to make
                            a stampede?  Is it like three or
                            more?  Is there a minimum speed?

                                          EARL
                                   (shakes his head)
                            I was in one.  A bolt of lightning
                            blew up cottonwood tree.  Three
                            hundred head going hell-bent for
                            the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny,
                            I can  tell you.

               Earl's hand slips and the fence snags him right through his
               thick glove.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Ow!  God damn!  Is this a job for
                            intelligent men?!

                                          VAL
                            If there was one nearby I'd
                            probably ask him.

                                          EARL
                            I keep thinking, if we were but
                            half serious about money, we should
                            quit being hired hands and...

                                          VAL
                                   (mock serious)
                            Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.

                                          EARL
                            Whatever the hell we are, we should
                            quit and go get ourselves some real
                            employment.

               Val gestures to the vastness around them.

                                          VAL
                            What, and give up all this personal
                            freedom?


         5     EXT.  JEEP TRAIL - DAY                                       5

               Val guides the truck down a tortuous, rocky, almost impas-
               sable trail.  It takes full concentration as he fights the
               steering wheel, shifts, rides the brake and leans out trying
               to pick a decent route.  Earl braces his feet on the dash and
               munches breakfast, a raw hot dog right out of the package.

                                          VAL
                            Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every
                            year.

                                          EARL
                                   (shrugs)
                            Has a lot of rain.

               Earl pulls a box of Hershey bars from under the seat.  There's
               only one bar left.  He sets the box down between them.  Val
               glances at it -- and raises his fist: The Challenge.  One,
               two, three.  Val mimes "paper;" Earl mimes "rock."  Earl
               loses.  Val takes the bar.

                                          EARL
                                   (pointing ahead)
                            You're gonna get us hung up.

                                          VAL
                            Do not talk to the driver.

               THWONK!  The truck lurches to a stop, its frame caught on a
               big rock.  Val glares at Earl.


         6     EXT. DESERT INTERSECTION - PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY               6

               The pick-up turns from a dirt road onto an old paved road.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            What do we have next?


         7     INT.  PICK-UP - MOVING - DAY                                 7

               Earl consults a crumpled list pulled from inside his hat.

                                          EARL
                            Uh...Digging that waterhole for
                            Nestor.

                                          VAL
                            Burt and Heather's place is closer.
                            Let's do their kitchen today.  Do
                            Nestor tomorrow.

                                          EARL
                            Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We
                            don't dig today.  We don't get paid
                            today.  Damn it, Valentine, you
                            never plan ahead.  You never take
                            the long view.  Hell, here it is
                            Monday and I'm already working on
                            Wednesday.
                                   (squints dubiously at
                                    his schedule)
                            It is Monday, right?

               But Val is peering at the desert up ahead.  Off the road a
               ways is a small Toyota pick-up truck and, beside it, a lone
               figure trying to flag them down.

                                          VAL
                            Who the hell's that?  That's not
                            what's his name...the grad student?

                                          EARL
                            Nah, it's September.  Must be the
                            new one.

                                          VAL
                            The new one!  That's supposed to be
                            a girl!

               Earl braces himself, knowing what Val will do.  Val swerves
               the truck wildly off the road, barreling across the desert.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                                   (almost praying)
                            You will have long blonde hair, big
                            green eyes, nice full breasts that
                            stand up and say hello, ass that
                            won't quit.  And legs, legs that go
                            all the way up!

               Earl shakes his head, mildly bemused as they slide to a stop
               in a cloud of dust.


         8     EXT.  DESERT - RHONDA'S TRUCK - DAY                          8

               Val looks out hopefully.  The dust clears.  He sees her --
               RHONDA LeBECK, (25).  Val's eyes do an expert vertical scan:
               short brown hair, small brown eyes, so-so chest, legs hidden
               in baggy dungarees.

               Laden with a portable computer, notebooks, and some
               seismograph printouts, she stares at him through tilted
               glasses.  Her little pick-up truck is loaded with geology
               field equipment.  She shakes Val's hand firmly.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (brightly)
                            Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.
                            I'm up here for the semester...

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, geography.

                                          RHONDA
                            Right, geology.  And you have to be
                            Val and Earl.  I've heard all about
                            you.

                                          EARL
                            We deny everything.

               Rhonda smiles.

                                          RHONDA
                            Listen, got a question for you.  Do
                            you know if anybody is doing any
                            blasting or drilling or anything
                            like that?

                                          VAL
                            Around here?  Why would they?

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, I'm supposed monitor these
                            seismographs.  You know, they
                            measure vibrations...

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, vibrations in the ground.

                                          RHONDA
                            Yeah, well, I'm getting what I
                            refer to scientifically as "weird
                            vibes."  every sensor I've got is
                            giving me strange readings.  I
                            mean, the school has had these
                            machines up here three years and
                            they've never recorded anything
                            like this.

                                          EARL
                            Well, we'll ask around.  Let you
                            know if we hear of anything.

                                          RHONDA
                            Thanks.  God, I hope they're not
                            screwed up.  I might have to bag
                            the whole semester. Anyway, sorry
                            to bother you.

                                          EARL
                            No problem.  Nice meeting you.
                            Hope you get it sorted out.

               Rhonda unhappily turns back to her equipment as Val and Earl
               drive off.


         9     INT.  PICK-UP TRUCK - MOVING - DAY                           9

               Earl glances over at Val with a gleam in his eye.

                                          EARL
                            You know, if you wanted, we could
                            take a look at those seismographs
                            for her.

                                          VAL
                            What the hell do we know about
                            seismographs?

                                          EARL
                            Nothing.  But it sure might be a
                            nice way of getting to know her.

                                          VAL
                            Why?

                                          EARL
                            Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go
                            for any gal unless she fits that
                            damn list of yours A to Z...

                                          VAL
                            Well, sure.

                                          EARL
                            ...And is dumber than my hind end.
                            Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...

               Val flips down the truck's sunvisor.  Tapes to it are snap-
               shots of nearly identical blonde bimbos.  Val points to one.



                                          VAL
                                   (defensively)
                            Tammy Lynn Baxter.

                                          EARL
                            Don't matter.  They're all the
                            same: dead weight.  Can't make a
                            decision, can't walk because of
                            their shoes, can't work because of
                            their fingernails.  Make my skin
                            crawl!

                                          VAL
                            Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.

                                          EARL
                            I thought you called it your
                            pecker.  Look, don't make the
                            mistake I made.  Twenty years of
                            looking for a woman exactly like
                            Miss October 1968, and where'd it
                            get me?  Here with you.

               Val rolls his eyes -- "Give me a break."


         10    EXT.  PERFECTION - ESTABLISH - DAY                           10

               The pick-up rattles toward a tiny, utterly isolated high
               desert hamlet -- a few dozen houses and mobile homes fighting
               for shade in the vast landscape.  Its most prominent feature
               is an aging wood-frame water tower, perhaps 25 feet high,
               near the center of town.  A sign PANS into view --
               "PERFECTION -- Pop. 14."


         11    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 11

               Val and Earl head past the water tower for Pham Van's General
               Store, Perfection's main gossip stop and only business.  The
               store's sign, in English and Vietnamese, reads: "Groceries,
               Haircuts, Post Office, Town Hall, VIDEOS!"  Val and Earl park
               next to a camouflage-painted, large-tired Blazer.

               Just then they spot MELVIN, the town's surly teen-aged pain-
               in-the-ass, coming toward them, mindlessly bouncing a
               basketball off the hoods of parked cars.  As he nears their
               truck:

                                          EARL
                            Melvin, touch that truck and die.

                                          MELVIN
                            Oh, man, I'm really shaking.

               But he steers clear of their truck.


         12    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                               12

               Inside, the energetic Vietnamese owner, PHAM VAN, presides
               over his all-purpose establishment: part general store, part
               barber shop, part saloon.

               At the bar are BURT GUMMER and his wife HEATHER, two no-
               nonsense survivalists who have settled in Perfection to await
               the coming apocalypse -- a nice enough couple, but there's a
               hint of paranoia around the edges.  Burt is shoving a box of
               cartridges across to Pham.

                                          BURT
                            No, Pham, they're not hollow
                            points.  I ordered hollow points
                            and that's what I want.

               When Val and Earl enter, Pham automatically pops the tops on
               two cold beers and has them in place before the cowboys reach
               the bar.  Everyone exchanged nods.

                                          HEATHER
                            Hi, guys, what you been up to?

                                          VAL
                            Ran into the new college student,
                            Rona.

                                          EARL
                            Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's
                            getting some kind of strange
                            readings on her things.

                                          BURT
                            Damn, you know, those kids turn up
                            oil or uranium or something out
                            there...next thing the Feds will be
                            at our door.  "Sorry, time to move.
                            Eminent domain."

                                          HEATHER
                            Down, honey, down.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry,
                            you're gonna have a heart attack
                            before you get to survive World War
                            III.

               Heather and Pham laugh.  Burt smiles patiently.  Just then
               the compressor in Pham's ice cream freezer comes on.  It's a
               loud chug-chug-chug sound mixed with a high-pitched squeal.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going
                            out, you think?

                                          VAL
                            Could be.

               He starts toward the compressor, but Earl heads him off.

                                          EARL
                            Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get
                            over to Nestor's.

                                          VAL
                            Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we
                            don't do anything right now.  Earl
                            explained it to me.

               As they turn to go, Val does a take, amazed, as he spots a
               decorative bleached-out cattle skull displayed on the counter
               -- with a $29.95 price tag.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Hey, Pham Van, what the hell is
                            this?

                                          BURT
                            A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three
                            of them for the rec room.

                                          VAL
                                   (whispers to Pham Van)
                            We sell 'em to you for three bucks
                            a piece!

                                          PHAM VAN
                                   (deadpan)
                            And I appreciate it.

                                          VAL
                                   (playfully)
                            You don't get it, Pham.  The idea
                            was: we were ripping you off.

               Suddenly a car alarm blares from outside.  Burt's out the
               door in a flash.  The others follow.


         13    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 13

               Burt races out and shouts at Melvin who back guiltily away
               from Burt's camouflage Blazer.

                                          BURT
                            Melvin, you little pain-in-the-ass!

                                          MELVIN
                            It wasn't me, man!  Your truck's
                            just screwed up, that's all.

               Burt angrily switches off the alarm.  Val and Earl laugh as
               they climb into their truck.

                                          VAL
                            Why don't his parents ever take him
                            to Vegas with them?

                                          EARL
                            You gotta ask that?


         14    EXT.  PIT - DAY                                              14

               At one end of town, Earl maneuvers a huge bulldozer with a
               scoop-loader blade through a choking cloud of dust, scouring
               out a shallow pit to serve as a watering hole.  Val sights
               down a row of stakes which mark one end of the pit.  The job
               is done.  He signals Earl to cut the engine.  Both men have
               kerchiefs covering their faces and are totally encrusted with
               dust.


         15    ANGLE - TRUCK TRAILER - DAY                                  15

               Nearby is an old battered truck trailer -- the massive, solid
               steel kind used for heavy rock hauling.  Tires flat, mired in
               dried mud and weeds, it hasn't been used in years.  Now it
               provides welcome shade as the men sit sipping some coffee.

               NESTOR CUNNINGHAM drives up, surveying the pit with approval.

                                          NESTOR
                            It came out great, boys.  Should
                            fill up just fine come the next
                            rain.  Lemme have your bill.

               Earl and Val start fishing in their pockets for pen and
               paper.  Earl comes up with various pieces of paper, Val with
               three or four pens.  It's a moment before they realize each
               has the other needed implement.  Earl writes out the bill
               during:

                                          NESTOR (cont'd)
                            I'll have to send it to you the
                            first of the month, boys.

               Val and Earl exchange pained looks.

                                          NESTOR (cont'd)
                            Now, you know I'm good for it.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, Nestor, we know.  Don't worry
                            about it.  Catch us when you can.

               They amble over to their truck.  Earl takes the driver's side
               -- and starts fishing in his pockets for the key.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Are we too easy-going?

                                          EARL
                            No, we're not too easy-going.  This
                            area is economically depressed.

               Val realizes he has the key and hands it over.

                                          VAL
                            So what if we just did it...today.
                            Pack up.  Drive straight down to
                            Bixby.  Get serious.

                                          EARL
                            We could.  We could.  But we'd have
                            to get really serious.  It's gonna
                            cost twice as much to rent a place.

                                          VAL
                            So?  That car wash pays good, and
                            they're always looking.

                                          EARL
                            Car wash?!  That's got no future.
                            If we're gonna take the plunge we
                            oughta have a better plan than
                            that.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, sure.  Go ahead and plan
                            it...for a year or two.


         16    EXT.  VIOLA'S PLACE - DAY                                    16

               CLOSE ON a stencilled sign: PHAM VAN'S U-RENT -- CESSPOOL,
               SEPTIC TANKS.  PULL OUT to see Val and Earl have rented a
               portable septic pump (perhaps trailer mounted).  The aged
               machine reeks of and drips with its ignoble cargo.  The
               intake hose has been repaired so often it looks to be more
               tape than hose.  Grimacing Val threads the slimy hose down
               through the open top of Viola's cesspool.

               Beside them is Viola's well-kept mobile home on a low hill
               not far from Pham Van's store.  Well-kept flower gardens
               surround the place.  VIOLA, a sweet little old lady, watches
               the men work while straining to hold the leash of her tiny
               but ferocious dog.  The dog yaps continuously, lunging at
               Val and Earl.

                                          VIOLA
                            Stop it!  Stop it, you horrid
                            animal!
                                   (to Val and Earl)
                            I'm going to give her back to my
                            son.  I swear it.

                                          VAL
                            Hey, Viola, you've got my
                            permission.

                                          EARL
                            God almighty, my mama sure didn't
                            raise me for this.

               Val gets up and starts the pump's gas engine.

                                          VAL
                            Well, you're the one won't work in
                            the car wash.  You're the one's
                            gotta have a plan.

                                          EARL
                            Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is
                            what keeps us doing jobs like this!

               Earl angrily throws the pump valve and starts the pump
               mechanism.  He and Val on stand either side of the intake
               hose as it gurgles happily.

                                          VAL
                            What keeps us doing jobs like this
                            is you dragging your feet.  I was
                            up for going to Bixby.  I was
                            getting excited.

                                          EARL
                            In the past year I must've said a
                            hundred times "We gotta get out of
                            Perfection.  We gotta better
                            ourselves."  You gonna stand there
                            in broad daylight and tell me you
                            think I'm the reason we're still
                            here?  You want to know how close I
                            am to going to Bixby right now?

                                          VAL
                            I'll call that little bluff.  How
                            close?

               POW!  GOOOOSH!  The gurgling intake hose ruptures, showering
               them with -- well you know.  They react as if they'd been
               shot; gagging, staggering, screaming obscenities.


         17    EXT.   VAL AND EARL'S TRAILER - DAY                          17

               Val and Earl's beat-up mobile home is just down the street
               from Pham Van's store.  Val and Earl, now in cleaner clothes,
               march out resolutely.  Val has a portable TV in one hand and
               a framed COORS beer sign in the other.  Earl unhooks the
               clothes line and dumps it, clothes and all, into the back of
               their truck, on top of the rest of their belongings.

               They stare at each other for a moment.  This is it.  No going
               back.  They leap into the truck.  As they drive off, Val leans
               out and yanks their wooden nameplate ("E. Basset -- V. McKee")
               off the mailbox.


         18    EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    18

               They haven't gone fifty yards when they spot NANCY STERNGOOD
               (40s) working in front of her house.  The guys pull their
               hats low over their faces.  Earl swerves to the far side of
               the street.

                                          EARL
                            Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants
                            another load of firewood.

                                          VAL
                            Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.

               Nancy spots them and beckons excitedly.

                                          EARL
                            She's got us.  Now, listen, the
                            plan is: we have done our last job
                            in Perfection.

                                          VAL
                            That's the plan.

               They stop beside Nancy.  While they talk, Nancy's daughter,
               MINDY (9), comes bouncing along on her pogo-stick, listening
               to her Walkman and slowly circling the truck.

                                          NANCY
                            Mindy, honey, don't pogo in the
                            street.  Hey, guys, I've got a job
                            for you...

                                          EARL
                            Sorry, Nancy.  We ain't doing odd
                            jobs anymore.  We're headed for
                            Bixby permanent.

                                          NANCY
                                   (skeptical)
                            Oh, sure...
                                   (sees stuff in back of
                                    truck)
                            ...My God, you really are!

                                          VAL
                            Yep, we're relocating to an area
                            with a greater economic base.
                                   (to Mindy, over her music)
                            Hey, Mindy, what's the count?

                                          MINDY
                            Six hundred three, six hundred
                            four, six hundred five...

                                          VAL
                            Go for it!

                                          NANCY
                            Gee, guys.  I made the big
                            decision.  I'm putting in that
                            satellite dish.  I was going to
                            offer you five hundred dollars.

               Val and Earl glance at each other -- five hundred dollars!


         19    EXT.  DESERT ROAD - PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY                      19

               The truck roars toward the "Leaving Perfection" sign.  Val
               and Earl are elated, downright giddy.

                                          EARL
                            We did it!  We faced temptation and
                            we did not bend!

                                          VAL
                            Damn straight!  Now there's nothing
                            between us and Bixby but nothing!

               They zoom past the sign.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Last time we'll see that sign!

               They laugh, then are thrown half out of their seats as Earl
               accidentally hits a big pothole.

                                          EARL
                            Last time we hit that goddamn
                            pothole!


         20    EXT.  DESERT - WIDE - DAY                                    20

               As the truck streaks across the landscape.  Val and Earl
               merrily continue their good-byes to whatever is visible.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            So long, cactus!

                                          EARL (V.O.)
                            Adios, bridge!


         21    EXT.  CANYON ROAD - DAY                                      21

               On its way down from the high desert, the lonely road now
               winds through a twisting, narrow canyon.  A county highway
               maintenance truck is parked to one side and two road workers,
               CARMINE and HOWARD, repair a slide-damaged section of the
               road, Carmine breaking up asphalt with a jackhammer.  Val and
               Earl pull up, hand them each a beer, and speed away, shouting:

                                          VAL
                            Last time down this damn twisty
                            road!


         22    EXT.  SHACK - DAY                                            22

               The pick-up speeds past a small shack.  Val and Earl
               automatically roll up their windows.  In a moment we see why:
               a monster, ferocious dog comes galloping out to chase their
               truck.  Earl gives the dog the finger.

                                          EARL
                            Last chance, asshole.  Run, run...!


         23    EXT.  OLD FRED'S PLACE - DAY                                 23

               Old Fred latches the gate on his corral filled with sheep.
               He looks up as Val and Earl's truck speeds past.  Val and Earl
               honk their horn and wave happily.  Old Fred waves back.


         24    EXT.  ROAD - ELECTRICAL TOWERS - DAY                         24

               The pick-up zooms along, the road now paralleling a line of
               tall high-tension electrical towers.


         25    INT./EXT.  PICK-UP TRUCK - MOVING - DAY                      25

               The guys have calmed down, but each is still dreaming of a
               new life.

                                          EARL
                            Okay, here's the plan.  We bust our
                            tails in the car wash six months...
                            well, maybe nine...and we don't
                            spend a dime, you know?  And then
                            we go for it...down payment on a
                            tow-truck or a back-hoe or
                            something, right?  Start a real
                            business.  We can start looking for
                            something today, tonight!

               Val points up ahead -- a man is sitting near the top of a
               distant electrical tower.

                                          VAL
                            Jeez, look at that guy.

                                          EARL
                                   (shakes his head)
                            One job I'd never take is working
                            around electricity.

                                          VAL
                            Especially when it's two hundred
                            feet off the ground.

               But as the pass the tower:

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Hey, hold up...That's Edgar Deems!

                                          EARL
                            You're full of shit.

                                          VAL
                            He's only got one damn jacket.
                            That's him, I'm telling you.


         26    EXT.  ELECTRICAL TOWER - DAY                                 26

               Earl pulls over.  They climb out and peer up at the tower.
               Edgar is hard to see through the criss-crossing girders.

                                          EARL
                                   (impressed)
                            Man, oh, man.  He must've really
                            been drunk this time.
                                   (shouts)
                            Edgar!  What the hell you doing?
                            Get on down from there!

               Edgar doesn't move.  Val and Earl shift about uncomfortably.

                                          VAL
                            Well, shit, we can't leave him up
                            there.

               They stare at each other.  Someone's got to climb up.  Val
               raises his fist in The Challenge.  Their fingers fly.  Rock
               breaks scissors.  Val loses.

               Valentine unhappily climbs the tall tower while Earl watches
               from below.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Hey, Edgar, don't you move.  I'm
                            coming to get you...You damn fool,
                            you owe me on this one...

               Higher and higher Val climbs.  He tries not to look down.

               He's approaching Edgar from below and behind.  As he gets
               nearer he begins to notice forboding details: one of Edgar's
               shoes is missing, half the trouser led is torn off.. Edgar is
               strapped to a girder by his belt, his shotgun gripped in his
               hands.  A swarm of flies buzzes away.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            What the hell...

               He edges around to where he can see Edgar's face -- the
               eyes are wide open, staring.  He's dead.


         27    EXT.  OLD FRED'S PLACE - DAY                                 27

               Old Fred is now hoeing his garden.  He glances up as Val and
               Earl's pick-up roars back toward Perfection.


         28    EXT.  JIM AND MEGAN'S HOUSE - DAY                            28

               A big station wagon is parked between a small mobile home and
               a half-finished house being built by JIM and MEGAN WALLACE,
               an out-going, energetic older couple.  Lumber, cinder blocks,
               and tools are scattered around the yard.

               Jim examines Edgar's body in the bed of Val and Earl's pick-
               up truck.  Val, Earl and Megan talk in subdued tones.

                                          VAL
                            Real sorry to bother you, Megan,
                            but we figured since Jim's a doctor...

                                          MEGAN
                            No, it's fine.  You did the right
                            thing.  When Jim is done we'll call
                            the Coroner's office in Bixby.
                            We'll take care of it.
                                   (shakes her head)
                            Poor Edgar.

                                          EARL
                                   (tries to break the mood)
                            Well, I see you got all the
                            wallboard up.

                                          MEGAN
                            That was easy.  You two did the
                            hard part.  Sure sorry you're
                            leaving.

               Jim climbs out of the pick-up.

                                          EARL
                            Was is a heart attack?

                                          JIM
                                   (shaking his head)
                            He died of dehydration.  Thirst.

                                          VAL
                            But that doesn't make sense.  That
                            takes a couple of days, doesn't it?

                                          JIM
                            Three or four even.

                                          EARL
                            You mean he sat up there three or
                            four days?  Just sat there till he
                            died of thirst?

               Jim shrugs.  Everyone is mystified.


         29    EXT.  OLD FRED'S PLACE - DAY                                 29

               Fred is still hoeing.  In the nearby pen his sheep start
               acting restless.  He eyes them.  What's up?  We hear a
               strange muffled sound.  Unseen, behind him, at the far end of
               the garden, his scarecrow mysteriously tilts.

               Old Fred keeps hoeing.  He stops, his foot is caught in the
               dirt.  Suddenly he is yanked knee-deep into the ground!


         30    EXT.  CANYON ROAD - DAY                                      30

               Val and Earl's truck, again headed for Bixby, and going way
               too fast, zooms past the two workers still repairing the
               road.  The workers glance up, annoyed.


         31    EXT.  SHACK - DAY                                            31

               Val and Earl, sobered and deep in thought, drive past the
               shack where the ferocious dog lives.  They automatically roll
               up their windows during:

                                          EARL
                            Reckon he hated Perfection more
                            than us?  You suppose he wanted to
                            kill himself?

                                          VAL
                            If he did, why didn't he use his
                            damn shotgun?

                                          EARL
                            Maybe he just couldn't pull the
                            trigger...

                                          VAL
                            Oh sure, he figured it was easier
                            to die of thirst?  Come on,
                            sombody must've chased him up
                            there.

                                          EARL
                            Oh, you mean somebody who ain't
                            scared of a twelve gauge shotgun.
                            And then what did they do?  Camp
                            out down below and just wait for
                            him to die?

               Val has no answer.  It's too weird.

                                          VAL
                            Well, whatever the hell happened
                            it's just one more goddamn good
                            reason to haul ass out of this
                            place.

                                          EARL
                            You got that right.

               They are passing the shack.  Earl suddenly realizes:

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Hey, where the hell's that asshole
                            dog?

                                          VAL
                                   (looking around)
                            Probably up a pole starving itself
                            to death.

                                          EARL
                            Okay, the plan is: pedal to the
                            metal the whole way.  We don't stop
                            till we hit the carwash, not even
                            to pee.

                                          VAL
                            I'll go with that plan.


         32    EXT.  OLD FRED'S PLACE - DAY                                 32

               CLOSE ON the pick-up's tires skidding to a stop.  PULL OUT to
               see we're back at Old Fred's.

                                          VAL
                            What are you doing?

               Earl is staring wide-eyed.  Val follows Earl's gaze and is
               aghast when he sees --

               The sheep pen -- it's a ghastly, bloody mess.  Scattered on
               the churned up ground a few dismembered sheep legs and heads
               are all that remain of the flock.

                                          VAL
                                   (whispers)
                            What the hell...?

               Val and Earl leap out of the truck to investigate.

                                          VAL
                            Hey, Old Fred!  Fred!  Where are
                            you?!

               Earl dashes into Fred's house.  Val checks around outside.
               Earl comes back out.

                                          EARL
                            Not here.

               Then they spot something lying in the middle of the garden --
               Old Fred's hat.

               Still looking all around, Val squats distractedly to pick up
               the hat.  He and Earl stumble backward in shock.

               OLD FRED IS STILL WEARING HIS HAT!!  His mangled face stares
               up at them, eyes and mouth frozen open in a death grimace.

                                          EARL
                            Oh, Jesus!!

                                          VAL
                            What the hell is going on?  I mean
                            WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!!


         33    EXT. CANYON ROAD - DAY                                       33

               Carmine and Howard continue repairing the road, Carmine still
               using the noisy jackhammer.  Val and Earl drive up.

                                          EARL
                            You guys better get the hell outta
                            here!  We got a killer on the loose!

                                          HOWARD
                            What?

               Carmine stops jackhammering to listen.

                                          EARL
                            A murderer, man!  A real psycho.
                            He's cutting people's heads off!
                            I'm serious!  I'd high-tail for
                            town if I was you!

               Val and Earl speed away.

                                          CARMINE
                            They're drunk.

                                          HOWARD
                            Yeah...

               But he edges over to the truck and takes out a heavy steel
               pry-bar to keep within easy reach.

               Carmine goes back to work, pounding the asphalt with the
               jackhammer.  Suddenly the blade strikes something beneath the
               road, something soft.  We hear a strange, unearthly shriek
               from underground.  A weird orange goo gushes up around the
               blade.  Then the jackhammer takes off by itself like a
               harpoon stuck in a whale!  Carmine gets tangled in the jack-
               hammer's air-hose and is dragged along, shouting for help.

               Howard chases him down the embankment and into the scrub-
               brush.  He hears Carmine screaming.

                                          HOWARD
                            Carmine!  What the hell is it?!
                            Where are you?

               But now there is only silence.  Howard crashes through the
               brush.  All he finds is the torn end of the air-hose -- which
               suddenly sucks down into the ground.  He's momentarily
               staggered by an awful smell, but forces himself to keep
               looking.  He lets the pry-bar drag on the ground.  Then
               something -- it looks like a mouth or a horrid beak -- shoots
               out of the ground and grips the pry-bar with uncanny
               strength!  Howard drops his weapon and scrambles madly away.

               He clambers back onto the road.  But almost immediately
               cracks form in the pavement around him.  More beak-things
               break through the asphalt between him and his truck.

               He dashes across the road, scrambling up the embankment.  He
               clings precariously to a tree root, looking down -- where'd
               they go?  Suddenly the dirt around him begins to "bubble."
               Several hungry beaks break through and grab him, yanking him
               head first into the embankment.  Then the embankment gives
               way, crashing down onto the road, taking with it a nearby
               telephone pole and snapping the lines.


         34    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 34

               Pham Van is talking to MIGUEL, a local rancher.  They both
               jump as the doors burst open.  Val and Earl race in, trailed
               by Nestor and Melvin.  Val heads for the payphone during:

                                          NESTOR
                            His head?  You mean just his head?

               Val grabs the phone and digs in his pocket for change.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, really sick, man.  Sweet Old
                            Fred.

               Earl comes up with change and hands it to Val, who dials.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Something happen to Fred?

                                          MELVIN
                                   (ignoring Pham)
                            Are you serious, man?  They killed
                            him just to take his sheep?

                                          EARL
                            He didn't have nothing else to
                            steal.  Neither did Edgar.

                                          MIGUEL
                            What happened to Edgar?

               Val stares at the phone.

                                          VAL
                            I don't believe this.  The phone is
                            out!  Pham, your phone is out!

                                          PHAM VAN
                            I didn't do it!  What's going on?

               Val and Earl rush out.


         35    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 35

               Trailed by the others Val and Earl march out and leap into
               their truck , Val driving now.  He searches for the key.

                                          NESTOR
                            We've gotta get the police up here.
                            You guys gotta step on it to Bixby.

               Earl hands Val the key.

                                          VAL
                            Consider it stepped on.


         36    EXT.  CANYON ROAD - DAY                                      36

               Again the pick-up barrels through the canyon.

                                          VAL
                            Brother, we decided to leave this
                            place just one day too late, you
                            know?

                                          EARL
                                   (grimly)
                            Well, there's sure as hell nothing
                            to stop us now.  Everybody we know
                            between here and Bixby is already
                            dead.

               Earl points ahead and screams:

                                          EARL
                            LOOK OUT!!

               Val brings the truck to a squealing stop.  Ahead: the
               collapsed embankment completely blocks the road.  It's
               totally impassable.  The cowboys are dumbfounded.

                                          EARL
                            Is some higher force at work, here?
                            Are we asking too much of life?

               But Val is in no mood for philosophy.  He leaps out and peers
               into the highway maintenance truck which sits undisturbed,
               emergency lights still flashing.  There's nobody in it.  He
               starts looking around.

                                          VAL
                            Those assholes are supposed to be
                            fixing the goddamn road!
                                   (shouts)
                            Hey!  Where are you guys?  People
                            gotta use this road, you know!
                            You on a booze break or what?!

                                          EARL
                                   (whispers; urgently pointing)
                            Val!  Val!

               Val looks where he's pointing -- Howard's bloodstained
               hardhat lies at the edge of the landslide.  Val gets the
               point.  Looking around for the unknown assailant, he eases
               back into the truck.  Earl already has a pistol in his lap
               and is digging through the glove compartment.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Where are the bullets?  Don't we
                            have any goddamn bullets?

               Val quickly jockeys the truck to turn it around on the narrow
               road.  But as he backs into the hillside, we hear a strange
               grating clunk from underneath.  When he tries to pull
               forward, the truck won't move.  The engine stalls.

                                          VAL
                            Jesus!  I don't believe this!

                                          EARL
                            You're hung up again.

                                          VAL
                            I am not!

               They both lean out.  The rear tires are clear.  Val restarts
               the truck and tries to pull forward, rocking the truck
               against some unseen pull.  Smoke wells up from the clutch.

                                          EARL
                            You're hung up I tell you.  You're
                            gonna burn the clutch.

               Val slams the truck into low-range four-wheel-drive and revs
               it.  The tires dig in, fighting for traction -- and suddenly
               the truck lurches free.  We hear an eerie shriek mingled with
               gear and engine noise as Val angrily roars away.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Jesus, you can break an axle like
                            that.

                                          VAL
                            Fuck you!

                                          EARL
                            Hey, I don't want spend the night
                            out here!


         37    EXT.  PHAN VAM'S STORE - DAY                                 37

               The word has spread.  Everybody in town is gathered at Pham
               Van's.  They rush out to meet Val and Earl as they drive up.

                                          BURT
                            What the hell you doing back
                            already?

                                          VAL
                            You're never going to believe this,
                            but the canyon road...we were on it
                            not two hours ago...well, it's
                            completely...

               But he stops because they're all staring wide-eyed at the
               rear of the truck.

                                          NANCY
                            My God...!

               Val and Earl jump out and look where everyone else is
               looking.  Their jaws drop.  REVEAL: hanging from the rear
               axle of their truck and trailing out behind like a nightmare
               wedding decoration -- a sex foot long, grotesque, fleshy,
               tentacle.  The end gripping the axle looks like a vicious,
               razor-sharp beak or hook.  The trailing end is mutilated,
               oozing orange goo -- as though the creature was torn in half.



                                          MELVIN
                            Unreal!  Where'd you get it?

                                          VAL
                            Uh...didn't know we had it...

                                          NANCY
                            It's disgusting.

                            So...it's some kind of snake?

                                          EARL
                            Or a big mother slug maybe?

                                          BURT
                            Some kind of mutation...?

               Burt, more daring than the others, pries the thing off the
               axle with a shovel.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Don't touch, don't touch.

                                          BURT
                            It's dead all right.  Tore the damn
                            thing in half.

                            It must've grabbed us.  That's why
                            the truck stalled-out.

                                          VAL
                                   (suddenly indignant)
                            Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not
                            hung up...!

                                          BURT
                            Stalled out your truck?  Have to be
                            one strong son of a bitch.

               Pham Van leaps over them.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            I give you boys five dollars for
                            it.

               Val and Earl square their shoulders.  This time they're ready
               for him.

                                          VAL
                            Twenty.

                            Fifteen.

                            Okay, fifteen.

                                          VAL
                            Damn right fifteen.

               Burt is deep in thought.

                                          BURT
                            Just one of these couldn't eat up
                            off a whole flock of sheep.
                            There's gotta be more out there, a
                            lot more.

               A cold chill spreads through the group.  They stare out at
               the vast, forbidding desert.  They suddenly feel alone --
               very alone.


         38    EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           38

               CLOSE on Rhonda's hat lying on the ground.  We think the
               worst.  Then she reaches in, picks it up and puts it on.
               REVEAL she's in a lonely corner of the valley working with a
               seismograph.  She pounds a marking stake into the dirt.


         39    INSERT - CLOSE ON SEISMOGRAPH                                39

               The needle responds to each blow on the stake.  We hear
               Rhonda stop pounding.  The needle stops.  All is silent --
               but the needle starts moving again!"


         40    BACK TO SCENE                                                40

               LOW CAMERA is MOVING in Rhonda's general direction.  She
               starts to pound another stake.  CAMERA REACTS so it is moving
               straight toward her.  As it passes a burrow, a rabbit
               suddenly scouts out.  CAMERA WHIP PANS to watch the rabbit
               scamper into the distance, then TURNS BACK to move toward
               Rhonda, who still pounding her stake.

               CAMERA passes Rhonda's seismograph.  The machine tilts
               slightly as the ground bulges up beneath it.

               Rhonda finishes pounding.  She heads for her truck, noisily
               tossing in her tools and slamming the tailgate.  CAMERA
               CLOSES IN on her, faster and faster.  It is right on her
               heels as she climbs into the cab!


         41    ANGLE - RHONDA'S TRUCK                                       41

               A beak-thing thrusts out of the ground, groping where
               Rhonda's boot just was.  Rhonda drives off, unknowingly
               running right over the thing.  We hear a shriek of pain as
               the tentacle writhes and sucks back under the ground.


         42    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - NIGHT                               42

               Mindy Sterngood poses cautiously with the bizarre hook
               tentacle.   A camera FLASHES and we REVEAL Pham Van taking
               her photo beside a sign: "Photographs -- You and the Snake
               Monster -- $2.00."  Viola and Miguel, wait in line.

               We now see the store is crowded with concerned townsfolk
               debating what to do, and how to protect themselves.  Val and
               Earl sit on the sidelines, sipping beer, gazing in awe at
               enterprising Phan Vam:

                            A man who plans ahead.

               Dominating the discussion are Burt and Heather now armed with
               scoped, magnum hunting rifles.  Heather stands guard at a
               window, peering out into the night.

                            ourselves.  We go out, we find
                            those damn snake things, we make
                            'em extinct.

               Burt steps over to a faded topographic map on the wall and
               points out details during:

         43    EXT.  JIM AND MEGANS'S HOUSE - ESTABLISH - NIGHT             43

               In the vast desert night a single floodlight illuminates Jim
               and Megan's partially finished house.  Their station wagon is
               parked out front.  A country and western tune drifts to us
               from it's radio.

               As we MOVE CLOSER, we see the floodlight is powered by a
               small, softly purring generator set maybe fifty feet away.

               Jim and Megan, both exhausted, unload a big stack of roofing
               shingles from their station wagon.  Jim starts to lift a
               package of shingles but gives up and sits on the tailgate.

                                          MEGAN
                            That's the sky that's going to be
                            over our roof every night, when
                            we're done.

                                          JIM
                                   (joking)
                            Ah, but consider this, if we don't
                            finish the roof, we can looks at
                            that sky all the time.

               Just then the whirring of the generator becomes strangely
               muffled.  The floodlight flickers.  Now the generator dies.
               Darkness engulfs them.  The car radio music drones on
               incongruously.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Damn that thing!

                                          MEGAN
                                   (sarcastic)
                            We could always buy a new
                            generator.

               Jim digs out a powerful flashlight and heads over toward the
               generator.  Megan lies back, taking a welcome breather.
               After a moment:

                                          MEGAN
                            Well, what's wrong with it?

                                          JIM (V.O.)
                            It's...gone...!


         44    ANGLE - JIM                                                  44

               Baffled, he sweeps the whole area with the flashlight.  Megan
               joins him.

                                          MEGAN
                            You sure this is where it was?

                                          JIM
                            Am I sure?!
                                   (points with flashlight)
                            It was right there.  There's the
                            cord.

               The severed electric cable stops at the edge of a cone-shaped
               depression in the dirt where the generator sat.  He hands her
               the flashlight and kneels.  We watch tensely as he probes the
               loose earth with his hands.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Maybe the ground caved in.  There's
                            a lot of old mines and stuff around
                            here.

               Megan grabs his shirt, trying to pull him back.

                                          MEGAN
                            Well don't then!  You don't want to
                            fall in.

               Suddenly, about ten feet away -- WHOOMP!!  The generator
               shoots up out of the ground!  Jim and Megan dive for cover as
               it sails through the air, and crashes to earth.  They stare,
               transfixed.  The generator is dented and bent almost beyond
               recognition -- and covered with oozing slime.

                                          JIM
                            What the...?

               But Megan is all action.  She yanks him back.

                                          MEGAN
                            Come on.  Get away from it!

                                          JIM
                            God, what a stink!

               We again hear that mysterious rumbling sound.  Jim stops,
               sweeping the flashlight around them.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Hear that?

                                          MEGAN
                            Never mind!  Let's go!  Let's just
                            go into town or something!  Jim,
                            please!

               She hustles him bodily toward the car during:

                                          JIM
                            You know, I bet it's geological or
                            something, like natural gas, or a
                            geyser.  They stink like that.
                            Remember in Yellowstone...?

               Suddenly he drops knee-deep into ground!  Megan is thrown
               off balance and tumbles to one side.  The flashlight falls,
               lighting them at an eerie low angle.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Something's got me!!

               We hear sickening CRUNCHES from below the earth.  He SCREAMS
               in excruciating agony.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Oh, God!  Get me Out!!  GET ME OUT!!

               He struggles wildly, but just sinks further down!  Megan
               slides a 2X4 over to Jim.  He grabs it like a drowning man,
               trying to keep himself from being pulled down.  But he's
               pulled with suck power the 2X4 snaps!

               His head is going under.  Megan desperately tries to dig the
               smothering earth away, but she's losing.  Now only his arms
               are above ground.  She pulls with all her might, but he sinks
               inexorably down, down.  She's pulled flat on the ground.
               He's gone.

               The next instant, a vicious hook-tentacle erupts through the
               earth, missing Megan's face by inches.  She scrambles back
               frantically.


         45    ANGLE - STATION WAGON                                        45

               LOW CAMERA pursues Megan toward the car, just missing her as
               she dives in through the open tailgate.  She slams it after
               her.  The talons rake across the car, scratching the glass.

               Megan tumbles into the front seat.  Thank God the keys are in
               the ignition.  She starts the engine.  But outside the "snake
               things" attack the car in a frenzy, slashing blindly.  A rear
               tire is totally shredded just as:

               Megan floors it.  The car lurches forward but the mutilated
               tire falls apart.  The wheel rim digs into the loose earth
               and the car is stuck.  With no other recourse, Megan locks
               the door, rolls up the windows and cowers in the middle of
               the car, panting, sobbing.  The radio is still playing a
               happy cowboy tune.  She peeks out.  They gave up?  She's
               safe?  Nothing happens for a moment, then --

               The car starts to shake and shudder!  Dust wells up around the
               windows.

               Outside we see a bizarre sight.  The earth around the rear of
               the car is "boiling," dirt flying in all directions -- and
               the car starts to sink into the ground!!

               Megan wildly honks the horn!  The car looks just like a ship
               going down by the stern, hood tilting up gracefully.  The
               back windows shatter, dirt pouring in!  Megan smashes the
               windshield with a small fire extinguisher and scrambles out
               on the hood.  But there's no hope.  The car keeps sinking,
               titling now almost ninety degrees, forcing her onto a
               precarious perch on the grille -- sinking, sinking.

               Out of her mind with terror, she keeps softly murmuring the
               same hopeless phrases:

                                          MEGAN
                            Stop it!  Stop it!  Somebody stop it...!


         46    EXT.  DESERT - JIM AND MEGAN'S HOUSE - VERY WIDE - NIGHT     46

               The headlights are two ironic beacons sending their beams
               skyward through the roiling dust into the night sky.  The
               sound of the radio becomes muffled.  The headlights sink from
               view -- and then Megan's scream floats across the desert.


         47    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAWN                                47

               Out front of Pham Van's, nervous Val and Earl saddle up the
               horses while Pham loads their saddle bags with food.  Every-
               one has gathered to see them off.  There's an air of tension.

                                          VAL
                                   (eyeing the horses)
                            Pham, we don't want to be stuck on
                            a couple of canners.  They better
                            be fast.

                                          EARL
                            Relax.  A snake thing like that
                            couldn't move too quick.

                                          VAL
                            Screw you.  For all you know they
                            could fly.

               Earl pulls their old Smith and Wesson revolver and battered
               Winchester rifle out of the pick-up truck.

                                          EARL
                            You want the rifle or the Smith?

                                          VAL
                                   (definite)
                            The rifle.

               So does Earl.  He raises his hand.  They swiftly do a round
               of scissors-rock-paper.  Earl loses.  He hands Val the rifle.
               Just then, Burt and Heather pull up in their Blazer, climbing
               out with their hunting rifles.

                                          BURT
                            You guys all set?

                                          EARL
                            Ready as we'll ever be.

                                          BURT
                            Heather and I are going to drive
                            around a little, see if we can find
                            that college girl and tell her to
                            get her ass back into town.

                                          VAL
                            Good idea.  And we'll swing by the
                            doctor's place.  They were going to
                            go into Bixby but we don't know if
                            they left before the road was out.

               Val and Earl mount up.

                                          HEATHER
                            Hold on.  You guys oughta take
                            something that packs more punch
                            than that thirty-thirty.  Take one
                            of our Browning autos, or even my
                            model seventy...
                                   (offers her hunting rifle)
                            It's three-seventy-five H and H
                            mag.

               Earl takes the awesome-looking gun with a smug glance at Val.

                                          EARL
                            Gee...thanks, Heather.  Hope we
                            don't need it.

               Heather unhooks a box of cartridges from her belt and hands
               it to Earl.  Suddenly there's a blood-curdling SCREAM!  The
               door to Pham Van's flies open.  Out staggers Melvin, wrapped
               in Pham Van's hook-tentacle, writhing in apparent agony.

                                          MELVIN
                            IT'S GOT ME!  IT's GOT ME!  AAAAHGH!

               People scatter like sheep.  Burt and Heather have guns
               trained on him in an instant.  Then everyone realizes it's a
               sick joke.  Melvin collapses with laughter.  Burt is livid.
               He almost shot Melvin.  He charges over and yanks the kid to
               his feet, screaming:

                                          BURT
                            You stupid punk!  You came that
                            close, that close!!

                                          EARL
                            One of these days, Melvin,
                            somebody's gonna kick your ass.

               Pham rushes over and grabs his precious tentacle.  As people
               calm down, Val and Earl gaze nervously at the vast desert
               before them.

                                          BURT
                            Well...you fellas watch yourselves.

                                          NANCY
                            Come back with the Sheriff.

                                          NESTOR
                            Sheriff, like hell.  Come back with
                            the National Guard.

               They ride out to an adlib chorus:  "Keep your heads down;"
               "Go careful, boys;" "Keep a sharp lookout;" etc.


         48    EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           48

               Val and Earl ride along, very tiny in the vast, lonely
               landscape, and very on edge.  Constantly looking all around.

                                          EARL
                            You know, we can't possibly make
                            Bixby by nightfall.

               Val doesn't want to hear it.

                                          EARL
                            That means we're gonna be out here,
                            like, in the dark.

                                          VAL
                                   (resentfully)
                            Great.  Thank you.

               Faint Country and Western radio music drifts to them.
               They're nearing Jim and Megan's house.


         49    EXT.  JIM AND MEGAN'S HOUSE - DAY                            49

               Val knocks on the door to the mobile home.

                                          VAL
                            Hey, doctor, anybody here?

               No answer.  He opens the door and peers inside.  Behind him
               Earl steps out of the half-finished house and shrugs.  Nobody
               around.  Wind rustles the plastic sheeting over the windows.
               Strangely they can still hear the muffled radio clearly.

                                          VAL
                                   (spooked)
                            Oh, man, I hate this shit.

               They walk briskly to their horses.  Earl snatches Heather's
               rifle from its saddle scabbard.  Val pulls out the
               Winchester.  Earl tries to reassure himself.

                                          EARL
                            Car's gone.  We just missed them,
                            that's all.

                                          VAL
                            Then where's the goddamn Conway
                            Twitty coming from?

               They focus on the sound and walk gingerly toward it, keeping
               constant watch in every direction.  The ground here is all
               torn up like the sheep pen -- and the music is coming from
               underneath!  What the hell is going on?

               Val scrapes at the dirt with his boot -- and finds the
               headlight of Jim and Megan's station wagon, still on, glaring
               up at him.  He drops down and wildly sweeps away more dirt,
               revealing more of the car's grille and hood -- and blood -
               soaked dirt which sticks to his hand.  He leaps away,
               frantically rubbing the blood off on his pants.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Oh, man...oh, man...


         50    EXT.  DESERT - CONCRETE DITCH - DAY                          50

               Val and Earl are riding at full gallop.  They race alongside
               a concrete-lined flood-control ditch and veer off to follow a
               barbed wire fence which crosses the ditch.


         51    EXT.  DESERT - BARBED WIRE FENCE - DAY                       51

               They ride along the fence during:

                                          EARL
                            Here's the plan...We don't even
                            stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we
                            keep right on going.  We'll walk
                            the horses.

                                          VAL
                            That is the plan...I mean, goddamn
                            it!  What the hell are those
                            things?  How could they bury an
                            entire Plymouth station wagon?

                                          EARL
                            Why would they do it?

               Suddenly the horses stop short.  In a frenzy they wheel
               around, rear up, refusing to go on.  The cowboys fight to
               control them.

                                          VAL
                            I knew it!  Pham Van wouldn't know
                            a decent horse if...!

               But Earl's already drawing his rifle.

                                          EARL
                            Shut up!  They got wind of
                            something they don't like!

                                          VAL
                            Oh shit!

               He draws his rifle.  They look wildly in all directions at
               once -- but there's nothing, only empty desert.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            But I don't see anything!

               They keep staring.  The horses keep pacing nervously.  Then
               -- Earl's horse rears wildly and falls!  Earl goes flying.
               Val wheels around wildly, dismounts and runs to Earl, who's
               bruised and winded but basically unhurt.  They think Earl's
               horse just tripped.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Hey, you okay?  You okay?

                                          EARL
                            Yeah...yeah.
                                   (turning to the horse)
                            What about the hor...?

               Their eyes bulge.  Several "snake things" have engulfed the
               horse's head, sucking, crushing, slurping.  Val's horse goes
               berserk and gallops for the horizon.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            What in the name...?

                                          VAL
                            That's how they get you!  They're
                            under the goddamn ground!

               Suddenly they realize what that means -- the thing could
               come up under them!!  The cowboys scramble frantically away.
               But nothing pursues them.  They pause, glancing back
               nervously.

                                          EARL
                            What the hell are they?

                                          VAL
                            Sons of bitches!

               Val raises his rifle and takes a well-aimed shot, hitting one
               of them.  Orange goo spurts out.  We hear a deafening shriek
               as all the "snake things" instantly zip back underground.

               Then -- A HUGE MOUND OF EARTH RISES UP UNDER VAL AND EARL!!
               The cowboys tumble down its side, Val losing his rifle.  They
               roll over and stare dumbfounded at the mound.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                                   (gasps)
                            There must be a million of them!!

               The mound of earth turns toward them.  The ground splits open
               and out rises -- a huge head!

                                          EARL
                                   (awestruck)
                            Nope...just one.

               The monster is a horrendous thirty-foot long eating machine!
               Its head is eyeless, utterly alien, covered with tough boney
               plates which close together to form a cork-screw point.

               The cowboys stumble back toward the fence in speechless
               terror.  The creature slides toward them, pushing through the
               earth like a whale through water.  Now it opens its mouth --
               but it's like a grotesque flower, boney plates spreading open
               like petals, revealing a huge, slimy, fleshy, oozing orifice!
               And inside the mouth, a ghastly multi-tentacled tongue!
               These are the "snake things," not snakes at all but actually
               the horrid hook-tentacles that can shoot out six feet to snag
               their prey!

               The monster snorts and snuffs, throwing up plumes of dust,
               sounding like a horrendous pig.  It sinks into the earth and
               charges!  We see the hump of earth move toward them faster
               and faster but then it disappears as the creature goes deeper.

               Val and Earl leap sideways and run along the fence.  The
               creature goes straight and slams into a fencepost from below.
               All we see is the fencepost knocked at a crazy angle.

               The cowboys keep running.  The creature regroups and charges
               after them, hitting each fencepost in turn, sending weird
               sinuous shock waves along the barbed wire, making almost
               musical twanging sounds.  Val looks back.

                                          VAL
                            It's gaining on us!!

               And as if that weren't enough, Earl points to more trouble
               ahead.


         52    EXT.   CONCRETE DITCH - DAY                                  52

               The fence runs straight to the edge of the ditch, an eight
               foot wide gap yawning dead ahead.  The creature churns like
               a locomotive from behind.  They'll have to try to jump!  They
               strain desperately for every last fraction of speed.

                                          EARL
                            We can do it, we can do it!

               They leap and -- they don't do it!!  They smack into the
               opposite side of the ditch, clawing frantically at the lip,
               only to tumble to its sloping bottom.  A split second later
               the charging creature slams like a wrecking ball into the
               foot-thick concrete wall!  The wall CRACKS AND BULGES OUT!  A
               hook-tentacle flops out through one of the cracks!  Terrified
               Val and Earl scramble away.  But the wall holds together.

               And the, strangely, all is quiet.  The tentacle lays dead
               still.  Eventually, the cowering cowboys dare to creep back a
               little closer, still panting, exhausted, jumpy.

                                          EARL
                            Stupid son of a bitch...knocked
                            itself cold.

               And now orange slime begins to ooze through the cracks in the
               concrete.

                                          VAL
                            Cold, my ass!  It's dead!  We
                            killed the bastard!

               He suddenly shakes his fist at the dead beast.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            You FUCKER!!

               They allow themselves a small wheeze of nervous laughter,
               only to jump like rabbits as some pebbles rattle loudly down
               the concrete wall behind them.  They whirl to see Rhonda, up
               on the opposite side of the ditch, staring down at them.
               She's lugging a bunch of her equipment, including a small
               folding shovel.

                                          RHONDA
                            Hi, guys, how're you doing?  Look,
                            can I ask you something?  Did you
                            just notice something weird?
                            Vibrations?  You know, some kind of
                            earth tremor?

               Val and Earl look at each other, then burst out laughing.
               Rhonda spots the cracked wall.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            What's that?


         53    EXT.   CONCRETE DITCH - DAY                                  53

               The shattered concrete has been pulled away to fully reveal
               the creature's horrendous head.  Start CLOSE on it: oozing
               blood, slavering mouth plates hanging open, hook-tentacles
               lolling out.  WIDEN to see Earl and Rhonda, sweating, dusty
               and tired, staring in awe and cringing at the stench.

                                          EARL
                            Jesus Christ...think it smells like
                            that 'cause it's dead?

                                          RHONDA
                            I don't see any eyes...must be
                            totally subterranean...and those
                            tentacles...

                                          EARL
                            I think they shoot right outta its
                            mouth, hook you, and pull you right
                            in.  Good thing we stopped it
                            before it killed anybody else.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (shudders)
                            Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find me.
                                   (overwhelmed)
                            This is important, you know.  This
                            is like, well, let's say it, it's
                            probably the biggest zoological
                            discovery of the century.  The
                            century?  Forget it.  History.

               We can hear a shovel digging up above, and now Val shouts:

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            I got it!  Here's the other end!
                            Just look at what we caught here!

               Earl and Rhonda climb up.  CRANE UP with them to REVEAL the
               whole animal!  Val, digging excitedly with Rhonda's shovel,
               is just scraping away the last loose dirt from the creature's
               tail.  The whole length of the immense thirty foot beast is
               partially uncovered, in king-sized bas-relief.

                                          EARL
                                   (hushed)
                            This is one big mother!

                                          VAL
                            So this is the guy that had your
                            seismos working overtime?

               She nods, stepping down to study the creature.  The body is
               stream-lined, cigar-shaped, maybe eight feet in diameter at
               its thickest.  It's covered with hundreds of short, rear-
               pointing, retractable spikes.  Rhonda gingerly jiggles one.
               It can be pushed in and out of its socket like a plunger.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            It must push itself along with
                            these.  Hundreds of them pushing at
                            once.  That's how it can move so
                            fast.  I mean this thing was
                            tripping sensors all over the
                            valley.  No wonder I couldn't...

               A chilling thought stops her in mid-sentence.  She springs
               down into the drainage ditch to get her backpack, pulling out
               her seismograph printouts.  She studies them frantically
               during:

                                          EARL
                            Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of
                            anything like this before?

                                          VAL
                                   (elbows Earl)
                            Sure, Earl, everybody knows about
                            them.  We just didn't tell you.
                            Come on, nobody's ever seen one of
                            these!  We're really in on
                            something here!

               The guys looks at each other.  One thought immediately springs
               to their minds.

                                          EARL
                            Pham Van don't get his mitts on
                            this for no measly fifteen bucks!

                                          VAL
                            You got that right!

               While they bask in their fame-to-be, Rhonda continues to
               study the print-outs, coming to a terrifying conclusion.

                                          EARL
                            Here's the plan: we'll get a...a
                            flatbed, I guess, with a big winch,
                            figure a five ton anyway.

                                          VAL
                            Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd
                            tear it all up.  Want to lift it.
                            Some kind of crane with lifting
                            straps.

               But Rhonda interrupts -- now really scared.

                                          RHONDA
                            Hey, hey, shut up!  The way I
                            figure it.  There are five more of
                            these things!

               Val and Earl shut right up.  Earl edges up a fencepost.  Val
               sidles up onto a rock during:

                                          EARL
                            Five more?

               Rhonda paws through her unwieldy printouts, pointing out
               jagged ink lines on the graphs, comparing different ones.

                                          RHONDA
                            Yeah, darn it, look.  I've got
                            seismographs all over the valley.
                            If you compare the different
                            readings, there have to be five.
                            Here's one at two o'clock
                            yesterday, but here's another one
                            three miles away at the same time.
                            So that's two.  Now, here...

               The men leap from their perches and hustle her in the
               direction she came from.

                                          VAL
                            We'll take your word for it.

                                          EARL
                            Yeah.  Where's your truck?

                                          RHONDA
                            The other side of that dome.

               She indicates what to most of us would be a hill, dotted with
               huge boulders thrusting out of the sandy desert soil like big
               mushrooms.  The trio jogs toward the hill.


         54    EXT.  DESERT - SEISMOGRAPH - DAY                             54

               En route to the truck, they pass near one of Rhonda's
               seismographs.  Suddenly Earl stumbles as one leg drops knee-
               deep into the ground!  He screams.  Val wheels and bodily
               yanks him up.  They back away from the small hole in the
               ground, calming a little as they realize:

                                          EARL
                            Prairie dog burrow...

                                          VAL
                            Little sons of bitches.

               Rhonda tenses as she hears a sound she knows well -- the soft
               scratching of the seismograph needle across its paper
               cylinder.  She whacks Val on the shoulder and points
               speechlessly at it.


         55    INSERT - SEISMOGRAPH                                         55

               The needle is going wild!!


         56    BACK TO SCENE                                                56

               She doesn't have to explain.  All three of them dash dash for:


         57    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - DAY                                    57

               The remains of an old rail fence lay beside one of the
               boulders.  Val, Earl, and Rhonda scramble over the wood, up
               onto the rock and stand there tensely.

               In a moment, the creature gently rustles the earth at the
               base of the rock.  The monster's slimy hook-tentacles slither
               out, searching the rock base.  Shuddering, the humans move as
               high as they can, well out of reach.  The tentacles slip back
               beneath the earth.  Everyone breathes a sigh of relief.

                                          EARL
                            Well, at least the bastard can't
                            climb.  Pardon my French.

                                          RHONDA
                            Probably couldn't move too easily
                            on the surface.

                                          VAL
                            God, the live ones smell worse tan
                            the dead ones.

                                          EARL
                            Okay, now, how far's your truck?

               Rhonda points.  They can see the roof of her truck, maybe a
               hundred yards away through the boulders.  Val and Earl think
               about it.

                                          VAL
                            I don't know.  If this one's any
                            faster than that other one...

                                          EARL
                                   (nods)
                            I think we wait right here.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


         58    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - SUNSET                                 58

               It's hours later.  Stiff and uncomfortable, they have nothing
               to do but theorize.

                                          RHONDA
                            There's nothing like them in the
                            fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so
                            they predate the fossil record...
                                   (not buying it herself)
                            That'd make them a couple of
                            billion years old...and we've just
                            never seen one till now.  Right.

                                          EARL
                            I'd vote for outer space.  No way
                            those are local boys.

                                          VAL
                                   (joking)
                            Atomic testing.  Or, no, bio-
                            engineering!  The government built
                            them, a big surprise in the next
                            war.

               There's a long pause.  Earl stares at the dirt around the rock.

                                          EARL
                            Well...haven't seen a sign for
                            hours.  Maybe it's long gone.

                                          VAL
                            Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a
                            little stroll and see?

                                          EARL
                            Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, we've got to do something.

               Val gets an idea.  He grabs a post from the dilapidated fence
               and cautiously slips down near the boulder's edge.

                                          EARL
                            Watch yourself!  It's got a good
                            six foot reach.

               Val nods.  Dead silence as he reaches way out with the post
               and scrapes it on the ground.  Almost instantly the creature
               roars up, grabbing the post in a flurry of flying dirt and
               lashing tentacles, nearly hooking Val's hand.  Val
               practically falls over himself scrambling back to safety.

                                          VAL
                            Son of a bitch!

                                          EARL
                            Son of a goddamned bitch!  Been
                            waiting there all this time.  How
                            the hell's it even know we're still
                            here?

                                          VAL
                            It's been listening to us.  It's
                            got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't
                            smell anything underground, so I
                            figure...

               Rhonda stares at Val, impressed.

                                          RHONDA
                            Of course!  It can sense the
                            slightest seismic vibration...hear
                            every move we make.  Especially on
                            this rock.  It's a perfect
                            conductor.

               They all settle back, having no idea what to do next.  Rhonda
               gazes out at the desert that surrounds them like an ocean.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            I always wanted to be stuck on a
                            desert island.  But somehow I
                            always imagined, you know, water.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

         58A   EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - NIGHT                                 58A

               Our heroes are silhouetted against a huge, spectacular,
               desert night sky.  After a very long pause:

                                          EARL
                            You know, I hate to be crude, but
                            I'm gonna have to take care of some
                            business here.

                                          VAL
                                   (emphatic)
                            Me, too.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (just as emphatic)
                            Same here.

               The silhouettes shift, Val and Earl moving down one side of
               the rock, and Rhonda down the other.  We can no longer see
               them.  We just head zippers zipping down -- then soft sighs
               of relief from Val and Earl.  Then:

                                          RHONDA (V.O.)
                                   (softly)
                            Darn it!

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            You okay?

                                          RHONDA (V.O.)
                            Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you
                            ever wanted proof God is a man,
                            this is it.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


         59    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - DAWN                                   59

               Rich orange sunlight creeps silently across the deathly still
               desert.  Earl is already awake.  Val is curled up without his
               jacket, shivering.  He wakes with a start.  Where the hell's
               his jacket?

               Rhonda wakes slowly.  She's surprised to find herself wrapped
               in Val's jacket.  Touched by his chivalry, she embarrassedly
               hands it to baffled Val.

                                          RHONDA
                            Thanks.

               Val glances at Earl, who looks away.  Who, me?

                                          VAL
                                   (to Rhonda)
                            No problem.  Anytime.

               Earl gropes through his pockets, coming up with only
               cigarettes.  Val fishes in his own pockets, finding only
               their lighter.  They exchange items and light up during:

                                          EARL
                            Well, folks, what's the plan?

                                          VAL
                            First let's see if Stumpy's still
                            out there.

               This time he tosses a piece of wood out onto the sand.  With
               soft rustling, a bulge forms in the earth, moves over to the
               wood, then subsides.  Rhonda starts looking around during:

                                          EARL
                            Don't he have a home to go to?

                                          VAL
                                   (grim)
                            Well, that's why Edgar never got
                            down off that tower.

                                          RHONDA
                            I might have an idea...

                                          EARL
                                   (ignoring her)
                            We're gonna have to come up with
                            some kind of plan or it's just
                            gonna wait us to death.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, I was wondering if we
                            could...

                                          VAL
                            Well, let's just run for it.  We
                            outran that one yesterday, at least
                            on a sprint.

               Rhonda gives up on them.  She goes over and pulls a long
               cross rail from the fence during:

                                          EARL
                            Run for it?  Running's not a plan.
                            Running is what you do when the
                            plan fails.  You're not even trying
                            to come up with a plan!

                                          VAL
                            Well, it's not like we've got a
                            hell of a lot of options...

                                          RHONDA
                                   (interrupting)
                            You guys know how to pole vault?

               They watch in surprise as she hefts her pole, checks the
               balance, eyeballs the distance to the nearest boulder.  Then
               she charges between them, plants her pole and vaults smoothly
               over to the next boulder, maybe fifteen feet away.  The
               creature surfaces where her pole touched down, but too late
               -- a hook tentacle vainly sweeps the area, the disappears
               into the ground.  Val and Earl glance at each other,
               impressed.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            We just stay where it can't get
                            us...on these residual boulders.
                            My truck's parked right next to
                            one.

               Earl rushes to grab a couple more fence rails.

                                          EARL
                            Stay on those residual boulders!

               Val just stands staring across at Rhonda -- his horizons are
               broadening.  Earl stuffs a fence rail into his hands.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                                   (pointedly)
                            Tammy Lynn Baxter, she do a lot of
                            pole-vaulting?

               Earl takes a deep breath and goes for it, vaulting across to
               Rhonda.  Val follows.


         60    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - WIDE SHOT - DAY                        60

               Through the shimmering heat in the distance we see the
               strange sight of the three figures vaulting from boulder to
               boulder.


         61    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - RHONDA'S TRUCK - DAY                   61

               Val, Earl and Rhonda pole-vault their way toward the truck.
               Finally they're at the nearest boulder, but the truck is
               still ten feet away.

                                          VAL
                            Think it's still following us?

                                          RHONDA
                            Let's assume that it is.

                                          EARL
                            And once we hit that truck we gotta
                            go fast.  I say we all jump together.

               Rhonda and Val nod.  Rhonda grips her car keys in her teeth.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (through clenched teeth)
                            Ready?

                                          VAL
                            Yeah.  One, two, three...

               They all vault in unison, landing in the truck bed.  Rhonda
               scrambles up, slides open the cab's rear window, and begins
               wriggling through headfirst.

                                          EARL
                                   (whispers)
                            Come on, girl, it ain't gonna give
                            us much time...

               Dust explodes around the rear of the truck!  Hook-tentacles
               snake up on all sides, narrowly missing Val.  He and Earl
               grab whatever's handy, pounding at the tentacles with
               expensive instruments.

                                          VAL
                            GO!  GO!  GO!

               Rhonda's only half way through the cab window, still hanging
               headfirst into the cab.  She frantically starts the truck,
               dives down and punches the accelerator with her fist.

               As the truck roars away, one tentacles manages to tear off the
               the muffler.  The engine thunders like a tank.  Val and Earl
               sit back, sighing in relief, then react when they see
               Rhonda is driving upside down and blind.


         62    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 62

               Rhonda skids her noisy truck to a halt in front of Pham Van's.

                                          VAL
                            We better get everybody together.

               Val leaps out and jumps into his pick-up truck.  He searches
               for the key.

                                          EARL
                            You go north, I'll go south.

                                          VAL
                            Right.

               Val holds out his hand for the key.  Earl tosses it to him.
               Val drives off.  We FOLLOW Rhonda and Earl as they drive the
               other way, toward Viola's.

                                          EARL
                            I'll bet you're sorry the college
                            ever sent you up here.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, I'm scared, but I'm not
                            sorry.

                                          EARL
                            You know, Val went to that college,
                            too.  For a whole year.  Couldn't
                            quite sit still for it, though.
                            Had too much vinegar in his system.
                            But once he settles down, forgets
                            this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in
                            a million.

               Rhonda sees straight through Earl's clumsy attempt at match-
               making.  She can't help but smile.  Earl grins sheepishly.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            All right, I'm about as subtle as
                            a donkey's ass.  Pardon my French.
                            I'm just saying the boy's got
                            potential, that's all.

               MOVE IN on Rhonda -- her and Val?


         63    INT. PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                  63

               Nestor, Viola, Nancy, and Miguel nervously crowd around Val,
               Earl, and Rhonda.  Viola holds her yappy dog which perio-
               dically snarls and snaps at people.  Pham Van is on his CB
               radio trying to contact Burt and Heather.

                                          MIGUEL
                            You serious, Val?  You think we're
                            not even safe here in town?

                                          VAL
                            Ask me that after you meet one.  I
                            think we should all get the hell
                            out while the getting's good.

                                          NESTOR
                            Why not just take a Number Ten pick
                            axe and give it one good whack...?

                                          VAL
                            Nestor, damn it, these things are
                            bigger than an Airstream trailer!

                                          NANCY
                            God, I've got to find Mindy.

               Nancy rushes out.

                                          EARL
                            Hey, Pham, where's Burt and Heather?

                                          PHAM VAN
                                   (hangs up CB)
                            Can't raise them.  I guess they're
                            still out there somewhere.

                                          RHONDA
                            If you've got a radio, why aren't
                            you calling somebody in Bixby?  The
                            police or...

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Can't reach outside the valley.
                            You know, because of the mountains.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, Rhonda, what's the name you
                            call those things, huh?

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Where'd they come from?

                                          RHONDA
                            Huh?  I don't know.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            You're a scientist, right?

                                          VIOLA
                            You should have a theory at least.

                                          RHONDA
                            Look, these things are absolutely
                            unprecedented!

                                          NESTOR
                            Yeah, but where'd they come from?

                                          RHONDA
                                   (exasperated)
                            Where'd they come from?  Okay,
                            worms, probably in the Jurassic
                            period.  Cosmic radiation was much
                            higher then...so they mutated...and
                            they got so big they just sank
                            right into the ground and fell
                            asleep... But now continental drift
                            has brought them to the surface,
                            ready to be harvested by the
                            ancient alien meat growers who
                            planted them here.

               Everybody stares at her, then they smile, realizing she's
               pulling their legs.

                                          EARL
                            You're right, don't matter where
                            they come from.

                                          VAL
                            Right.  We need to be talking about
                            what we're gonna do.

                                          VIOLA
                            My goodness, Valentine, once they
                            see the road is out and the phone
                            lines are down, someone will be
                            along to look in on us.  Don't you
                            think?


         64    EXT.  CANYON ROAD - DAY                                      64

               We see the utility truck still parked near the landslide
               blocking the road.  REVEAL, on the far side, a telephone
               maintenance truck is now parked, emergency lights flashing --
               and nearby, amid phoneworkers' climbing and repair gear, two
               more hard hats lying on blood-soaked ground.


         65    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 65

               The crowd is still jabbering away.  Rhonda speak over them:

                                          RHONDA
                            No no no, they listen!  They can
                            sense the slightest vibration
                            through the ground.  That's how
                            they see!  That's how they hunt!

                                          MIGUEL
                            So, like we don't vibrate, right?
                            Maybe they won't even come to here,
                            huh?  Maybe they leave us alone.

               Val shakes his head, and marches over to the topographic map
               on the wall.

                                          VAL
                            They caught up with Edgar here.
                            They grabbed Old Fred here.  They
                            nailed the asshole dog here.  And the
                            doctor's place is here...

               The spots he indicates describe a line leading along the
               valley straight toward town.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            This valley's just one long
                            smorgasbord and if we don't haul
                            ass outta here we're the next
                            course.

               We hear an a eerie SHRIEK from outside.  Something shoots in
               through the window, striking Earl in the chest!!  Earl flails
               frantically at it -- but it's only Melvin's basketball.  We
               glimpse Melvin outside, doubled over with laughter.  Earl
               grabs the ball and hurls it viciously back, but Melvin easily
               dodges it.

                                          EARL
                            You little ass wipe!  You knock
                            that off or you're gonna be
                            shitting that basketball!  Pardon
                            my French.

                                          NESTOR
                                   (to Val)
                            Now, Val, let's assume they're as
                            dangerous as you say.  Where are we
                            going to go that's safer than right
                            here?

                                          VAL
                            Rhonda's got an idea about that.

                                          RHONDA
                            Yes, see, they move very easily
                            through the Pleistocene Alluvials...
                                   (off their blank looks)
                            ...the dirt...the loose soil that
                            makes up the valley floor.  But
                            they can't move through solid rock.
                            I think we should travel west to
                            the mountains.

                                          EARL
                            You know, up the jeep trail.

                                          RHONDA
                            The mountains are solid granite.
                            We'd be safe there, and we could
                            hike along them...all the way to
                            Bixby if we have to.


         66    EXT.  EDGE OF TOWN - DAY                                     66

               Nancy rushes back toward Pham Van's, still looking.

                                          NANCY
                            Mindy!  Mindy!


         67    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 67

               We're CLOSE on Melvin as he circles around the back of Pham
               Van's, bouncing his basketball, mischief in his eyes.  We can
               hear the townsfolk inside.

                                          VIOLA (V.O.)
                            No, Valentine, I'm not leaving my
                            place.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            Well, it's gonna take us days to
                            get back with help.

                                          EARL (V.O.)
                            Doggone it, Viola, it's just plain
                            crazy to stay.

               Then, to Melvin's astonishment, the steady rhythm of his
               bouncing basketball suddenly stops.  The ball just goes flup
               and doesn't bounce back up to him.  He looks down.  No ball!
               Just swirling dust at his feet.


         68    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 68

               Everyone jumps as we once more hear an ear-shattering SHRIEK
               from Melvin.  Earl snarls and heads for the door, Val right
               behind them.

                                          EARL
                            I'm gonna kick his ass!

                                          VAL
                            I'm gonna help you.


         69    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 69

               Val and Earl are well ahead of the other townsfolk as they
               march around to the side of Pham Van's.  But where's Melvin?
               Nothing out here but the oppressive, hot desert silence.
               Then they hear a soft shuddering whimper -- from above.
               There's terrified Melvin, halfway up a telephone pole,
               clinging to it desperately.

               Val and Earl freeze in their tracks and glance at each
               other, realizing instantly what's up.  Without a word they
               leap desperately in opposite directions.  Like a breaching
               whale, a creature roars up through the earth right where they
               were standing, great mouth gaping open, slimy tentacles
               lashing in all directions.

               The townsfolk scatter, some heading for their homes,
               including Viola and Nestor.  Others scramble over each other
               as they pile back into Pham Van's.  The telephone pole
               shudders.  Melvin falls and scampers for the nearest hiding
               place, a corrugated tin storage shed near Pham Van's.


         70    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 70

               Val, Earl, Rhonda, Miguel, and Pham Van rush in.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Jesus Christ!  Man, you gut a gun?!

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Big as a house!  What are we gonna
                            do...?!

                                          RHONDA
                            Quiet!  QUIET!!

               Miguel and Pham shut up.  Then we hear something new -- the
               building itself creaking and groaning like a ship.  The
               liquor bottles behind Pham Van's bar vibrate and clink.  The
               creature is moving beneath the building.  The people freeze
               like mannequins.  Now we can hear its pig-like snorting.
               Pham Van and Miguel react as the awful smell percolates up
               through the floorboards.  Val signals them to keep quiet.
               Finally, the creaking stops.

               Rhonda addresses the group in an intense whisper:

                                          RHONDA
                            Remember...no noise.  No vibration.

               Everyone stands stock still -- and sweats.  But, then, slowly
               we become aware of a faint, yet oddly familiar sound.
               Squeak, squeak, squeak -- Mindy on her pogo stick!  They all
               scramble to the windows.


         71    EXT.  MAIN STREET - DAY                                      71

               There she is, alone in the vacant street, Walkman blaring in
               her ears, merrily bouncing along to a rock 'n' roll beat.


         72    ANGLE - PHAM VAN'S STORE                                     72

               Thoughts of personal safety vanish as the horrified people
               lean way out the doors and windows and shout with one voice:

                                          CROWD
                                   (ad lib)
                            MINDY!
                            Get off your pogo stick!
                            Get in here, girl!
                            Run, Mindy!


         73    ANGLE - MINDY                                                73

               She can't hear them over her Walkman.  A tell-tale puff of
               dust spurts up not fifty feet from her!


         74    ANGLE - PHAM VAN'S STORE                                     74

               Val sees Mindy has only seconds left!  He vaults straight out
               the window and charges toward her!  Right behind him comes
               Earl and Rhonda.


         75    ANGLE - NANCY                                                75

               As she rounds a corner at the opposite end of town.  She
               spots Mindy, then sees Val running.  She starts running.

                                          NANCY
                            Mindy!  Mindy!


         76    ANGLE - MINDY                                                76

               She's lazily bouncing in circles -- squeak, squeak, squeak.
               She goes wide-eyed as she rotates to see Val coming at her
               like a mad bull, arms outstretched.  The asphalt under her
               pogo stick cracks and --

               Val tackles her, both of them tumbling head over heels.  She
               scrambles up, rubbing her skinned elbow and yelling:

                                          MINDY
                            Oww!  Val, you hurt me...!

               Val claps his hand over her mouth.  She goes wide eyed as she
               sees: her pogo stick standing straight up in the cracked
               asphalt!  Then it is sucked down like so much spaghetti!

               Nancy rushes into frame, hugging Mindy.  Val signals her to
               be quiet.  They sit uneasily.  Where's the creature?
               Suddenly the pogo stick erupts out of the earth right in
               their midst!

               Val runs one way, Nancy and Mindy the other, heading up the
               street toward their house.  Val scrambles up onto his pick-up
               truck!  The creature rams the truck, rupturing a tire.  As it
               shakes the truck violently, Val spots Rhonda and Earl, now
               standing uncertainly halfway between him and Pham Van's.

                                          VAL
                            Go back, for chrissake!

               Rhonda and Earl hesitate.

                                          EARL
                            We gotta get him off there.  It'll
                            suck that truck down!

               But Earl now hears something behind them!  Down the street,
               a little wall of cinder blocks framing Viola's driveway
               suddenly topples over.

                                          EARL
                            Oh, Jesus.  Rhonda, another one!


         77    ANGLE - LOW CAMERA - RHONDA AND EARL                         77

               CAMERA charges toward them.  Earl swerves toward Pham Van's,
               but Rhonda is cut off!  She heads toward the next nearest
               haven:


         78    EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     78

               The storage shed where Melvin is hiding.  It sits in a
               vacant, weed-choked lot.  Crashing through the weeds, Rhonda
               has almost reached the shed when she is suddenly brought up
               short and slams face down in a cloud of dust!

               She can't get up!!  Something's got her!  She's caught in an
               old rusted barbed wire fence, lying almost flat, hidden in
               the weeds.  Some strands have come loose and are curled up
               like vicious concertina wire.

               Barely has she taken this in when -- the ground caves in
               under her!  She rolls wildly to one side as hook-tentacles
               snake up, missing her by inches!  She keeps rolling-crawling-
               scrambling -- anything to get away from the awful maw -- but
               gets her legs hopelessly tangled in the barbed wire.  She
               freezes.  The creature feels around where she was.

               She calms herself, pulling gingerly at the wire, working
               tensely to free herself but --

               The creature's mouth slams shut on the fence.  Like a spider
               sensing something caught in its web, the monster knows it's
               on to something.  Its hook-tentacles shoot forward to snare
               three feet of fence, then the creature lunges up and out,
               swallowing that three feet in a big "gulp" and yanking Rhonda
               violently toward it!  She screams, pants ripped, legs slashed
               and bleeding!  GULP!  She's dragged even closer.


         79    EXT.  MAIN STREET - THE PICK-UP - DAY                        79

               The truck shakes and shimmies as Val's creature tries to pull
               it down.  Val sees that Rhonda's in trouble.  He searches
               frantically for a weapon -- and finds one -- a CHAIN SAW!  He
               leaps as far from the truck as he can and hits the ground
               running, yanking furiously on the saw's starter cord.


         80    EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     80

               Rhonda is in a dead panic, thrashing helplessly in the barbed
               wire.  The beast takes another gulp of fence, wrenching her
               within inches of a probing hook-tentacle!  Suddenly we hear a
               nasty ROAR as Val's chain saw swings in, slicing the squirm-
               ing tentacle in half, spraying gore everywhere!  The creature
               unleashes an unearthly shriek, and the other tentacles
               recoil.  The severed one writhes like a beheaded snake.

               Val yanks off Rhonda's boots.

                                          VAL
                            Come on!  Outta your pants!

               She frantically claws at her belt.  But in mere seconds:

                                          RHONDA
                                   (pointing)
                            LOOK OUT!

               Tentacles snake out to regain their grip on the fence.  Val
               grabs the saw and starts slashing wildly, but this time the
               hook-tentacles snag it and wrench it from his grasp.  It
               slams to the ground, motor dying.  The monster readies itself
               for the lunge that will suck Rhonda in.  Val grabs her under
               the arms and pulls.  Rhonda wriggles wildly to get out of her
               wire enmeshed pants.

               The creature lunges!  Rhonda pulls free!  She and Val tumble
               backward.  The creature gets only a mouthful of Rhonda's jeans.

               The next instant the second creature explodes up through the
               ground right next to fallen Val and Rhonda!  They roll
               sideways, come up running, and sprint for Pham Van's along an
               old wooden sidewalk.


         81    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 81

               Earl flings open the front door.  Val and Rhonda race toward
               the porch.  Right on their heels the creature ripples the
               boards like an ocean wave!

                                          EARL
                            Come on!  Come on!  Don't look back!
                            Just run!  Run like screaming fuck!

               They dive through the open door of Pham Van's.  The rippling
               boards zoom on past it.  Earl quickly eases the door shut.


         82    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 82

               Earl turns to breathless Rhonda.

                                          EARL
                                   (whispers)
                            Pardon my French.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


         83    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - LATER                               83

               It's a tense, edgy group.  Every movement made is in slow
               motion, every word is a whisper.   They gaze grimly out the
               windows at the silent, deserted, heat-shimmering main street.

               Val gingerly dabs iodine onto the cuts on Rhonda's legs.
               She doesn't even wince.

                                          VAL
                            You paying attention?  This oughta
                            hurt like hell.

                                          RHONDA
                            It does.

               She smiles at him.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            So, is that one of your usual jobs,
                            saving peoples' lives?

                                          VAL
                                   (embarrassed)
                            First time for me.

               She gazes at him.  He looks away.  Over at the bar, Pham
               holds up a new pair of pants for Rhonda.

                                          RHONDA
                            Oh, thank you.

               Grateful for something to do, Val eases over to get the
               pants.  Rhonda looks after him.  Then she becomes aware of
               someone staring at her.  It's Earl, giving her a big Cheshire
               cat grin that says "What did I tell you?"

               Pham hands the pants to Val.  Then Pham and Miguel reach
               simultaneously for a sods bottle and -- knock it over!  It
               rolls all the way down the bar as a flurry of desperate hands
               try to stop it.  No good.  It rolls off the end and -- CRASH!

               Everyone freezes.  Sure enough the building shudders.  Floor
               boards creak and bend as searching tentacles thump and scrape
               along under the floor.  People close their eyes, not even
               breathing.  Finally the noise subsides.  Everyone relaxes --
               a little.

                                          MIGUEL
                            So what are we gonna do, you know?
                            How long till they go away?

                                          EARL
                                   (shakes his head)
                            They got the patience of Job.  They
                            just sit and goddamn wait til they
                            hear something that sounds like
                            lunch.  We need a plan.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            I've got a plan.  You and Val take
                            your truck, get to the mountains.
                            Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.

                                          VAL
                            Those scumsuckers are my radials,
                            Pham!

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, we can take my truck then.

                                          EARL
                            No good.  You need major four-
                            wheel-drive just to get up that
                            jeep trail.

               They all shut up when they hear Viola's dog yapping in the
               distance.


         84    EXT.  VIOLA'S TRAILER - DAY                                  84

               Up the hill across from Pham Van's, the old trailer looks
               perfectly peaceful.  Except Viola's dog keeps yapping.  Then
               we hear panicked Viola.

                                          VIOLA (V.O.)
                            Quiet!  Quiet you hateful thing...!


         85    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 85

                                          EARL
                            Shut it up!  Shut the little
                            bastard up!

                                          VAL
                            Chuck him out the door!  Like a
                            little hors d'oeuvre.



               INT.  VIOLA'S TRAILER - DAY

               We hear a loud whap!  The dog's bark simply changes to
               piercing yelps.  It would be funny except --

               The trailer suddenly bucks upward, hit from below as though
               by a pile driver!  Again and again the unseen creatures slam
               into the frail structure.

                                          VIOLA (V.O.)
                            Get away!  Get away!  Oh God in
                            heaven, help me!

               The trailer is finally knocked right off its foundation!  It
               tips over and tumbles all the way down the hill!  As the dust
               clears, all is silent.  A huge hole is torn in the trailer's
               floor.  Viola's possessions are scattered everywhere.


         86    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 86

               Everyone stares in shock.

                                          RHONDA
                            Oh my God.

                                          EARL
                            Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid,
                            scum...

                                          VAL
                            Gotta do something.  Gotta get the
                            bastards!

                                          MIGUEL
                                   (hopeless)
                            Man, what the hell can we do to
                            those things?

                                          EARL
                            Well, we're sure as hell not going
                            to sit here being quiet for God
                            knows how long.  Are we?

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Now wait a minute, Earl.  I got
                            enough food here to last us for
                            weeks.  Those damn things can't
                            wait around forever.
                                   (pause)
                            We can do it.  I mean, if we have
                            to, right?

               Everyone turns away from the windows, gingerly sitting down,
               glumly pondering this possibility.  There is a long silence.

               Then suddenly -- ROAR!  The silence is shattered as Pham
               Van's big freezer compressor suddenly comes on.

                                          EARL
                            Jesus!  Shut it off!

               Pham runs to the freezer.  Its on/off switch is buried behind
               stacks of soft-drink cases.  He tears at them like a madman,
               toppling them this way and that.  Earl and Val join him.

               But right behind Pham, the floor BUCKLES UP, a monster's
               snout BURSTING THROUGH and engulfing one of his legs!  The
               creature starts to back down into the jagged hole, dragging
               screaming Pham with it.  Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Miguel grab
               Pham's arms but are no match for the monster.  It shakes and
               spins him like some gigantic dog, effortlessly throwing them
               off, relentlessly pulling Pham down.

               The hole in the floor is too small for Pham to fit through!
               As one leg goes down, the other is bent hideously backward.
               Pham screams and screams as jagged wood tears into him, bones
               snap, ribs crack.  The others grab him again but are utterly
               helpless.  With vicious, powerful jerks the creature yanks
               his man mangled body down.  The last thing we see is his foot,
               now folded back past his head, and he's gone.

               Val is wild with helpless anger.

                                          VAL
                            Son of a bitch!  Son of a bitch!

               The floor bulges up in another place!  A second creature!
               Then a third, coming RIGHT UP UNDER THEM!  Earl sprawls onto
               the bar.  Rhonda springs onto the shelves in the middle of the
               store, knocking groceries everywhere.  Val and Miguel climb up
               shelves which cover the rear wall of the store.

               The whole building shakes and shudders, dust powdering down
               from the ceiling.  Flailing tentacles are everywhere,
               slashing open food packages; clouds of flour fill the air!

               Val spots a hatch in the ceiling.

                                          VAL
                            Everybody!  This way!  The roof!

               Earl leaps from the bar to the rear shelves.  Val and Miguel
               slide sideways till they're beneath the hatch, then use the
               shelves as a ladder, climbing up to the hatch.  Val pounds on
               it frantically.

               In the middle of the store, Rhonda leaps from shelf to shelf,
               trying to get closer to where Val is.  Soon she reaches the
               last one, balancing precariously.  But a creature tips over
               the first one!  The shelves topple like dominoes, crashing
               toward Rhonda.  She is half catapulted, half jumps right
               through an open window, ripping through the screen.

               Val sees what's happened.  With maniacal strength he smashes
               open the hatch and climbs out onto --


         87    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          87

               Val rushes to the edge of the roof shouting:

                                          VAL
                            Rhonda!  Keep moving.  Don't stop!

               He looks down where Rhonda fell.  She's not there.  He hears
               a whistle and is relieved to see:


         88    EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      88

               Rhonda is perched as high as she can get on the water tower
               near Pham Van's.  It's maybe twenty-five feet tall, a simple
               wood frame holding a big galvanized tank.  The wooden legs
               stand on big concrete anchors buried in the ground.


         89    EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     89

               Melvin peers terrified out the shed door, up at the guys on
               Pham Van's roof.

                                          MELVIN
                            Hey!  What's going on, man?!  What
                            the hell you doing up there...?!

                                          MIGUEL
                            Melvin, shut the hell up!

               It's too late.  Wham!  A creature strikes.  The little shed
               shudders, dust puffing from every old seam.  In a split
               second Melvin has climbed to the shed roof.


         90    EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    90

               Nancy and Mindy peer to the window, surprised to see the men
               on Pham Van's roof.


         91    EXT.  PERFECTION - WIDE - DAY                                91

               We hear Val's shouting to the remaining townsfolk.

                                          VAL
                            Nancy!  Nestor!


         92    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          92

                                          VAL
                            Get up on your roof!  On your roof!
                            They can come through the floor!

               The store shakes and shimmies.  We hear the monster's
               thunderous crashing from below.

                                          EARL
                            Can't you shout a little quieter?


         93    EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - DAY                           93

               Burt and Heather's place, about a mile from town, is no-
               nonsense, functional, ugly -- unpainted concrete walls, no
               yard, chain-link fence.  Burt and Heather drive up in their
               big Blazer and park right beside the house.  Hot and tired,
               they climb out, each carrying a heavy, scoped hunting rifle.
               Burt peers toward Perfection through binoculars during:

                                          HEATHER
                            I can't believe it.  No tracks, no
                            sign, no spoor.

                                          BURT
                            Yeah, whatever they are, you'd
                            think after they ate all those
                            sheep they'd have to take a dump
                            someplace...
                                   (reacts to what he sees)
                            What the hell's going on in town?


         94    EXT.  PERFECTION - TELEPHOTO - BURT'S P.O.V. - DAY           94

               The town is a very strange sight.  It's as though an
               invisible flood were in progress, driving people to high
               ground.  We see: Rhonda perched on the water tower; Val, Earl
               and Miguel on the store roof; Nancy and Mindy on their roof;
               Melvin on the storage shed; Nestor on his roof.


         95    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          95

               Val, Earl and Miguel gaze out at the town, trying to concoct
               a plan.   Suddenly Earl perks up.  The men speak softly.

                                          EARL
                            Hey, here's the plan: Nestor's
                            Cadillac.  His tires are nine
                            hundred sixteens.  We sprint for
                            it, grab the spare, put it on our
                            truck with our spare.

               Val stares at him, incredulous.

                                          VAL
                            How the hell long it take you to
                            change a tire?

                                          EARL
                                   (sighs)
                            Just about too damn long.  Bolt
                            pattern's probably wrong anyway.

                                          VAL
                            We need another plan.

               Suddenly, down in the store, Pham Van's CB radio squawks
               loudly.

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Yo, P.V., Burt here.  Come back.

               The building shudders as the creatures again smash through
               the floor inside, looking for the source of the noise.  Val,
               Earl and Miguel scramble to the edge of the roof.


         96    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 96

               The CB radio sits on a shelf near an open window.  Tentacles
               are feeling along the wall just below it.  Val appears out-
               side the window -- upside-down.  He snatches the radio and is
               hauled straight up out of frame.

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Pham?  Anybody copy?


         97    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          97

               Miguel and Earl haul Val by the feet back up onto the roof.
               Val quickly turns down the CB volume.

                                          VAL
                                   (whispers into mic)
                            Burt, now listen.  We found out
                            what's been killing people.  Over?


         98    INT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                98

               A peculiar cross between bomb shelter and blue-collar den,
               Burt's wood-paneled basement has all the comforts for post-
               Apocalypse living.  Burt talks on his CB.

                                          BURT
                            Negative copy on that, Pham, check
                            your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                                   (a little louder)
                            Burt, can you hear me now?

                                          BURT
                            Just barely, Pham.  What are you
                            all doing up on your roofs. What
                            the hell's going on?  Come back.

               A few feet away Heather works at their ammunition reloading
               bench.  She dumps a few hundred empty cartridge cases into a
               case cleaner and switches it on.  It HUMS loudly as it
               vibrates.


         99    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 99

               The groping tentacles swiftly suck back below the floor.
               TILT UP to see out the window some distance away, a couple of
               old trash cans topple over as the creature streaks past
               beneath them, making a bee-line for Burt's.


         100   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          100

               Miguel points frantically at the trash cans.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Oh man, they're going, man!  I
                            think they're going for Burt!

               Val talks a little louder into the mic.  INTERCUT as needed.

                                          VAL
                            Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of
                            your basement!!  Take your radio!
                            You and Heather get up on your
                            roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Val?  What the hell you doing back
                            already?

                                          VAL
                                   (shouts)
                            Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof
                            or someplace!  We found out what's
                            been killing people!  They're under
                            the ground!

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            What's under the ground?  We're not
                            getting up on the roof.  Earth
                            shelter's the best.  Known that
                            since I was a kid.

                                          VAL
                            Listen!  Listen!  We know what they
                            are!  They're big things under the
                            ground!  Much bigger than we
                            thought!  They're coming after you!
                            They're coming right now!


         101   INT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                101

               Hearing that warning, Burt and Heather go into a well-honed
               drill.  They grab their hunting rifles and take positions at
               basement windows.  Burt scans with the binoculars.  He sees
               nothing.  He glances at Heather.  She shrugs.  Nobody coming.

                                          BURT
                                   (into CB)
                            We don't see anything, Val.  Now
                            what the hell are you talking
                            about?  Over.

               Val is frantic.  How do you explain these things?

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            They're coming underground!  They
                            ...they can dig like a son of a
                            bitch...Big monsters under the
                            ground, Burt!  Now get the hell
                            out!  Hurry!

               Burt and Heather exchange looks.  Has Val gone nuts?  Then
               they hear a low RUMBLE, growing louder and louder.  Tools
               hanging over the work bench start to shake; the decorative
               cow skulls on the wall rattle; the overhead lights sway --
               and then -- everything stops.  Dead silence, except for the
               humming of the case cleaner.

               THEN THE WALL MOVES!!  The wood paneling bulges slightly.
               Nails pop out.  The wall is pushed again; the paneling
               cracks.  A cow skull falls.  Burt and Heather level their
               rifles and --

               A huge creature pushes right through the wall!  Fully half
               its bulbous, spiked body writhes into the center of the
               room, great multi-part jaws drooling open, hook-tentacles
               lashing out.


         102   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          102

               The three men can hear the chaos over the CB.

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Jesus Chri...!

               The CB goes dead.  The men stare numbly.  Then, drifting
               across the desert, a soft popping sound.  The men perk up;
               they know what it is -- distant gunfire.


         103   INT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                103

               The gunfire is DEAFENING as Burt and Heather blast away.
               Globby blood spurts from a dozen wounds, and the creature
               pulls back a little.  The couple keeps firing until magazines
               are empty.  The creature lunges forward again.

               PAN with Burt and Heather to REVEAL a wall of the basement we
               haven't seen until now -- a wall covered with guns -- hand
               guns, long guns, riot guns, flare guns, antique guns,
               military guns, elephant guns.

               Heather grabs an HK-91 assault rifle, slams in two magazines,
               bottoms taped end to end, and opens fire!  A hook-tentacle
               snags her boot, yanking her right off her feet.  Burt pumps
               out eight devastating blasts from a twelve-gauge riot gun,
               severing the tentacle.  Heather is on her feet in an instant.
               She expertly flops her double magazine over, loading the full
               one taped upside-down to it, and opens fire again.  Burt
               grabs an AR-15 semi-auto and joins her.  They lay down
               massive fire, virtually disappearing in muzzle flash and
               smoke.  Ejected shell cases clatter and clang all around the
               room.

               The guns are empty.  THE CREATURE IS STILL COMING!  They back
               down the wall, desperately grabbing weapons one after
               another: a lever-action, a magnum handgun, even a flare gun
               which Heather fires right into the creature's mouth.
               Shrieking in pain, the horrid thing thing KEEPS WRIGGLING
               TOWARD THEM!

               Burt and Heather scramble up over a desk to keep something
               between them and it.  Burt smashes open a fancy glass case
               holding a huge four-gauge elephant gun.  He slams in two
               gigantic cartridges nearly an inch in diameter.  He fires.
               The concussion literally shakes the building.  The recoil
               slams Burt back against the wall.

               The monster bullets tear monster holes in the monster.  Great
               gouts of curdles blood spew from it -- Burt hit an artery or
               something.  The beast convulses grotesquely, then collapses,
               deflating like a beached whale.  Burt and Heather stagger
               together and hug each other fervently.  They stare dumbfounded
               at the massive dead horror.  Burt suddenly shouts vehemently:

                                          BURT
                            Broke into the wrong goddamn rec
                            room, didn't you, you BASTARD!


         104   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          104

               Val, Earl and Miguel listen to the silence hoping for some
               sign that their friends are alive.  Suddenly:

                                          BURT (V.O. filter)
                            We killed it!  You got that?  We
                            killed that motherfucker!  Come
                            back!

               It takes a moment for this to sink in, then the men CHEER --
               as quietly as possible.

                                          VAL
                            Uh...roger that, Burt.  Uh,
                            congratulations.  Uh, be advised,
                            however, there are four more,
                            repeat, four more motherfuckers.
                            Come back.


         105   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    105

               Burt and Heather dash out onto the roof, laden with weapons,
               ammo boxes and their CB radio.  They hit the deck, assorted
               rifles and the elephant gun the ready.


         106   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          106

               Val shouts to everyone:

                                          VAL
                            They got one!  They killed one of
                            the sons of bitches!


         107   EXT.  STORAGE SHED - ROOF - DAY                              107

               Melvin pumps his fist in the air.

                                          MELVIN
                            Way to go, dudes!


         108   EXT. THE STERNGOOD HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                        108

               Nancy and Mindy hug each other.


         109   EXT.  NESTOR'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                            109

               Perched on his Spanish tile roof, Nestor pours coffee from
               his thermos and raises his cup in a toast.


         110   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      110

               Rhonda lets out a WHOOP.


         111   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          111

               The men sit, temporarily jubilant.

                                          EARL
                            Well, I guess we don't get to make
                            fun of Burt's lifestyle anymore,
                            huh?

               Val grabs the CB mic.

                                          VAL
                            Burt, any chance you can get the
                            rest of them?


         112   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    112

               Burt and Heather peer from their fortress-like roof.  Burt
               spots earth bulging up near the foundation of his house.

                                          BURT
                                   (into CB)
                            One second, Val.

               He grabs the elephant gun and takes two well-aimed shots --
               two deafening BOOMS which echo off the distant mountains.
               But the bullets bury themselves harmlessly in the dirt.  The
               bulge in the dirt moves calmly away and sinks from view.
               Heather shakes her head.

                                          HEATHER
                            You're not getting any penetration,
                            even with the elephant gun.

                                          BURT
                            Damn!
                                   (into CB)
                            Val, we can't get them.  Never
                            figured on having to shoot through
                            dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop
                            there is.  Come back.


         113   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          113

               The men are disappointed.  That's not what they wanted to
               hear from Burt.  Then Earl perks up and grab the CB mic.

                                          EARL
                                   (into CB)
                            Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget
                            shooting them.  Tell me this: can
                            you get to your truck?

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            No problem.

                                          EARL
                            Good.  You've got the only truck in
                            the valley that can make it up that
                            damn jeep trail.  So, here's the
                            plan: You and Heather go for help.
                            Get to the mountains...

               But Rhonda interrupts, pointing urgently from the water
               tower.

                                          RHONDA
                            Hey, guys!  They're up to
                            something.

               Val, Earl and Miguel rush to the edge of the roof and look
               down where she's pointing --

               A creature is running its tentacles along the building's
               foundation.  It's a strange, more studied movement than we've
               seen before.

                                          VAL
                                   (to Rhonda)
                            What's it doing?

                                          RHONDA
                            Why do you all keep asking me?

               They all stare nervously down as the tentacles feel their way
               along the wall, moving toward a corner of the building.
               Suddenly Miguel spots something down the next wall.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, there's another one coming!

               Another set of tentacles is feeling along the adjacent wall.
               The two creatures meet at the corner, their tentacles touch-
               ing rather like ants' antennae.  They they submerge; tenta-
               cles zipping into the earth.  Nothing happens for a moment.

               Then the corner of the building suddenly heaves up a couple
               of feet.  Clapboard siding splits.  A warped window shatters.
               (We don't see the creatures, only the effect of their shoving
               from below).  The men nearly lose their balance.  Then the
               corner sinks back down.

                                          EARL
                            What the hell was that all about?


         114   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    114

               Nancy and Mindy are still huddled on the roof.  They don't
               make a sound.  They're startled when the house suddenly
               groans and tilts as creatures give it a tentative shove.
               Nancy and Mindy frantically cling to the peak of the smooth
               roof.  The picture windows shatters.  We hear beams POP and
               CRACK, dishes CRASH off shelves.  The front screen door
               swings open.  At last the house slowly settles back down.


         115   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          115

               The men are watching Nancy's house tensely.

                                          MIGUEL
                            They weren't making no noise.
                            Why they bothering them for?

                                          VAL
                                   (mind racing)
                            They're studying the buildings...
                            trying to figure them out.

               Rhonda chimes in from the water tower.

                                          RHONDA
                            Yeah, they're confused.  They can
                            feel our vibrations, but they can't
                            find us.

                                          VAL
                            They're working together, too.

                                          EARL
                            Yeah, like they got a plan...

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Breaker there, Earl.  What do you
                            want us to do?

                                          EARL
                                   (into CB)
                            Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up
                            to something.


         116   EXT.  NESTOR'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                            116

               Straddling the peak of his steeply sloping roof.  Nestor
               grabs on in panic as the creatures lift the place up slowly!
               The roof warps, Spanish tiles shatter and rain down on the
               ground.

               This causes a flurry of activity.  Tentacles snake around
               where the tiles fell.  We hear creatures crash through
               inside, snorting and huffing.  They attack the house in
               earnest, shaking it violently, pushing the front wall out
               till it falls flat.  The roof collapses on that side!  Nestor
               can't hang on!  He slides all the way down, landing across a
               window on the flattened wall.  The next instant he's grabbed
               and pulled through the window, right into the ground.  He
               SCREAMS!

               DOLLY along the ground, heading toward the storage shed where
               Melvin is.  All we can see is dirt, but we can still hear
               Nestor screaming UNDERGROUND!  His screams get more and more
               faint as DOLLY ENDS on:


         117   EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     117

               CLOSE ON horrified Melvin as he rocks back and forth
               autistically.

                                          MELVIN
                            Oh, wow, man!  No way!  No fucking
                            way, man...!


         118   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                             118

               Nancy comforts Mindy.


         119   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      119

               Rhonda turns away.


         120   EXT.  PHAM CAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          120

               Val, Earl and Miguel stare in horror and disbelief.  Miguel
               crosses himself.  They're in worse trouble than they thought.

                                          VAL
                            They knocked his place down on
                            purpose, man.  They're gonna tear
                            this whole town out from under us!


         121   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - DAY                           121

               Burt and Heather's truck is parked in foreground.  The couple
               is up on the roof in background.  Burt prowls along the edge
               of the roof with the elephant gun.  Heather mans the C.B.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            Burt!  Heather!

                                          HEATHER
                            Yeah, Val.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            We're in deep shit over here.
                            Let's change that plan.

               A hump of dirt raises near the base of the house.  Burt jerks
               the rifle to his shoulder and squeezes off a shot.  The hump
               moves away from the house.

                                          HEATHER
                            Knock it off, Burt!

                                          BURT
                            I think I scared it!

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            Forget going for help.  We'll all
                            be dead long before you get back.

               Still moving away, the hump of dirt passes under the side-
               walk, rippling the flagstones gently.

                                          HEATHER
                                   (into CB)
                            We're here, Val.  Just tell us what
                            you need.  Come back.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            They're tearing down the houses
                            here!  We all gotta get outta here
                            together!  Now!

               The hump of dirt passes under Burt and Heather's truck,
               rocking the vehicle slightly.

                                          HEATHER
                            We're with you, Val.  We'll come
                            get everybody.  Just hang on tight.

               The truck's security alarm starts BOOPING!  Burt and Heather
               stare down helplessly as the noisy truck is furiously
               attacked by the frenzied creatures.  Dust flies as metal rips
               and tires shred.


         122   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          122

               Val Earl and Miguel listen in disbelief to the distant truck
               alarm.  It finally sputters and dies.

                                          HEATHER (V.O.)
                            Val, we're going to have to forget
                            about the truck...

                                          VAL
                                   (into CB)
                            Yeah, Heather, we got you.

               They've hit rock-bottom.  They sit in helpless, desperate
               silence.

               Over on the storage shed roof, Melvin is losing it:

                                          MELVIN
                            Hey, you better think of something,
                            man!  You gotta do something!

                                          EARL
                            Who?

                                          MELVIN
                            You and Val, man!

               Miguel nods in agreement.  Val and Earl stare at him,
               incredulous.

                                          VAL
                            What?!!  Since when the hell's
                            every goddamn thing up to us?!

                                          RHONDA
                                   (flatly)
                            You guys do all the odd jobs.

               Val just stares at her.

               Then -- CRASH!  The store shudders, creaks, and groans.  The
               creatures are back.  One corner of the store lifts up, beams
               splintering.  Then another corner lifts up!  The roof tilts
               like the deck of a storm-tossed ship.  From now on the
               monsters shake and ram the building almost constantly.
               Hanging on tight, the men peer over the edge.

                                          EARL
                            We don't have a hell of a lot of
                            time here.

               Meanwhile, Rhonda tries her desperate best to be logical:

                                          RHONDA
                            Look, the situation hasn't changed.
                            We still have to get to solid rock.
                            There must be some way!

                                          VAL
                                   (shouts, angry)
                            Like what?!  There's nothing left
                            that'll make it to the mountains!

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, Val, quiet, man!

                                          VAL
                            We need a helicopter is what we
                            need, or a goddamn tank...

                                          EARL
                            Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we
                            take the Cat?

                                          VAL
                                   (dubious)
                            Jesus.  It's slower than hell.

                                          EARL
                            Yeah, but it weighs better than
                            thirty tons.  No way they could
                            stop it.

                                          MIGUEL
                            We can't all fit on that bulldozer.

               But Val is warming to the idea.

                                          VAL
                            But...we could pull something!  We
                            could, I don't know, drag a car
                            behind it!

                                          EARL
                            A car, huh?  Like a big armored
                            car?  Need something bigger,
                            tougher...our truck maybe...or,
                            hell, that old semi trailer!

                                          VAL
                            Its tires are flat...

                                          EARL
                            Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull
                            anything.

                                          VAL
                            Well...all right!  We just roll on
                            out of here!

                                          EARL
                            We got a plan!

               They squint at the bulldozer -- 'way in the distance.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            'Course, that's one helluva long
                            walk.

               They stare grimly, momentarily stuck for an idea.  Then:

                                          RHONDA
                            Listen, they only respond to
                            vibration, right?  Couldn't we...
                            distract them somehow?

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, good!  Something to keep them
                            busy.  We need a decoy.

                                          EARL
                            Hey, Melvin, you wanna make a buck?

                                          MELVIN
                            Fuck you!

               Miguel grabs Earl and points down at little garden tractor in
               a jumble of Pham Van's equipment and tools near the side of
               the store.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, how about the tractor?  Start
                            him up.  Let him go by itself.  Let
                            those things chase it all over is
                            they like that noise.

                                          EARL
                                   (nodding)
                            Not bad.
                                   (to Val)
                            What do you think?

               The store takes a heavy hit.  The front porch collapses with
               a terrific crash.

                                          VAL
                            I think the ground's getting
                            closer.  I think we do it.  We're
                            gonna save our asses here!

                                          RHONDA
                            Wait!  How are you going to know
                            they're all following it?

                                          VAL
                            Good point.

                                          EARL
                            We got two right here.

               Val scrambles to the highest point of the sagging roof and
               shouts to Nancy.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Nancy, we gotta find all four of
                            them.  How many you got over there?


         123   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                             123

               The house shuddering and shaking.

                                          NANCY
                            There's one.  I think one.


         124   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          124

               Earl grabs the CB mic.

                                          EARL
                                   (into CB)
                            Burt, Heather, we got a little sort
                            of a plan going here, maybe.  Can
                            you tell if you've still got any of
                            those things out at your place?
                            Come back.


         125   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    125

                                          BURT
                                   (into CB)
                            Yeah, still got one poking around.

                                          EARL (V.O.)
                            That's four.  Let us know if it
                            starts moving, Burt.

                                          BURT
                            Roger that.


         126   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - TRACTOR - DAY                       126

               Val and Earl have lowered Miguel down to a window sill right
               above the garden tractor.  He has used his kerchief to tie
               the steering wheel to keep the front wheels straight.  He
               jams the throttle open and signals thumbs-up to Val and Earl
               above.


         127   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          127

               Val and Earl stride purposefully toward the opposite end of
               the roof.  Realizing they have the same idea, each one tries
               to edge ahead of the other.

                                          VAL
                            I'm making the run to the Cat.

                                          EARL
                            Like hell you are.

                                          VAL
                            Get real.  I'm faster than you.

                                          EARL
                            I'm best at driving the Cat.

                                          VAL
                            Only if something happens to me.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Look, you'd better listen.  I'm
                            older and wiser.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, well, you're half right.

               Earl raises a fist: The Challenge.  They do scissors-rock-
               paper.  One, two, three.  Val loses.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Damn.  Guess I have to do it.

                                          EARL
                                   (shakes his head)
                            I won.  I pick who does it.

               Val glares at him.  Earl's obviously determined.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Ready when you are, Miguel!

               Earl positions himself, nervous as hell, ready to leap at the
               right moment.


         128   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - TRACTOR - DAY                       128

               Miguel leans out precariously and pulls the tractor's starter
               cord.  Nothing.  On the second try it starts.  He slams it
               into gear and sends it out toward open desert.  The store
               shakes under Miguel, almost knocking him off the window sill,
               as two humps of dirt pursue the noisy tractor.

                                          MIGUEL
                            There they go!  They're chasing it!


         129   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    129

               A "spout" of dust erupts near the foundation as the creature
               beneath zooms away toward the new sound.  Nancy whispers:

                                          NANCY
                            It's going...
                                   (then shouts)
                            There goes this one!  It's going!


         130   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          130

               The CB radio squawks:

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Hey, this guy just took off like a
                            shot.  What'd you people do?

               Earl is poised to leap.  Val steps up and slaps him on the
               back.

                                          VAL
                            Watch your ass, shithead.

                                          EARL
                            Don't worry about me, jerkoff.

               Val instantly elbows Earl hard in the stomach.  As Earl
               doubles over, Val springs off the edge of the roof.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            You goddamn suicidal son of a
                            bitch!

               We see Val running for all he's worth -- and there's the
               bulldozer at the edge of town a long way away.


         131   EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           131

               LOW CAMERA pursues the garden tractor as it bounces along.


         132   EXT.  PERFECTION - DAY                                       132

               Val charges across the vast open area that separates him from
               the bulldozer.  We can hear the tractor droning along in the
               background.


         133   EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           133

               The tractor suddenly takes a bad bounce and flips over!  The
               engine dies.  Total silence.


         134   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          134

               Earl, Rhonda and Miguel have seen the tractor take a header.

                                          EARL
                            Oh my God!


         135   EXT.  EDGE OF TOWN - VAL - DAY                               135

               Val's crunching boots seem incredibly loud in the sudden
               silence.  He hesitates, glancing over his shoulder.  He's
               totally out in the open, halfway to the bulldozer.  Should he
               run back or go forward?  He decides to go for the bulldozer.


         136   EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           136

               All four creatures are now heading for Val.  INTERCUT four
               slightly different LOW CAMERA ANGLES speeding over the
               ground, racing after him.  He strains to the limit, breaths
               coming in painful rasps -- but the creatures are closing in
               on him with chilling ease.


         137   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          137

               Everyone watches in horror.

                                          EARL
                            He'll never make it!  They're gonna
                            get him!

                                          RHONDA
                                   (yells)
                            VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T
                            MOVE!


         138   EXT.  EDGE OF TOWN - VAL - DAY                               138

               Val hears her and stops dead.  So do the creatures.  Maybe
               twenty feet away, their giant snouts poke up out of the
               ground: one, two, three, four.  Val stands trembling.  The
               creatures softly shuffle back and forth, searching blindly
               for him, hook-tentacles feeling everywhere.  One tentacle
               sweeps toward Val's boot.  He manages to lift his foot just
               in time, letting the tentacle pass beneath it.  He balances
               precariously like a flamingo.


         139   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          139

                                          EARL
                            It worked!  They can't find him!
                                   (pause)
                            Okay, okay...uh...we gotta make
                            some noise...a lot of noise!  HEY,
                            YOU SORRY SONS OF BITCHES, COME AND
                            GET ME...!!!!

               He starts jumping noisily up and down.  Miguel joins in,
               cursing the monsters in Spanish.



         139A  EXT.   WATER TOWER - DAY                                     139A

               Rhonda kicks and shouts.  But it's obvious they need some-
               thing louder.  She spots the aging outlet pipe coming from
               the water tank.  Bracing herself, she kicks at it with both
               feet.  It finally gives way at a rusted joint.  A torrent of
               water blasts out, thundering into the dirt.


         140   EXT.  EDGE OF TOWN - VAL - DAY                               140

               All the creatures wheel about in the dirt and zoom off toward
               town.  Val breathes a big sigh of relief and sprints to the
               bulldozer.


         141   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          141

                                          EARL
                            That did it, girl!  Goddamn good
                            thinking!


         142   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      142

               A mass of tentacles and snouts swirl through the big puddle
               where the water if falling.  The creatures' breathing throws
               up spouts of muddy water.  Rhonda looks down nervously.  Earl
               calls reassuringly from Pham Van's:

                                          EARL
                            Don't worry.  No way they can lift
                            that tower.  I mean it's really
                            heavy.


         143   INSERT - CONCRETE FOOTING                                    143

               The dirt begins to cave in around the tower's footing.  The
               creatures are digging the dirt away!


         144   BACK TO SCENE                                                144

               The water tower tilts ever so slightly, creaking and
               groaning!  Rhonda frantically grabs a handhold.

                                          RHONDA
                            They're not trying to lift it!


         145   EXT.  BULLDOZER - DAY                                        145

               Val lands in the driver's seat and turns the engine over --
               it doesn't start!

                                          VAL
                            NO FUCKING WAY!

               The old machine starts.  Val slams it into reverse and backs
               up toward the semi trailer.


         146   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      146

               The water tower is starting to tilt seriously.  Water spills
               over the top edge of the tank, drenching Rhonda.


         147   EXT.  BULLDOZER - DAY                                        147

               Val has used heavy chains on the back of the bulldozer to
               jerry-rig a hitch to the semi trailer.   Now he scrambles
               back into the driver's seat.  He guns the engine, wrenching
               the old semi trailer from years of dried mud and tumbleweeds.
               Ancient tires disintegrate.  Rusted wheels screech and
               complain -- but it moves.  Val lets out a whoop and heads
               full-tilt for town.  He's suddenly shocked as he sees:


         148   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      148

               Rhonda's in big trouble.  She scrambles to the high side of
               the tower platform.  The tower's going to tip over at any
               moment!  It's roof slides off and crashes into the street!

               On Pham Van's, Miguel and Earl are tearing apart the swamp
               cooler, throwing pieces of it off the roof, trying to
               distract the creatures, but they can't compete with the noise
               from the water.

               In BG the bulldozer rumbles toward the tower at top speed --
               an excruciatingly slow eight miles per hour.

               The tremendously heavy water tank suddenly tears loose,
               sliding off its platform, nearly carrying Rhonda with it.
               She ends up hanging from a cross beam as the water tank
               splatters like an enormous egg below, sending a small tidal
               wave down the street.

               The remains of the tower tilt crazily nearly forty-five
               degrees.  The bulldozer grinds closer and closer.  Rhonda
               tries to climb up, but the jostling and shuddering of the
               tower keeps her dangling precariously.  Suddenly she falls!

               And lands in the dirt.  The creatures zero in on her!  She
               turns wildly and leaps for the blade of the approaching
               bulldozer.  The blade is only inches off the ground but Val
               swiftly raises it, lifting Rhonda high into the air just
               above the grasping tentacles!


         149   EXT.  PERFECTION - MAIN STREET - DAY                         149

               As Rhonda climbs down into the cab, Val heads the bulldozer
               over to Pham Van's and stops.  Almost as soon as he does,
               creatures attack, a frenzy of tentacles grabbing at all sides
               of the massive earth-moving machine, slithering into the
               treads.  Val and Rhonda watch this nervously as Earl and
               Miguel quickly clamber from the roof down into the protective
               steel belly of the semi trailer.

               Val mentally crosses his fingers and sends the bulldozer
               roaring forward.  It effortlessly tears loose from the
               tentacles, grinding one to pulp in its treads.  The creature
               shrieks in pain.  The humans cheer!  At last they've got the
               upper hand!


         150   EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     150

               Melvin dances merrily, and noisily, on the metal rooftop.

                                          MELVIN
                            Way to go!  Dumb fucking worms!
                            Now haul ass over here, man!  Me
                            next!  Get me off of here...!

               The flimsy shed seems almost to explode as a furious creature
               roars up inside.  The walls buckle out.  The whole structure
               sags.  Melvin scrambles to peak of the roof.

                                          MELVIN
                            Oh shit!  Oh, God!  Help!

               As the unseen creature thrashes around inside the shed, the
               walls topple outward and the roof drops to the ground like a
               pancake.  Melvin has lost all self control and just keeps
               screaming.  Val pulls along side, jumps down onto the tread,
               and reaches out to Melvin.  But just as they join hands, the
               creature hits the roof from beneath, dragging it several
               feet.  Val is yanked off the bulldozer and lands with Nelvin
               on the roof!

               The creature slams into the roof repeatedly, but the
               corrugated metal is both light and resilient.  It bends, but
               the frustrated monster can't get enough "bite" to tear
               through it.  Val and Melvin straddle the peak of the roof,
               trying desperately to hang on as it heaves up, buckling like a
               bronco.

               Earl scrambles into the bulldozer driver's seat and heads
               after them at full throttle, the big diesel roaring.

               Melvin and Val prepare to jump onto the bulldozer, but just
               before it reaches them the roof suddenly starts to slide like
               some mad flying carpet, carried from beneath by a creature!
               Val hangs on like a rodeo rider, struggling to keep fear-
               crazed Melvin from tumbling off.


         151   EXT.  DIRT DITCH - DAY                                       151

               The roof zigs and zags, spins and twists.  Melvin and Val
               won't be shaken loose.  Earl does his best to head it off,
               but it's hard to predict which way the roof will scoot next.

               The rood careens alongside the edge of a dirt-walled drainage
               ditch, then suddenly skitters sideways and plunges over the
               edge.  Melvin and Val tumble to the bottom.  As they jump to
               their feet:

                                          VAL
                            We got about three seconds!

               Val sees, almost right above them, an exposed pipe which
               spans the ditch.  He shoves Melvin toward it.  They leap up
               and grab the pipe, pulling their legs up as high as they can.
               An instant later, the creature blasts through one wall of the
               ditch, roars past beneath them and burrows into the opposite
               wall!

               Earl brings the bulldozer to a thundering stop next to them.

                                          EARL
                            Well, come on!


         152   EXT.   NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   152

               Nancy and Mindy huddle together on their roof.  The upraised
               scoop blade of the bulldozer comes INTO SHOT with Val riding
               it.  He helps them step across into it.


         153   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    153

               Burt is using a hacksaw to cut lengths from a heavy vertical
               pipe to which his TV antenna was anchored.  Heather works
               with the sections Burt has already cut off.  She is filling
               them with gunpowder from reloading cannisters and hammering
               the ends shut -- they're making bombs.

               Then they hear rumbling.  What is it, more creatures?  They're
               surprised by the odd sight of the strange contraption
               approaching.

                                          BURT
                                   (impressed)
                            God damn!  Armored transport!

               Val climbs up on the bulldozer roll cage so he's about even
               with Heather and Burt.  A creature occasionally slams into the
               underside of the bulldozer of the semi trailer, rocking them
               slightly, throwing up clouds of dust.

                                          VAL
                            Let's go you two.  We're headed for
                            the mountains.

                                          BURT
                            In a minute.

               He grabs a coil of blackpowder cannon fuse.  He cuts off a
               length and stuffs it in the end of one of the pipe bombs
               during:

                                          VAL
                            Come on, Burt, we can't hold still
                            long.  They're damn smart and
                            getting smarter by the minute.

               Burt hefts the finished bomb.

                                          BURT
                            That's fine.  We've got some new
                            things to teach them.

                                          VAL
                            Damn it!  They'll sink this rig
                            just like a boat!

               Just then the bulldozer starts to tilt sideways, creatures
               digging dirt away beneath it.  Earl guns it forward out of
               the depression they're making.

                                          EARL
                            See that?  They're doing it now!
                            They try it every time we hold
                            still.

               Burt and Heather are impressed.  They rush around the
               rooftop, gathering food, ammo, guns, the finished bombs,
               handing them to impatient Val who hands them down to people
               in the semi trailer during:

                                          VAL
                            Jesus Christ, we're only going nine
                            miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!

                                          BURT
                            Yeah, well those things are gonna
                            be on our ass every foot of the
                            way, right?

               He holds up to rifles to Heather, the HK91 assault rifle and
               another elephant gun.

                                          BURT
                            What do you think?  Max firepower
                            or...?

                                          HEATHER
                            I'd go for penetration.  The 458
                            shooting solids -- less ammo to
                            carry anyway.

               Burt nods.  Everyone on the bulldozer and semi trailer shouts:

                                          TOWNSFOLK
                                   (adlib)
                            Come on!
                            Who cares!
                            Forget it!
                            Let's go!

               Dust flies up.  The bulldozer tilts.  Earl guns it forward
               again.  Heather and Burt grab a few more things and leap down
               into the semi trailer.

                                          MELVIN
                            Give me a gun!  I'll take one!

                                          BURT
                            I wouldn't give you a gun if it was
                            World War Three.

               Earl pilots the strange looking contraption out into the
               desert.  Burt and Heather watch their fortress-home recede.

                                          BURT

                            Bomb shelter...
                                   (looks heavenward)
                            ...underground goddamn monsters?!

               Heather puts a consoling arm around him.


         154   EXT.  JEEP TRAIL - DAY                                       154

               The bulldozer easily lumbers along the really rough road we
               saw Val and Earl's truck struggle over the other morning.

               As they come closer we see Burt and Heather riding "shotgun,"
               he sitting out in the bulldozer's scoop, she on the rear of
               the semi trailer, elephant guns at the ready.  Val, Earl and
               Rhonda are in the cab.


         155   EXT.  CLIFFS - DAY                                           155

               It's late afternoon, sun casting dramatic shadows across the
               beautiful desert.  We are WIDE on the bizarre vehicle,
               resolutely grinding along not far from the cliffs, nearing
               the mountains ahead.


         156   EXT.  DESERT - BULLDOZER - DAY                               156

               As they scan the desert, the people are feeling like they may
               get out of this after all.  Earl calls back to the people in
               the semi trailer.

                                          EARL
                            Any sign of'em?

                                          MIGUEL
                            Maybe they just gave up, you know.

                                          MELVIN
                            Yeah, the bulldozer's too much for
                            them, man.

               As they top a gentle rise, Burt excitedly points ahead.

                                          BURT
                            There we go, solid rock!

               Everyone cheers.  But then Heather points up ahead to one
               side.

                                          HEATHER
                            What's that?


         157   P.O.V. - THE GROUP - DUST CLOUD - DAY                        157

               Perhaps two hundred yards from them, a huge cloud of dust
               wells up from behind big boulders.


         158   BACK TO SCENE                                                158

               Everyone stares uneasily at the billowing cloud.

                                          NANCY
                            Is it them?

                                          MIGUEL
                            What else could it be?

                                          MINDY
                            What're they doing?

                                          MELVIN
                            Maybe they're taking a dump.

                                          RHONDA
                            We're not going over there, right?

                                          EARL
                            No.  We go straight.

                                          VAL
                            Damn it.  What the hell are they
                            doing?  They're up to something.

                                          EARL
                            I don't care what they're doing as
                            long as they're doing it way over
                            there.

               Earl shoves the throttle all the way.  The engine screams.


         159   EXT.  DESERT - DUSTCLOUD - DAY                               159

               We MOVE IN through the cloud of dust.  Dirt is flying by the
               ton out of en eight foot diameter hole in the ground.  A huge
               mound of the tunneled-out dirt is already piled high.  The
               creatures are digging a tunnel -- but why?


         160   EXT.  DESERT - BULLDOZER - DAY                               160

               We watch the bulldozer rumbling along.  It seems unstop-
               able.  The mountains and safety are barely a mile away --

               when the EARTH CAVES IN!!  THE BULLDOZER PLUNGES NOSE FIRST
               INTO AN UNSEEN PIT DUG JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE!

               The machine ends up half-buried at a steep angle.  The semi
               trailer is right on the edge of the pit.  Everyone is shaken,
               bruised, bloodied.  Val, Earl and Rhonda look frantically for
               Burt, who was riding out front in the scoop.  They're
               relieved to see him clawing his way out of pit.  Val hauls
               him up and all four of them now leap into the semi trailer.
               As they come to rest, Val slowly realizes what's happened.

                                          VAL
                            They...they dug a trap!  I can't
                            believe this!

               The idling bulldozer engine coughs and dies.  There is a
               moment's crushing silence.

               Then the dreaded digging begins.  Dust boils up around the
               semi trailer -- creatures digging from below!  The semi
               trailer shakes and shudders, slowly sinking.  The people
               huddle together in sheer panic.  Val and Earl grab the
               nearest of Burt and Heather's guns and fire wildly, hope-
               lessly, down at the dirt.  Ricochets whine into the distance.

               Burt grimly digs an overloaded knapsack for one of his
               pipe bombs.  He leaps up between Val and Earl and lights the
               fuse, looking for a target.

                                          BURT
                            Hungry?!  Eat this!!

               He tosses the bomb at some churning earth and dives back into
               the semi trailer.

                                          BURT (cont'd)
                            Keep your heads down!

               KABOOM!  The explosion throws up a big plume of dust and
               rocks.  We hear a new, very strange sound of pain from the
               creatures.  The semi trailer instantly stops shaking.  The
               creatures have stopped digging.  All is quiet.

               The people peer up over the edge of the semi trailer, looking
               all around.  Then:

                                          RHONDA
                            There they are!


         161   P.O.V. THE GROUP - DISTANT CREATURES                         161

               Numerous spurts of dust mark their paths as they race madly
               away, fanning out from the semi trailer.


         162   BACK TO SCENE                                                162

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, Burt...did you get one...!

                                          RHONDA
                            No, there's still four of them.
                            See...there's like four different
                            dust trails.

                                          VAL
                            Sure got their attention, though.
                            Nice going, Burt.
                                   (to Earl)
                            Earl, what about the Cat?

               Earl's already staring down at the bulldozer.

                                          EARL
                            No way.  It's down for the count.

               Val looks around.


         163   P.O.V.  VAL - ROCK OUTCROP                                   163

               Toward the cliffs he sees a big rock outcrop.


         164   BACK TO SCENE                                                164

               Rhonda points in the opposite direction from where Val is
               looking.

                                          RHONDA
                            Here they come!  They're coming
                            back!

               Heather unexpectedly fire two deafening blasts from her
               elephant gun at the approaching creatures, then shakes her
               head, frustrated.  They're still coming.

                                          VAL
                            Come on, everybody!  We gotta run
                            for those rocks over there!

                                          EARL
                            Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.

                                          MELVIN
                            Yeah, man!  They'll get us!

                                          VAL
                            There sure as hell get us if we
                            stay here!

                                          RHONDA
                            Wait, wait, listen.  Burt do you
                            have any more of those things?

                                          BURT
                            The bombs?  Damn right I do.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, what is you throw one that
                            way, the way we want to go...
                                   (points toward rocks)
                            Then, when the explosion happens...
                            if it drives them away again...we
                            all run like goddamn bastards!
                                   (to Earl)
                            Pardon my French.

               Wham!  With a jolt the semi trailer begins shaking and
               shuddering again -- sinking, smiling.

                                          MELVIN
                            What if it doesn't scare them?
                            What if they don't run?

                                          RHONDA
                            I don't think it does scare them!
                            It hurts them!  They're  so
                            sensitive to sound, they have to
                            run!  It hurts too much!

               Glances all around.

                                          BURT
                            She's got my vote.

                                          VAL
                            Right.  We're gonna run.  Get
                            ready.

               Val squats in front of tear-streaked Mindy.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Mindy, you understand what we're
                            going to do?
                                   (off her nod)
                            And don't worry, they can't get us
                            once we're on those rocks.

                                          MELVIN
                            I don't know, man.  They're too
                            fast!  You can't outrun them, no
                            way!

               As Burt readies another bomb, he pauses to hand bug-eyed
               Melvin a huge Ruger Super Redhawk 44 magnum handgun.

                                          BURT
                            Here, kid.  This'll make'em think
                            twice.

               Melvin's eyes bug out further.  Burt lights his bomb.

                                          BURT (cont'd)
                            Heads down!!

               He hurls the bomb.  Wait.  Wait.  WHOOOM!  Again we hear the
               creatures' unearthly shriek of pain.  Rhonda's on her feet
               before the rocks stop falling.  She spots the creatures.

                                          RHONDA
                            It worked!  There they go!

                                          VAL
                            LET'S DO IT!

               Earl lets out a war wild WHOOP.  It's infectious.  CRANE UP
               with them as everyone piles out of the semi trailer like
               soldiers out of a trench -- they charge across no-man's-land.

               Melvin runs like a demon.  He tries to shoot at the first
               thing he sees but the gun just clicks over and over -- empty.

                                          MELVIN
                            Burt, you bastard!

               Enraged, he doubles his speed, trying to overtake Burt.

               Mindy can't keep up.  Nancy tries to pull her along.  Val and
               Earl swoop in, grab Mindy under either arm, and carry her
               between them.


         165   ANGLE - THE CREATURES                                        165

               The ground heaves violently as the retreating monsters
               angrily wheel about and charge back after the humans.


         166   EXT.  DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - DAY                            166

               Big slabs jutting this way and that -- a rock iceberg in a
               sand ocean.  The people scramble onto it amid whoops of joy
               and relief.  Melvin charges up to Burt:

                                          MELVIN
                            You asshole!  There's no bullets in
                            this gun!

                                          BURT
                            Got you moving, didn't it?

               Burt's line gets a laugh from people, but then tentacles
               burst up on all sides of the rock, probing, feeling.  The
               effect is instantly sobering.  Burt swiftly grabs out his
               remaining bombs -- six of them -- and holds one ready.  But
               they're in no immediate danger.

                                          EARL
                            So...now what?

                                          RHONDA
                            Could we make it to the mountains?

                                          VAL
                                   (gestures to Burt's bombs)
                            No way.  We'd need fifty of those
                            things.

               The hopelessness of the situation suddenly hits Val, Earl,
               and Rhonda.  After a moment:

                                          EARL
                            Well...that's it.  We're not
                            getting off this rock...

                                          VAL
                            Not going to pole vault anywhere.
                            That's for sure.

                                          HEATHER
                            What's the matter with you?  What
                            are you talking about?!

                                          RHONDA
                            They'll just wait out there till
                            we're dead.  That's what they do.

               As this sinks in, Burt loses his cool, igniting an argument.

                                          BURT
                            What?  Well, for chrissake, we
                            could have made a stand at our
                            place!  We had food, water...

                                          EARL
                            You can't fight'em that way...

                                          BURT
                            You two jackasses hauled us way the
                            hell out here...!?

                                          VAL
                            BACK OFF, BURT...!

                                          BURT
                            Well, who put you two in charge?

                                          NANCY
                                   (shouts)
                            Burt!  Those animals would have
                            killed you!

               Everyone stares in surprise at normally quiet Nancy.

                                          NANCY (cont'd)
                                   (softly)
                            You haven't seen what they can do.

                                          VAL
                                   (calmer)
                            They'd have dug your place out from
                            under you in half an hour!

               There's a long, grim silence.  Everyone sits glumly.
               Finally, Burt picks up a bomb and contemplates it:

                                          BURT
                                   (losing it)
                            If it comes to starvation, I know
                            what I'm doing.  Take one of these.
                            Walk right out there with the fuse
                            lit.  Stuff it down my pants and
                            let 'em take me down.  BOOOOM!

               Heather puts a soothing hand on his shoulder.

                                          HEATHER
                            Jesus, honey!

               But now Earl brightens a little.

                                          EARL
                            You know, that's not a bad idea!

               The others react.  Is Earl nuts?

                                          EARL
                            No, I mean, it gives me an idea...
                            going fishing like...


         167   EXT.  DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - LATER                          167

               In the open desert, a rock lands.  Then another.  Val and
               Rhonda are throwing them from the rock outcrop.

               Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Burt have moved away from the main
               group to another section of the rock outcrop where
               intervening boulders will protect everyone from an explosion.

               Earl has tied a bomb to some nylon rope form one of Burt's
               knapsacks.  Burt places the other bombs safely out of the way
               behind a ledge.  Meanwhile, Val and Rhonda keep throwing
               rocks.  Soon, the ground shifts.

                                          VAL
                            There!  Right straight out in front
                            of you.

               Burt has his coil of fuse.

                                          BURT
                            How much you think?

                                          EARL
                            I don't know...  They're pretty
                            quick...fifteen seconds?

               Burt nods, expertly eyeballing a fifteen second length and
               snipping it off.  As he stuffs it into the bomb:

                                          EARL
                            What the hell is that, anyway?

                                          BURT
                            Cannon fuse.

                                          EARL
                            What do you use it for?

                                          BURT
                                   (matter of fact)
                            My cannon.

               The bomb is ready -- it's moment of truth.  Earl digs in his
               pocket for the lighter -- but Val has it.  Val nervously
               leans over to light the fuse, but then frowns as he sees how
               Earl is holding the rope.

                                          VAL
                            Come on, you're not going to do
                            your lasso thing...?

                                          EARL
                            Hey, just 'cause you're no good
                            with a rope...

               Val shakes his head and lights the fuse.  Earl whirls the
               bomb on the end of its rope like a lasso, and lets it fly out
               as far as he can.  Then he starts pulling it back in along
               the ground like a fishing lure.  Rhonda stares at her watch
               as they all sink down behind the protective boulder.

                                          RHONDA
                            Come on...come on...

                                          BURT
                            Take it...take the bait...

               Suddenly a snout subtly surfaces and gulps down the bomb.  A
               tense two seconds later -- KABOOOM!  Bullseye!  It's a
               volcano of gory creature parts.  They splatter all over!  The
               remaining creatures shriek and race away again.  The people
               cheer wildly.

                                                                    CUT TO:


         168   EXT.  DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - LATER                          168

               Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Burt prepare to try again.  This time
               Val has the rope and a new bomb.  Rhonda stands by him, ready
               with the lighter.  Earl lobs rocks out into the desert.

                                          EARL
                            Where the hell are they?  Hope they
                            didn't wise up.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (pointing)
                            Nope, there!  That's one.

               Rhonda shakily lights the fuse.  Val heaves the bomb out and
               starts trolling.  The creature swallows it.  Everyone drops
               down behind the boulder, Val impulsively grabbing a second
               bomb. They tense with anticipatory glee -- but the creature
               suddenly spits its bomb back out!  It sails back right over
               their heads.  It strikes the rocks above them, skittering
               down a crevice and landing in -- BURT'S PILE OF BOMBS!

               Val, Earl, and Rhonda scatter.  Burt dives backward over a
               rock ledge.

               BABABAMMM!!  All the bombs explode, throwing rocks every-
               where.  The creatures streak away.  Val, Earl and Rhonda
               sprawl into the dirt, half stunned.

               When the panic is over, Val and Earl realize where they are --
               fifty yards out in open desert!  So is Rhonda, off at an
               angle from them!  Only Burt is safe on the rock outcrop.

               And the creatures are coming back fast!

               The stranded trio starts back for the outcrop, but the
               creatures burst up ahead of them -- one blocking Rhonda's
               path, the other two cutting Val and Earl off!  The creatures
               roar toward their easy prey!

               Val and Earl freeze.  The ground bulges as the creatures
               "skid" to a halt not ten feet from them.  Rhonda stands stock
               still some fifty feet away, eyeing her own creature.

               Over on the outcrop with the main group of people Heather
               sizes up the situation.

                                          HEATHER
                            Make noise.  Everybody!  COME ON!

               Everyone starts hopping up and down, yelling, screaming, and
               clapping.  Burt even runs a few feet out from the rocks,
               firing a pistol into the dirt.

                                          BURT
                            COME ON, YOU SLIMEBAGS!  OVER HERE!
                            FRESH MEAT...!

               The crowd keeps up the ruckus.  The creatures are distracted
               by the noise, but this time they don't automatically go after
               it.  Their big snouts turn uncertainly this way and that.
               But they just stay where they are.  Their hook-tentacles
               slide out, feeling all around.  Earl whispers:

                                          EARL
                            They're not falling for it!

               Heather takes careful aim with her elephant gun.

                                          HEATHER
                            I'll make'em pay attention
                            goddamnit...

               But before she can fire, the creatures mysteriously sink from
               view.  Val, Rhonda, and Earl remain frozen.  What the hell is
               going on?  Nothing happens -- then --

               A HUGE HUMP OF EARTH suddenly wells up near Rhonda.  It sinks
               back down as fast as it appeared.  It's like the creature
               suddenly lifted its whole body almost to the surface then
               submerged again.  Another hump rises and falls right near Val
               and Earl.  There's a pause as the men whisper:

                                          VAL
                            They're...they're trying to make us
                            move!

                                          EARL
                            Or just knock us over.  Look, use
                            the bomb!

                                          VAL
                            It's out last one.  We can't kill
                            them all.

               The creatures try another random "barrage" of humps, some
               coming perilously close.  They know they'll eventually topple
               their prey.  One comes so close to Val and Earl that pebbles
               roll down its sides into their boots!

                                          EARL
                            Use the fucking bomb!

                                          VAL
                            So, we get back on that rock and in
                            three days we're dead anyway.

                                          EARL
                                   (slowly; terrified)
                            I want to live for the three days.

               More humps rise and fall.  Val gives in.  He signals Rhonda,
               gesturing with the bomb.  She understands.  He'll set it off,
               driving away the creatures, and they'll all run back to the
               outcrop.

               Val digs for the lighter.  Doesn't have it.  Earl digs for
               it, too.  But he doesn't have it either!  They go dead pale.
               How can that be?  They look across fifty feet of deadly open
               ground -- trembling Rhonda holds up the lighter!

               Over on the outcrop, Burt shouts:

                                          BURT
                            What's wrong?  Use the bomb, for
                            Godsake!

               Val signals to Rhonda to throw the lighter.  She nods.  But
               just before she does, A HUMP STARTS RISING DIRECTLY UNDER
               HER!  She fights to keep her balance -- struggling to keep
               from taking that single step which will instantly tell the
               creatures where she is.

               But there's no hope.  The hump jerks higher.  Her boots slip
               down the gravelly side!  Instantly the creature twists toward
               her, its hungry mouth erupting out of the dirt.  She screams
               and dashes for Val and Earl.  They run to meet her.  The
               other creatures surface.  The trio is cut off from the rock
               outcrop!

               Val and Earl link up with Rhonda and they all run madly while
               Rhonda tries to light Val's bomb fuse.  But suddenly Val
               yanks the bomb away.

                                          VAL
                            No wait!  This way!

               He veers off in a new direction.  Startled Earl and Rhonda
               have no choice but to follow.  As they desperately try to
               catch up to Val:

                                          EARL
                                   (gasping)
                            What the hell are you doing?!!

                                          VAL
                            I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!

               Earl looks up ahead.  They're headed right for --


         169   EXT.  THE CLIFFS - DAY                                       169

               The massive cliffs.  Earl's eyes bug out.  In seconds they'll
               be right at the brink with nowhere to run.

                                          EARL
                            This better be one great plan!

               As they skid to a stop at the very brink, Val breaks off the
               bomb fuse, leaving only one inch of it.  He whirls to check
               the progress of the advancing creatures.

                                          VAL
                            Get ready!

               He holds the bomb out to Rhonda.  She instantly tries to
               light it.  He grabs her wrist so hard it hurts.

                                          EARL
                            Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!

                                          VAL
                            Not yet, not yet...

               The charging creatures are almost underfoot.  Finally Val
               pulls Rhonda's hand over to light the fuse.  Instantly he
               hurls the bomb as far as he can, behind the creatures.

                                          EARL
                            Too far!  You threw it behind them!

               The ground opens under their feet!  Tentacles snake toward
               Val and Earl.  A horrid mouth clamps onto Rhonda's boot.  She
               screams as it starts to pull her down.

               WHOOOM!!  The bomb explodes!  The creatures shriek in pain,
               instantly releasing their prey and racing away from the
               painful shock wave in the only direction they can --


         170   EXT.  CLIFFS - WIDE LOW ANGLE - DAY                          170

               Right out through the face of the cliffs!!  The huge,
               shrieking creatures seem to hang in mid-air for a moment,
               their grotesque bodies undulating in pain.  And then they
               fall!  And fall and fall -- a thousand feet!


         171   EXT.  BOTTOM OF CLIFFS - DAY                                 171

               The creatures land on massive jagged rocks, exploding like
               immense, horrid watermelons.  Multi-colored gore festoons the
               whole cliff face.

               TILT UP to see three tiny figures standing at the top of the
               cliff.


         172   EXT.  CLIFFS - DAY                                           172

               Val peers down at the distant creatures for a long time.  Then
               he notices Earl and Rhonda are staring at him.  Where the hell
               did he get an idea like that?  After a moment:

                                          VAL
                            Well, it just suddenly hit me, you
                            know?  Stampede?

               They turn and head back toward the others.  They laugh as
               they realize how stealthily they are walking.  Val starts
               taking big, exaggerated stomping steps.  Rhonda and Earl
               follow suit.  The trio goes off arm in arm, stomping merrily.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


         173   EXT.  PERFECTION - MAIN STREET - DAY                         173

               Val and Earl roll two scavenged truck wheels down the street
               toward their own truck; which is up on jacks, two wheels
               missing.

               Mindy races past excitedly.

                                          MINDY
                            Look!

               A highway maintenance truck is rolling into town followed by
               a police car.  The townsfolk happily swarm around the
               MAINTENANCE MEN and POLICE OFFICER who gape at the destroyed
               town.

               Val and Earl eagerly start bolting on one of their new wheels.

                                          EARL
                            Road's in!

                                          VAL
                            Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit
                            Bixby we start making phone calls.
                            We could make some real money off
                            this whole thing, get in People
                            magazine...

                                          EARL
                            People?  Hell, National Geographic.

                                          VAL
                            Sell the movie rights.  We're going
                            straight from blue-collar to white
                            -collar.

                                          EARL
                            Yeah...but no ties.

                                          VAL
                            No ties.

               Rhonda pulls up in her truck, leans out and snaps their
               picture with a top-of-the-line Nikon.

                                          RHONDA
                            Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his
                            camera.

                                          EARL
                            Howdy, Rhonda.

                                          RHONDA
                            You're really leaving, huh?

                                          EARL
                            You bet.  You gonna be staying up
                            here?

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, yeah!  There's going to be
                            major research up here.  First
                            thing is to get some pictures of
                            that one we dug up.

               An awkward pause.  Finally she extends her hand to them.  Val
               just gives it a quick shake.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            Uh...well, maybe I'll see you two
                            sometime...
                                   (to Val)
                            And thanks for everything, you
                            know, saving my life and stuff.

                                          VAL
                                   (awkwardly)
                            Well...you're welcome.

               She gazes at him, just a hint of something in her eyes.  Earl
               springs to attention.  Is the boy blind?  Then Rhonda snaps
               out of it.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well...see ya.

               They nod.  She drives off.  Earl stares at Val who starts
               putting the second wheel on the truck.

                                          EARL
                            Christ, Val, maybe she's not your
                            type, but you could, at least, be
                            civil.

                                          VAL
                            Civil?  I'm civil.

                                          EARL
                            You're not civil, you're glum.  We
                            got the world by the tail with a
                            downhill pull and all of a sudden
                            you go glum on me.

               Earl freezes as a bell goes off in his head.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Oh my God.  She got to you.  You do
                            like her!

                                          VAL
                            Somebody paying you to do this?

                                          EARL
                            She just practically asked you for
                            a date.  What the hell is wrong?!

               Val glares at Earl for a moment.

                                          VAL
                            Earl, get real.  What does she need
                            with a guy like me?

               Earl is dumbfounded.

                                          EARL
                            What was that?  All this time she's
                            not good enough for you.  Now,
                            suddenly, you're not good enough for
                            her?  God, my work is never done.
                            You don't decide is you're
                            worthless, she does.  But you gotta
                            give her a chance!

               Val lowers the jack letting the truck down.

                                          VAL
                            Earl, I'm not gonna make a fool of
                            myself!  You got that covered.

               Earl stands there fuming, mind racing.  A last ditch idea
               hits home -- we see a devilish glint in his eye.

                                          EARL
                            Fine, make the mistakes I did.
                            I think I'll just be playing this
                            hand myself.

                                          VAL
                            What?

                                          EARL
                            She likes both of us.  We both
                            helped her out.

                                          VAL
                            You are so full of shit...

                                          EARL
                            Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She
                            ain't as narrow-minded as you.
                            I'll lay odds she's looking for
                            character in a man.  For my part,
                            I'd be proud to have her.  I'd
                            goddamn worship her.

               Earl hops into the truck.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            I'm going out there right now, help
                            her take those pictures...set up her
                            seismo-jiggers.  Whatever she
                            wants.  Who the hell knows what'll
                            happen?

               Earl starts to drive off.  Val springs into the passenger
               seat.  Through the truck's rear window we see Val raise his
               hand in The Challenge.  They do a round of scissors-rock-
               paper -- but it's a tie.  They go again.  Another tie.  They
               keep playing and tying as they drive off into the distance
               and we --

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                          THE END

A FULL MOON FILLS THE FRAME -- Luminous, tinged with gold.      
Slowly, a penumbral shadow begins to spread across the          
moon's surface, darkening it from left to right...

                "These violent delights have violent
                ends..."

... until the moon is enveloped in shadow; a new moon...        
which disappears into the darkness.                             

OVER BLACK - A RUFFLED TULIP appears, isolated against the      
blackness.

HOLD ON the tulip as the background FADES UP around it to       
reveal we're now in --                                          

EXT. FOREST - ECU ON THE TULIP - DAY                            

It's surrounded by the dark, lush, greenery of the forest       
floor.

SUDDENLY A FOOT SLAMS DOWN next to the tulip, nearly            
crushing it. As the foot immediately lifts off again, it        
grazes the tulip, knocking its petals off --                    

ON THE RUNNING PAIR OF FEET                                     
They abruptly change direction. Race on. INCLUDE BELLA          
SWAN, desperately searching the woods -- SHORT, SURREAL CUTS    
of her frenetic quest --

                           BELLA
                Edward!

Ahead, through the darkness of the thick forest, she SEES       
SUNLIGHT; a clearing. She hurtles toward it --

EXT. MEADOW - DAY

                           BELLA
                Edward!

                                                             2.



-- as Bella bursts into the sunlight. It's the meadow where        
Edward revealed his skin in the sun. But he's not here now.        
Instead, Bella SEES --

ACROSS THE MEADOW -- AN OLD WOMAN, white hair framing her
withered face. Bella's eyes widen with surprise as she
recognizes --

                           BELLA
              ... Gran?

GRAN looks as surprised as Bella. Bella smiles and waves,
as does Gran. Bella starts toward her but --

                           EDWARD (O.S.)
              Bella...
She spins to the voice behind her to SEE --

EDWARD emerge from the forest, his alabaster skin in sharp         
contrast to the shadows. She beams at him, relieved, in
love... until he moves to edge of the shade, inches from
sun's rays --                                                      

                          BELLA
              Stop - she'll see!

But Edward just smiles and steps into the sunlight.                
Sunbeams SHATTER off his skin like a thousand rainbow              
shards, as if he were made of diamonds. An awesome sight.

JUMP CUT TO: Edward now inches from Bella, still glistening,
entrancing her. She wraps an arm around his waist, then
arranges her face into a calm expression. They turn to --          

Gran, whose expression is calm, too. Gran's arm is
extended, as if she also holds someone.
JUMP CUT TO: Bella and Edward, only feet from Gran now.
Bella's about to present Edward, but then SEES that --

Gran mimics Bella's movement exactly. With growing horror,
Bella reaches out to Gran... and touches glass!                    

PULL BACK TO FIND Gran is now surrounded by a GILDED FRAME.        
It's a MIRROR, mounted on a wall with wallpaper reflecting a       
surreal dreamlike version of the forest behind Bella.              

                           BELLA
              Oh my God.

-- as she realizes that's not Gran; it's Bella, sixty-five         
years older.

                                                            3.


Bella spins to her perfect, eternally 17-year-old Edward.
He takes her now WRINKLED, age-spotted hand. Kisses it.

Then he leans in very close to her 83-YEAR-OLD FACE and           
whispers into her ear --                                          

                          EDWARD
              Happy birthday.

                                                  SMASH TO:       

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

ON BELLA - her eyes snap open. She lies atop her bed. A
book, "ROMEO AND JULIET," lays open on her chest. Bella
sits up, the dream still weighing on her...
INCLUDE HER ROOM, cluttered with pictures of Edward, of the       
Cullens; memorabilia of all things Edward. A KNOCK on the
door. CHIEF CHARLIE SWAN enters carrying two gifts, one
wrapped, one not.

                          CHARLIE
              Happy birthday, Bells.

                          BELLA
              Dad, we agreed, no gifts.

                          CHARLIE
              At least mine's not wrapped.

He hands it to her. It's a digital camera.   Bella's
pleased, despite herself.

                          BELLA
              Okay, this is actually kind of great.
              Thanks, Dad.

                          CHARLIE
                   (re: wrapped gift)
              Goes with this one from your mom. We
              coordinated - well, she coordinated
              me.

Bella opens the wrapped gift to reveal a SCRAPBOOK.

                          CHARLIE
              To put your pictures in, record your
              senior year -- man, senior year.
              How'd you get so old so fast?

                          BELLA
              Not that old.

                                                           4.



                          CHARLIE
              I don't know. Is that a wrinkle?

Bella races to the mirror, searches her face.

                          CHARLIE
              I was kidding.

                          BELLA
              So not funny, Dad.

EXT. FORKS HIGHWAY - DAY

An AERIAL VIEW of this lush, green, overcast landscape; the
rainy world that is Forks. FIND Bella's old truck as it
lumbers down the two-lane highway...
                          BELLA (V.O.)
              It was just a dream... but also my
              worst nightmare.                                   

EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

Bella climbs out of her truck, shouldering her book bag.
She looks around the parking lot, seeking Edward --              

                          MIKE (O.S.)
              Wherefore art thou, Bella?

She turns as MIKE, ERIC, ANGELA and JESSICA approach.

                          MIKE
              You finish the Shakespeare assignment?

                          JESSICA
              He means will you finish his
              assignment?
                          MIKE
              No, I don't -- okay I do.

                          BELLA
              I can help you with it -- but first --
                   (pulling out her camera)
              I need a picture. My mom's expecting
              a scrapbook full of memories.

                          ANGELA
                   (holds up her own camera)
              I take `em, I don't pose for `em.

                          BELLA
              You do today.                                      

                                                          5.



She pushes Angela to the others; they arrange themselves --     

                          JESSICA
              You'll photoshop my nose if it looks              
              big, right?                                       

                          ERIC
              Don't worry, I'm in the picture; no
              one will be looking at you guys.

Jessica scoffs, Angela points her camera at Bella; Mike and
Eric joust -- Bella aims --                                     

FULL FRAME - THE CAMERA'S DIGITAL SCREEN                        

It FREEZES on them, fun, delightfully carefree... but when      
the camera lowers, their playfulness has dissipated as they     
see someone behind Bella. She turns to see --                   

EDWARD climbing out of his silver Volvo.

                         MIKE                                   
                   (dry)                                        
              Oh good. Cullen's here.                           

                            JESSICA                             
                      (drier)                                   
              Yay.                                              

The friends, uncomfortable, move off --

                          ERIC                                  
              Check ya later.

-- But Bella doesn't register their tone. She's transfixed      
by Edward who approaches, eyes never leaving hers. He           
reaches her, washing away all her concerns --
                          EDWARD
              Happy birthday.

-- except that one.    Her face falls.

                          BELLA
              Don't remind me.

                          EDWARD                                
              Your birth is definitely a day to                 
              celebrate.                                        

                            BELLA                               
              Not for me.                                       

                                                          6.



                          EDWARD                                
              Eighteen is a little early to be                  
              worrying about your age.

                          BELLA
              It's one year older than you.

                          EDWARD
              Bella, I'm ninety.

                          BELLA
              True. Maybe I should be creeped out               
              that I'm dating such an old guy.                  

                          EDWARD                                
                   (smiles, amused)                             
              Yes, it's the age that's creepy, not              
              the fact that you're dating a vampire.            

Then he kisses her, tenderly, adoringly. She kisses him         
back... despite their restraint, the passion mounts... until
he pulls away. As always, both are left wanting more.
Edward nods toward the school building --                       

                          EDWARD                                
              Class.                                            

                           BELLA                                
              Right.   Class.                                   

Catching their breath, they start toward school... but          
Edward stops, hearing something in his mind. Irritated.         

                          EDWARD                                
              Someone wants you.

                          JACOB (O.S.)
              Bella!
JACOB BLACK, 16, jogs up, carrying a used car part, long,
black ponytail wagging. He looks 18 due to his tall,
muscular body, but the gregarious Jacob is a little klutzy,     
still catching up to his growth spurt. He nods to Edward,
who moves off to the side but eyes them.

                          BELLA
              God, Jacob, what are they feeding you
              on that rez, steroids? You're huge.

                          JACOB
              Wouldn't seem so drastic if you came
              around more.

                                                            7.



                          BELLA
              I will, soon. But isn't your school,
              like, ten miles that way?

                          JACOB
                   (re: car part)
              Just here buying this for the Rabbit.
              I'm almost done with the rebuild.
              Gotta come take a ride when it's done.              
                   (as if remembering)
              Oh, and hey, happy birthday. Your dad
              told my dad. So...

He pulls from his coat a small woven DREAMCATCHER, feathers       
dangling from it. He hands it to her.
                          JACOB
              I saw it the other day and thought of
              you - it catches bad dreams.

                          BELLA
              This, I need. It's great.

                          EDWARD
              The bell's about to ring.

The bell RINGS. Jacob gives Edward an amiable smile, with         
just a hint of snark.                                             

                          JACOB                                   
              Ooh, look at you, all psychic.                      

                          EDWARD                                  
              I don't have that particular gift.                  
              But I can read a watch. I'm clever                  
              that way.                                           

They share a tight smile.   Bella intercedes, squeezing           
Jacob's arm.                                                      

                          BELLA
              Bye, Jake, and thank you.

Edward guides her away.   As they walk off --                     

                          EDWARD
              How come Jacob Black gets to give you
              a gift and I don't?

                          BELLA
              He's just a friend.

                                                          8.



                          EDWARD
              "Friends" don't spend two weeks
              looking for the perfect dreamcatcher.

                          BELLA
              Stop reading his mind if he bothers
              you so much.

                          EDWARD
              Little hard to tune out.

She just laughs, but Edward looks back at Jacob with
resentment. Jacob holds his gaze.

INT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY
Edward and Bella enter the double doors -- suddenly a small,
wrapped gift appears in Bella's face. ALICE presents it.

                         ALICE
              Happy --

                         BELLA
              Shh!

-- Alice whispers in her ear as she hugs Bella --

                          ALICE
              -- birthday.

Over Alice's shoulder, Bella sees JASPER, keeping his
distance. He offers her a pleasant nod. She tries to hide       
Alice's present, hoping no one noticed --

                          BELLA
              Alice, didn't I say no gifts?                     

                          ALICE
              You did. I didn't. I've already seen
              you open it and guess what? You love
              it.

                          BELLA
              You had a vision about my birthday.

                          ALICE
              And about the green dress you'll be
              wearing to your party tonight. Great
              color on you.

                          BELLA                                 
              ... My party?                                     

                                                           9.



                             ALICE                               
              Please?     It'll be fun.                          

                          BELLA                                  
                   (beat, confused)                              
              I... guess I can deal --                           

                         ALICE                                   
                   (hurriedly)                                   
              -- Great! See ya at seven!                         

Alice hugs her again and races off before she can change her     
mind. Which is when Bella realizes --                            

                          BELLA                                  
              Wait, Jasper, no fair with the mood                
              control.                                           

He offers an apologetic bow before Alice drags him away.         

                            EDWARD                               
              Vampires.    You can't trust them.                 

                                                     CUT TO:

CLOSE ON A T.V. MONITOR - Zeffirelli's `68 "Romeo and
Juliet" plays. The suicide scene.

                          ROMEO
              Arms, take your last embrace, and

              with a righteous kiss...

PULL BACK TO INCLUDE --

INT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

The room is dark as we PAN OVER the class, some students
entertained, some moved, Mike trying not to fall asleep.
The teacher, MR. BERTY, mouths every word --

                          ROMEO
              Here's to my love!
                   (drinks)
              O true apothecary!    Thy drugs are quick.

FIND Edward and Bella in the back of the room, desks pushed
together, whisper-talking.

                          BELLA                                  
              I hate being... celebrated.                        

                                                            10.



                          EDWARD                                   
              Come on, the last real birthday any of               
              us had was Emmett's - I think Bing
              Crosby was on top of the charts.
                   (then)                                          
              You'll be helping us feel normal for a               
              night.                                               

Bella sits back, knowing she's trapped.    He kisses her hand.     

                          EDWARD                                   
              There are worse tragedies than a                     
              birthday. Look at Romeo. He's                        
              responsible for his wife's death. Who                
              could live with that?                                
                   (looks at the screen)                           
              ... Though I do envy him one thing.                  

                          BELLA
                   (blanches slightly)
              Juliet's alright... if you like that
              obviously beautiful sort of thing.

                          EDWARD
              Not the girl - the suicide.
                   (off her look)                                  
              Nearly impossible for my kind. But
              humans, a little poison, dagger to the
              heart. There are so many options.                    

                          BELLA
                   (appalled)
              Why would you even think about that?

He turns her wrist over, runs his hand over the horseshoe          
shaped SCAR on her forearm.                                        

                          EDWARD
                   (shrugs)                                        
              I considered it. Once.      When James               
              had you trapped.                                     

FLASHPOP TO "Twilight" - In the ballet studio, JAMES grabs         
Bella's arm and BITES --                                           

BACK ON EDWARD - pained.                                           

                          EDWARD
              I didn't know if I'd find you in time.
              If I'd gotten you killed --

                          BELLA
              It wouldn't have been your fault --

                                                         11.



                          EDWARD
              Either way, I had a plan.                          

                            BELLA                                
              What plan?                                         

                          EDWARD                                 
              There are... ways for us. At least                 
              one way. I would have gone to Italy,               
              provoked the Volturi...                            

                            BELLA                                
              The who?                                           

                          MR. BERTY                              
              Is there something you'd like to share             
              with the class, Edward?                            

                          EDWARD                                 
                   (politely)                                    
              Certainly not. But I apologize for                 
              being a distraction. Perhaps you                   
              should rewind to act five, scene one,              
              line twenty-eight eighty-nine --                   
                   (reciting)                                    
              "If you had the strength of twenty men             
              it would dispatch you straight."                   

Mr. Berty just looks at him, then moves off, intimidated --      

                          MR. BERTY                              
              Eyes on the screen, people.                        

Bella is too concerned to be amused.                             

EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - NIGHT                                        

Lights glow from inside the beautiful house.                     
                          EDWARD (O.S.)                          
              The Volturi are a very old, very                   
              powerful family...

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - CARLISLE'S ROOM - NIGHT

ON AN 18TH CENTURY OIL PAINTING, depicting Grecian figures in
swirling robes writhing among pillars and balconies. In a
high balcony, FOUR CALM FIGURES look down upon the bacchanal;
two black haired, one snowy white, one golden haired...

                          EDWARD (O.S.)
              The closest thing my world has to
              royalty...

                                                           12.



INCLUDE -- Edward and Bella (now wearing a green dress).
She studies the painting - the largest on a wall crowded
with pictures. The other walls are towering bookshelves.

                          EDWARD
              Francesco Solimena painted this; he
              often depicted the Volturi as Gods.

Bella examines the golden haired "God."

                          BELLA
              Is that... Carlisle?                                

                          EDWARD
              Yes. He lived with them for a few                   
              decades. He describes them as very                  
              refined - for killers.

PUSH IN ON THE PAINTING, THE FOURSOME

Their features begin to fill in, become real - THEY COME TO
LIFE in the painting, turning to leave the balcony through
an archway. We FOLLOW THEM into --

INT. A CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL - DAY

It's centuries old, its marble cracked and weathered. The         
open oculus in the domed ceiling is the only source of            
light. The room is empty but for three large wooden chairs        
and half a dozen VAMPIRES in elegant 18th century attire.

                          EDWARD (V.O.)                           
              The Volturi are also what you might                 
              call enforcers.                                     

                         BELLA (V.O.)                             
              Of what?                                            
                          EDWARD (V.O.)                           
              The only rule they have: to keep                    
              secret the existence of our kind.                   

Two of the Volturi, MARCUS and CAIUS, take their seats,           
Carlisle stands beside them. ARO moves to the center of the       
room where we REVEAL --                                           

A ROGUE VAMPIRE is on his knees. He looks feral compared to       
the others, and terrified. Aro puts his hands on either           
side of the Rogue's face. Compassion?                             

                                                           13.



                          EDWARD (V.O.)
              We don't make spectacles of ourselves,
              or kill conspicuously, unless we want               
              to die.

Aro then slowly, dispassionately, RIPS THE ROGUE'S HEAD OFF.      
Two Volturi Guards (FELIX and DEMETRI) appear on either           
side, holding him down as Aro easily detaches the head and        
tosses it aside. Aro calmly sits as the others tear the           
Rogue limb from limb. Carlisle has to look away...                

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - CARLISLE'S ROOM - NIGHT

-- as Bella spins on Edward --

                          BELLA
              Don't even -- talk about that. You                  
              can't let anyone hurt you. The                      
              Volturi or anyone else.                             

                          EDWARD                                  
                   (sees she's worried)                           
              Who else would hurt me?                             

                          BELLA                                   
              You said there were more dangerous                  
              things out there than you. And I know
              you have at least one enemy --

OFF BELLA'S FACE - FLASHPOPS:

-- ON ALL THREE EVIL VAMPIRES, James, VICTORIA, the dread-        
locked LAURENT (from "Twilight")

-- CLOSE ON VICTORIA - fire-red hair, burgundy red eyes,
feral, vicious grin (from "Twilight")

                          BELLA (O.S.)
              You said she'd come after you for
              killing her mate.

BACK ON BELLA AND EDWARD

                          EDWARD
              Victoria? Yes, some day. But Alice                  
              will see her coming. And she won't win.

Bella looks up at him, pained.

                          BELLA
              I hate that I can't protect you.

He laughs, amused.   She's decidedly not.                         

                                                            14.



                           BELLA
               That was me being serious.

                           EDWARD
                    (kissing her face)
               I know. But you do protect me...                    
                    (kisses her nose)
               From boredom...                                     
                    (kisses her lips)
               And loneliness...                                   
                    (in between kisses)
               You give me a reason to stay... un-                 
               dead. But it's... my job; to protect                
               you...                                              

-- but he stops, smiles, hearing something in his mind --
                           EDWARD
               ... from everyone but my sister.

-- as the door bursts open and Alice dances in.

                           ALICE
               It's time it's time it's time!

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

Alice tugs Bella and Edward to the top of the landing, then        
skips down the stairs. They look down into --

THE LIVING ROOM - Hundreds of pink candles and rose-filled
crystal bowls. ROSALIE, ESME, EMMETT, Carlisle, Jasper and
Alice look up at her, all of them stunningly beautiful.

Bella would love to disappear, but Edward leads her down to --

THE LIVING ROOM -- where Esme and Carlisle hug Bella warmly.
                           CARLISLE
               Sorry about all this.   We tried to
               rein Alice in.

                           ESME
               Like that's even possible.   Happy
               birthday, Bella.

FLASH!   Alice has snapped a picture of Bella with them.

                           ALICE
                    (re: camera)
               Found it in your bag.   Mind?

Emmett moves to Edward's side.   Nudges him.

                                                              15.



                          EMMETT
              Dating an older woman.    Hot.

Bella caught that.    Edward elbows him sharply to shut up.

                           EMMETT
              What?

Rosalie steps up.    Shoves a silver package at Bella.

                          ROSALIE
              It's a necklace. Alice picked it out.

She walks away, bored. Bella has to smile.     She sees Jasper
across the room. They wave to each other.
                          ALICE
                   (aims the camera)
              Show me the love!

Edward pulls Bella into an embrace, they look deeply into
one another's eyes. FLASH!

                          ALICE
              For your scrapbook.    Now open your
              presents!

Alice drags Bella over to a table piled with elaborately             
wrapped gifts, a huge cake and a tall stack of china plates.

                          BELLA
              Alice, I'm the only one who even eats
              cake. That thing could feed fifty.

                          ALICE
              Hope you're hungry.    Here, this one's
              from Emmett.
The others crowd around... Jasper somewhat away. Bella, no
fan of being the center of attention, opens the gift to find
an empty car-radio box.

                          BELLA
              Um... thanks?

                          EMMETT
              Already installed it in your truck.

                          EDWARD
              Finally, a decent sound system in that
              piece of --

                                                            16.



                          BELLA
              No hating on the truck.     Thank you,               
              Emmett.

                           ALICE
              Open mine.

Alice hands her a box.   Bella starts to open it, but --

                          BELLA
              Ouch - paper cut.

CLOSE ON BELLA'S FINGER - A single drop of deep red blood
appears.

Bella thinks little of it, but then HEARS a disturbing,            
grisly SNARL -- she looks up just as --                            

BELLA'S POV - JASPER lunges toward her!    Teeth bared, eyes       
beyond reason --                                                   

-- Edward FLINGS Bella behind his own body, causing her to
CRASH into the table, plates shattering as --

-- Jasper SLAMS into Edward; sounds like boulders colliding.

-- Edward pushes him, hard; Jasper SAILS backward, hitting         
the wall. But he RICOCHETS off it and comes back at Bella.         

-- Emmett and Carlisle TACKLE Jasper from the side, dragging       
him to the ground -- Alice helps hold him down --                  

                          ALICE
                   (soothingly)
              Jaz... shhh --

... But she stops, her head suddenly jerking toward Bella.
Then everybody's eyes snap toward Bella as they catch the
overwhelming scent --

ON BELLA - lying amid the shards of broken china. She looks
at her arm, seeing now - it's been slashed by plate shards;
bright red blood pulses out of her, pooling. She looks up --

BELLA'S POV - THE CULLENS (SLOW MOTION)

All of them now, including Edward (but not Carlisle) stare
down at her, at her blood, with fevered eyes. Six suddenly
ravenous vampires...

SLOW MOTION ABRUPTLY ENDS as -- Carlisle jumps to Bella's
side. Edward, though white as a bone, snaps out of it and
stands between her and the others.

                                                           17.



                          CARLISLE
              Emmett, get Jasper out of here.                     
                   (no response)
              Emmett.

Emmett reins himself in, elbows Rosalie. They drag the
snarling Jasper out. Esme holds her nose, politely exits
with the others. Alice looks at Bella, apologetic --              

                          ALICE                                   
              I'm sorry, I... can't...                            

She slips out the door.   Edward's still on guard as Carlisle     
examines Bella's arm.

                          CARLISLE
              I'll have to stitch this up.

                          EDWARD
              I'll carry her to the kitchen.

He moves to pick her up, but his eyes dart to the blood.

                          CARLISLE
              I'll take care of her, Edward.
                   (Edward doesn't move)
              Check on Jasper. Go.                                

Edward looks from him to Bella. Then steps back, allowing
Carlisle to lift Bella and carry her to the kitchen. But
just before the kitchen door closes, Bella sees Edward's
agonized face. He turns away, unable to meet her eyes...

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                               

Bella sits in a chair opposite Carlisle who mops up her           
blood as he removes glass shards from her arm. He drops one       
into a bowl; PLINK. She tries not to look at the blood.           
                          BELLA                                   
              I sure can kill a party.                            

                          CARLISLE                                
              It's not your fault. Jasper hasn't                  
              been away from human blood as long as               
              the rest of us.                                     

                          BELLA                                   
              Seems like you're the only one it                   
              doesn't effect.                                     

                          CARLISLE                                
              Centuries of practice.                              

                                                         18.



                          BELLA                                 
              Did you ever think of... living                   
              differently?                                      

                            CARLISLE                            
              I enjoy   my work too much. Helping               
              people,   saving lives. I'm hoping                
              there's   a point to my existence, even           
              if I am   damned.                                 

                            BELLA                               
              Damned?    You're not damned.                     

                          CARLISLE                              
              Then you and I agree. But Edward                  
              doesn't believe there's an afterlife              
              for our kind.                                     
                   (looking at her)                             
              He thinks we've lost our souls.                   

                          BELLA                                 
                   (realizing)                                  
              That's why he won't... He thinks he'd             
              be damning me.                                    

                          CARLISLE (CONT'D)                     
              If you believed as he did, would you              
              risk it?                                          

Off Bella, no, not ever...                                      

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT                                      

A large red bow hangs from the new stereo in the dashboard.     
Edward drives in silence. Bella studies him. Finally --         

                          BELLA                                 
              Say something.                                    
                          EDWARD                                
              What do you want me to say?                       

                          BELLA                                 
              That I'm a klutz. That I should have              
              been more careful --                              

                          EDWARD                                
              You got a paper cut. Normal people                
              get paper cuts. And a normal                      
              boyfriend wouldn't have flung you into            
              a stack of plates. A normal boyfriend             
              wouldn't have had to fight the urge to            
              kill you --                                       

                                                         19.



                           BELLA                                
              Stop.   I don't want normal, I want               
              you.                                              

Edward doesn't respond, just pulls the truck into --            

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE/INT. BELLA'S TRUCK (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT      

The truck stops.   Beat.                                        

                          BELLA                                 
              You can't protect me from everything -            
              something's going to separate us --               
              accident, illness, old age... as long
              as I'm human...
                          EDWARD
                    (appalled)
              That's your solution?   My ending your            
              life?

                          BELLA
              Your giving me forever.                           

He faces forward again, jaw tight, mind working, tormented.     
She reaches for his hand --                                     

                          BELLA                                 
              Carlisle told me how you feel, about              
              my soul, but I don't believe that --              

-- he subtly moves his hand away from hers.                     

                          EDWARD                                
              You should go in. It's late.                      

He climbs out - instantly he's opening the passenger side       
door for her. She climbs out. He looks down at her face -       
he softens as he takes it in. Puts a hand on her cheek.         

                          BELLA                                 
              I'll leave my window open for you.

                          EDWARD
                   (quietly)                                    
              I won't be coming back.   Not tonight.            

                          BELLA                                 
              Then... can I ask for one thing?   It's           
              still my birthday.                                
                   (off his nod)                                
              Kiss me?                                          

                                                           20.



He lifts her face to his, and kisses her. He begins               
carefully, gently... but it changes, he becomes urgent, with      
an almost painful edge, as if it were goodbye.                    

Abruptly, he pulls away. With a last look, he turns walks         
off into the night. Off Bella...                                  

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ON A PHOTO - as a printer spits it out. It's the pic Alice
took of Bella and Edward's embrace. Bella, troubled, puts
it in her scrapbook, her bandaged finger running over it.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

"Romeo and Juliet" lessons are on the board. Everyone's
scribbling essays. Bella glances at Edward's desk; empty --

FLASHPOP TO -- (previous scene in truck) ECU ON EDWARD'S          
EYES, hard, turning away from her...

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY                                

Bella sits with Jessica, Angela, Eric and Mike. They joke,
throw things. Bella's distracted, looking-out for Edward.         

FLASHPOP TO -- (scene in the truck) ECU ON EDWARD'S HAND          
moving away from hers...

BACK ON BELLA'S WORRIED FACE, off which we go to --               

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - DAY                                        

PAN the photos on the wall. INCLUDE EDWARD who studies            
them, his expression grim. He looks down at Bella's               
SCRAPBOOK to SEE the photo of him and Bella. He pulls it          
out, takes a closer look...                                       
EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY                                          

ON BELLA THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD of her truck as she pulls         
into the driveway. She climbs out, heads toward the house         
but stops, relief washing over her --

                           BELLA
              Edward.   You're here.

He stands by the house. Bella hurries toward him, but slows
when she sees his cold, distant face; an unreadable mask.

                          EDWARD
              Walk with me?

                                                        21.



Edward gently takes her hand. Dread fills her, but she lets
him guide her toward the woods...

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Edward stops by a fallen tree.        Turns to Bella.

                          EDWARD
              We need to leave Forks.                          

                             BELLA                             
              What?   Why?                                     

                          EDWARD
              It's time. Carlisle's supposed to be             
              ten years older than he looks; people
              will start noticing.

                          BELLA
              But... when?

                             EDWARD
              Now.                                             

Bella reels, trying to take this in.       Finally --          

                          BELLA                                
              I'll have to think of something to               
              tell Charlie, but I can be ready --              

                           EDWARD                              
              Not you.   Us.                                   

                          BELLA                                
                   (stunned)
              What? -- no -- Edward, what happened             
              with Jasper - that was nothing.                  
                          EDWARD                               
              Nothing compared to what could happen.           
              You don't belong in my world.                    

                          BELLA
              -- I belong with you --

                          EDWARD
              -- You don't --

                          BELLA
              -- I'm coming --

                          EDWARD
              I don't want you to come!

                                                                22.



Bella is stung, as if slapped.

                          BELLA                                        
              You don't... want me.                                    

                          EDWARD                                       
              No.                                                      

She steps back.   Trying to understand this.                           

                          EDWARD                                       
              I'd like to ask one favor though.                        

                         BELLA                                         
                   (looks up, hopeful)                                 
              Anything.                                                
                          EDWARD                                       
              Don't do anything stupid or reckless --                  
              do you understand?                                       
                   (adding)                                            
              ... for Charlie's sake. Just... take                     
              care of yourself.                                        

                          BELLA                                        
              I... yes... I will.                                      

He softens ever-so-slightly.                                           

                          EDWARD                                       
              Don't worry. You're human. Time                          
              heals all wounds for your kind.
              Particularly if you're not reminded.                     

Desperation wells up in her, overwhelming dignity.                     

                          BELLA                                        
              No, this is - don't do this.     Please.                 
He sees she won't let go easily.    Takes a breath.       His face     
turns cold again.                                                      

                          EDWARD                                       
              Try to understand. Every second with                     
              you is about restraint. You're too                       
              fragile. I'm tired of pretending to                      
              be something I'm not. Reining myself                     
              in so I can be with a human.                             

                          BELLA                                        
              Then take my soul. I don't care!        I                
              don't want it without you --                             

                                                               23.



                          EDWARD                                      
                   (sharply)                                          
              -- You're not good for me, Bella.                       

Bella looks at him.   His hard face.   His resolve.                   

                          EDWARD                                      
              I've let it go on too long.     I'm
              sorry.                                                  

Tears sting Bella's eyes. This can't be happening. He
steps forward... kisses her forehead. She closes her eyes.

                          EDWARD
              I promise, it will be like I never                      
              existed. Goodbye, Bella.                                
And here, for the first time, we SEE how truly agonizing
this really is for Edward. But Bella doesn't see.                     

By the time she opens her eyes - he's gone.    She spins --           

                           BELLA
              -- Wait --

She SEES a LEAF FLITTERING to the ground where he grazed a            
branch; the only indication of his direction. She hurries             
down the path, then runs --                                           

                           BELLA
              Edward?!

-- and she keeps running, going deeper into the woods...

A SERIES OF QUICK, SURREAL SHOTS - TIME LAPSING

Bella runs through the woods, searching, reminiscent of her
opening dream. It gets darker and darker, until we're deep into  
night -- HEAR Bella's sharp desperate BREATHS --                 

BELLA TRIPS. Falls to the damp forest floor.        She looks up,     
the trees spinning around her...                                      

STAY ON BELLA - NIGHT - AS HOURS PASS                                 

She remains on the ground. Curls into a ball.       Darkness          
shrouding her. Devastation paralyzing her.                            

ECU ON HER FACE - numb. HEAR the faint sound of her name              
being called in the distance. A search party. She's too               
wrecked to respond.

Rain begins to pour; she doesn't register it....                      

                                                            24.



SERIES OF SCENES END ON -- BELLA, lying there, dazed. She
begins to HEAR an animal SNUFFLING. It gets closer. It
sounds large. Scary. Then she hears a whisper --

                          EDWARD (O.S.)
              Move, Bella.

She lifts her head, looks for Edward... but SEES something         
else instead --

BELLA'S POV - A DARK SHAPE, huge, black. Nearing. Its EYES
reflect light for a split second; they're inhuman, savage.

Bella, terrified, manages to DRAG herself to a cluster of
trees. She squeezes between them. Breathing hard. She
closes her eyes, trying to disappear...                            
INT. WOODS - LATER NIGHT                                           

Bella's eyes open to find herself FLOATING several feet
above the ground. Trees pass by. She's being carried...

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Half the town is gathered - a tired rescue party that
includes Mike Newton and Jacob Black.

Charlie, beside himself with worry, pores over a map with
BILLY BLACK (in wheelchair) and Quileute HARRY CLEARWATER,
46, (dark braids, stout, protruding belly, kind face).

                          CHARLIE
              I'll call the Cullens again. Her note
              said she and Edward went for a walk.

                          BILLY
              They left town, Charlie.
                          HARRY CLEARWATER
              Hospital said Doc Cullen got a big job
              somewhere else.

Harry puts a reassuring hand on Charlie's shoulder.                

                          HARRY CLEARWATER                         
              We'll find her, Charlie.                             

Charlie is glad for the comfort of his two friends.                

                           JACOB
              Charlie!                                             

Charlie spins to where Jacob points --

                                                          25.



THEIR POV - THE EDGE OF THE WOODS

SAM ULEY, 20, emerges, a tall, strong Quileute Indian with       
cropped hair and a fierce expression. He's carrying Bella.       

                          BILLY
              It's Sam Uley. He found her.

Charlie bolts to her; he's never moved faster in his life.
He wraps his arms around Bella, lifting her from Sam's arms.

                          CHARLIE
              Thank you, Sam. Thank God.

Charlie carries Bella to the house, cradling her. Harry and      
Billy give Sam a nod of praise and gratitude. But Sam backs      
away, avoiding any accolades.

ON JACOB - jogging alongside Charlie, peering at Bella with      
worry. Then Jacob slows, feeling eyes on his back... he          
turns to SEE Sam Uley staring at him. Jacob, uncomfortable,
quickly looks away.

ON CHARLIE CARRYING BELLA up the stairs to the house --          

                          CHARLIE
              What were you thinking, Baby?   Why
              were you out there?

                          BELLA
              He's... gone.                                      

Off her as Charlie carries her inside --                         

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     

OVERHEAD SHOT OF THE BED - Charlie lays Bella down and wraps     
her in blankets...                                               
A SERIES OF DISSOLVES ON BELLA                                   

She's curled in a fetal position in the middle of the bed.       
Then at its foot. Under the blankets. On top of them. In         
various different arrangements. Meanwhile...                     

A BLACK LIQUID begins to flood the floor, slowly swallowing      
everything in the room. It rises up the sides of the bed,        
higher and higher until it breaches the top of the bed and       
begins to engulf Bella. Off her, submerged in blackness...       

                                                           26.



EXT.   BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY - A MONTH LATER

The leaves have turned red and orange.    SEE a FIGURE in the     
upstairs window --                                                

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - DAY                                        

Bella sits in a rocking chair by the window. Her face             
blank. Empty. STAY ON BELLA, unchanging - but THROUGH THE         
WINDOW OUTSIDE, we SEE TIME LAPSING behind her --                 

OCTOBER -- Costumed kids appear in the yard, trick-or-            
treating. DISSOLVE INTO...                                        

NOVEMBER -- NEIGHBORS (BOB MARKS and his WIFE) bring Charlie
a turkey... they glance up at Bella's window with concern...      
WINTER BEGINS -- the trees' branches are now bare...              

DECEMBER -- Charlie drags a Christmas tree toward the house...    
worry has taken its toll on him. But Bella remains                
unchanged...                                                      

                           BELLA (V.O.)                           
               Dear Mom... I'm...
                    (beat)
               ... lost...

PAN the now blank walls of the exceedingly neat room; gone        
are all traces of Edward...

                           BELLA (V.O.)
               Edward took everything with him.
               Including my life. He promised it                  
               would be like he never existed...

... LAND ON the scrapbook which lies open; the photo of
Bella and Edward's embrace at the birthday party - gone.
INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER DAY

BELLA AT HER COMPUTER, typing an e-mail to Renee.

                           BELLA (V.O.)
               ... But I need to know he did.

A SERIES OF TABLEAUS, DISSOLVING INTO ONE ANOTHER:

-- INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Bella sits on the couch, blank, as the rain pounds.    Charlie
watches her, concerned.

                                                         27.



                          BELLA (V.O.)
              It's like a huge hole has been punched
              through my chest...

-- INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

In the darkness, Bella is curled up in a ball on her floor.     

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              But the pain is my only reminder that
              he was real... that they all were...

-- INT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

Lunch. Bella sits alone, staring straight ahead. SEE
Jessica, Eric, Angela and Mike, watching her with concern.
Talking about her. She doesn't notice.

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              I miss them. Especially Alice...

EXT. TANYA'S ALASKAN HOME - DAY

A one-story contemporary home, surrounded by snowy, barren
land and woods. Through a LARGE PICTURE WINDOW we SEE Alice
and Carlisle, arguing inside --

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              But I'm sure it's better for them, not
              having me around...

INT. TANYA'S ALASKAN HOME (CONTINOUS) - DAY

Alice faces off with Carlisle as the others watch on. Esme
desolate; Emmett blank. He sits next to Rosalie who seems
almost irritated. Jasper isolates himself in a corner.

                           CARLISLE
              No.   We promised Edward.

                          ALICE
              But she won't do well without us. I get           
              flashes of her, but they're unclear --            

                          ROSALIE
              Forget her, let's drag Edward home.               

                          ESME
              He'll come back when he's ready.                  
              After Bella moves on.                             

                                                            28.



                          CARLISLE                                 
              Yes. When she's living her life, safe                
              from danger --                                       

                          JASPER
                   (with self-contempt)
              You mean safe from us.

Alice wraps an arm around Jasper, soothingly.

                          ROSALIE
                   (pointedly to Alice)
              And when will that be?

                          EMMETT
              Can you see him, Alice?                              
They all turn to Alice... a beat. She closes her eyes,             
trying to get a lock on Edward -- PUSH IN ON ALICE as --

                          ALICE
              The only decision he's made...

                                                    SMASH TO:

EXT. SOUTH AMERICA - ANDES (ALICE'S VISION) - DAY                  

(Visuals are jumpy, unclear) START HIGH ON A MOUNTAINTOP in        
the middle of nowhere. SWOOP DOWN to its peak on which we          
find EDWARD. Standing still, face agonized.                        

                          ALICE (O.S.)                             
              ... is to be alone...                                

-- and suddenly, he starts running, like he's trying to            
outrun his memories, faster and faster -- he races toward a        
CLIFF; a RAVINE hundreds of feet below --                          
Edward doesn't slow, just blasts forward faster; then he           
LEAPS off the cliff, FLOATING, but the pain stays with him --      

ON EDWARD'S FEET landing hard on the other side of the             
ravine - as they hit ground we --                                  

                                                SMASH BACK TO:     

CLOSE ON BELLA'S FINGERS

-- as they hit computer keys --

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              Time passes. Every tick that goes
              by... aches...

                                                            29.



INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

INCLUDE BELLA'S COMPUTER SCREEN, as she types...

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              Like the pulse of blood behind a bruise...

Bella stops. A beat as she stares at her own words.   Then
she hits "select all" and "delete" --

ON THE COMPUTER - A BLANK DOCUMENT. She types: "Hi Mom,
things are great, grades are up. Hanging with friends.
Stop worrying. I'm fine."

Bella presses "send", and the cheery e-mail disappears.
Bella rises, returns to her rocking chair, staring out             
desolately. PUSH PAST HER OUTSIDE...                               

AN UNKNOWN POV FROM THE WOODS - ON BELLA IN THE WINDOW

-- Someone's watching her, pacing menacingly, hungrily...

                                               DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella exits to find Charlie out by the street, stuffing
trash into the bins. He talks with neighbor, Bob Marks, who
also attends to his trash: two old, beat up motorcycles.           

                          CHARLIE
              It's about time you got rid of those,
              Bob. Seen one too many bikers smeared
              on the highway.

                          BOB
              Save the lecture, Chief. Soon as the
              garbage truck hauls `em off, you and
              my wife can rest easy.
                    (starts off, but stops)
              Oh, hey, what's the word on that bear                
              problem? Folks are saying they're                    
              huge.                                                

                          CHARLIE
                   (distracted)
              That's just... talk...                               

-- as Charlie watches Bella walk to her truck, head down.
Bob sees her, too --

                          BOB
              How you doin' there, Bella?

                                                            30.



Bella, in her own world, doesn't respond.   Bob gives Charlie
an understanding shrug and heads off.

ON BELLA as she opens her truck door.   Suddenly, it gets
slammed shut again by Charlie.

                              CHARLIE
               That's it.

                           BELLA
               That's what?

                           CHARLIE
               You're going to Jacksonville to live
               with your mother.
                              BELLA
               What?   Why?

                           CHARLIE
               I just - don't know what to do any                  
               more. You don't act like someone left               
               you; more like someone died.

She looks away.   That's how it feels to her.

                           BELLA
               I'm not leaving Forks.

                           CHARLIE
               Bells, the bastard's not coming back.

She nods.   Knows this all too well.                               

                           CHARLIE                                 
               It's not normal, this behavior. And                 
               frankly, it's scaring the hell outta
               me, and your mother.                                
                    (gentler)
               Go to Jacksonville, Baby. Make some
               new friends.

                           BELLA
               I like my old friends.

                           CHARLIE
               You never even see them anymore.

                           BELLA
               I do, too. In fact, I'm... um...
               Jessica and I are going to Port
               Angeles tomorrow. Shopping.

                                                          31.



                          CHARLIE
                   (suspicious)
              You hate shopping.

                          BELLA
              That's how good a friend I am.

                         CHARLIE
                   (somewhat appeased)
              Alright. Shopping.

                          BELLA (PRE-LAP)
              Hi Jessica, it's Bella...

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY
Bella drives, talking on her cell (hands-free, of course).

                          BELLA
              ... Yes, Bella Swan. Hey, any chance
              you feel like shopping tomorrow?

EXT. PORT ANGELES - MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT                        

Bella and Jessica exit the theater.   A MARQUEE behind them      
bears the title of a ZOMBIE film.                                

                          BELLA                                  
              I don't get why are there so many                  
              zombie movies.                                     

                          JESSICA                                
              It's, like, a metaphor? For crass                  
              consumerism or something.                          

Bella glances at her.                                            

                          JESSICA                                
              Not that you'd know anything about                 
              consuming. You didn't buy anything                 
              today.                                             

                          BELLA
              I bought something.

                          JESSICA
              Socks don't count. `Course, I was
              surprised you even called.

                          BELLA
              I've been kind of... out of it.

                                                            32.



                          JESSICA
              Kind of? I mean, at first I was
              worried. Then I'm like, okay, she's
              still bumming? It's not like I wasn't
              going through things, too. Like Mike
              deciding he wanted to "just be friends?"
              That was really hard and --

                          MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
              How `bout a ride, girls?

As Bella looks ACROSS THE STREET, time suddenly SLOWS --

BELLA'S POV - A DIVE BAR, "ONE EYED PETE'S" (SLOW MOTION)

-- FOUR ROUGH-LOOKING GUYS loiter out front next to their           
motorcycles. They're in shadow, we can't see their faces.

OFF BELLA WE SMASH TO --

FLASHPOPS: Bella surrounded by FOUR GUYS ("Twilight");
Edward's Volvo skidding to a stop; Edward staring them down --

BACK ON BELLA, a chill going down her spine, FREEZING her as
she stares at the foursome across the street...

Then suddenly -- a pair of lips lean next to her ear --

                          EDWARD (O.S.)
              Move, Bella.

She turns to find Edward standing next to her. Or so it
seems. But he's an illusion; an apparition - which becomes          
clear when --

Jessica steps right into him, dissolving him to nothingness, and
TIME ABRUPTLY SPEEDS UP AGAIN --
                           JESSICA
              Come on.

                          BELLA
              I know them... I think...                             

                          JESSICA
              Can we just go --

Jessica pulls at her arm, but Bella shakes her off.

                          BELLA
              I want to see something.

                                                             33.



Much to Jessica's frustration, Bella begins to cross the
street toward the Guys, frightened but drawn.

                          GUY #1
              Alright, we got a taker.

The apparition of EDWARD REAPPEARS in her path this time.           
She stops.

                          EDWARD
              Turn around, Bella.     This is                       
              dangerous.                                            

But when she steps backward, he fades. Testing her
hallucination, she strides forward again -- Edward's
apparition reappears, strides alongside her --
                             EDWARD
              Stop.   Now.

She's almost smiling as she reaches the Guys, finally able
to see them clearly -- and stops, realizing --

                          BELLA
              ... You're not them.                                  

And with that.... Edward disappears.

                          GUY #1
              We'll be whoever you want, honey.

Guy #2 pulls up right next to her on his motorcycle.

                          GUY #2
              Ready for a thrill ride?

GUY #2 extends his hand to help her onto the bike.     She          
hesitates.                                                          
                             EDWARD (O.S.)                          
              Walk away.     Go.                                    

Edward's apparition appears on the other side of the bike.          
Bella looks at him with determination -- then climbs on to          
the back of the bike --                                             

                          BELLA                                     
              I can break promises, too.                            

                         GUY #2                                     
                   (confused)                                       
              ... Okay.                                             

                                                              34.



                          JESSICA                                    
              Bella!

The bike LURCHES forward, going way too fast. As the wind            
blasts her hair back, she realizes this might have been a            
mistake --                                                           

                          BELLA                                      
              ... Wait                                               

Guy #2 doesn't hear her, guns the engine, going faster --            

BELLA'S POV - DIRECTLY AHEAD                                         

Edward stands in road, directly in their path, more present,         
more clear than ever. The bike's headlight illuminates him,          
racing toward him --                                                 

                          BELLA                                      
              Stop - stop! - STOP!                                   

The bike abruptly pulls up short.                                    

                          GUY #2                                     
              Hey, I didn't force nothing on you.                    

Bella scrambles off, stumbling in the process.    Edward is          
gone.                                                                

The four Guys then REV their bikes and PEEL out.    Bella            
watches them go as Jessica storms up.

                          JESSICA
              What the hell is wrong with you?!

                          BELLA
                   (almost to herself)
              I... saw something.                                    
                           JESSICA                                   
              You.   Are insane. Or suicidal.                        

                          BELLA                                      
                   (trying to figure it out)                         
              The more dangerous... the more real it                 
              was.                                                   

                          JESSICA
              So, what, you're like an adrenaline
              junky now? Go hang-gliding or bungie-
              jumping. Don't be a complete freak.

                                                            35.



An angry Jessica charges off. Bella watches the motorcycles
disappear down the street as --

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              He wasn't real. I knew that. I                       
              didn't care. I needed to see him. If                 
              danger's what it took, that's what I'd               
              find.                                                

Off Bella, determination settling into her face...

EXT. JACOB BLACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella pulls up in her truck, a tarp covering something big
in the back. Jacob comes out of the house. A huge grin.
                          JACOB
              Bella!

Bella hops out, Jacob gives her a hug.   Bella's surprised by
his affection, but doesn't mind.

                          JACOB
              `Bout time you came by.

                          BELLA
              I brought you something.

Bella pulls the tarp back, revealing - her neighbor's two
dilapidated, rusting MOTORCYCLES.

                          JACOB
              Scrap metal. You shouldn't have.

                          BELLA
              I rescued them from the dump. They'd
              cost more than they're worth to fix...
              unless one had a mechanic-type friend.
                          JACOB
              Me, being the mechanic-type friend?
                   (off her shrug)
              Since when are you into motorcycles?

                          BELLA
              Recently.

                          JACOB
                   (studying the bikes)
              The parts alone will be pricey.

                          BELLA
              I have a college fund I can dig into.

                                                            36.



                          JACOB
              Charlie's gonna love that.                           

                          BELLA
              Charlie won't know.                                  

                          JACOB
              Wow. Lying to Dad. Blowing through                   
              college money. Repairing dangerous                   
              machines - that I'm guessing you'll
              want to ride?

                          BELLA
              I really get it if you think this is
              stupid and reckless.
                          JACOB
              Oh it's totally stupid and reckless.
                   (leans closer, grins)                           
              When do we start?

Bella face spreads into something we haven't seen in a
while... a wide smile. As they pull the bikes off the
truck, they laugh and joke; it's as though Jacob has brought       
Bella back to life. But --

UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA AND JACOB FROM A DISTANCE

-- someone's watching as the two of them wheel the bikes           
into the garage. REVERSE on the watcher to discover --

EXT. EDGE OF THE WOODS - SAM ULEY - SAME

Next to Sam stand two others, JARED, 17, and PAUL, 18. All
three have cropped hair, sleeveless shirts, cut-offs. It's
unsettling how they watch Bella and Jacob; the ferocity in
their eyes, the danger.
Sam turns; the others follow his lead. The three slink
soundlessly into the darkness of the woods...

                                                   SMASH TO:

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Two hikers, NATE and TIM, 20's, as they tromp through the
shadowy, mist-laden woods. Tim studies his IPhone GPS --

                          TIM
              We're going the wrong way.

                           NATE
              Who cares?   Enjoy the scenery.

                                                              37.



                           TIM
                    (slapping a mosquito)
               And the West Nile virus.

Tim hears a RUSTLE.    Stops.

                           TIM
               You hear that?

                           NATE
               If I knew you were such a wuss, I'd
               have brought my grandma.

                           TIM
               Could be one of those giant bears.
                           NATE
               There are no giant --

RUSTLE. Nate stops. Then, from the opposite direction,
another RUSTLE. Then another, and another, from behind,
from in front. It's either more than one creature or it's
moving with extraordinary speed. The guys are terrified.

                           TIM
               What the hell is that?!

                           NATE
               I don't know!

The guys, faced away from one another, search the trees.
STAY ON TIM as suddenly, there's an eerie SILENCE. Beat.

                           TIM
               Think it's gone?

No answer.   He turns to find that Nate has vanished.
                            TIM
               Nate?   Nate!?

Nothing... then the RUSTLING starts again.       And intensifies.

Tim BOLTS! CLOSE ON TIM - tearing through the woods, too
scared to feel the branches SMACK him in the face. Breath
ragged, he looks over his shoulder --

TIM'S POV - BEHIND HIM - something gives chase, flattening
foliage and bending thin trees in its path. Tim runs harder --  

TIM'S POV - UP AHEAD THROUGH THE TREES - THE HIGHWAY

A couple cars pass.    Civilization.   Safety.   Tim races for it --

                                                           38.



EXT. HIGHWAY (CONTINUOUS)

Tim bursts from the tree-line, he's almost to the pavement,       
he`s going to escape --                                           

BAM! Something YANKS him out of frame at an unnatural             
angle. His SCREAM is abruptly choked off, leaving nothing         
but a disturbing silence...                                       

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT. JACOB'S GARAGE - ANOTHER DAY

Motorcycle parts are spread out on blankets.    Jacob moves
among them excitedly, piecing them together.    Bella watches.
                          BELLA
              If we're going to be working on this
              every day, we should probably include
              some homework. Don't want the Dads to
              think I'm a bad influence on you.

                          JACOB
              You influence me?     Please.

                          BELLA
              I am older than you.

                          JACOB
              Age ain't nothin' but a number.

                          BELLA
              And I convinced you to secretly build
              us two-wheeled death machines.

                          JACOB
                   (sudden mock-horror)
              God, you're right, you're like Satan --
                          QUIL (O.S.)
              Yo, Jake, you in there?

Bella abruptly sits up, starts to pull a tarp over the bikes.

                          JACOB
              It's cool, it's just my boys.

QUIL ATEARA and EMBRY CALL enter, both 16. Quil is short,
stocky and feisty, with short hair. Embry is tall, thin and
laid back, with chin-length black hair.

                          EMBRY
              Hey, Jake --

                                                               39.



They stop when they see Bella.        The two guys share a smile.

                          JACOB
              Hey. This is Bella.         Bella, that's
              Quil and Embry.

                          QUIL
              So the bike building story is true.

                          BELLA
              Taught him everything he knows.

                          QUIL
              What about the part where you're his                    
              girlfriend?                                             
                          BELLA
              Oh, we're just friends.

                              EMBRY                                   
              Ooh.    Burn.

                          JACOB
                   (scrambling)
              I said she's a girl and a friend.

                          QUIL
              Embry, you remember him making that
              distinction?

                              EMBRY
              Nope.

Bella rescues Jacob --

                          BELLA
              So I guess you guys have girlfriends.
                         JACOB
                   (laughs loudly)
              Right. Quil took his cousin to prom.

Embry chuckles, as well.

                          QUIL
              Yeah, that's still a riot. You want
              funny, Black? I'll give you funny.

Quil makes a run at him, he dodges; a playful scuffle ensues.
Embry, amused, saunters over to Bella.

                          EMBRY
              I got five bucks on Quil.

                                                           40.



                           BELLA
              You're on.

The scuffle continues.   Off Bella, enjoying them...

A SERIES OF SCENES...                                             

INT. JACOB'S GARAGE - OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL DAYS             

The bikes begin to take shape, the parts on the blanket thin      
out.                                                              

                          BELLA (V.O.)                            
              I never forgot my reason for doing                  
              what I was doing...                                 
Jacob clowns for Bella's amusement, pretends to skewer            
himself with a pipe. She laughs.                                  

                          BELLA (V.O.)                            
              But being with Jacob was a bigger perk              
              than I expected...                                  

He constantly touches her, playful, affectionate. It's            
effortless in contrast to Edward's intense restraint. We          
can see her spirits beginning to lift.                            

EXT. JACOB'S GARAGE - NIGHT                                       

Bella and Jacob exit, make their way across the yard to her       
truck. Bella seems lighter, happier than before.                  

                          JACOB
              Quil keeps asking to come over. I                   
              think he likes you a little too much.               

                          BELLA
              Tell him I'm not into the cougar                    
              thing.

                          JACOB
              What is it with you and age? I mean,                
              that Cullen guy was young, didn't seem              
              to... bother you.                                   

He instantly regrets saying Edward's name as he sees it           
crush her spirits. Off Bella, retreating into herself...          

                          BELLA (V.O.)                            
              Not even Jacob could keep away the                  
              nightmares...

                                                         41.



EXT. WOODS - NIGHT (NIGHTMARE)

Bella TEARS through the forest, searching desperately. Then
she turns -- finds Edward a few yards away, his face cold.      
She steps toward him -- but he BOLTS backward, suddenly
twenty yards away --

                           BELLA (V.O.)
               ... the terror, the loneliness.

-- he rapidly retreats further until he disappears, leaving
Bella utterly alone, darkness closing in on her...

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bella SCREAMS in her sleep. The light turns on and Charlie      
hurries to her side, gently shaking her awake.                  

                           CHARLIE                              
               You're alright, Bells.   You're okay.            

Her eyes open, tears streaming down her cheeks. He doesn't      
quite know what to do, so hands her a glass of water from       
her bedside table. She sits up, sips. He pulls the              
dreamcatcher from her bedpost.                                  

                           CHARLIE                              
               This thing's not working very well.              

                           BELLA                                
               It's... not as bad as it was.                    

                           CHARLIE                              
               Yeah right.                                      
                    (beat)                                      
               I know what it's like, you know. When            
               your mom left me. I had a hell of a              
               time. Imagined doing all kinds of                
               crazy things, just to stop the pain.             

She avoids his look.                                            

                           CHARLIE                              
               But hanging out with Jacob seems to              
               help get your mind off... things.                

                           BELLA                                
               He's been keeping me afloat.                     

                           CHARLIE                              
               That's good. He's a good guy.                    

Off Bella...                                                    

                                                          42.



INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY                                         

Bella drives along the La Push cliffs. Jacob rides shotgun.
He studies a grease-blackened motorcycle crankshaft.

                          JACOB
              We got lucky at the dump. You know
              how much a new crankshaft goes for?

                          BELLA
              Sure, I spend all my free time on
              crankshaft-dot-com.

                          JACOB
              I think that's a porn site.
                   (then)                                        
              These bikes are gonna be rolling soon.             
              Where should we ride first?

                          BELLA                                  
              Someplace sunny.                                   

                          JACOB
              Like there's any place sunny around                
              here.                                              

                          BELLA
              I know a place above the cloud line --             

The second she says it, she regrets it -- off her --

FLASHPOP TO - THE MEADOW, Bella lying in the grass with          
Edward ("Twilight"), flowers surrounding them.                   

                          JACOB (O.S.)
              Where is it?

BACK ON BELLA - her face falls.
                          BELLA
              Actually, it's... too hard to get to.              

He brings his easy smile and optimism to the rescue.

                          JACOB
              So we'll find our sunny spot, right?               

She smiles, grateful. Then she looks out the window at the
cliffs... and notices --

                                                          43.



BELLA'S POV - IN THE DISTANCE BY THE CLIFF

FOUR MEN stand on the rocky ledge of the cliff (Sam, Jared,
Paul, and a fourth). They wear nothing but cut-off shorts.
They push each other, rough-housing.

                          BELLA
              Isn't that... Sam Uley?

                          JACOB
                   (bitter)                                      
              And his cult.

Suddenly, two of the guys throw a struggling Jared over the
cliff! BELLA SLAMS on the brakes. Jumps out of the truck --
Jacob climbs out after her --
                           BELLA
              Oh my God!   Stop them! --

EXT. LA PUSH CLIFFS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- Bella runs toward them.   But Jacob's laughter slows her.

                          JACOB
              They're not really fighting, Bella.                
              They're cliff diving.

                          BELLA
              What, on purpose?

                          JACOB
              Scary as hell, but a total rush.

BELLA'S POV - A DIVER (Paul) takes a running start and           
FLINGS himself into the air, twisting and cartwheeling down.

Bella is intrigued, sees the potential for adrenaline - for      
Edward.                                                          

                          JACOB
              Most of us jump from lower down.

                          BELLA
              Think I could?

                          JACOB
              Man, first motorcycles, now cliff diving?

                          BELLA
              You said it was a rush.

                                                         44.



                          JACOB
              Maybe on a warmer day. And not from
              the top. We'll leave the showing off
              to Sam and his disciples.

There's that bitter edge again.   She looks at him.             

                          BELLA
              You don't like them.

                          JACOB
              They think they run this place.   Acting
              all bad ass, calling themselves
              "protectors."

                          BELLA
              What are they protecting?

                          JACOB
              The tribe, the land, their right to be
              jerks. Embry used to call them hall
              monitors on steroids; now look at him.

Bella looks closer, SEES the fourth guy is Embry, hair now
shorn, thin frame filled out, laid back expression gone. It
pains Jacob to see him.

                          BELLA
              That's Embry? I didn't recognize him.             
              What happened to him?                             

                          JACOB
              He missed some school - then, out of
              nowhere, he's following Sam around.
              Same thing happened with Paul and
              Jared. They weren't even friends, now
              Sam owns them.
                   (beat)                                       
              Sam keeps giving me this look, like               
              he's waiting for me or something; it's            
              kinda freaking me out.                            

                          BELLA
              Maybe you should just avoid them.

                          JACOB
              I try but...                                      

She sees he's unnerved, instinctively hugs him reassuringly.    

                           BELLA
              Hey.   If it gets worse, we'll go to my
              Dad.   Or you can come stay with us.

                                                         45.



                          JACOB
              Thanks.
                   (beat, holding her)
              If this is how you're going to react,
              I'll freak out more often.

Bella realizes she crossed a line and covers, playfully
shoving him. As they head to the truck, Bella looks back --

BELLA'S POV - ON SAM

-- but now he's looking directly at her. Then he turns and
DIVES over the edge, cutting a clean line into the water.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY
Bella carries her tray to an empty table, but looks over at
Mike, Angela, Jessica and Eric. Bella takes a breath, then
casually joins them. They take note, but keep talking.

                          JESSICA
              I'll kill Tyler if he gave me his flu.

                          ANGELA
              It's going around. My sister was so
              sick she couldn't come on our hike
              this weekend... so she didn't see it.

                          ERIC                                  
                   (sotto)                                      
              Ang, maybe you should keep that to                
              yourself --                                       

                          ANGELA                                
              We saw something, Eric.                           

                          ERIC                                  
              I believe you.                                    
                          JESSICA                               
              No he doesn't. He's just trying to                
              get lucky.                                        

                          ERIC                                  
                   (suddenly hopeful)                           
              Is that an option?                                

                          ANGELA                                
                   (ignoring him)                               
              It was jet black and huge; on all                 
              fours it was still taller than a                  
              person. A bear maybe.                             

                                                             46.



                             JESSICA                                
                 Or Big Foot.                                       

                             MIKE                                   
                 Or an alien. Lucky you didn't get                  
                 probed.

                             ANGELA
                      (quietly)                                     
                 ... We saw it.

She's serious.    And a little scared.   Bella see that.            

                             BELLA
                 You're not the only one.
Everyone stares.    Did Bella just speak?

                             BELLA
                 My dad's been getting reports at the
                 sheriff's station. A couple hikers
                 went missing. People are scared.

Now everyone's chilled.

                             MIKE
                 I did hear some guy talking about it
                 at the store.                                      

                             ERIC                                   
                 Last time you clowns doubt my                      
                 girlfriend.                                        

As they continue, Angela mouths "thanks" to Bella. They             
share a smile and join in, Bella becoming part of the group.

                                                        CUT TO:
ECU ON JACOB AND BELLA'S FACES

-- just inches apart.

                             JACOB
                 You look scared.

                            BELLA
                 I'm not.

She's lying. PULL BACK to see she's straddling the now
completed motorcycle. Jacob stands next to her, holding the
bike up. There's an intimacy to their proximity. INCLUDE --

                                                            47.



EXT. LA PUSH - CLEARING IN THE FOREST (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

The bike is aimed down a dirt road.     Jacob runs through the     
instructions:

                          JACOB
               Brake?
                    (she taps it)
               Clutch?
                    (she squeezes it)
               Right. Gas?
                    (she grips it)
               You ready?

Bella nods.   Jacob grins... then KICK-STARTS the bike.
                           JACOB
               Slowly... release the clutch.

She does... the bike moves forward an inch -- Jacob
cautiously steps back. She moves forward another inch --

                             EDWARD (O.S.)
               Stop.

Bella turns to find the apparition of EDWARD standing next
to her. Her hand slips off the clutch, the bike BUCKS and
falls on top of her. Jacob quickly lifts it off her as the         
apparition of Edward disappears.

                            JACOB
               You okay?   Bruises, breaks -- ?                    

                           BELLA
               I'm going again.

                           JACOB
               I'm not sure that's a good --
Bella quickly rises and hops back on.

                           JACOB
               Guess we're going again. Now what are
               you going to do with the clutch?

                             BELLA
               Release it.    Slowly.

Jacob nods. Then kick-starts the bike again. She releases
the clutch and moves forward. Slowly at first -- EDWARD
reappears at her side, glowering.

                                                          48.



She keeps going, a little faster. EDWARD appears on her left     
now; she passes him. He reappears ahead; she passes.

ON BELLA'S FACE as the wind flings her hair back. She
gathers speed... and for a moment, experiences pure freedom,
exhilaration... then she sees Edward standing at the curve
in the road ahead, and realizes --

                          BELLA
                   (yelling to Jacob)
              I don't -- how do I turn!?

                           JACOB
              Bank it!   Bank - hit the brake!

Jacob races toward her. She reaches the turn, doesn't bank,
goes straight... and flies right into a wall of trees.

As she lies on the ground dazed, Jacob hurries up.

                          JACOB
              What, are you training for the X-games?

She looks around for Edward.   He's gone.

                          BELLA
              I want to go again.

                          JACOB
              Forget it. I'm revoking your                       
              motorcycle privileges. Man, look at                
              your head.                                         

Indeed, blood drips down her forehead. He pulls off his          
shirt to mop it up. She shrinks away --                          

                          BELLA                                  
              God, I'm sorry.                                    
                          JACOB                                  
              You're apologizing for bleeding?                   

                          BELLA                                  
              It doesn't... bother you?

                          JACOB
              It's just blood, Bella.

He bends over her, carefully tending her head. She finds
herself looking at him. His dark eyes, his bare chest and        
smooth skin. He glances at her.                                  

                                                            49.



                          JACOB                                    
              What are you staring at?                             

                          BELLA                                    
              Just, you're actually... good looking.               

He's surprised; there's a moment between them.     He smiles.

                          JACOB
              How hard did you hit your head?                      

                          BELLA                                    
                   (realizing)                                     
              Oh I - yeah.                                         

He offers her a hand, helps her up.    She holds onto it,          
alarmed.                                                           

                          BELLA                                    
              Jake, you're hot.                                    

                          JACOB                                    
              Upgraded from good looking?                          

                          BELLA                                    
              No, temperature hot.                                 
                   (feels his forehead)                            
              You're burning up.                                   

                          JACOB                                    
              I feel fine.                                         

He takes her hand from his forehead.   Holds it.   She tries       
to pull it away.                                                   

                           JACOB                                   
              What?   I can't hold your hand?                      
                          BELLA                                    
              It just... means something else to you               
              than it does to me.                                  

                          JACOB                                    
              One, that's my problem. But two... we                
              have fun, you think I'm hot --                       

                          BELLA                                    
              Good looking.                                        

                          JACOB                                    
              I know you like me.                                  

                                                            50.



                          BELLA
              More than anyone.    But... that's all.

                          JACOB
              Because of Cullen?                                   

The name stings her.   He takes both her hands now.                

                          JACOB
              Look, I know what he did to you. I                   
              can see it in your face every time his               
              name comes up. But you need to know -                
              I would never, ever do that to you. I                
              promise I will never hurt you. You                   
              can count on me.                                     
                          BELLA
              I already do. You don't know how                     
              much. You're my best friend but... I                 
              don't think my feelings will change.                 

He takes this in, it's hard. A wave of something sweeps
over him. He sits back. Closes his eyes, takes a breath.

                          BELLA
              I'm sorry. I should've said something                
              right from the start --

                         JACOB
              No. That's not -- I just feel...                     
              weird.

                          BELLA                                    
              I told you, you have a fever.                        
              Probably that flu everyone has.                      

                          JACOB
              It doesn't... feel like flu.    I don't              
              know what it is.                                     

Off Jacob, rattled, and Bella, concerned...                        

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY                     

Bella does homework. Charlie watches a game.     She's on          
edge. Anxious. HEAR A BEEEEP --                                    

                          BELLA (O.S.)                             
              Hey Jake. Just checking to see how                   
              you're doing. And to say I'm sorry,                  
              about, you know... how I feel and...                 
              hope the flu passes fast. Call me.                   

                                                            51.



EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - ANOTHER DAY                 

Bella climbs out of her truck, SEES the empty spot where           
Edward used to park. SEES Eric and Angela canoodling.              
Couples everywhere. She puts her head down, hurries to             
class. BEEEEP --                                                   

                          BELLA (O.S.)                             
              Hi Jake. Your dad said you have mono.                
              He won't let me visit but... would you               
              call me?                                             

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                       

Bella paces her room, not wanting to sleep/dream.     She eyes     
the phone, waiting for it to ring. BEEEEP --                       
                           BELLA (O.S.)                            
              Me again.   I just... need to hear your              
              voice...                                             

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Bella's on the phone, leaving yet another message, her             
desperation having reached its peak. In the living room,           
Charlie and Harry check their fishing gear.                        

                           BELLA
              Jacob.   Please. Call me.                            

She hangs up, leans her forehead against the phone.     Charlie    
enters --                                                          

                          CHARLIE
              Harry and I will be back by three --

He stops when he sees her.   Puts a hand on her shoulder.          
                          CHARLIE
              It's mono, Bells.                                    

                          BELLA
              He's too sick to even call?                          

                          CHARLIE
              You just gotta wait it out.                          
                   (then)                                          
              You know, I don't have to go fishing...

                         BELLA
                   (forcing a smile)
              No, go. I'll call Jess or someone.                   

                                                            52.



                           CHARLIE
               Good. But stay here or at Jess's. No                
               hikes or anything. We're issuing a                  
               warning about those bears.                          

Off Bella's nod --                                                 

EXT. THE WOODS - DAY                                               

SERIES OF CUTS - Bella tries to navigate her way to the            
meadow. She refers to a map, a compass.                            

                           BELLA (V.O.)                            
               I was more afraid of the hole in my                 
               chest than I was of bears. Without                  
               Jacob, I needed Edward more than                    
               ever...                                             

Bella tries a trail; it doesn't look familiar.    Backtracks.      
Tries another.                                                     

                           BELLA (V.O.)                            
               ... I needed to know he existed.                    
               There was only one place I might find               
               him, or the feeling of him...                       

FLASHPOP - THE MEADOW - Edward and Bella lie in the grass          
surrounded by flowers, sunlight dappling them. They look           
lovingly into one another's eyes...                                

BACK ON BELLA - the memory and her desperation fuel her.           
Finally, she sees a clearing ahead, hurries toward it --           

EXT. THE MEADOW (CONTINUOUS) - DAY                                 

-- Bella steps into the clearing, hopeful... but her face          
falls. In contrast to the warmth of her memory, the meadow         
is cold, gloomy, cloudy. And no Edward. She closes her             
eyes, trying to force Edward here.                                 

Nothing.   Her eyes open on the empty, overcast meadow.            

Bella sinks to her knees. Tears threatening. But then she
hears a RUSTLING noise. She turns toward it, peers into the
woods.                                                             

Another RUSTLING NOISE comes from another part of the woods.
She spins toward it -- nothing. Then she turns and JUMPS
when she finds --

Vampire LAURENT standing just ten yards away.    Dreadlocks,
chiseled face. Bella can't believe it.                             

                                                         53.



                            BELLA
              Laurent?

                            LAURENT                             
              Bella.                                            

She beams, realizing he's real.                                 

                            BELLA                               
              Laurent!                                          

                          LAURENT
              I must admit, I didn't expect to find
              you here.

                          BELLA
              I live here. But you - I thought you              
              were in Alaska with Carlisle's friend.

                          LAURENT
              Tanya, I was. It was kind of him to
              arrange, given my association with
              James and Victoria, "The Enemy."

                          BELLA
              You tried to help us.                             

Laurent begins to stroll in a slow arc around her, his eyes
assessing her as --

                          LAURENT
              I went to visit the Cullens, but their
              house is empty. I'm surprised they
              left you behind. Weren't you sort of
              a pet of theirs?

Bella's smile falters, fear beginning to dawn on her.           
                          BELLA
              Um... something like that.                        

                          LAURENT
              Do the Cullens visit often?

Suddenly, EDWARD'S apparition appears between them.             

                            EDWARD
              Lie.

                            BELLA
              Absolutely.    All the time.

                                                           54.



                            EDWARD
              Lie better.

                          BELLA
              I'll tell them you stopped by.

Edward fades (throughout, he'll reappear when he speaks,
then fade again). Bella tries to look relaxed.

                          BELLA
              Will they be able to reach you in Alaska?

                          LAURENT
              I don't think so. Tanya's "vegetarian"
              family was pleasant enough. But the
              dietary restrictions were difficult -
              living on nothing but animals.

Suddenly, he's standing inches from her.   She now sees his
EYES. Dark blood-red.

                          LAURENT                                    
                   (conspiratorial)
              Tell me Bella. Do you ever feel                        
              compelled to... cheat?                                 

Bella involuntarily takes a step away from him.

                          LAURENT
              But that's not why I left. I came
              back here as a favor to Victoria.

                          BELLA
              ... You're still friends.

                          LAURENT
                   (shrugs)                                          
              More or less. She asked me to get the                  
              lay of the land with the Cullens.
              Because, well... I'm afraid Victoria                   
              is quite put out with you.

                          BELLA
              That's... too bad.

                          LAURENT
              Yes. She feels it's only fair to kill
              Edward's mate, given he killed hers.
              Eye for an eye, mate for a mate.

And now Bella knows.   Terror overwhelms her.   Edward appears --

                                                          55.



                          EDWARD
              Threaten him.

                          BELLA
              Edward will know who did it.   He'll
              come after both of you.

                          LAURENT
              I don't think he will. After all, how
              much could you mean to him if he left
              you here unprotected?
                   (then)
              Victoria sent me here for information.             
              She won't be happy about my killing                
              you.                                               
                          BELLA
              No, Laurent...

                          LAURENT                                
                   (sincere)                                     
              No, no, no. Don't be upset. I'm                    
              doing you a kindness. Victoria plans               
              on killing you slowly, painfully -
              whereas I'll make it very quick.
                   (inhaling)
              And you smell so... mouth watering.

He faces her, taking in her scent, bloodlust building.   Her
eyes dart around, escape is impossible --

The only thing she SEES is the apparition of Edward, looking
at her with alarm...                                             

                         BELLA                                   
                   (whispering, barely                           
                    audible)                                     
              Edward. I love you.                                
Laurent is milliseconds from biting - then abruptly, his         
expression changes. He sees something in the forest behind       
Bella - and it terrifies him.                                    

                          LAURENT
              I... don't believe it.

He steps back. Bella's confused as she realizes he's no
longer focused on her... she follows his eyes, slowly
turning... to find behind her --

AN ENORMOUS BLACK WOLF skulking out of the darkness of the       
woods. It stalks towards them, a low disturbing GROWL in
its throat, sharp teeth gleaming.

                                                            56.



Bella is trapped between the two killers.    Edward whispers
in her ear --

                           EDWARD
              Don't.   Move.

The wolf slinks closer to Bella, a mere twenty feet from where     
she stands, then --

FOUR MORE WOLVES soundlessly emerge from the trees, flanking
the black wolf. They're the size of small horses, all of
different hues: dark silver, chocolate, ash and russet-            
brown. Their hackles are up, lips curling, bodies crouched,
ready to spring.                                                   

Bella is frozen with fear as they come toward her. The RUSSET-  
BROWN WOLF is the closest and looks directly at her. Laurent    
continues to retreat - then suddenly, almost simultaneously --  

-- Laurent BOLTS across the meadow --                              

-- The wolves SPRING toward Bella -- and leap right over her
in pursuit of Laurent! Their thunderous SNARLS and SNAPS
shake her as the pack sprint after the vampire, surrounding        
him before he reaches the treeline --                              

Laurent SWINGS at the dark silver wolf, SMACKING the wolf          
half-way across the meadow. Another wolf lunges at Laurent -       
he kicks it and it sails into a tree, SPLINTERING it.              

The two wolves recover, lurch back to the pack which closes        
in on Laurent. It's impossible to know who will prevail --         

Bella doesn't stay to find out.     She RACES into the woods --    

EXT. WOODS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY                                      

-- Bella runs franticly, tearing down the hillside,                
tripping, quickly picking herself up -- running, running --        

EXT. WOODS/ROADSIDE - DAY                                          

-- Bella DASHES out of the treeline and to her truck parked        
on the shoulder. She jumps in, PEALS out --                        

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY                                           

Bella BURSTS in, out of breath. Charlie and Harry
Clearwater are washing their fishing gear. Charlie spins.

                           CHARLIE
              Bella?   What's wrong?

                                                           57.



                          BELLA
              They're not giant bears -- I saw them.
              Up in a meadow --                                   

                          CHARLIE
              Damn it, I told you not to go into the
              woods!

                          HARRY CLEARWATER
              What did you see, Bella?

                           BELLA
              Wolves.   They're wolves, Dad.

We might note, though they don't, that Harry Clearwater
sighs ever-so-slightly.                                           
                          BELLA
              Five of them. The size of - of cars.                
              I swear. They went after -- something -
              - and I ran.

Charlie grabs up the phone; as he dials --

                          CHARLIE
              Harry, can you get some men from the rez?

                           HARRY CLEARWATER
              Sure.   Yeah. I'll just --

Harry seems more concerned than gung-ho as he slips out.

                          CHARLIE
                   (into phone)
              Jerry? Put a hunting party together --
              tranq guns, large caliber shotguns --
              there's something dangerous out there.
                          BELLA (V.O.)                            
              Something dangerous. Victoria.                      

Her eyes dart around the house, their vulnerability spinning      
in on her. As Charlie hangs up, goes to his gun cabinet --        

                          BELLA (V.O.)                            
              If she came after me, Charlie would                 
              try to protect me -- and he'd die.                  

                          CHARLIE                                 
              I've gotta go to the station.

                          BELLA                                   
              Good! -- That's good.                               

                                                            58.



                            CHARLIE                                
                You okay here? You want to come with?              

                            BELLA                                  
                Actually, I -- need to see a friend.               

EXT. JACOB'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella knocks.   Then knocks again.    Finally, Billy answers.

                             BELLA
                Hi, Billy.   I know Jacob's sick but --

                            BILLY
                He's out with friends.
                            BELLA
                      (taken aback)
                Oh.

                            BILLY
                I'll let him know you came by.

Billy starts to close the door, but Bella stops him.

                            BELLA
                Wait -- he's got mono, right?    That's
                what you told my dad.

                            BILLY
                     (with compassion)
                You should go on home, Bella.

And he closes the door.      Off Bella --

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY

Bella climbs in, slams the door, pissed. Starts the truck.
Then turns it off. Deciding, she tosses the keys aside and         
sinks down into her seat to wait...

BELLA'S POV - EXT. JACOB'S HOUSE - ON THE WINDOW - LATER

RAIN now pours down. Billy, inside, pulls the curtain back,
looks out at Bella with sympathy. Then closes the curtain.

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - ON BELLA - SAME

Bella looks out the passenger window at Billy. Suddenly,
there's a KNOCK at the driver's window. She spins to find --

JACOB standing there. But his face is shockingly different.
His hair is cropped short. No friendly smile.

                                                           59.


No warmth in his eyes. Just a hard, brooding resentment.
Bella is taken aback. She climbs out of the truck to FIND --

EXT. JACOB'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- behind Jacob stand Sam Uley, Jared, Paul and Embry.
They're oblivious to the rain, wear minimal clothes.              

                          BELLA
              You cut your hair.

                          JACOB
              Go away.

Jacob turns away. Sam leads the group toward the house.
Jacob follows. She, and we, note his sure-footed strides;         
his awkward growth spurt disappeared overnight. She grabs         
his arm.

                          BELLA
              What happened to you?

He stops, turns back. The others wait on the porch for him.
They're out of earshot, but won't leave him alone with her.

                          BELLA
                   (lowers her voice)
              I can help.

His face is hard as he shakes his head.   He's not talking.

                          BELLA
              Sam got to you. What did he do?

                          JACOB
              Sam's trying to help me, don't blame him.

                          BELLA
              Then who?
                          JACOB
                   (bitterness seething)
              How `bout those filthy, reeking
              bloodsuckers you love? The Cullens.                 

                          BELLA                                   
                   (thrown)                                       
              I... don't know what you're --                      

                          JACOB                                   
              You know exactly what I'm talking                   
              about.                                              

He's shaking, almost convulsing with anger.    She regroups.      

                                                            60.



                          BELLA                                    
              The Cullens are long gone.    How are                
              they to blame?                                       

                          JACOB                                    
              They started all this by existing.
              Goddamn leeches --

                           SAM                                     
              Jacob.

Jacob glances at Sam, who gives him a look.     Jacob takes a      
breath, trying to calm himself.                                    

                          JACOB
              I can't be friends with you anymore.
                          BELLA
              Jake, I know I hurt you. I should
              have been more up-front but -- I
              needed you, I still do. I don't know                 
              what that means yet, but if you give                 
              me time --                                           

                            JACOB
              Stop.    Don't. It's not you --                      

                          BELLA                                    
              -- "It's not you, it's me?"     God.                 

                           JACOB                                   
              It's true.   I'm not... good.                        

                          BELLA                                    
              You're wrong --                                      

                          JACOB                                    
              It doesn't matter.    This is over --                
                          BELLA
              I can't take losing my best friend, too.             

                          JACOB
              You already have --

                          BELLA
              Don't say that -- you promised --                    

                          JACOB
              Go home, Bella. Don't come back.

He practically runs away, joining the gang who all disappear
inside. Off Bella, standing in the rain...

                                                           61.



INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Bella enters, dripping wet, too listless to close the door.       
Charlie's face falls when he sees the pain and lifelessness       
returned to her. He grabs a blanket, wraps her in it.             

                          CHARLIE
              Billy called, said you and Jacob had a
              fight. But, hey, you guys will work
              it out, I'm sure of it.

                          BELLA
              I'm... going to change.

Bella heads upstairs.   Charlie sags, helpless.   He moves to     
the open door --                                                  
UNKNOWN POV - EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT             

-- It paces, watching Charlie slowly close the door...            

                                                    SMASH TO:

INT. FOREST - NIGHT

Bella TEARS through the forest again, searching. She turns --
finds Edward, cold, distant. But his face begins to MORPH...      

... and becomes Jacob's. She reaches for him but he BOLTS         
backward, suddenly many yards away.

                          BELLA
              Why!?                                               

He, too, retreats further, disappearing until Bella is alone.

BLACKNESS encroaches, the moonlight becoming a tiny
spotlight on her. She searches the dark - then SEES a pair
of EYES, female, blood-red - coming toward her; HEAR a loud
SCREECHING NOISE --

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

-- Bella tosses herself awake, slowly realizing it was just
a dream. But she HEARS the SCREECHING noise again!                
Fingernails on her window. Bella bolts upright, looks
around for a weapon --

                         JACOB (O.S.)
                   (whisper shouting)
              Bella! Ouch - damn it; open the window.

Bella cautiously moves to her window to find --

                                                              62.



EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

Jacob, shirtless, clings to the top of a tree which bends
with his weight. Bella opens the window, whisper-yelling --

                            BELLA
                What the hell are you doing?

                            JACOB
                Get out of the way.

He begins to swing his legs, increasing momentum.       She
realizes what he's about to attempt --

                              BELLA
                No!
He launches himself THROUGH the window with great agility --

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

-- Jacob lands on the balls of his feet. Bella is stunned.           
He freezes, listening for Charlie. Nothing. A bitter, self-
satisfied grin spreads on his face. It pisses Bella off.             
He takes in her room.                                                

                            JACOB                                    
                I pictured your room more...                         
                cluttered.                                           

                            BELLA                                    
                Why are you here?                                    

                            JACOB
                I had to talk to you.   Alone.

                            BELLA                                    
                To kick me in the gut again? It was                  
                bad before, but you made it so much                  
                worse.                                               

                            JACOB                                    
                I know. And I want to explain.                       
                But... I can't.

                              BELLA
                Then leave.                                          

He stays put.   She tries to push him but he's immoveable.           

                            BELLA                                    
                You're done with me, remember?   Get.                
                Out!                                                 

                                                           63.



                          JACOB                                   
              Bella, I literally can't explain...                 

She becomes aware of her hands on his bare skin and muscular      
chest. The intimacy of their touch. She pulls away.               

                          JACOB                                   
              I broke my promise not to hurt you, I               
              know. But I'm trying to keep it now.                
              I need you to understand... even if                 
              you don't want to see me when you find              
              out --                                              

                          BELLA
              Find what out?                                      
He starts to speak -- but can't.   It's agonizing.   She sees     
he's in pain. Is concerned.                                       

                          BELLA                                   
              What's wrong?                                       

                          JACOB                                   
              I can't do it.                                      

                          BELLA                                   
              Yes, you can. I'll help you. We                     
              can... we can leave. Leave home,                    
              leave Sam.                                          

                           JACOB                                  
              It's not something I can run away                   
              from.                                               
                    (then)                                        
              I would run with you though. If I                   
              could.                                              
                    (beat, realizing)                             
              Wait. Wait, I already -- I told you.                
              You know this -- you can guess.                     

                          BELLA                                   
              I don't want to play games with you --              

                          JACOB                                   
              You have to! I can't tell you, but if               
              you remember - it was that day I ran                
              into you at the beach. I told you a                 
              story -- come on! I told you a                      
              story... about?                                     

                          BELLA                                   
              ... about... "The Cold Ones?" You                   
              said it was a stupid tribal myth.                   

                                                           64.



                         JACOB                                    
                   (pointedly)                                    
              Was it? Are the Cold Ones a myth?                   

She doesn't answer.                                               

                          JACOB                                   
              What else did I say?                                

                          BELLA                                   
              That... the tribe made a treaty with                
              them. They can't come onto your land                
              and... I don't know, I don't remember.              

                            JACOB                                 
              Try, Bella.                                         
                          BELLA
              You have to give me more. Tell me                   
              where to look. Is there something I
              should see -- ?

                          JACOB
              No, that's too dangerous --

                          BELLA
              I'll take the risk.    Jacob, show me.              

He looks at her, doesn't want to but knows it's the only          
way. Beat.                                                        

                          JACOB
              Where was the last place you saw me...              
              the way I used to be?                               

                          BELLA
              The motorcycles - that clearing in the              
              woods.                                              
He nods slowly, then turns to go.    She stops him.               

                          BELLA                                   
              Don't go. There are dangerous things                
              out there; more than you know.                      

He looks at her with a wry smile. Then pulls her into a           
hug. Her cheek against his bare chest. She takes in the           
closeness... then he soundlessly heads out her door. A beat
-- Bella starts pulling on clothes.

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT

Bella drives through the darkness.

                                                           65.



                          BELLA (V.O.)
              If I was going to lose someone else, I              
              needed to know why.

She pulls off the road, and drives into the forest.

EXT. LA PUSH - CLEARING IN THE FOREST - NIGHT

Bella parks. Climbs out of her truck. The moon eerily             
illuminates the clearing. Forest NOISES encroach.

She hears a RUSTLE amid the trees. Spooked, she freezes --        
then SEES JACOB emerge from the trees. A moment as their
eyes meet. Then --

Sam Uley, Paul, Embry and Jared step into the clearing, as        
well, half-clothed, movements almost synchronized. Their          
expressions simultaneously alter into fury when they see
Bella. Paul spins on Jacob.

                          PAUL
              What the hell have you done?!

                          JACOB
              I didn't tell her.   You'd know if I                
              did.                                                

                          PAUL
              She's here, isn't she?

                          SAM
              Bella, there's nothing to see here.
              You should go home.

                          BELLA
              Not until I know what you did to Jacob.

                          PAUL
                   (advancing on Bella)
              What we did?!

Jacob moves in front of Bella protectively, facing Paul.

                          SAM
              Both of you, calm down --

                          JACOB
              Sam, she knows things about the                     
              bloodsuckers. She's been on the                     
              inside. She can help --                             

                          PAUL
              Like a leech lover's gonna help us.

                                                          66.



                          JACOB
              Watch what you call her.

                          EMBRY
              Get a grip, guys --

But Paul and Jacob are so angry, their bodies begin to
shake, nearly convulse. It unnerves Bella --

                          BELLA
              It's alright, Jacob, I'll go --                     

Paul and Jacob are beyond hearing.                                

                          PAUL
              All you care about is her --
                          SAM
                   (commanding)
              Paul, back off.

                          PAUL
               -- and she doesn't give a crap about
              you --

Jacob flashes anger, PUSHES Paul, hard.   Paul FLIES backward.

                          SAM
              Jacob.

Paul rises, outraged, throws his head back in a growl,
vibrating violently --

                          JARED
              Too late.

                          SAM                                     
              Bella, get back!                                    
Paul FALLS FORWARD but halfway to the ground there's a loud
RIPPING noise and Paul explodes in silver-gray fur, becoming
a massive wolf crouched and ready to spring!

Bella, horrified, grabs Jacob's arm, pulling him --               

                          BELLA                                   
              Run, Jacob! --                                      

But he yanks away from her, runs directly at the Paul-wolf --     

                           BELLA                                  
              Jake, no!   Stop -- !                               

                                                              67.



Jacob DIVES headfirst into the air - with another sharp
TEARING sound, shreds of cloth blast into the air, fur
BURSTS from Jacob's skin - he lands on the ground a gigantic
russet-brown wolf, charging the Paul-wolf.                           

Bella reels as the two wolves CRASH into each other,                 
snarling and RAMMING one another. The sound is DEAFENING.
Their teeth flash at each other's throats.

Bella stumbles backward as the fight carries the two wolves          
beyond the clearing and into the woods --

CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM, as they fight deeper and deeper into
the darkness... until they disappear. The horrible SOUNDS
of the fight still ECHO --
BACK IN THE CLEARING -- Sam starts after them, kicking off           
his shoes.

                          SAM
              Take Bella to Emily's place.

Sam disappears leaving an eerie quiet.    A long silence...

                          EMBRY
              Guess the wolf's out of the bag.

Off Bella, stunned.

EXT. LA PUSH - EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Bella's truck, driven by Embry, pulls up to a tiny,                  
weathered house with a window box full of marigolds. Jared,          
in the back, jumps out, opens Bella's door. He and Embry             
head toward the house. She doesn't move.                             

                         EMBRY                                       
                   (to Jared)                                        
              Pay up. She didn't puke.                               

Jared, annoyed, hands Embry five bucks.                              

                          EMBRY                                      
              Told you she was tough.     She does run               
              with bloodsuckers.                                     

                          BELLA                                      
              Wait. We should go back, make sure                     
              Jacob's okay.                                          

                          JARED                                      
              I hope Paul gets some teeth in him.                    
              Serve him right.                                       

                                                             68.



                          EMBRY                                     
              No way. Jake's a natural. You see                     
              him phase on the fly? I gotta fiver                   
              says Paul doesn't touch him.                          

                            JARED                                   
              Easy money.    Paul's been at it longer.              

Bella looks at them, appalled.      They realize she's not          
following them.                                                     

                            EMBRY                                   
              Come on in.    We won't bite.                         

                          JARED                                     
              Speak for yourself.                                   
Bella warily climbs out of the car, joins them.     Embry           
pauses at the door --

                          EMBRY
              Oh, hey, about Emily - Sam's fiance -                 
              just try not to stare. It bugs Sam.                   

                          BELLA
              Why would I stare? --

-- But the guys are already entering --

INT. EMILY'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

Bella hesitantly enters behind Jared and Embry. She sees            
EMILY, 20, at a counter, popping fresh muffins out of a tin.
SEE only one side of Emily's beautiful face, draped by long
black hair.

                          EMILY
              You guys hungry? Like I have to ask...
Emily looks toward them now -- REVEALING the other side of
her face: A scar runs from hairline to chin, three red lines
that pull down her eye and twist her mouth.

                            EMILY
              Who's this?                                           

As Jared and Embry beeline for the muffins --

                            JARED
              Bella Swan.    Who else?

                          EMILY
              So you're the vampire girl.

                                                         69.



                          BELLA                                 
              And you're a... you're all...                     

                          EMILY                                 
              Werewolves? I'm just engaged to one.              
              But these animals --                              
                   (slaps Embry's hand)                         
              Save some for your brothers.                      

Bella cautiously approaches the counter, keeping an eye on      
the door for Jacob.                                             

                          EMILY                                 
              Leave it to Jacob to get around Sam's
              gag order.
                          BELLA                                 
              He didn't say anything, or...                     
              couldn't.                                         

                          EMBRY                                 
              That's a wolf thing. Alpha's orders               
              get obeyed whether we want to or not --           

                          JARED                                 
              How `bout you shut up now, Embry?                 

                          EMBRY                                 
              You know Jacob's gonna fill her in.               

                          JARED                                 
              Yeah, I know every stupid thought he              
              has.                                              
                   (to Bella)                                   
              Wanna know what he thinks of you?                 

                          EMILY                                 
              Like you need special powers to know              
              that.                                             

                          EMBRY                                 
                   (to Bella)                                   
              It's another wolf thing. We hear each             
              other's thoughts. Good for hunting.               
              Embarrassing for everything else.                 

Jared leans to Bella, challenging.                              

                          JARED                                 
              Freaking out yet?                                 

                                                         70.



                          BELLA                                 
                   (meets his look)                             
              You're not the first -- mind reader               
              I've met.                                         

                          EMBRY                                 
                   (grins)                                      
              Jake's right. You are good with the               
              weird.                                            

                          BELLA                                 
              But I don't get -- how?   Why? --                 

                          SAM (O.S.)                            
              -- Because there are bad things here.             
She spins - Sam is now standing behind her, the front door      
open behind him.                                                

                          SAM                                   
              And they're getting worse.                        

Bella is chilled. Sam moves past her to Emily - the sight       
of her instantly warms his face.                                

                          SAM
              Hey, Em.

He kisses Emily's scarred face adoringly. Bella has to look     
away. Their utter devotion is a painful reminder of what
she has lost. Fortunately, she's distracted by --

Jacob and Paul's arrival. They laugh and jab one another.
Bella is relieved to find Jacob unscathed. Jared and Embry
crowd them, finding a scar on Paul's arm --

                           EMBRY
              Ha!   Pay up.
As Jared reluctantly hands Embry five bucks, Jacob's eyes       
find Bella's. He nods solemnly to the door; we should talk.     

EXT. LA PUSH - CLIFFS - DAWN

The sun is just beginning to rise, reddening the clouds         
overhead. Bella paces by the cliff's edge, trying to come       
to grips with this new reality. Jacob keeps his distance,       
trying to control his anger.                                    

                          BELLA                                 
              You just have to... stop.                         

                                                         71.



                          JACOB                                 
              It's not a life-style choice.   It's in           
              my DNA.                                           

                          BELLA                                 
              Killing is in your DNA?                           

                          JACOB                                 
              Man, I thought maybe you wouldn't be              
              such a hypocrite -- what, I'm not the             
              right kind of monster for you? Can't              
              measure up to your bloodsucking                   
              friends --                                        

                          BELLA                                 
                   (angry as well)                              
              Hey, they manage to survive without               
              hurting innocent people.                          

Jacob stops -- a beat as his anger is replaced by confusion.    

                          JACOB                                 
              Wait - innocent? -- so... you don't               
              care that I morph into a giant dog.               
              Just that I... kill people?

              "Just?" Those hikers' lives mean that             
              little to you?                                    

He bursts out laughing.                                         

                         BELLA                                  
                   (repelled, turns to go)                      
              Oh my God.

              We're not killing hikers.   We're                 
              trying to protect them.

              Vampires? Jake, no --

                   (steps back, bitter)
              Don't worry, we can't touch your
              precious Cullens - unless they bite
              someone and violate the Treaty --

                          BELLA
              That's not what I -- you can't fight
              vampires. They're too dangerous.

                          JACOB
              Please. We took out that leech with
              the dreads easy enough.

                          BELLA                                
              You... killed Laurent?                           
                          JACOB                                
                   (worried)                                   
              ... He didn't seem like a friend.                

                            BELLA                              
              No, God no.    But... how?                       

                          JACOB
              It's what we do, why we exist. A few             
              "lucky guys" in the tribe have the               
              gene. If a bloodsucker moves to town,
              our DNA kicks in, we reach the right
              age and the fever hits --                        

                         BELLA
                   (realizing)
              "Mono."

                          JACOB
              I wish. Next thing I know, they're
              telling me, this is your life now. That
              future you saw for yourself? Gone.

Desolation fills him.   She sees this.

                          BELLA
              It's bad, huh?

                          JACOB
              I just hate feeling... out of control.
              Like maybe Sam is right; you shouldn't           
              be around me.

                          BELLA
              Like you could get rid of me.

                                                         73.



                          JACOB
              You've seen Emily.                                

That lands with her.   She nods.                                

                          JACOB                                 
              Sam lost it for a split second; Em was            
              standing too close -- he's still messed
              up about it.
                   (beat)                                       
              I don't want to be that kind of
              nightmare.

                          BELLA
              You're not like that. You save                    
              people, right? You saved me from                  
              Laurent.

                          JACOB
              Yeah, didn't mind taking him out. His             
              red-headed girlfriend will be fun,
              too.

Bella stops, chilled to the bone.

                             BELLA
              Victoria.     She's here?

                          JACOB
              We chased her all the way to the
              border the other night. But she won't
              stay gone. Keeps coming back -- if we
              knew what she was after...
                   (sees Bella's face)
              ... What?

                          BELLA
              I know what she wants.      Me.

EXT. FOREST HIGHWAY - DAY                                       

A MASERATI with Canadian plates blasts down the highway at a    
blinding speed --

INT. MASERATI - SAME

CLOSE ON VICTORIA, easily controlling the steering wheel
with two fingers. She speaks to someone we don't see, her
words laced with longing and fury.

                                                            74.



                          VICTORIA
              James hated cars. He liked being
              close to the ground. But I'd steal                   
              one occasionally, to throw him off the
              scent... See, we played hide and seek
              sometimes. No one can hide like me --                
                   (grins to her passenger)
              -- but no one could seek like James.

INCLUDE her barely conscious passenger, DENISE, 30's, a
pretty bleach-blonde with expensive jewelry. She's just
coming to, a bump on her head where she was knocked out.

                          DENISE
              What -- what are you -- ?
                            VICTORIA
              Some games   lasted months... but we
              always got   hungry for each other.
                   (sly,   to Denise)
              So I'd let   him find me...

Denise now lucid, looks around to SEE --                           

IN THE BACK SEAT her husband, MICHAEL'S BODY, well-dressed
in a turtle neck, 40's, sits upright, his head tilted
forward as if he's resting. Denise reaches for him --

                            DENISE
              Michael?    Oh my God --

                          VICTORIA
              We never could get enough of each
              other...
                   (seething)
              We would have had forever to try.

Denise, scared, shakes Michael's arm --
                           DENISE
              Michael?!

-- which causes Michael's head to roll to the side,
revealing his gouged, blood-soaked neck and his vacant, dead
eyes. Denise starts SCREAMING. Victoria grins.

                          VICTORIA
              James always loved a screamer.

Victoria's hand jets out, grabbing a fistful of Denise's
hair. She yanks Denise over, exposing her neck just as we --

                                                     SMASH TO:

EXT. EMILY'S BACKYARD - DAY                                       

ON JARED --                                                       

                          JARED
              Excellent. If the redhead's after
              Bella, we've got bait.

With stunning speed, Jacob grabs a four-pronged spading fork
from some garden tools, and FLINGS it toward Jared's head -
Jared easily, and amazingly, catches it.

                          JACOB
              She is not bait.

INCLUDE - A picnic table in the middle of this small,             
quaintly landscaped garden. Jacob, Bella, Embry, Paul, Sam,
Jared and Emily are in the midst of a huge breakfast.

                          BELLA
              I should leave town.                                

                          SAM
              Victoria will follow you and make it                
              harder for us to catch her.

                          BELLA                                   
              No one can catch her.   She can escape              
              anything.                                           

                           PAUL                                   
              Ooh.   She has special powers.                      

                          BELLA                                   
              Some of them do.                                    

They all look at her.   She instantly regrets saying it.          
                          JACOB                                   
              Like... what? Bella?                                

                          JARED                                   
              The mind reader you said you knew. He               
              was a suckhead? Can they all do that?               

                          EMBRY                                   
              That would blow.                                    

                          BELLA                                   
              No, I -- shouldn't have - no.                       

                          PAUL                                    
              She's still protecting them.                        

                                                               76.



                           JARED                                      
               I don't know why. It's not like they                   
               stuck around to protect you --                         

                           JACOB                                      
               Guys, back off.                                        

Jacob looks apologetically at Bella.   She shrinks, stung.            

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                            

Jacob walks her to the door.                                          

                           JACOB                                      
               Don't worry, we've got this place                      
               covered. She won't get near you or                     
               Charlie.                                               

Bella nods.   He sees she's blue.                                     

                           JACOB                                      
               Hey, we should do something fun.                       
               Like... cliff diving, right?                           

                           BELLA                                      
               I could use the rush.                                  

                            JACOB                                     
               Soon.   After we catch her.                            

He offers a reassuring look before jogging into the woods.            

EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - NIGHT                                             

Bella tentatively approaches the large, modern glass home.            
She climbs the porch steps, approaches the door...                    

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT
Bella enters to find it perfectly intact, lived-in, warm,             
candles glowing... and the Cullen family enjoying the
evening - Carlisle, Esme, Rosalie, Emmett and Jasper.                 

Bella is overwhelmed with joy at seeing them.                         

                           BELLA                                      
               You're here.                                           

But they ignore her. Won't even look at her.      She starts          
toward them but suddenly --                                           

Edward appears and YANKS Bella away, pulling her to the door          
and pushing her out, slamming it on her --                            

                                                           77.



EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

continue to ignore her as they gather around Edward --            

INT. BELLA'S ROOM - MORNING                                       

Bella awakens, tears on her face. She can't take it. Gets         
the hell out of bed, anxious to leave the dream behind. But       
it stays with her...                                              

EXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY                                          

Bella knocks on the door, rain falling around her, wind           
blowing strong. Emily opens the door. Sees her.                   
                           EMILY                                  
              Bella.   Are you okay?                              

                          BELLA                                   
              Yeah, I just... is Jacob here?   He                 
              wasn't at home...                                   

Sam appears behind Emily.                                         

                          SAM                                     
              He's with Jared and Embry, keeping an               
              eye on things. I'm heading out soon.                
              Should I tell him something?                        

-- as Sam wraps an arm around Emily. Their deep love is           
achingly obvious. Off Bella's face --                             

FLASHPOP to Bella and Edward at her birthday party, in a          
similar embrace, as Alice SNAPS their picture --

              You want to come in?                                

-- But Bella's already hurrying to her truck, determination       
on her face.

who checks it, then notes the position of the SIX MEN in his
hunting party, all wearing rain gear. He SEES Harry at the
end of the line, pausing, looking down.

                          CHARLIE
              You got something, Harry?

                                                           78.



ON HARRY - he looks down at a large WOLF PAW PRINT.

                          HARRY CLEARWATER
              Nope, nothin'.

The hunting party moves forward.   Harry lets them get ahead,
stomps out the paw print.

ON CHARLIE as he passes under a huge tree --

WHIP PAN UP THE TREE to find that HIGH ABOVE, crouching on a
limb, is VICTORIA. She watches Charlie with a vengeful glare.

She noiselessly SWINGS down to a lower branch, getting ready
to pounce on Charlie --
ON HARRY - his eye catches her movement; he looks up, SEES
the back of her red head -- his breath CATCHES --

She HEARS the sound, even through the rain and wind.    Before    
Harry can raise his shotgun --

Victoria's standing next to him, WHIPPING the gun out of his      
hands with superhuman speed. He GASPS, breath stuck in his        
chest. She grins, about to bite -- but suddenly --                

THE RUSSET-BROWN JACOB-WOLF smashes into her, knocking her        
away. She rights herself immediately and takes off --             

THE THREE WOLVES give chase, disappearing. It all happened        
soundlessly, in seconds, unbeknownst to the others...

STAY ON HARRY - he still can't catch his breath, IN SLOW
MOTION he clasps his left arm -- INTERCUT WITH --

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS - SAME

LIGHTNING FAST CUTS of THE CHASE - the wolves are right on
Victoria's tail, blasting through the forest --

BACK ON CHARLIE - SLOW MOTION - He turns to SEE Harry
clutching his chest. Charlie runs to Harry's side --

SMASH BACK TO VICTORIA escaping at breakneck speed she
bursts out of the trees to --                                     

EXT. THE OCEAN (CONTINUOUS) - SAME

-- Victoria beelines for the choppy water, dives in -- when
she reappears, she's hundreds of yards offshore --

THE WOLVES prowl the beach in frustration as we go --

                                                              79.



BACK ON HARRY - SLOW MOTION - he falls to his knees just as
Charlie reaches him. Off Charlie beginning CPR...

                                                     SMASH TO:

EXT. LA PUSH - CLIFFS - DAY

Bella's truck comes to a stop; she climbs out. Ignoring the
wind and rain, she strides to the cliff's edge; looks down --

BELLA'S POV - THE WATER - steely gray.     Rough whitecaps.

                           EDWARD (O.S.)                             
              Step back.                                             

Bella smiles, tears of relief springing to her eyes.    She          
turns to find Edward's apparition at her side.                       

She steps back from the cliff's edge - which causes him to           
disappear.                                                           

That's it. She starts pulling off her shoes and coat,                
adrenaline pumping --                                                

Edward's apparition reappears, but she keeps going --                

                          EDWARD                                     
              Stop this now, Bella.                                  

                          BELLA                                      
              You won't stay with me any other way.                  

She takes a last look at him... then with a running leap --          
FLINGS herself over the edge --                                      

ON BELLA SCREAMING with exhilaration as she plummets down,           
down... then SPLASHES into the water.                                
EXT. ON THE WATER'S SURFACE (CONTINUOUS) - DAY                       

No sign of Bella. A beat. Suddenly, she POPS back up.
Inhales deeply -- and laughs!

                           BELLA
              Yes!

She enjoys a moment of elation and empowerment... then turns
to swim ashore... but her smile falters when she realizes
how strong the current is...

A WAVE crashes over her head. She gasps for breath.     Then         
ANOTHER WAVE hits her. Starts to pull her under...

                                                           80.



UNDER THE WATER - Bella struggles --

ABOVE WATER - she pops up, looks around in a panic, SEES --

BELLA'S POV - IN THE DISTANCE - something orange-ish,
bobbing on the surface of the water --

Bella goes down - then comes up again - THE ORANGE-ISH thing
is suddenly thirty yards closer.

Bella struggles to stay afloat but the current SMASHES her
into a rock, the air goes out of her chest. She sinks.

ANGLE ON THE ORANGE-ISH THING -- IT'S VICTORIA, floating
effortlessly, hungry anticipation on her face. She dips
below the surface, vanishing...
UNDER THE WATER - BELLA SINKS, struggling at first... Edward      
appears in front of her, his eyes full of longing and love.
He reaches to her, she to him, hands almost touching, things
going dark... suddenly A HAND GRABS HER COLLAR --

                                                   SMASH TO:

EXT. BEACH - DAY

CLOSE ON BELLA - barely conscious.

                          JACOB
              Breathe, Bella! C'mon!

Jacob hits her on the back.   She spits up water, coming to.

                           JACOB
              Bella?   Can you hear me?

                          BELLA
              ... Jake?
She focuses, finally SEES Jacob hovering over her, relieved.
Behind him stands Sam.

                          SAM
              She'll be alright.

Sam looks out at the water, scanning it.   Sensing something.

                          JACOB
              What the hell were you thinking?

                          BELLA
              I needed... to see... something.

                                                         81.



                           JACOB
               What? The pearly gates?   If we hadn't
               heard you scream --

                           SAM
               Get her home. I'm heading to the                 
               hospital. I'll meet you there.                   

Jacob nods.   Sam jogs off.

                           JACOB
               Why would you jump? Didn't you notice
               it's like a hurricane out here?

                           BELLA
               I know. It was stupid --                         
                    (realizing)
               -- Sam said hospital - someone's hurt?

                           JACOB
               Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.

                           BELLA
               Oh my God - does my Dad know?

                           JACOB
               He and my dad are both over there.

                           BELLA
               Will Harry be okay?

                           JACOB
               I don't know. Come on. I'll find you
               something dry and drive you home.

As Jacob helps Bella up, we RACK FOCUS out to --

ANGLE ON THE WATER - where Victoria bobs, watching Jacob
guide Bella away... then she disappears below the surface.

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT

Jacob drives. Bella wears a fleece jacket but still
shivers. He pulls her close, wrapping an arm around her --

                           JACOB
               Hundred and eight degrees over here.

She tucks herself into him.

                           BELLA
               Must be nice, never getting cold.

                                                         82.



                           JACOB
               It's a wolf thing.

                           BELLA                                
               It's a Jacob thing.   You're just...             
               warm.                                            

                           JACOB                                
                    (grins)                                     
               Like the sun.                                    

                           BELLA                                
                    (meaning it)                                
               Like the sun.                                    

                           JACOB                                
               Which always comes back.   You can               
               count on me.                                     

She nods.   Awkward silence.   He fills it.                     

                           JACOB                                
               There are other cool things about all            
               this, like -- I heal fast. Wanna see             
               me stab my hand?

                           BELLA
                    (no!)
               Yeah, `cause that would be fun.                  

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE/INT. TRUCK (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

The truck pulls up to the curb. It's pitch black outside.
Jacob's still holding her close as he shuts the engine off.

                           BELLA                                
               So... this wolf thing's not all bad?             
                           JACOB                                
               It's better. Now that you know.                  
               But...                                           

                            BELLA                               
               ... but...                                       

                           JACOB                                
               It just... comes so easily to me.                
               More than the other guys.                        

                           BELLA                                
               That's a good thing, isn't it?                   

                                                         83.



                          JACOB                                  
              Maybe. Or maybe it makes me less...                
              human than the others.
                   (beat, quieter)
              Sometimes I'm scared I might...                    
              disappear, you know? Who I really am.              

Bella faces him, looks directly in his eyes.

                          BELLA
              I won't let that happen.

Their faces are close... and stay close for an intimate
beat. They could kiss, their lips near... but Bella blinks
herself back to reality and pulls away.
                          BELLA
              Thanks for driving - for everything.

-- as she pushes open her door. WIND wafts in -- Jacob
reacts to a repugnant smell outside --

                          JACOB
              Holy crap -- !

He abruptly pulls Bella back into the truck, SLAMS her door
shut and starts the truck.

                          JACOB
              There's a bloodsucker out there.

                          BELLA
              How do you know?

                          JACOB
              I can smell the stink.   I'm getting               
              you out of here.
As Jacob whips the truck around, the HEADLIGHTS ILLUMINATE --

BELLA'S POV - THE DRIVEWAY -- a black Mercedes is parked in
front. Bella spins to the rear window as Jacob floors it --

                           BELLA
              Stop!   It's not Victoria --

                          JACOB
              Forget it --

                          BELLA
              It's Carlisle's car!   They're here.               
              Go back! --

                                                          84.



                          JACOB
              It's a trick --

He's still flooring it -- Bella cracks her door open while
they're moving - he SLAMS on the brakes. She jumps out --

                          JACOB
              Damn it, Bella --

EXT. ROAD (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

Bella hurries up the road toward her house. Jacob's
suddenly standing in front of her, furious --

                           JACOB
              Stop.   You gotta come with me.                    
                           BELLA
              It's okay.   They're my friends --

                          JACOB
              Don't you get it? If a Cullen is back
              here, this is their territory. The Treaty
              says we can only defend our own lands.             

                          BELLA
              -- It's not a war --

                         JACOB
              It is. And you'll only be safe in La
              Push. I can't protect you here anymore.            

                          BELLA
              I don't need you to --

                          JACOB
              -- You're about to cross a line --
                          BELLA
              Only if you draw one.                              

She starts to move past him, but he stops her --                 

                          JACOB                                  
              I'm not letting you do this.                       

                          BELLA                                  
              You don't have a choice.   I don't                 
              belong to you.                                     

Her words are a knife to the heart. She sees that, but           
can't take them back. He hands her the keys.                     

                                                          85.



                          JACOB
              Bye, Bella, I hope you don't die.

She flinches at the stinging remark. He disappears into the
darkness, leaving her alone on the dark road.

She's closer to her house than her truck. She hurries
forward. The NIGHT SOUNDS start to encroach, branches
crackling, bushes rustling. She glances behind her...
nothing but darkness... she faces forward again ---

And runs directly into a VAMPIRE! Bella SCREAMS -- then
realizes IT'S ALICE. Bella is stunned. So is Alice.

                           BELLA
              Alice!
                          ALICE
              You're... alive.

She's clearly confused, but Bella hugs her with tears of joy.

                          BELLA
              Oh my God, Alice.    You're here.

                          ALICE
              I heard voices - I didn't think it was
              you but - you're alive.

                          BELLA
              You keep saying that.

                          ALICE
              I saw you - a vision of you - you
              jumped off a cliff. I knew I'd be too
              late but --                                        
                   (becoming angry)
              Why the hell would you try to kill
              yourself?!

                            BELLA
              I didn't.    I was cliff diving.

                           ALICE
              Why?!

                           BELLA
              Um... fun?

                          ALICE
              That was fun for you.

                                                        86.



                          BELLA
              Until I hit the water.

                          ALICE
              I have never met anyone more prone to
              life-threatening idiocy... and what is
              that hideous wet dog smell?                      

                         BELLA
              Oh. Probably Jacob.      He's kind of a          
              werewolf.

Off Alice's horrified expression.

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
As Bella makes herself hot chocolate, Alice paces.

                          BELLA
              Werewolves are not vicious.

                          ALICE
              Until they lose their tempers.

                          BELLA
              They saved me from Laurent, they're
              protecting me from Victoria --

                          ALICE
                   (shocked)
              Victoria? I didn't see her. I didn't             
              see you get pulled from the water                
              either.                                          

                          BELLA
              It was Jacob who saved me. More than             
              once. I couldn't have made it without            
              him. You have no idea what it was                
              like.

                          ALICE
                   (softening)
              Yes. I do. I knew leaving wouldn't               
              be good for you. I tried to tell
              Edward, but he wouldn't listen.

                          BELLA
                   (hesitantly)
              ... Does he know you're here?

                           ALICE
              No.   He's been... away...

                                                          87.



INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - RIO DE JANEIRO - DAY                   

A dump, empty but for a table and chair. On the table lie        
THE PHOTOS that once lined Bella's walls. Edward stands in       
the center of the room, stock still, staring out at the          
rising sun. His face is as empty and desolate as Bella's         
was after he left.

A CELL PHONE on the table RINGS jarringly. He doesn't move.      
It continues. Finally, he whips the receiver to his ear,
exasperated.

                            EDWARD
                 What?

                             ROSALIE (O.S.)
                 Wow, Edward finally answered the
                 phone. I feel so honored...                     

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. TANYA'S ALASKAN HOME - DAY

Rosalie, on the phone, stands at the picture window --

ROSALIE'S POV - EXT. ALASKAN HOUSE - Emmett, Jasper,
Carlisle and Esme walk away from the house, over the snow to     
the treeline, on their way to hunt. None wear coats.             

                             EDWARD
                 I'm hanging up now...

Rosalie turns away from the window.

                             ROSALIE
                 Wait!... You should come home.                  
                      (no response)
                 Esme's a wreck, Carlisle never smiles.          
                 Even Emmett's depressed. You've
                 really done a number on them.

                             EDWARD                              
                      (pained)                                   
                 I'm sorry. I am. But they wouldn't              
                 be happier with me around. Trust me.            

                             ROSALIE
                 I... I just miss... us.   The family.           

                             EDWARD                              
                 I know. But the further away I am,              
                 the safer Bella will be. She deserves           
                 a shot at a normal life --                      

                                                            88.



                          ROSALIE
              But see, you don't have to worry about               
              that, not anymore --

She stops realizing she may be making a mistake.     But Edward    
caught it, sits up.

                           EDWARD
              Why, Rose?   Did something happen?

                           ROSALIE
              I - uh --

                          EDWARD
              Tell me, Rosalie.
                   (rises, fierce)
              Tell me! --

                          ROSALIE
                   (blurts)
              -- Alice had a vision. She saw Bella -               
              - throw herself off a cliff... She's
              dead, Edward.

Edward reels, uncomprehending.                                     

                          EDWARD                                   
              I... don't believe it.                               

                          ROSALIE                                  
              Alice is there now. Thought she could                
              help with the funeral or something.                  

STAY ON ROSALIE as --                                              

                          ROSALIE                                  
              Come home, Edward. It's time...                      
              Edward...?                                           
She's been disconnected.   Off Rosalie, worried...                 

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY                                           

Bella walks Charlie to his cruiser. He wears a dark, ill-
fitting funeral suit. At the car, Bella adjusts his tie --

                          CHARLIE
              Thanks for understanding, Bells. They                
              wanted to keep the service small.

                          BELLA
              Don't worry about me.    Are you gonna               
              be okay?

                                                           89.



                          CHARLIE
              Yeah... but Sue, and those kids --
              Leah's only a year older than you.
              And Seth's, what, fourteen...

Emotion threatens. She hugs him. He holds on a little too
tightly for a beat. Then he bucks up, climbs into his car.

                          CHARLIE
              There'll be a reception after. I
              might stay late, see if I can help.

Bella nods, then waves as he drives away. She turns to head
back inside but finds Alice suddenly at her side. She jumps.

                          ALICE
              You're not going?

                          BELLA
              I'm not the most popular person on the
              werewolf rez right now.

                          ALICE
                   (saddened)                                     
              Because you're friends with me.                     

Bella shrugs. Alice hears something, then looks down the          
road -- JACOB'S RABBIT appears in the distance....

                          ALICE
              Huh. Didn't see them coming. Didn't                 
              see him pull you out of the water -                 
              maybe my visions are allergic to dogs.              

                           BELLA
               -- Alice.

                          ALICE
                   (jogging off)
              I'll go do some hunting.

ANGLE ON THE RABBIT -- as it pulls up. Jacob drives, Embry in
the passenger seat. Bella approaches, surprised to find QUIL
in the back; same short hair and hard look as the others.

                          BELLA
              Quil... you, too?                                   

                         QUIL
                   (aggressive)                                   
              Yeah. Me, too.                                      

Jacob climbs out.   Embry takes the driver's seat.

                                                               90.



                           JACOB
              You alone?

                           BELLA
              Yes.   Shouldn't you be at the funeral?

                          JACOB
              Had to talk to you first.
                   (to the guys)
              I'll meet you there. Go on.

They're wary... but pull out.      Jacob follows Bella into --

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Jacob enters behind Bella.   She turns to him...
                          BELLA
              Look, Jake, I'm sorry I --

                          JACOB
              This place stinks to hell.

She sees he's shut down, cold.      She shuts down, as well.

                          BELLA
              You're welcome to leave.      In fact --

                          JACOB
              -- How many Cullens are here and how
              long are they staying?

                          BELLA
                   (snapping back)                                    
              Just Alice. And she'll stay as long
              as she wants.

                          JACOB
              Are the rest coming back?

                          BELLA
              Not that I'm aware of.      Anything else?

                           JACOB
              That's it.

                          BELLA
              Better go report to Sam.

Jacob turns, starts to leave. He looks back, sees her anger
turn to hurt. He stops. Beat.

                                                             91.



                           JACOB
               I've done it again. I keep breaking                  
               my promise not to hurt you.                          

                           BELLA
               It doesn't have to be this way.

He moves back to her, looks into her eyes with sadness.

                           JACOB
               Yeah, it does.

                           BELLA
               Am I gonna lose you this time, Jacob?

He can't answer that, but he presses his hand to her cheek.
                           JACOB
               It was easier when we were both human,
               wasn't it?

They look at one another, Jacob's hand still on her face,           
his eyes searching hers.

Slowly, he starts to bend toward her lips. She doesn't pull         
away. She misses him too much, needs him too badly. This            
time, she'll let it happen. A kiss is a centimeter away...          

Suddenly, the shrill RING of the phone makes them both jump.        
Jacob, the closest to it, doesn't move his face, just keeps         
looking into her eyes as he reaches for the phone, answers --       

                           JACOB                                    
               Swan residence.                                      

She smiles.   But he instantly bristles, voice going cold.          

                           JACOB                                    
               He's not here. He's at a funeral...                  

Then the phone goes dead --                                         

INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - RIO DE JANEIRO - SAME                     

-- Edward stares at his phone crazed, enraged, grief-               
stricken -- he HURLS it against the wall, shattering it.            

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME                             

-- Jacob hangs up the phone.                                        

                           JACOB                                    
               Filthy bloodsucker.                                  

                                                            92.



                          BELLA                                    
              Wait, who was it?                                    

                          JACOB                                    
                   (spitting it out)                               
              Dr. Carlisle Cullen.                                 

                          BELLA                                    
              You should have let me talk to him.                  

                          JACOB                                    
              He didn't ask for you --                             

Suddenly, Jacob's eyes go wild, his body stiffens, starts          
trembling in the way that precedes a wolf-morph.
                          JACOB
              Step away from me, Bella.

Bella turns to see what he's reacting to - Alice. She
stands in doorway looking empty, despairing. Bella                 
immediately hurries to her side.                                   

                          BELLA
              Alice, what's wrong?

                            ALICE
              ... Edward.

                          BELLA
              What about him? What happened?

                          ALICE
              I just saw him in a vision.   He...                  
              thinks you're dead.

                          BELLA                                    
                   (realizing)                                     
              That was him calling, not Carlisle.                  

                          ALICE                                    
              Bella, he's going to Italy... to the                 
              Volturi...

OFF BELLA'S FACE -- FLASHPOPS of the CIRCULAR HALL, the            
THREE VOLTURI - the DISMEMBERING of the rogue vampire --           

                                                    SMASH TO:

INT. BELLA'S ROOM - DAY

The door SLAMS open and Bella races in, shoving clothes into
a bag. Jacob dogs her, protesting.

                                                                 93.



                            JACOB
                Why do you have to go?

                            BELLA
                He won't believe Alice.    He has to see                
                that I'm alive.                                         

                            JACOB
                     (stops her)
                He left you, Bella. He didn't want
                you anymore, remember?

                            BELLA
                But I still love him, and I'm not gonna
                let him kill himself out of guilt.
This wounds him. But she can't stop to soothe him.         She
pulls away and continues packing.

                            JACOB
                What about your dad?

                            BELLA
                I'm eighteen, legally free to go.
                I'll leave a note.                                      

Alice enters.

                            ALICE
                Got the airline tickets.

                            JACOB
                     (squaring off with Alice)
                You Cullens might hunt animals but
                those monsters in Italy don't.                          

                            ALICE
                I'm well aware what the Volturi are.
                            JACOB
                Then why are you taking Bella to them
                like a bottle of wine to a party?

                            ALICE
                Right, she's better off here with
                Victoria stalking her. The one you
                dogs can't seem to catch?

Jacob growls, a shudder ripping through him. Bella
intercedes, stopping him from morphing by grabbing Alice.

                            BELLA
                Let's go.

                                                            94.



EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY

Alice flies to her car. But Jacob catches Bella's arm, not
hostile. Just pleading.

                          JACOB
              Please, Bella. Stay here.   For                      
              Charlie... for me.

Bella sees the love in his eyes; this could be last time she
ever sees him. She hugs him, then pulls away.

                            BELLA
              Bye, Jacob.

He watches, agonized as she races to the car, climbs in...
INT. THE MERCEDES (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

Bella tries to pull on her seat belt but Alice stops her --

                          ALICE
              Maybe Jacob's right.                                 
                   (Bella tries to                                 
                    interrupt)                                     
              No. You need to realize - the Volturi                
              could easily see me as Edward's
              accomplice. And you're a human who
              knows too much and tastes too good.
              They could kill us all.

Bella's response is to yank her seat belt into its clip.           
Alice sees she won't change her mind. She shifts into gear         
and PEELS OUT. Bella looks out the window for Jacob; he's          
not there... she turns toward the woods --                         

BELLA'S POV -- THE TREELINE -- SHREDDED CLOTHING FLIES in the
air as we SEE the HIND LEGS OF A WOLF disappear into the
forest. Off Bella, fighting tears but determined as hell...        

INT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT                                  

ON EDWARD walking down a seemingly endless corridor.
Finally, he reaches a set of intricately carved double doors
which open for him. He enters --

INT. CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

-- Edward finds himself facing three wooden thrones, on
which sit the ancient Volturi: Aro, Marcus, Caius.                 

Aro wears an expensive, contemporary, black Italian suit,          
long black hair in a loose ponytail to his waist.

                                                          95.


Marcus and Caius eschew modern clothing for rich silk robes,
their long hair loose around them. All three have
translucent, onion-like, white skin.

                          EDWARD
              Have you decided?

                          ARO
              It was an intriguing debate.     We don't
              get many suicidal vampires.

                           CAIUS
              Pathetic.

                          ARO
              I'm afraid your gifts are too valuable
              to destroy. But if you're unhappy
              with your lot, join us. We'd be
              delighted to utilize your skills.

                          EDWARD
              So you won't end this.

                          MARCUS
              Not without cause.

Edward registers this, his face setting. Clearly, he's           
going to give them cause. He strides out. Off Aro...             

                          ARO
              Such a waste.

EXT. FLORENCE AIRPORT, ITALY - MORNING

Bella waits impatiently at the curb as --                        

A YELLOW HARD-TOP PORSCHE with darkly tinted windows
SCREECHES to a halt in front of her. The passenger door          
opens - Alice is behind the wheel, pulling off the chic,         
white, hooded coat she used for protection against the sun.      
As Bella climbs in, buckles up --                                

                          BELLA
              Where'd you get the car?

                          ALICE
              Hope you're not opposed to grand theft
              auto.

                           BELLA
              Not today.

Alice FLOORS it and the Porsche PEELS OUT --

                                                            96.



EXT. TUSCAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

AERIAL VIEW - THE YELLOW PORSCHE screams down a highway,
cutting lanes, weaving through Peugots and Fiats --

INT. PORSCHE - DAY

Bella grips the dashboard as Alice narrowly misses a car.

                          BELLA
              How much time do we have.                            

                          ALICE (O.S.)                             
              He's waiting till noon, when the sun's               
              at its highest...                                    
                                                   SMASH TO:       

EXT. VOLTERRA - PALAZZO DEI PRIORI - DAY (ALICE'S VISION)

It's jumpy, uneven -- EDWARD stands in shadow, his shirt
open, eyes shut. A clock GONGS as he steps into SUNLIGHT --

                          ALICE                                    
              ... He's going to make the Volturi                   
              change their minds.                                  

INT. PORSCHE - SAME                                                

                          BELLA
                   (checking her watch)
              It's almost noon now.

                          ALICE
              There's Volterra.

Alice punches it as Bella SEES --
BELLA'S POV - A MEDIEVAL FORTIFIED VILLAGE atop a distant
hill. Volterra.

EXT. VOLTERRA - DAY

The narrow, centuries-old streets are crowded with festival
revellers who all wear RED. They gaily head toward the town
square carrying red pendants, balloons, scarves. The
PORSCHE weaves through them, hurrying forward.

INTERCUT INSIDE THE PORSCHE --

                          BELLA
              Why are they all wearing red?

                                                          97.



                          ALICE
              San Marcos Day festival. The perfect               
              setting. Large crowds. The Volturi                 
              won't let him get far enough to reveal             
              himself - he's counting on that.                   

                          BELLA
              We only have five minutes --

Alice screeches to a halt at a ROAD BLOCK.   Italian POLICE      
wave her back. Bella jumps out --

                          BELLA
              Where's the square?

                          ALICE
              Follow that lane --

-- Bella's already running --

                          ALICE
              He'll be under the clock tower!

Alice watches her go... then senses something, looks up --

ALICE'S POV - ON THE ROOFTOPS - A FIGURE IN A BLACK HOODED
OVERCOAT leaps from building to building, tracking Bella.
As he disappears, off Alice --

EXT. VOLTERRA ALLEYS - SERIES OF FAST CUTS - DAY

Bella races down the cobble-stoned alleys, stumbling on the
uneven stones. Festival revellers head in the same
direction, she maneuvers around them.

ABOVE BELLA - SEE flashes of the FIGURE IN THE OVERCOAT --

As Bella nears the square, the alleys become more populated.
She pushes past people AD LIBBING "excuse me," "sorry."
Finally, she emerges into --

EXT. PALAZZO DEI PRIORI (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

BELLA'S POV - a sea of scarlet flags, dresses and jackets.
On the other side of the crowded square - THE CLOCK TOWER;
it reads one minute before noon.

Bella battles her way through the square; the crowd shoves
back, shouting at her in Italian --

                          ITALIAN MAN
              Fare attenzione!

                                                            98.



Bella charges forward to find herself blocked by --

A FOUNTAIN - Suddenly, GONG!    The clock tower bells chime.
It's noon!

Bella jumps into the fountain, wades through the shallow
water to the other side -- she jumps out and barrels through
the crowd. Finally, she SEES --

BELLA'S POV - BENEATH THE CLOCK TOWER

Edward, in the shadows, just inches from the sunlight.

                            BELLA
              Edward! --
-- GONG! Bella's cry is drowned out by the BOOMING CHIME.
She pushes toward him, fighting to reach him as --

CLOSE ON EDWARD (IN SLOW MOTION) - as he unbuttons his
shirt, exposing his bare chest --

ON BELLA (IN SLOW MOTION) - calling his name --

ON EDWARD'S FACE - he closes his eyes, welcoming death --
then slowly --

Edward takes a step into the sunlight, the rays hitting his        
shoe, but before the sun touches his skin --                       

BELLA SLAMS into him - it's like running into a brick wall --      

                            BELLA
              No, Edward!    Don't!

Edward opens his eyes and looks at Bella as the clock booms
its final CHIME. He's amazed, already dead in his mind.            
                          EDWARD                                   
              Carlisle was right... heaven...                      

                          BELLA                                    
              No, I'm here. I'm alive.                             

                          EDWARD
                   (confused)                                      
              You're... not real.

                            BELLA
              Look at me!    Alice was wrong.                      

He begins to realize... she is real.

                                                            99.



                          EDWARD
              Bella?

                          BELLA
              Please, step back.   I'm alive, I'm --

He suddenly kisses her, stepping back into the shade with
her. They soak each other in like starved people suddenly
nourished. He pulls away to look at her...

                          EDWARD
              You're here.

                          BELLA
              I'm here.
They share a long look, he's about to kiss her again... when
suddenly, he stiffens -- and abruptly PUSHES Bella behind
him, taking a protective stance in front of her --

They face the DARK ALLEY that runs under the clock tower.
Out of the alley's shadows emerge --

TWO FIGURES IN HOODED OVERCOATS. Both stunningly handsome
males in their 20's: FELIX, huge, strong; and DEMETRI,             
slender, elegant. Both have unsettling burgundy red EYES.

                          EDWARD
              I won't be needing your services after
              all, gentlemen.

                          FELIX
              Aro wants to speak with you again.

                          EDWARD
              No rules were broken.                                

Demetri's smile suggests he doesn't agree. He's the more
gracious of the two. But no less dangerous.

                          DEMETRI
              We should take this conversation to a
              more appropriate venue.

                          EDWARD
              Fine. Bella, why don't you stay and                  
              enjoy the festival?                                  

                          FELIX
              The girl comes with us.

                          EDWARD
              That's not going to happen --                        

                                                         100.



ALICE suddenly appears, lightly tripping through the alley       
toward them, pulling back the hood of her white swing coat.

                          ALICE
              Come on, guys, it's a festival.                    

She reaches Edward and Bella, positioning herself in a
protective stance, as well.                                      

                          ALICE                                  
              We wouldn't want to make a scene.                  

                          FELIX                                  
              There won't be any scene.    And we'll             
              still win.                                         
                          EDWARD
              But not easily --

                            JANE (O.S.)
              Enough.

A very tiny, young woman appears, JANE. She also wears a
dark overcoat, her Botticelli angel-like face peering out
from under the hood. SEE her CRIMSON IRISES.

Felix and Demetri are back off immediately. Edward and           
Alice step back, as well. Bella can see they're afraid of        
this small girl.

                            EDWARD
                      (nodding to her)
              Jane.

                          BELLA
                   (sotto to Alice)
              Who is she?
                          ALICE
                   (sotto to Bella)
              Just do as she says.

Jane tosses Edward an overcoat.    He dons it.

                            JANE
              Follow me.

Jane simply turns and heads up the alley, confident they'll
follow. Felix, smirking, gestures for them to go ahead of
him. Edward takes Bella's hand...

                                                           101.



EXT. VOLTERRA STREETS - DAY

Jane leads Edward, Bella and Alice through several narrow,
dark alleys. Felix and Demetri bring up the rear. Edward
never loosens his grip on Bella's hand.

Their path dead ends at a WALL OF BRICK. Jane just strides
forward and, without breaking pace - drops down into an OPEN
HOLE in the street; it's a drain. Alice follows Jane.
Bella looks down, sees nothing but BLACKNESS.

                          EDWARD
              It's alright. Alice will catch you.

Edward takes her wrists, dangles her over the hole --
INT. SEWERS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- ON BELLA as she drops through the darkness, to be caught
by Alice. Edward lands beside them, then Felix and Demetri.

Edward pulls Bella close as they follow Jane through the
sewer. He meets Bella's eyes, trying to look reassuring,
but he's tense as hell. Finally, they reach --

A FOLDING IRON ELEVATOR DOOR. Jane easily pulls it aside.
They all enter. As the door CLANGS shut on them --

                                                     SMASH TO:

CLOSE ON MODERN ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING. They all exit into --      

INT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

An elegantly decorated space with old world charm. They're         
greeted politely by GIANNA an attractive (human) receptionist.     

                          GIANNA
              Buon pomeriggio.

They head through the lobby to --

THE LONG CORRIDOR that Edward traversed earlier.   Finally,
they reach the carved double doors which open --                   

INT. CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

Bella, Edward and Alice enter to face the three ancients:
Aro, Marcus, Caius.

Eight VOLTURI GUARDS (including Jane, Felix, Demetri) line the
walls in a variety of modern dark overcoats.

                                                           102.



BELLA'S POV - THE FLOOR - there's a depression in the center
that leads to a drain. Bella shivers.

Aro rises, greets them like old friends, taking Edward's
hand and shaking it --

                          ARO
              What a happy surprise! Bella is alive
              after all. Isn't that wonderful?

Caius responds with a sour expression. Marcus could care           
less. Aro doesn't release Edward's hand, looks at him as --        

                          ARO
              Her blood appeals to you so much it
              makes me thirsty. How can you stand
              to be so close to her?

                          EDWARD
              It's not without effort.

                          ARO
                   (laughing)
              I can see that.

Off Bella's look, Edward explains --                               

                          EDWARD
              One touch and Aro can see every                      
              thought I've ever had in my life.

                          ARO
              You're quite the telepath yourself,
              Edward. Though... you can't read
              Bella's thoughts. Fascinating.

He releases Edward's hand and turns to Bella.
                          ARO
              I would love to see if you are an                    
              exception to my gifts, as well.                      

He reaches for Bella's hand. She hesitates, does she have a        
choice? Aro laughs at her reluctance, further extends his          
hand. Bella finally takes it.                                      

A beat as he holds her hand... confusion sweeping over him.        

                          ARO
              Interesting.

He releases her, moves back to his chair, deep in thought.

                                                             103.



                          ARO
              I wonder if --                                         

                            EDWARD                                   
                      (reading Aro's thoughts)                       
              No!                                                    

                          ARO                                        
              Let's see if she's immune to all our                   
              powers, shall we Jane?                                 

Jane turns toward Bella but Edward springs in front of her --        

Jane instead focuses her gaze on Edward which FLINGS him             
across the room where he collapses, writhing in agony. Jane          
concentrates on him with a small smile, enjoying his pain.           
                            BELLA
              Stop!

Bella and Alice rush to his side.    As soon as Jane looks
away, Edward's pain ceases.

                            ARO
              Jane, dear.    The girl?                               

Jane's gaze now turns toward Bella who cringes, awaiting the         
pain... but nothing happens. Jane's grin is replaced by              
anger. Aro laughs like a child with a new toy.                       

Jane, infuriated, moves toward Bella, but Aro stops her with         
a tiny gesture.                                                      

                          ARO
              Remarkable! She confounds us all.      So
              what do we do with you now?

                          MARCUS                                     
                   (seemingly bored)                                 
              You already know what you'll do, Aro.                  

                          CAIUS                                      
              She knows too much; she's a liability.                 

                          ARO
              That's true. Unless Edward intends to
              give her immortality...
                   (looks at Edward)
              But that's not your intention, is it.
              Shame.

He nods to Felix who moves toward Bella, but he only takes a         
step before Edward tackles him.                                      

                                                          104.



                          BELLA                                   
              Edward, don't!                                      

Alice leaps to help but several Volturi guard hold her back,      
which is no easy job. As she struggles mightily --                

Edward is David to Felix's Goliath.    Edward will lose, but      
he'll go down fighting.                                           

-- Edward is fast, anticipating Felix's moves before he           
makes them, but Felix is stronger --                              

-- Felix grabs Edward, throws him into the ceiling, SMASHING      
against the marble; he drops like a stone. Is then                
immediately KICKED across the room.                               
                         BELLA                                    
                   (to Aro)                                       
              Stop this! Please!                                  

But Aro ignores her, leans forward to study Edward.    Jane is    
itching to step in. Aro gestures her back.                        

-- Felix takes some hits, but then lifts Edward overhead,         
CRACKING him like a nut, then flinging him against a wall --      

Bella runs toward Aro but a Volturi Guard flings her away;        
she flies HARD against the wall.                                  

The guard is then occupied by the thrashing Alice --              

Bella, bruised, but not broken, makes another attempt to get      
to Aro -- finally reaches him, kneels in front of him --          

                            BELLA
              Do it!    Kill me! Just leave them
              alone!
-- as she yanks her collar back, exposing her neck to him.
Aro is surprised and intrigued. A beat.

                           ARO
              Enough.                                             

Felix immediately releases Edward who manages to look up.         
He sees Bella kneeling in front of Aro.                           

                          EDWARD
              Get away from her -- !

Edward moves toward Aro but is quickly immediately pinned by      
Jane's invisible powers; he writhes in agony. Alice can no        
longer bear Edward's suffering --                                 

                                                          105.



                          ALICE                                   
              Edward, stop. I've already seen it.                 

                          EDWARD                                  
                   (through gritted teeth)                        
              Alice, stay out of it.                              

                          ALICE                                   
              I know what to do.                                  

Aro, intrigued, gestures for Jane to stop; Edward goes limp.      

                          ARO
              Ah yes, the clairvoyant. I saw your
              gift in Edward's thoughts. What is it               
              you've seen?                                        
                          EDWARD                                  
              ... don't...                                        

                          ALICE                                   
              I'm the one who will change Bella.                  

Bella is taken aback by this.   Aro is surprised, as well.        

                         ARO

              Please. Be my guest.                                

                          ALICE                                   
              Not here. Her father is in law                      
              enforcement. If she goes missing,                   
              there will be questions.                            

                          CAIUS                                   
              He is easily dealt with.                            

                          ALICE
              It will happen, Aro.   See for                      
              yourself.

She thrusts out her hand. Aro nods to the Guards who              
release her. She gives him her hand. He closes his eyes --        

                                                   SMASH TO:

EXT. FOREST - DAY (ALICE'S VISION)

Edward hunts a deer. Matching his pace is another vampire -
Bella! She's pale and beautiful - she and Edward smile at
each other as they take a last grand leap for the kill --

                                               SMASH BACK TO:

                                                            106.



INT. CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL - DAY

BACK ON ARO, utterly delighted.   He releases Alice's hand.

                          ARO
              Mesmerizing! To see the things you've
              seen, that haven't happened yet!                      

Alice moves to Edward's side, helps him up.                         

                          ALICE
              I'm so sorry.

                   (to Bella)
              Your gifts will make for an intriguing
              immortal. Go make your preparations.                  

Bella hurries to Edward's side, too.    Caius is put out.           

                          CAIUS

              Dear Caius, the girl's disappearance                  
              will be conspicuous at best. And                      
              surely you see her potential.

              Let us be done with this.    Heidi will               
              arrive any moment.                                    

Aro gestures - Demetri throws open the carved double doors.         
Caius glares at them threateningly.                                 

                          CAIUS                                     
              We will make sure she follows through.                
              I would not delay. We do not offer                    
              second chances.                                       

Edward, recovered now, takes Bella by the arm and, with             
Alice, they cautiously back toward the door --

INT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - LONG CORRIDOR (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- Demetri leads Bella, Edward and Alice out of the hall.
As they make their way up the corridor, they see coming
toward them --

A GROUP OF TWO DOZEN TOURISTS, led by a beautiful vampire,
HEIDI. Edward, Alice and Bella stop to let them all pass.
As Heidi passes Demetri, he gives her a flirtatious smile --

                                                            107.



                            DEMETRI
                     (sotto)                                        
                Nice fishing, Heidi, save some for me.              

Heidi smiles.   She gives Bella a curious once-over, then
continues on.

                            HEIDI
                     (to the group)
                This way, please. Stay together...

A HUSBAND and WIFE, 60's, cameras around their necks, pass
Bella. The Husband winks at Bella --

                            TOURIST HUSBAND
                Unusual tour, isn't it?
                            TOURIST WIFE
                Bill, get a picture of that bust there.

As the Tourists file past, we HEAR a variety of languages,
German, Japanese, English.

The group is moved toward the carved double doors which
swing open for them. They file into the marble hall --

Edward pulls Bella forward, but she cranes her neck back as
the last of the tourists disappear inside.

As the large doors close... we begin to HEAR SCREAMING --

Edward and Alice rush Bella out - PUSH IN ON BELLA'S                
TORMENTED FACE as the SCREAMING gets louder... and louder --

                                                     SMASH TO:

INT. BELLA'S ROOM - NIGHT
ON BELLA'S SLEEPING FACE as the SCREAMING CRESCENDOS --
Bella sits bolt upright, yelling --

                            BELLA
                -- Stop!                                            

She catches her breath, disoriented, confused. Then she             
turns to find Edward lying beside her, looking at her.              

                            BELLA
                It... wasn't a dream.                               

                            EDWARD
                Go back to sleep. You've been through               
                a lot.

                                                         108.



                          BELLA                                  
              No, you might --                                   

                          EDWARD                                 
              I'll be here when you wake up.                     

Beat, she looks at him, wary.                                    

                           BELLA                                 
              Why?   Out of guilt?                               

                          EDWARD                                 
                   (realizing)                                   
              You... think I asked the Volturi to                
              kill me because I felt guilty?                     
                            BELLA                                
              Didn't you?                                        

                          EDWARD                                 
              I went to them because I thought I'd               
              lost you.                                          

                          BELLA                                  
              You didn't even want me.                           

Now Edward takes her by the shoulders.                           

                          EDWARD                                 
              Bella. The only reason I left was to               
              protect you. I wanted you to have a                
              chance at a normal, happy life.                    

                          BELLA                                  
              But it was so easy for you to leave.               

                          EDWARD                                 
              I had to be convincing. But easy?     In           
              my hundred years, I've never had a                 
              harder time than what I just went                  
              through.                                           

She's beginning to believe him.                                  

                          BELLA                                  
              I kept seeing you. Visions of you.                 
              Always protecting me. I thought I was              
              going crazy.                                       

                          EDWARD                                 
              Your own instincts were speaking to                
              you. I wish it had been me. But                    
              you're the heroic one. You saved me.               

                                                            109.



He moves to kiss her... but abruptly stops.   Suddenly --           

HER DOOR swings open - she spins toward it as the LIGHTS            
flip on and Charlie enters. Edward is gone.                         

                          CHARLIE                                   
              You alright? Another nightmare?                       

                            BELLA                                   
              I'm okay.    You don't have to worry.                 

                          CHARLIE                                   
              Last time you said that, you                          
              disappeared. You want to talk                         
              nightmares?                                           
                          BELLA                                     
                   (sincere)                                        
              I'm really sorry, Dad.                                

                          CHARLIE                                   
              Just... don't ever do that to me                      
              again. Okay?                                          
                   (off her nod)                                    
              And you're grounded for the rest of                   
              your life.                                            

                           BELLA                                    
              I know.                                               

                          CHARLIE                                   
              Get some rest so I can keep lecturing                 
              you in the morning.                                   

He kisses her forehead. Exits.     A beat... she turns to find      
Edward sitting on the bed.                                          

                          EDWARD                                    
              He won't forgive me easily.                           

                           BELLA                                    
              Nope.                                                 

                          EDWARD
              Will you? I don't deserve it but... I                 
              hope you will. Because I honestly                     
              have no idea how to live without you.                 

Bella melts in his eyes.   He kisses her.

                          BELLA
              You won't be able to get rid of me                    
              once Alice changes me.                                

                                                          110.



                          EDWARD
              She won't have to. There are ways to                
              keep the Volturi in the dark.                       

                          BELLA
                   (pulling away)
              They'll come after your whole family.
              You'd risk that just to keep me human?

                          EDWARD
              Just? You really don't understand
              what you'd be giving up.

                          BELLA
              I really do.
They look at each other; an impasse.    She decides something,    
grabs her jeans, pulls them on--

                          BELLA
              You're not the only one with a say in it.           

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN                            

CLOSE ON BELLA --

                          BELLA
              You all know what Edward wants. And
              you know what I want. But I won't
              force myself on you...

INCLUDE THE ENTIRE CULLEN FAMILY who surround Bella. The          
house has been restored to it's original warmth and beauty.       
Edward sits off to the side as Bella addresses them.              

                          BELLA
              I think the only fair way to handle                 
              this is by vote --
                          EDWARD
              You can't be serious --                             

                          BELLA
                   (firmly)
              This is my meeting, Edward.

Edward, frustrated, sits back.    She faces the family again.

                          BELLA
              However this turns out, I'm not                     
              letting the Volturi hurt you. I'll go               
              back to Italy alone --                              

                                                            111.



                            EMMETT
                The hell you will.   I'm not missing
                another fight.

                            BELLA
                That's not up for a vote, Emmett.    I
                don't want you involved.

                            ESME
                We've always been involved, honey, and
                we're not going to stop --

                            BELLA
                No, please -- I want you to seriously
                think about this. If I join you,
                you'll be stuck with me for a long
                time - forever. It's a huge decision.
                And I want - I need your honesty here.

They nod or otherwise communicate agreement.

                            BELLA
                Then let's take a vote... Alice?

Alice jumps up and hugs Bella.

                            ALICE
                Like you're not already my sister.     Of
                course, yes!

Bella smiles.   Jasper rises, but keeps his distance.

                            JASPER
                I vote yes. It'll be a relief not to
                want to kill you.

                             BELLA
                Um.   Thanks? Okay, Rosalie?
Rosalie, torn, looks at Edward who's stony toward her.

                            ROSALIE
                Edward, I'm sorry for what I did. I
                really am. And I know you're not
                ready to forgive me...
                     (to Bella)
                But this isn't the life I'd have
                chosen for myself. I wish there'd
                been someone to vote no for me...
                     (she exchanges a glance
                      with Carlisle - then...)
                So... no.

                                                            112.



Bella takes it stoically.    Emmett bounds over and lifts           
Bella into a bear hug.

                          EMMETT
              I vote hell yeah. We can pick a fight
              with these Volturi some other way.

Esme approaches and embraces Bella warmly.

                          ESME
              I already think of you as part of the
              family. Yes.

                          BELLA
              Thank you, Esme.
Carlisle moves, not to Bella, but to --

                            CARLISLE
              Edward --

                          EDWARD
              You can't go along with this,
              Carlisle, you know what it means.

                          CARLISLE
              You've chosen not to live without her,
              which leaves me no choice. I won't
              lose my son.
                   (turns to Bella)
              But Alice has never turned anyone.
              It'd be safer if I did it --

The front door suddenly SLAMS. Edward's gone.     Bella
blanches but turns to the family.                                   

                            BELLA
              Thank you.    Thank you all.

EXT. HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

A FERRARI has pulled over to the side of the road. VICTORIA
PEERS IN THE WINDOW. The DRIVER, a middle-aged man smiles --        

                          VICTORIA
              Where you headed?

                   (a slow grin)                                   
              Sounds perfect.                                      

As she climbs in...                                                

INT. EDWARD'S CAR - MORNING

Edward drives Bella home.    He is somber.   She is resigned.      

                            EDWARD
              When?
                          BELLA
              After graduation.                                    

                          EDWARD                                   
              Just two months.                                     

                          BELLA
              It'll be best for Dad that way. I can                
              pretend to be at college somewhere.                  
              Carlisle suggested it. But...                        
                   (quiet, emotional)                              
              I wish you'd be the one to change me.                

                          EDWARD
                   (beat)
              Would you be willing to trade for that?

                         BELLA
                   (hopeful)                                       
              Name it.

                          EDWARD
              Five more years as a human.

                          BELLA
              The Volturi won't wait that long.

                          EDWARD
              I'll settle for three.                               

                          BELLA
                   (sadly, shakes her head)
              I won't risk it. It'll have to be
              Carlisle.

He takes her hand.

                                                           114.



                          EDWARD
              Why are you so willing to give up your
              soul?

                          BELLA
              Because I don't believe you've lost
              yours. And I want to share mine with
              you forever.

He looks to her, kisses her hand... then suddenly Edward           
SLAMS on the brakes --

THEIR POV - THE ROAD

-- Someone stands in the road directly in front of them --
it's JACOB. He glares, then turns and walks into the woods.
                          BELLA
              What is he doing?

                          EDWARD
              He wants to talk to me.

                          BELLA
              Well, he can talk to me first.

She pushes out of the car --

INT. WOODS - MORNING

Edward and Bella tramp through the woods to FIND -- Jacob
leaning against a tree. His expression is hard.

                          JACOB
              You're still alive.                                  

                          BELLA                                    
              I've been calling you.                               
                          JACOB
              Couldn't drop by?                                    

                          EDWARD
              He thinks I'm keeping you away.

                          JACOB
                   (spinning on him)
              Stay the hell out of my head!

                          BELLA
              Dad grounded me, Jake. We're trying                  
              to get back before he wakes up.                      

                                                           115.



Jacob doesn't buy it. Bella is frustrated. But Edward
takes a step toward Jacob. Calm. Diplomatic.

                          EDWARD
              Jacob, I know you have something to
              say to me, but I'd like to say
              something first. Alright?

Jacob leans back against the tree, arms folded, waiting.

                          EDWARD
                   (sincere)
              Thank you. For keeping Bella alive
              when I... didn't.

                          JACOB
              No, you didn't. And it wasn't for
              your benefit, trust me.

                          EDWARD
              I know. I'm still grateful.
                   (then)
              But I'm back now. And I'm not leaving
              Bella's side till she orders me away.

She looks at him. He returns the look. Jacob sees the              
devotion between them. It wounds him. But he masks it.

                           JACOB
              We'll see.

                          EDWARD
              Either way, we'll handle Victoria from
              here on out.

                          JACOB
              She's been laying low. Ever since
              your freaky sister showed up. Guess
              she can't stand you Cullens either.

                          EDWARD
              She'll come back.

                          JACOB
              She does, she's ours.   She killed on
              our turf.

                           EDWARD
              We'll see.

                          JACOB                                    
              My turn to talk. I'm here to remind
              you about a key point in the Treaty.

                                                          116.



                          EDWARD
                   (reads his thoughts, nods)
              I haven't forgotten.

                          JACOB
              Good.

                           BELLA
              What?   What key point?

                          JACOB
              If any of them bites a human, the
              truce is over. That's bite, not kill.

                          BELLA
                   (realizing)
              But... if I choose it, it's none of
              your business.

Jacob is horrified, starting to shake with rage.

                          JACOB
              If you... what!? No.      No way.   I
              won't let you --

                          EDWARD
              -- Bella, step back --

                          JACOB
              You're not gonna be one of them.

                          BELLA
              That's not your call --

                          JACOB
                   (even more intense)
              You know what we'll do to you - I
              won't have a choice --
                          EDWARD
              We're done here --

Edward takes Bella's arm, starts to pull her away.    Jacob
lunges, trying to extract Bella from him --

                          JACOB
              You don't speak for her!

Edward PUSHES Jacob away; he flies back ten feet in the air,
but mid-air he PHASES INTO A WOLF!

                                                         117.



-- The Jacob-wolf lands on all fours, spinning to face
Edward in an attack stance. Edward shifts stance, as well,
readying for a fight --

                          BELLA
              Stop!

Edward and Jacob circle one another, seconds from lunging --

                          EDWARD
                   (to Bella)
              Get out of here. Now!

But Bella races between them, forceful, insistent.

                          BELLA
                   (to both of them)
              You do this, you'll be going through me.

A long tense beat, none of them backing down - it could go
either way --

                          BELLA
              I swear to God, I'm not moving.

Both rivals see she's dead serious. Edward backs off, ever-
so-slightly... the Jacob-wolf does the same.                     

                          BELLA
                   (turning to Edward)
              Give me a second. Please.

Edward shakes his head.   Doesn't move an inch.

                          BELLA
              Read his thoughts.   Is he going to                
              hurt me?
Edward does, and finally, reluctantly backs away. But his        
eyes never leave the wolf's. They glare at one another.

Bella carefully approaches the Jacob-wolf, blocking his line
of sight. Her voice is kind, pleading.

                          BELLA
              Jacob, I love you. You're my best
              friend. But... I can't change how I
              feel. Please don't make me choose.
                   (quietly, emotionally)
              Because it'll be him. It's always
              been him.

                                                           118.



Anguish sweeps through the wolf's fierce face.    It's even
harder to take than when he's in human form --

                          BELLA
              But you know how important you are to --

Suddenly, the wolf BOLTS out of there...

ON BELLA - fighting tears as she watches him disappear...

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              There were problems ahead.     Seemingly             
              insurmountable...                                    

Edward's arms wrap around her from behind.                         
                          BELLA (V.O.)
              ... If I didn't become a vampire, the
              Volturi would kill me. If I did, my
              best friend would do the job himself,
              or get killed in the attempt.

She turns to face Edward, looking into his loving eyes...

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              Victoria was still on the loose,
              putting everyone I loved in danger...

He kisses her tenderly, washing away her concerns.

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              But I'd already survived the worst --
              losing Edward. So I knew I could
              survive anything...

                           EDWARD                                  
              I'm here.   Always.
And she sees that's the truth, believes it. He takes her
hand and together they turn, heading out of the woods...

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              And soon, I'd be like him. We'd face
              our fate together. Forever.

Off them, hand in hand, inseparable... as we begin to --

        A school bus.  TWO very buxom PROSTITUTES are being handcuffed by a
        plain clothes special agent, CHESTER DESMOND.  Another AGENT has his
        gun to the spread eagled BUS DRIVER's head.  The KIDS inside the bus

                                  DESMOND
                        Smell something fishy, huh?

                                   COLE
                        I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU, CHET.
                        SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT I WOULD
                        LIKE TO SHOW YOU.  ARRANGEMENTS ARE
                        BEING MADE AND I WILL MEET YOU AT
                        THE PORTLAND, AIRPORT.

6.      EXT.  SMALL AIRPORT OUTSIDE OF PORTLAND - DAY

        ANOTHER ANGLE

        Desmond exits the plane.

7.      INT.  SECURITY LOUNGE OF THE AIRPORT - SAME

        Desmond enters.  Cole and another man, SAM STANLEY, walk towards him.

                                   COLE
                   (motioning to the man standing there)
                        CHET, GIVE SAM STANLEY THE GLAD
                        HAND.  HE'S COME OVER FROM SPOKANE.

        Desmond and Stanley shake.

                                  STANLEY
                        It's a pleasure.  I've heard a lot about
                        you.

                                   COLE
                        SAM'S THE MAN WHO CRACKED THE
                        WHITEMAN CASE.

                                  DESMOND
                        Congratulations.  I heard about that.

                                   COLE
                              (plowing ahead)
                        YOUR SURPRISE, CHET.  HER NAME IS LIL.

        LIL walks to them from another room.  She goes into a contorted dance.

8.      LIL'S DANCE

        Things we notice.

        --  She makes a sour face.

        --  She walks in place.

        --  She puts one hand in her pocket and makes a fist with the other.

        --  While she is doing this, she blinks with both eyes.

        --  She is wearing a red wig.

        At one point during this Cole adds a sentence.

                                   COLE
                        SHE'S MY MOTHER'S SISTER'S GIRL.

        Cole holds four fingers in front of his eyes.

                                  DESMOND
                          (noticing the fingers)
                        Federal?

        Cole gives him the thumbs up.

        Lil finishes her dance.

                                   COLE
                        GOOD LUCK, CHET.
                              (turns to Sam)
                        SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT
                        HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.
                              (back to Chet)
                        YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE
                        PHILADELPHIA OFFICES.  I AM FLYING
                        OUT TODAY

                                  DESMOND
                        Right, Gordon.  We'll be in touch.

9.      EXT.  HIGHWAY ON THE WAY TO DEER MEADOW - DAY

        Desmond's car on the highway.

10.     INT.  DESMOND'S CAR - SAME

        As they barrel down the highway -

                                  STANLEY
                        That was really something.  That
                        dancing girl.
                              (after a beat)
                        What did it mean?

                                  DESMOND
                        Code.  If you work with Gordon you learn
                        that right away.

                                  STANLEY
                        Code, I've heard a lot about this.

        Desmond pulls his arm back so that only his fingers come out of his
        sleeve.

                                  DESMOND
                        Sort of shorthand.

                                  STANLEY
                            (missing the humor)
                        Shorthand.  really?

                                  DESMOND
                        We're heading into a difficult situation.

                                  STANLEY
                        How do you figure?

                                  DESMOND
                        I'll explain it to you.  Do you remember
                        Lil's dance?

        As Desmond explains we -

                                                        INTERCUT WITH:

11.     FLASHBACK:  LIL'S DANCE

        In slow motion.

        ON LIL'S SOUR FACE

                                  DESMOND
                        Lil was wearing a sour face.

                                  STANLEY
                        What do you mean?

                                  DESMOND
                        Her face had a sour look...  that means
                        we're going to have trouble with the
                        local authorities.  They are not going to
                        be receptive to the FBI.

        ON LIL BLINKING BOTH EYES

                                  DESMOND
                        Both eyes blinking means there is going
                        to be trouble higher up...  the eyes of the
                        local authority.  A sheriff and a deputy.
                        That would be my guess.  Two of the
                        local law enforcers are going to be a
                        problem.

        ON LIL PUTTING ONE HAND IN HER POCKET AND ONE IN A FIST

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        If you noticed she had one hand in her
                        pocket which means they are hiding
                        something, and the other hand made a
                        fist which means they are going to be
                        belligerent.

        ON LIL WALKING IN PLACE

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        Lil was walking in place which means
                        there's going to be a lot of legwork
                        involved.

        WE SEE COLE PUTTING HIS FINGERS IN FRONT OF HIS FACE AND SAYING LIL
        IS HIS SISTER'S GIRL.

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        Cole said Lil was "his mother's sister's
                        girl".  What is missing in that sentence?
                        The Uncle.

                                  STANLEY
                        Oh, the uncle is missing.

                                  DESMOND
                        Not Cole's Uncle but probably the
                        sheriff's uncle in federal prison.

                                  STANLEY
                        So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's
                        committed a serious crime.

        ON LIL'S RED WIG

                                  DESMOND
                        Right, which is probably why Lil was
                        wearing a red wig meaning we are
                        headed into a dangerous situation.  Let
                        me ask you something, Stanley, did you
                        notice anything about the dress?

                                  STANLEY
                        The dress she was wearing had been
                        altered to fit her.  I noticed a different
                        colored thread where the dress had been
                        taken in.  It wasn't her dress or she
                        must have lost some weight.

                                  DESMOND
                        Gordon said you were good.  The tailored
                        dress is our code for drugs.  Did you
                        notice what was pinned to it?

                                  STANLEY
                        A blue rose.

                                  DESMOND
                        Very good, but I can't tell you about
                        that.

        Stanley rides along quietly for a while.

                                  STANLEY
                        What did Gordon's tie mean?

                                  DESMOND
                        What?  That's just Gordon's bad taste.

                                  STANLEY
                        Why couldn't he have just told you all
                        these things?

                                  DESMOND
                        He talks loud.  And he loves his code.

                                  STANLEY
                        I see.  He does talk loud.

                                  DESMOND
                        Gordon would not have sent us to Deer
                        Meadow without thinking it was a
                        high priority situation.

                                  STANLEY
                        It must be a high priority situation.

12.     EXT.  HIGHWAY - SAME

        Desmond's car drives off.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

13.     EXT.  DEER MEADOW SHERIFF'S STATION - AFTERNOON

        Desmond and Stanley arrive.  The Sheriff's Station is in a sorry
        state outside...  They walk up to the old steps and enter.

14.     INT.  DEER MEADOW SHERIFF'S STATION, RECEPTION AREA - DAY

        Agent Desmond and Stanley walk into a very small reception area.  At
        the counter Desmond shows his badge to CLIFF HOWARD, the Deputy.

                                  DESMOND
                        Good afternoon, Federal Bureau of
                        Investigation, Special Agent Chet
                        Desmond.  I'd like to see Sheriff Cable.

        Cliff just smiles for a long minute.

                                   CLIFF
                        Why don't you folks have a seat.  Make
                        yourself at home.  It's gonna be a while.

        Desmond stays standing and Stanley sits.  After another long moment,
        Cliff joins the SECRETARY in a conspiratorial giggle over the long
        wait they are planning to give the FBI.  In the middle of a giggle
        Cliff smiles up at Desmond.

                             CLIFF (continued)
                        Why don't you have some of that coffee.
                        It was fresh two days ago.

        Cliff has a good laugh over this and leans again over the secretary
        pretending to look at some paper work.  They both laugh.

                                  DESMOND
                        Okay, that's it.  I've had enough of the
                        waiting room now.

                                   CLIFF
                              (still smiling)
                        Oh.

        Desmond walks towards the door that obviously must go to Sheriff
        Cable's office.

        Cliff blocks his way with his arm across the doorway, daring him to
        do something.  While they stare eye to eye, Desmond's hand goes up
        slowly towards Cliff's face in a slow mesmerizing way.  Cliff tries
        to knock Chet's hand away.  Chet counters by grabbing Cliff's nose
        and pinches a nerve to its side injecting Cliff with a great amount
        of pain.

                             CLIFF (continued)
                        AAAHHHHHHHH...

        Desmond spins the deputy 180 degrees placing himself on the inside of
        the office and then still pressing the nerve guides Cliff down into a
        chair.

        While the Deputy's eyes tear copiously Desmond turns to the secretary.

                                  DESMOND
                        You can start that FRESH pot of coffee
                        right now.

        Desmond stalks to Sheriff Cable's office.  Stanley remains behind
        continuing to observe every detail.

15.     INT.  SHERIFF CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY

        SHERIFF CABLE looks up from his work.

                                   CABLE
                        How the hell did you...

        Desmond shows his credentials.

                                  DESMOND
                        Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special
                        Agent Chet Desmond.

        Cliff, still holding his nose, appears just behind Desmond, who turns
        to him.

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        That's all right, Deputy, Sheriff Cable
                        can take it from here

        Cable signals Cliff to leave.

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        I'm here to investigate the murder of
                        Teresa Banks.

                                   CABLE
                        Well, little fella, we don't need any
                        outside help here.  I don't like you
                        people sniffin' around my neck of the
                        woods.  In fact, when the state boys
                        called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I
                        think I said, "So what?"

                                  DESMOND
                        Your behavior is not funny and is
                        wasting the time of the Federal
                        Government.

                                   CABLE
                        You're lucky I am not wasting you.

                                  DESMOND
                        Well, little fella, let me put it this way.
                        The operative word here would be
                        "Federal".  With or without the
                        semantics of all this, I am now ordering
                        you to release all pertinent information
                        concerning Teresa Banks, both while
                        living and deceased.

        Cable retrieves a box with the paper work and some personal effects.
        He throws it to Desmond.

                                   CABLE
                        A basic kill.  Banks was a drifter and
                        nobody knew her.  My boys have been all
                        over this.  It's a dead end.

                                  DESMOND
                        That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable.
                        Where's the body?

                                   CABLE
                        Out back in our morgue

        Desmond starts to leave.

                             CABLE (continued)
                        It's 4:30.  We close at five.

                                  DESMOND
                        We've got our own clock.  We'll lock up.

        As Desmond turns to leave he notices on the wall a framed Newspaper
        clipping with picture.

        The caption reads:

                            "CABLE BENDS STEEL"

        The newspaper shows a picture of Cable in a He-Man pose bending a
        steel BAR into a U shape.  He turns to leave and Stanley seems to
        have appeared right on time.  Desmond moves down the hall and Stanley
        follows.

16.     EXT.  SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

        As Desmond and Stanley walk to the adjoining morgue they see a pile of
        steel BARS similar to the one they saw Cable bending in the picture.

        AT THE MORGUE DOOR

        Stanley moves up to Desmond and speaks confidentially.

                                  STANLEY
                        You know, Agent Desmond, I figure this
                        whole office, furniture included, is
                        worth 27,000 dollars.

        Desmond doesn't know what to say to him.  They enter the morgue.

17.     INT.  TINY MORGUE - DAY

        Teresa's body is on the platform in the middle of the room,  Stanley
        hangs his recorder on the hooks at the end of the autopsy table and
        puts on rubber gloves.  Desmond opens Teresa Banks file.

                                  DESMOND
                                 (reading)
                        Teresa Banks lived at the Canyon
                        Trailer Park for a month.  We'll check
                        that.  And worked as a waitress at Hap's
                        Truck Stop.  Worked the Night Shift.
                        Good place for dinner when we're thru
                        here, Sam.
                          (flips to another page)
                        No one came to claim the body and no
                        known next of kin.

        As Desmond is doing this, Stanley takes out his SPECIAL MACHINE.
        Desmond looks up from his work and notices.

                                  STANLEY
                        Solved the Whiteman Case with this.

                                  DESMOND
                        That's what I heard.

                                  STANLEY
                        No one could find those splinters
                        without a machine like this.  And no one
                        had a machine like this.

                                  DESMOND
                        That's good.

                                  STANLEY
                        Yes, it is good.
                              (looks around)
                        What do you think is in these other
                        drawers?

                                  DESMOND
                        I don't know, Sam.

                                  STANLEY
                        Maybe, later we could take a look.

                                  DESMOND
                        Sure, but let's finish up with this first.

        Getting to work, Stanley's face goes right over Teresa's.

                                  STANLEY
                            (into his recorder)
                        Crushed skull.  Probable cause repeated
                        blows to the back of the head with an
                        obtuse angled blunt object.  Subject
                        looks to be between 16 and 18 years of
                        age.

                                  DESMOND
                        Cole said she was 17.

        Stanley's eyes drift to Teresa's left hand.

                                  STANLEY
                        I wonder where her ring is?

        Desmond notices the mark on her hand as well.

                                  DESMOND
                        Yeah.
                    (looking into the personal effects)
                        Personal effects include a watch, under
                        garments, and a blue waitress
                        uniform...  the ring is missing.  It says
                        the rest of her things haven't been
                        removed yet from the trailer.  Let's
                        hope it's there.

        Stanley picks up her left hand.

        INSERT: BANKS LEFT HAND

        In Stanley's hand.

        ON THE SCENE

                                  STANLEY
                        There appears to be a contusion under
                        the ring finger of her left hand.

                                  DESMOND
                        Oh.

        Stanley peers underneath the fingernail.

                                  STANLEY
                        A laceration.

        Stanley brings over his "Whiteman" instrument.  Works the left hand
        under it.

                                  DESMOND
                        Accidental?

                                  STANLEY
                        Agent Desmond, would you hold the
                        finger for me.  There's something up
                        there.

        He gets whatever it is with a long set of tweezers.

                                  DESMOND
                        What is it?

                                  STANLEY
                        It is a piece of paper with the letter "T"
                        imprinted on it.  Take a look.

        Desmond comes around and takes a look.

        On a piece of paper.

        CLOSEUP: DESMOND

        Pondering what he has seen.

        ON THE SCENE

        We move across to a clock on the wall that reads:  5:04.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        THE SAME CLOCK

        It now reads 3:33.  Stanley zips up a regulation body bag around
        Teresa.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

18.     EXT.  MORGUE - LATE NIGHT

        Desmond and Stanley come out of the morgue.

                                  STANLEY
                        Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty
                        in the morning.  Where are we going to
                        sleep?

                                  DESMOND
                        We're not.  You and I are going to get
                        some food.

                                  STANLEY
                        Yes, it's been several hours since we've
                        eaten.  I didn't realize that so much
                        time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?

        Desmond takes a long look at Stanley.

                            STANLEY (continued)
                        You've got your own M.O., don't you,
                        Agent Desmond?

        Desmond gets in and starts the car.

19.     EXT.  HAP'S DINER - LATE NIGHT

        Establish.

20.     INT.  HAP'S DINER, MANAGER'S OFFICE - LATE NIGHT

        Desmond and Stanley talk with JACK, the manager who has black wavy
        hair with a black full mustache to match, shiny silk shirt with silver
        strands sown in and an Indian turquoise belt.  He has a sign on his
        shirt that says, "Say 'Goodbye' to JACK".

        A GUY in the room is working on a light that keeps buzzing and
        shorting out.  He doesn't really know what he's doing so he is
        poking at the wiring.

                                   JACK
                        Had the FBI here once before.  Back in
                        the fifties when Hap was running the
                        place.

                                  DESMOND
                        Where's Hap?

                                   JACK
                        He's dead - good and dead.

                                  DESMOND
                        Sorry to hear it.

                                   JACK
                        He didn't suffer.

                                  DESMOND
                        I'd like to ask you a few questions about
                        Teresa Banks

                                   JACK
                        Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few
                        questions about Teresa Banks.  She
                        worked nights for a month.  That's it.

                                  DESMOND
                        Any friends?

                                   JACK
                        No.

                                  DESMOND
                        Ever see her with someone else?

                                   JACK
                        No.

                                  DESMOND
                        Did she ever mention any friends?

                                   JACK
                        No.
                                (pointing)
                        Ask Irene over there.

        He gestures thru a door that leads out to the diner, pointing out a
        woman behind the counter.

                             JACK (continued)
                        Now, her name _is_ Irene and it _is_ night.
                        Don't take it any further than that.
                        There's nothin' good about it.

21.     INT.  HAP'S DINER - SAME

        They sit at the counter and IRENE comes over to them.  Behind her is
        the coffee and she is working on a cigarette.  Lipstick smeared on
        the coffee cup.

                                   IRENE
                        Take a good look around.  There's nobody in
                        this place - you're meetin' the reason
                        why.  What'll it be?

                                  DESMOND
                        How come Jack let's you work here?

                                   IRENE
                        Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.

                                  DESMOND
                        Say no more.

        Stanley is casing the restaurant as Irene pours them a couple of cups
        of coffee.

                                  DESMOND
                           (showing credentials)
                        Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special
                        Agent Chet Desmond.  I'd like to ask you
                        a few questions about Teresa Banks.
                        Jack said you knew her.  How well?

                                   IRENE
                        She only worked here a month.  Nice
                        girl.  Never seemed to get here on time
                        though.  Ask me she had a little problem
                        with --

        She makes a sniff to indicate a "cocaine problem".

                             IRENE (continued)
                        Came looking for a job with a friend of
                        hers.  Pretty girl.  Could've been her
                        sister.

                                  DESMOND
                        What happened to her?

                                   IRENE
                        There was only one job.  Teresa took the
                        job.  Her friend took a hike.  Never saw
                        her again.

                                  DESMOND
                        Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?

                                   IRENE
                        No.

                                  DESMOND
                        Do you take cocaine, Irene?

                                   IRENE
                        No, I do not.  I never took cocaine or any
                        other drugs.  I don't take drugs.

                                  STANLEY
                        Nicotine is a drug.  Caffeine is a drug.

                                   IRENE
                        Who's Shorty?  Those drugs are legal.

                                  DESMOND
                        He's with me.
                            (back on the track)
                        Anything you would like to tell us about
                        Teresa Banks that would help us out?

                                   IRENE
                        I've thought about that.  I think her
                        death is what you would call a "freak
                        accident".

                                  DESMOND
                        Thanks.

        An OLD GUY, long and skinny, smoking, gets Desmond's attention.

                                  OLD GUY
                        You talking about that little girl that
                        was murdered?

                                  DESMOND
                        You have something to tell us?

                                  OLD GUY
                        Yeah.

                                  DESMOND
                        What?

                                  OLD GUY
                        I can tell shit from shinolah.  Gets me
                        along way down that road.

        Desmond moves away from him.

                                  STANLEY
                        You think we ought to question him?

        Desmond looks down at the coffee cup in Stanley's _left_hand_.

                                  DESMOND
                        What time is it, Stanley?

        Stanley checks his watch pouring hot coffee on himself.

                                  STANLEY
                        Oh...

        Desmond guides his laugh into a cough.

                                  STANLEY
                      (looking at his watch while his
                                legs burn)
                        Agent Desmond, it's...

                                  DESMOND
                        It's late, Sam.

                                  STANLEY
                     (to himself as be dabs his pants
                               with napkins)
                        It's not late, it's early.  Really early.

        Irene comes up to them with her purse in her hand.  She is going off
        duty.

                                   IRENE
                        You know, I never told anybody, but once
                        for about three days, just before her
                        time, Teresa's arm went completely
                        dead.

                                  DESMOND
                        What do you mean?

                                   IRENE
                        Her left arm.  It was numb.  She said she
                        couldn't use it.  Said it had no feeling.
                        Probably from the drugs she was taking.
                              (after a beat)
                        I just thought I ought to tell you.

                                  DESMOND
                        Thanks.

        Stanley watches her leave.

                                  STANLEY
                        I doubt it was drugs, more likely a
                        problem with a nerve.  I could recheck
                        the arm for injuries, but for real nerve
                        work we are going to have to take the
                        body back to Portland.

                                  DESMOND
                        I think that's a good idea.

22.     EXT.  HAP'S DINER - NEAR DAWN

        As Desmond and Stanley head towards their car.

                                  DESMOND
                        I think we should see the sun rise at the
                        Canyon Trailer Park.

                                  STANLEY
                        Are you speaking to me in a code?

                                  DESMOND
                        No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean
                        just exactly what I say.

                                  STANLEY
                        In that case, we should go to the Canyon
                        Trailer Park.

        Irene walks past them and towards the parking lot.

                            STANLEY AND DESMOND
                        Thanks, Irene.  Good...
                            (catch themselves)
                        Good morning.

                                  STANLEY
                        Thank god it is morning.

23.     EXT.  CANYON TRAILER COURT - DAWN

        Desmond and Stanley drive thru to the manager's trailer which is
        surrounded by a small white picket fence.  They park and step to the
        trailer.  Desmond knocks twice on the door.  From inside they hear a
        voice that makes Cole's voice sound like a whisper.

                                   VOICE
                        OH, GOD, WHAT...  WHAT...

        Just then Desmond and Stanley notice a sign on the door that reads.

                       "DO NOT EVER DISTURB BEFORE 9
                              A.M...    EVER"

                                   VOICE
                        CAN'T YOU READ!

                                  STANLEY
                        Nine's really late.  We are really early.

        They both fumble for their badges as they hear the manager coming
        closer to the door.  They meet the manager, CARL RODD.

                                   CARL
                        God damn, this better be
                        important.

        He stops in the middle of this when he sees the badges.

                                  DESMOND
                        Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special
                        Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam
                        Stanley.  Sorry to disturb you, but we
                        would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer,
                        please.

                                   CARL
                        More popular than Uncle's Day at a
                        whorehouse.
                    (takes one step out of his trailer)
                        GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS
                        BRIGHT!  BLUE BRIGHT.

        Carl steps thru the little picket fence's gate and leads them towards
        Teresa's Trailer.

                             CARL (continued)
                        Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she
                        lives in town.  Teresa rented it about a
                        month ago.

                                  DESMOND
                        Did she have someone with her?

                                   CARL
                        Right.  She had a friend with her.  The
                        friend took off.

                                  DESMOND
                        Was there an argument?

                                   CARL
                        Not that I know of.  But arguments do
                        happen, don't they?

                                  DESMOND
                        Yes they do.  Did she have visitors?

                                   CARL
                        No, hey, I already told this whole damn
                        thing to Sheriff "Not-Quite-Able"...
                        Here's the trailer now.

        He swings open the door.

                             CARL (continued)
                        And this is exactly the way she left it.  I
                        never touched a GOD DAMN THING.
                           (frustration rising)
                        GOD!

        Desmond and Stanley go in.

24.     INT.  TERESA'S TRAILER

        Desmond smells the room.  He and Stanley look around.  Stanley leans
        over to Desmond.

                                  STANLEY
                                (whispers)
                        She lived alone.

                                  DESMOND
                        She must have known someone.

        Desmond notices her personal effects on the dresser, but no ring.

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        You better dust this place, Sam.

                                  STANLEY
                        I'll get my kit.

25.     EXT.  CANYON TRAILER COURT

        Stanley walks towards the car.  He writes in his note book.

                                  STANLEY
                               (to himself)
                        5,600 dollars.

26.     INT.  TERESA'S TRAILER

        Desmond notices a picture hanging on the wall.  Takes the picture
        down and looks at it thru his magnifying glass.
                                  (more)

        INSERT - PICTURE

        Teresa Banks is wearing a ring.

        BACK ON THE SCENE

        Stanley returns with his equipment.  Desmond shows him the photograph.

                                  DESMOND
                        Take a look at this.

                                  STANLEY
                        She's wearing a ring.

        Stanley studies it.

                                  DESMOND
                        My guess is there isn't enough detail in
                        the photo to get an idea of the design on
                        the ring, but we should do a blowup of
                        this anyway.

                                  STANLEY
                        (squinting at the picture)
                        May I see the magnifying glass, Agent
                        Desmond?
                       (takes a look, then looks at
                                 Desmond)
                        There doesn't seem to be enough detail
                        in the photo to ascertain the design on
                        the ring.

        Carl leans in from the outside.

                                   CARL
                        I'm gonna make myself some Good
                        Morning America.  You want some?

        Both nod "yes".

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

27.     INT.  TERESA'S TRAILER - LATER

        Stanley is finishing up his work.  Carl brings them their coffee.
        Desmond tastes the coffee under Sam's watchful eye.

                                  DESMOND
                        You weren't kiddin'.  This stuff's got the
                        sting of the forty-eight hour blend.

                                   CARL
                        That's right.  That's the best coffee
                        you're gonna get around here.

                                  STANLEY
                         (watching Desmond drink)
                        We really do need a good "wake me up",
                        don't we, Agent Desmond?
                     (after a long look from Desmond)
                        We really do need a good "wake me up",
                        don't we, Agent Desmond?

        A WOMAN sticks her head into the trailer.  She has an ice pack over
        one eye and a load of idle curiosity.  Desmond notices her.

                                  DESMOND
                        Did you know Teresa Banks?

        She just nods in the negative and leans back out.  Behind her is
        Deputy Cliff, who looks into the trailer.

                                   CLIFF
                        Hey, how's J. Edgar doin'?
                                 (to Carl)
                        Bet you appreciate them bustin' your
                        mornin' in half, eh, Carl?  Bet they woke
                        you up.

                                   CARL
                        They're only doing their job.

                                  DESMOND
                        What are you doing here in the trailer
                        court, Deputy?

                                   CLIFF
                        Maybe I just live here, what do you
                        think about that?

                                  DESMOND
                        Can I ask you where you were the night
                        Teresa Banks was murdered?

                                   CLIFF
                        You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a
                        party and I got fifteen fuckin'
                        witnesses.

                                   CARL
                        Maybe if you did a little less partyin'
                        that little girl would still be alive.

                                   CLIFF
                        Is that right, Mr. Jack Daniels?

                                  DESMOND
                        Did you know Teresa Banks?

                                   CLIFF
                        Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's
                        from her.  That's it.  By the way where
                        do you get off questioning a lawman?  I
                        could ask you the same question.

                                  DESMOND
                        No you couldn't.

        Chet steps towards Cliff who looses his balance and has to step off
        the trailer steps.

28.     EXT.  CANYON TRAILER COURT - SAME

        Desmond stands in the doorway of the trailer and watches Cliff get
        into his car and drive to work.

        Stepping away from the trailer Desmond spots something underneath.
        He bends down and retrieves a Titleist Golf Ball.

                                  DESMOND
                        Is there a golf course around here?

                                   CARL
                        Not a lot around here, no.  Got some
                        clubs, but not very many fellas with
                        balls.

        Desmond drops the ball in a plastic bag and gives it to Stanley who
        puts it in his kit.  Desmond turns to Carl.

                                  DESMOND
                        Thanks for your help, Carl.  Sorry we
                        woke you up.

                                   CARL
                        That's alright.  I was having a bad
                        dream.  I was dreamin' about a joke
                        with no punchline.

        Desmond and Stanley nod to Carl and walk to their car.

                                  STANLEY
                        I couldn't help but notice that you had a
                        suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the
                        murderer.  You did think that, didn't you,
                        Agent Desmond?

                                  DESMOND
                        He's not the murderer.
                              (after a beat)
                        But he's a bozo.

                                  STANLEY
                        Yes, he is like a clown.

        Desmond walks around the car to the drivers' side and gets in.

29.     EXT.  SHERIFF'S STATION - MIDDAY

        The FBI MOBILE CRIME VAN sits outside as Desmond and Stanley pull up.

30.     INT.  WAITING ROOM, SHERIFF CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY

        Cable and Cliff meet Desmond and Stanley as they come in the door.
        The CRIME VAN DRIVER sits nearby.  The secretary is behind her desk.

                                   CABLE
                        What the hell is that thing doing out
                        there?  You're not taking that body
                        anywhere.

                                  DESMOND
                        We're taking the body back to Portland
                        and there's not a thing you can do about
                        it.

                                   CABLE
                        Maybe not _a_ thing, but maybe _two_
                        things.

                                  DESMOND
                        Teresa Banks had a ring.  Any idea what
                        happened to it?

                                   CABLE
                        We got a phone, here, that's got a little
                        ring.

                                  DESMOND
                           (turning to Stanley)
                        Sam, get the body and put it in the van.
                                (to Cable)
                        Sheriff Cable, where were you the night
                        Teresa Banks was murdered?

                                   CABLE
                     (flexing the muscles in his arm)
                        My alibi is as strong as these bands of
                        steel.

        He reaches out and stops Stanley from going out to get the body.
        Cable smiles menacingly at Desmond.

                             CABLE (continued)
                        Cliff told me you asked him the same
                        thing.  Why don't we step around back
                        and we'll have our final "discussion" out
                        doors.

        Cable exits followed by Cliff and the giggling secretary.

                                  STANLEY
                         (coming close to Desmond)
                        When he says, "Discussion", how do you
                        take that, Agent Desmond?

                                  DESMOND
                        I don't take it, Sam.  I give it.

31.     EXT.  BEHIND THE SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

        Desmond, Cliff, Stanley, Cable, the secretary and the FBI van driver
        all have stepped outside by the pile of iron bars.

                                   CABLE
                        Now, J. Edgar, I'm going to take off my
                        badge, here.  Do you mind?
                           (takes his badge off)
                        The only way you're going to get that
                        body is over mine.

        He picks up a steel bar and bends it ala the picture in his office.

                                   CLIFF
                               (to Desmond)
                        You try that you little monkey.

                                  DESMOND
                        I think I'll take off my badge as well.

        Desmond takes his coat and badge off.  Cable takes his shirt off and
        Desmond follows.  Cable is bare-chested and Desmond is in FBI issue
        underwear.

        Desmond goes to pick up an iron bar and Cable hits him with a sucker
        punch.  As Desmond bends away from this Cable rushes at him.  Desmond
        stops him with a few well placed punches to his face.  Cable falls
        down and Desmond stands over him.  Chet picks up the steel bar and
        bends it.  He then tosses the bar away.

        Cable stands up and rushes at Desmond who flips and flops him around.
        Cable tries one more grand roadhouse punch which Desmond expertly
        ducks.

                                  DESMOND
                        (eyeing Cable's glass jaw)
                        This one's comin' from J. Edgar.

        Desmond blasts him in the jaw and Cable goes over - lights out, all
        systems down.

        The no longer giggling secretary and Cliff stand and stare.  Desmond
        looks at them.

                                  DESMOND
                        Who's next?

        After a moment of unbearable humiliation they shuffle away.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

32.     EXT.  SHERIFF'S STATION - AFTERNOON

        Stanley and the driver finish loading the body into the van.  Desmond
        and Stanley talk.

                                  DESMOND
                        Take the van back to Portland, Stanley.
                        I'm going to take one more look at the
                        trailer park.

        They walk towards the van until Stanley stops.

                                  STANLEY
                             (confidentially)
                        One thing that has been troubling me.
                        That lamp at the diner.  Do you think
                        they were working on it for esthetic
                        reasons or was their work due to faulty
                        wiring?

                                  DESMOND
                        Faulty wiring.

                                  STANLEY
                        Esthetics are subjective, aren't they,
                        Agent Desmond?
                            (extends his hand)
                        I'm Sam Stanley.  If you ever need me.

                                  DESMOND
                        Thanks, Sam, for the good work.  You
                        have a good eye for detail.

                                  STANLEY
                        We do notice things, don't we, Agent
                        Desmond?  Are you going back to the
                        trailer park for the Blue rose?

        Desmond smiles at Stanley as they shake.

        DESMOND'S POV

        As he enters the van, Desmond can barely make out what Stanley says
        as he points to the driver.

                                  STANLEY
                              (very muffled)
                        83,000 dollars.

33.     EXT.  THE TRAILER COURT - DAY

        Desmond is standing in front of Teresa's trailer with Carl Rodd.

                                   CARL
                    (motioning behind and to the right
                           of Teresa's trailer)
                        And that's Deputy Cliff's trailer over
                        there.  The red one.

                                   CHET
                        Right.

                                   CARL
                        I'll be in my trailer if you need me.

        Carl walks away towards his trailer.  Desmond walks over and around
        Cliff's red trailer.  He gets a strange feeling.  He looks past
        Teresa's trailer to the edge of the trailer park, where he sees a
        HAND appear in the window of a trailer.  Then the hand disappears.

        Desmond walks to that trailer.  He knocks on the door but no one
        answers.  He looks under the trailer and sees a _mound_of_dirt_with_
        _a_small_indentation_at_the_top_.  In the indentation is _Teresa_
        _Bank's_ring_.  As he reaches out and touches it, _he_disappears_.

34.     INT. GORDON COLE'S OFFICE, PHILADELPHIA - DAY

        Cole and ALBERT ROSENFIELD talk.

                                   COLE
                        EVERY SYLLABLE OF EVERY WORD IS THE
                        SOUND OF TWO HANDS CLAPPING.  IS
                        THAT WHAT YOU SAID, ALBERT?

                                  ALBERT
                        Six to eight hands clapping.  I was
                        referring to the possibility of a little
                        silence.

        The phone rings and Cole answers it.

35.     INT.  PHILADELPHIA FBI OFFICES

        AGENT DALE COOPER, in the doorway across the hall, talks to DIANE in
        the next room.  While he talks he does some isometrics against the
        door frame.

                                  COOPER
                        I know you haven't changed your hair and
                        I've seen that beautiful dress before,
                        but I must say, Diane, you look
                        sensational today.

        Diane says something else that we cannot hear.

                                  COOPER
                              (enjoying this)
                        No, I am not trying to buy time.  It's
                        Thursday and I know you have changed
                        something in the room...  and this time
                        you've done very well...
                                (stalling)
                        And I am going to tell you exactly what
                        it is...  in a moment...  you have moved...
                            (snaps his fingers)
                        Got it!  It's the clock, you've moved it
                        12 inches to the left.
                                 (a laugh)
                        Another triumph for the dashing Agent
                        Cooper.  And you, Diane, now have to
                        clean the coffee cup, get fresh ground
                        coffee from Sally and make a damn
                        great pot of coffee.

        Cooper with a triumphant smile walks over to join Cole and Albert.
        But Cole's stern look takes his smile away.

                                  COOPER
                        What is it, Gordon?

                                   COLE
                        COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS
                        DISAPPEARED.  GONE LIKE THE WIND IN
                        DEER MEADOW.

36.     INT.  SAM STANLEY'S APARTMENT, SPOKANE - DAY

        All around the walls of Stanley's apartment are work benches with
        adding machinery sitting on top of them.  In the middle of the room
        is a portable plastic pool, with milky white water and crystallized
        salt formations clinging to the sides like quartz rocks.  From one
        odd looking piece of machinery there are wires which extend into the
        pool.

        Cooper's eyes go to the pool and back to Stanley as Sam talks about
        Desmond.

                                  STANLEY
                        Agent Chet said he wanted to check the
                        trailer court one more time.  He had me
                        drive the van with the body back here.
                        Which we did.  It was 105 miles.

                                  COOPER
                        Anything else?

                                  STANLEY
                        Did Gordon show you a woman named
                        Lil?

                                  COOPER
                        I'm up to speed, Stanley.

                                  STANLEY
                        Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the
                        Blue Rose meant.

                                  COOPER
                        And neither will I.

                                  STANLEY
                              (understanding)
                        Oh, alright.
                               (reflecting)
                        You know, I liked Agent Desmond.  He
                        had his own M.O.

        Stanley turns to one of his work tables and shows Cooper the Whiteman
        machine.

                                  STANLEY
                        I cracked the Whiteman case with this.

                                  COOPER
                           (trying to stop him)
                        Stanley, I heard all about it.

                                  STANLEY
                        No one could've found those splinters
                        without a machine like this and no one
                        has a machine like this.

                                  COOPER
                        Tell me about the letter.

                                  STANLEY
                        Take a look at this.  Chet and I found it
                        under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail.

        Cooper looks under the microscope to see the letter they found on
        Teresa.

                                  COOPER
                        And no one found the ring?

                                  STANLEY
                        No, sir, we did not.

        Cooper straightens up from the microscope.  Stanley extends his hand.

                                  STANLEY
                        I'm Sam Stanley, if you ever need me.

37.     EXT.  CANYON TRAILER COURT - DAY

        Carl Rodd shows Cooper to Teresa's trailer.

                                   CARL
                        GOD.  I'm beginning to lose faith in the
                        United States Government and that
                        includes the telephone system.  Don't
                        you folks talk to one another.  That's her
                        trailer there and I haven't touched a god
                        damn thing.  Agent Chet Desmond come
                        by a second time and asked too see
                        Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer
                       (gestures to the red trailer)
                        ...which I showed him.  I went back to
                        my trailer...
                          (gestures back to his)
                        After that I never saw him again.

                                  COOPER
                        Thank you, Carl.

        Cooper starts walking in the opposite direction from Cliff's trailer
        picking up on the same odd vibe that struck Desmond.

                                   CARL
                              (turning back)
                        That's not the way to Cliff's trailer.  I
                        told you.

                                  COOPER
                        I am not going to Cliff's trailer.

                                   CARL
                        Well, where are you going?

                                  COOPER
                        I am going over here.

                                   CARL
                          (coming along with him)
                        God damn, you people are confusing.

        Cooper reaches a pack of dirt which is now creased with tire tracks.

                                  COOPER
                        What was here, Mr. Rodd?

                                   CARL
                        A trailer was here.  What the hell do you
                        think?

                                  COOPER
                        Can you tell me who's trailer it was...
                        and who stayed in the trailer?

                                   CARL
                        An old woman and her grandson.

                                  COOPER
                        Can you tell me what their names were?

                                   CARL
                        Chalfont.  Weird.  Chalfont was the
                        name of the folks that rented the space
                        before they did.  Two Chalfonts.

        Cooper kneels to examine the tracks left by the exited trailer.
        As he kneels and inspects the tracks he is overcome by the presence
        of SOMETHING.

        Cooper struggles to his feet and looks around.  Under a tree and
        close to the tracks is a car.

                                  COOPER
                        Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?

                                   CARL
                        Yep, it sure is.

        Cooper walks to it.

        AT DESMOND'S CAR

        Cooper inspects the car.  Coming around to the front of the car he
        notices the windshield.  On the windshield someone has written the
        words, "Let's Rock".

38.     EXT.  WIND RIVER, NEAR DEER MEADOW - AFTERNOON

        Cooper stares into the stream.

                                  COOPER
                       (dictating into his recorder)
                        Diane, it's 4:20 in the afternoon.  I am
                        standing here at Wind River where they
                        found the body of Teresa Banks.  Diane,
                        this case has got a strange feeling for
                        me.  Not only has Agent Chester
                        Desmond disappeared but this is one of
                        Cole's Blue Rose cases.  The clues that
                        were found by Agent Desmond and Agent
                        Stanley have lead to dead ends.  The
                        letter below the fingernail gives me the
                        feeling that the killer will strike again.
                        But like the song says, "...who knows
                        where or when".

39.     EXT.  TWIN PEAKS - DAY

        Shot of the Twin Peaks Sign.  Then on screen it reads:

                       TWIN PEAKS ONE YEAR LATER -

           EXACTLY SEVEN DAYS BEFORE THE MURDER OF LAURA PALMER

        Re-establish.  On screen it reads:

                       "PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA"

42.     INT.  COLE'S OFFICE

        Cooper talks with Cole.

                                  COOPER
                        Gordon, it is 10:10, on February 15th.

                                  GORDON
                        SO?

                                  COOPER
                        I was worried about today from the
                        dream I told you about.

                                   COLE
                        RIGHT.
                          (not sure what to say)
                        GOOD WORK.

        Cooper looks at the calendar in the room and checks his watch.  He
        walks from the room.

43.     INT.  HALLWAY BELOW THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERA - SAME

        Cooper stares into the lens of the camera for a moment.  Then sprints
        to the Surveillance Room.

44.     INT.  SURVEILLANCE ROOM

        Cooper stares at the monitor.  Sees nothing on the screen but an
        empty hallway.

45.     EXT.  BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - DAY

        Nice sunny day.  The dity in all its glory.  On screen it reads:

                              "BUENOS AIRES"

46.     INT.  BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - DAY

        PHILLIP JEFFRIES checks into the hotel.

                                HEAD CLERK
                        Here's your key, Mr. Jeffries.  I hope you
                        enjoy your stay here at The Palm
                        Deluxe.
                              (grabs a note)
                        This is for you.  The joven...  ah...  young
                        lady...  she left it.

        Rings the bell.  A BELLHOP appears.  Young, sweating, and eager.
        Jeffries hands him the key.

                                  BELLHOP
                        612 --- very nice.

        He picks up Jeffries' bag and heads for the elevator.

47.     INT.  HALLWAY BELOW THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERA - SAME

        Cooper runs out to the hall again stares into the camera.  He stays
        there for a moment then runs back to the Surveillance Room.

48.     INT.  SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

        Cooper stares at the monitor which still shows an empty hallway.

49.     INT.  HALLWAY BELOW THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERA - SAME

        BACK ON COOPER

        He runs back out the door into the hallway.  Behind him at the end of
        the hall a door opens and _Phillip_Jeffries_who_moments_ago_was_in_
        _Buenos_Aires_ enters the hallway headed towards Cooper, but Cooper
        doesn't see him because he is staring intently into the camera as he
        has done twice before.

50.     INT.  SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

        Cooper races into the room and stares into the monitor.

51.     ON THE MONITOR

        This time Cooper is amazed to see himself staring into the camera,
        and behind him is Phillip Jeffries coming towards him and the camera.
        On the screen Jeffries walks past Cooper.

                                  COOPER
                                (shouting)
                        Gordon.

        Cooper runs into Gordon's office.

52.     INT.  GORDON'S OFFICE

        As Cooper gets to Gordon's office, Albert and Cole are standing there
        staring bug eyed at Phillip Jeffries.

                                   COLE
                        PHILLIP!

        Albert stands up.

                                  ALBERT
                        Phillip?

        Jeffries moves into the room.  Cooper steps into the office.

                                  COOPER
                        Phillip?

                                   COLE
                        COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP
                        JEFFRIES.  YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM
                        AT THE ACADEMY.

        Jeffries stares at the threesome.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        I'm not going to talk about Judy.  Keep
                        Judy out of this.

                                  COOPER
                        But...

        Cole calms Cooper.

                                   COLE
                        STAND FAST, COOP.

                                 JEFFRIES
                           (pointing at Cooper)
                        Who do you think that is there?

                                  ALBERT
                        (trying to calm Jeffries)
                        Suffered some bumps on the old noggin',
                        eh, Phil?

                                   COLE
                        WHAT THE HELL DID HE SAY?
                           (pointing at Cooper)
                        THAT'S SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER.
                          (focusing on Jeffries)
                        ARE YOU OKAY, JEFFRIES?  WHERE THE
                        HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?

                                 JEFFRIES
                        I want to tell you everything, but I don't
                        have a lot to go on.  But I'll tell you one
                        thing:  Judy is positive about this.

                                  ALBERT
                        How interesting.  I thought we were
                        going to keep Judy out of this.

        Jeffries stumbles to a chair.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Listen to me carefully.  I saw one of
                        their meetings.  It was above a
                        convenience store.

                                  ALBERT
                        Who's meeting?  Where have you been?

                                   COLE
                        FOR GOD SAKES, JEFFRIES, YOU'VE BEEN
                        GONE FOR DAMN NEAR TWO YEARS.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        It was a dream.
                         (takes Albert by the arm)
                        We live inside a dream.

                                  ALBERT
                        And it's raining Post Toasties.

                                 JEFFRIES
                                (shouting)
                        NO, NO.  I found something...  in Seattle
                        at Judy's...  And then, there they were...

        Albert is about to say something, but is stopped by Cole's gentle
        pressure on his arm.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        They sat quietly for hours.

53.     INT.  ROOM ABOVE THE CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

        SIX PEOPLE in a large, barren, filthy room.  Cheap plastic storm
        windows flap in the cold wind.  In the foreground the Man From
        Another Place (Mike) and BOB sit at a formica table.  Behind them
        on plastic torn chairs huddle MRS. TREMOND and her GRANDSON.  TWO
        BIG WOODSMEN with full beards sit quietly.

                              FIRST WOODSMAN
                                (subtitled)

                        Going up and down.  Intercourse between
                        the two worlds.

                                    BOB
                                (subtitled)
                        Light of new discoveries.

                               MRS. TREMOND
                                (subtitled)
                        Why not be composed of materials and
                        combinations of atoms?

                          MRS. TREMOND'S GRANDSON
                                (subtitled)
                        This is no accident.

                        This is a formica table.  Green is its
                        color.

        He touches the table.

                        Yes, find the middle place.

        Bob begins to scream with anger.

                                    BOB
                                (subtitled)
                        I HAVE THE FURY OF MY OWN MOMENTUM.

                             TREMOND'S GRANDSON
                                (subtitled)
                        Fell a victim.

        The Man From Another Place raises his hand.

                        Fire Walk With Me...

        Bob claps his hand and a circle of fire appears in the room.

                                    BOB
                                (subtitled)
                        Fire Walk With Me.

        THROUGH THE CIRCLE

        We see the RED ROOM.

        ON THE SCENE

        Bob crawls into the Red Room and Mike starts to yell and leaps in
        after him.

54.     BACK IN THE FBI OFFICE

                                 JEFFRIES
                        I followed.

        Jeffries begins to cry quietly at his table.

                                 JEFFRIES
                               (to himself)
                        The ring...  ring...

                                   COLE
                                 (hinting)
                        ALBERT, I'LL TAKE THAT SECOND
                        MINERAL WATER.

        After a hesitation, Albert gets the "message" and discreetly leaves
        the room.

                             COLE (continued)
                        PHILLIP, LET'S CALM DOWN AND GET ALL
                        OF THIS INTERESTING STORY ON PAPER.

        Cole tries to raise someone on the intercom but it doesn't seem to
        have any juice.

                             COLE (continued)
                            (into the speaker)
                        HELLO...  HELLO.

        He is getting nothing.  The static begins to build on the intercom.
        The wiring in the wall and the flourescent lights start to hum as
        well.

                             COLE (continued)
                        LET ME HEAR SOME GOOD NEWS.  MY
                        DEVICE IS FAULTY.  WHERE THE HELL IS
                        THE SOUND IN THIS THING?
                         (pounds on the intercom)
                        MAYDAY...

        Hearing "May", Jeffries turns and stares at a _calendar_on_the_wall_.
        Move into Jeffries.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        May?  1989?

        CLOSEUP: JEFFRIES

        Staring at the calendar.  it is 1989.

        BACK ON THE SCENE

        Cooper looks out of the room to see if anyone is coming to help Cole
        who is still trying to get the intercom to work.  The static grows
        even louder.

                                   COLE
                        WHAT...  AM I ALONE?

        Cole turns back to Jeffries.  _But_there_is_no_one_there_.  Jeffries
        is gone.  Papers from Cole's desk are now sticking to Jeffries chair.

                                   COLE
                        HE'S GONE.

                                  COOPER
                        (coming back into the room)
                        What?

                                   COLE
                        ALBERT, COME BACK HERE.  HE'S GONE
                        CALL THE FRONT DESK.

                                  ALBERT
                              (on the phone)
                        I've got the front desk right now.  He
                        never was here.  No record of him
                        entering the building...  and the doctors
                        should be here any minute.

                                   COLE
                          (frustration building)
                        GREAT.  I, MYSELF, AM GOING TO BE
                        READY FOR THEM.

                                  COOPER
                        What's going on?

        Albert rushes back into the room.

                                   COLE
                        QUICKLY MEN...  WORD ASSOCIATION,
                        COOP.  WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT
                        RIGHT NOW?

                                  COOPER
                        Teresa Banks.

                                   COLE
                        ALBERT?

                                  ALBERT
                        Tylenol.

                                   COLE
                                (to Cooper)
                        WHY ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT TERESA
                        BANKS, COOP?

                                  COOPER
                        It was a year ago today that Teresa
                        Banks was killed.  I'm wondering if the
                        murderer will ever kill again.

                                   COLE
                        ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?

                                  ALBERT
                        No offense, sir, but after a day with you
                        it is mandatory.

55.     INT.  BUENOS AIRES HOTEL CORRIDOR - SAME

        Jeffries is suddenly standing in the second story hallway of the
        Buenos Aires Palm Deluxe Hotel.  The wall behind him is seared black
        and smoking.  A terrified MAID is whimpering and scampering away from
        Jeffries trying to stave away an epileptic fit.  She is looking at
        him like he is the devil personified.

        The bellhop had run further away, but has turned back to see Jeffries
        reappear.  He is afraid to come any closer.

                                 JEFFRIES
                               (to Bellhop)
                        Hey...  hey...

                                  BELLHOP
                               (half crying)
                        Oh, Mr. Jeffries.  De shit it come out of
                        my ass!  Santa Maria, where did you go?

        They stare at each other as the blackened wall continues to smoke.

56.     INT.  SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

        Cooper and Cole sit in front of the monitor.  Cooper plays back the
        surveillance tape.  _It_shows_Jeffries_coming_up_behind_Cooper_.
        _Then_moving_past_him_.  Cooper turns to Cole.

                                  COOPER
                        He was here.

57.     EXT.  HAYWARD HOUSE

        Laura Palmer continues down the sidewalk towards us.

        On screen it reads:

                      "THURSDAY - SEVEN DAYS BEFORE"

        Laura stops and turns.  We suddenly find ourselves in front of the
        Hayward House.

                                   LAURA
                        Donna?...  Donna?...

        LAURA'S POV

        DONNA HAYWARD gathering her books and coming out the door.

                                   DONNA
                        Just a minute, Laura.

58.     ON THE SIDEWALK

        Donna joins Laura.

                                   LAURA
                        If I am going to get through math today,
                        you're going to have to bring me up to
                        speed quick.

                                   DONNA
                        You didn't do your homework?

                                   LAURA
                        Noooo...

                                   DONNA
                                  (a pal)
                        Okay, this test is going to be about the
                        theorems I told you about last week.  You
                        remember the...

                                   LAURA
                        Don't tell me now.  Tell me right before
                        the test.  I won't be able to remember
                        long enough.

                                   DONNA
                        You graduating this year will be proof
                        that miracles happen.

                                   LAURA
                        Thanks.

        Laura tweaks Donna's cheek.

                                   DONNA
                        James called me last night looking for
                        you.

                                   LAURA
                        When?

                                   DONNA
                        The usual, 9:15.

                                   LAURA
                        He probably wanted to drive over.

                                   DONNA
                        Were you with Bobby?  Or are you two
                        still fighting?

                                   LAURA
                        No, and yes.  I don't know what I'm going
                        to do about Bobby.  I know he is seeing
                        someone else and that's okay with me,
                        and he thinks I'm seeing someone else
                        and that's not okay with him.

                                   DONNA
                        Are you going to tell him about that
                        "someone else"?

                                   LAURA
                        I don't know what to do.

                                   DONNA
                        You know what your problem is?
                                 (smiles)
                        You're just too adorable...

                                   LAURA
                               (smiles back)
                        You know, I think you're right.  I'm just
                        too adorable.

        Donna grabs her and shakes her shoulders.

                                   DONNA
                                (sing-song)
                        Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.

                                   LAURA
                         (joining her - laughing)
                        I'm just too adorable.  I'm just too
                        adorable.

        They continue up the sidewalk laughing.

60.     INT.  TWIN PEAKS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

        On Laura and Donna as they walk in.

        FIVE of their ADMIRERS watch Laura and Donna with love and worship.
        They sing a kind of pining but cool CHANT with knees bent and arms
        outstretched.

                                 ADMIRERS
                        "Laura...  Donna...  Laura...  Donna..."

        On Donna as they continue down the hall.  A cool MIKE NELSON snaps
        his fingers ala Bobby for Donna to come to him.  Without missing a
        beat Donna changes directions.  Mike has to hustle to catch up with
        her.

                                   MIKE
                      (putting his arm around Donna)
                        That's why you need a real man, Babe,
                        you're tough to handle.

                                   DONNA
                        And you're the real man?

61.     INT.  OUTSIDE THE GIRL'S BATHROOM

        JAMES HURLEY moves up behind Laura and pushes close to her.

                                   LAURA
                        James...

                                   JAMES
                        Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys.

                                   LAURA
                        Okay.

        James smiles and walks off.  Laura enters the girls' room.

62.     INT.  GIRLS' ROOM - DAY

        Laura ducks into a stall and does a quick hit of cocaine.  The school
        bell rings simultaneously.

63.     INT.  HALLWAY IN FRONT OF TROPHY CASE - SAME

        BOBBY BRIGGS saunters into school - late as usual.  The corridor is
        empty.  Everyone else is in class.  He walks to Laura's portrait in
        the trophy case.  Kisses the glass protecting it.

                                   BOBBY
                        Hey, Baby.

        He continues on happy and ultra-cool to his class.

64.     SCHOOL CLOCK

        It reads:  2:30.

65.     INT.  CUSTODIAN'S ROOM - DAY

        James waits for Laura amidst the cleaning drums and brooms.  The door
        swings open and Laura slides in wearing only a towel.  They embrace
        in the half light.

                                   JAMES
                        Laura, do you love me?

                                   LAURA
                        Yes, I love you.  I've told you, but it
                        doesn't really matter.

                                   JAMES
                        Why?  It does.

                                   LAURA
                        No, it doesn't...  just kiss me.

                                   JAMES
                        It does matter.  We're in love.

                                   LAURA
                        James, you don't know what you are
                        talking about.  Quit trying to hold on so
                        tight.  I'm gone...  long gone like a turkey
                        through the corn.

                                   JAMES
                        You're not a turkey.  A turkey is one of
                        the dumbest birds on earth.

                                   LAURA
                               (small smile)
                        Gobble, gobble, gobble.

        He smiles.  She kisses him and he responds.

                                   JAMES
                        Don't ever leave, Laura, ever.  I'll never
                        leave you.

        Laura moves into him.  A hopeless embrace.  His eyes full of hope and
        Laura's empty.  She pulls him to the floor to make love.

66.     EXT.  THE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

        A bell rings and, after a moment, STUDENTS and TEACHERS start to move
        out.  Bobby catches up with Laura and Donna.

66.     CONTINUED:

                                   BOBBY
                        Where were you for the last hour?  I've
                        been lookin' for you?

                                   LAURA
                        I was right behind you, but you're too
                        dumb to turn around.
                           (laughing with Donna)
                        If he turned around he might get dizzy
                        and fall down.

        Bobby grabs her roughly and spins her around.  Students stop and
        stare.

                                   BOBBY
                               (very angry)
                        I'M NOT KIDDIN'.  WHERE WERE YOU?
                        WHO WERE YOU WITH?

                                   LAURA
                        Get lost Bobby.

                                   BOBBY
                        Oh, yeah?  You'll be callin' soon and
                        maybe I'm not gonna be there.

                                   LAURA
                           (very smooth, cooing)
                        Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of
                        your smiles.

        Bobby can't hold onto his anger.  Slowly a huge smile spreads across
        his face.

                                   BOBBY
                                 (smiling)
                        Love ya, Babe.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

67.     INT.  HAYWARD HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

        Donna and Laura.  Eating nuts.  Donna is stretched out on the sofa
        and Laura is in a chair with her legs over the top.  She is almost
        upside down.  Nothing going on.

        EILEEN HAYWARD rolls through the living room in her wheelchair and
        makes a quick check of the nut supply.

                                   LAURA
                        Hi, E.H.
                                  EILEEN
                           (with a nod to Laura)
                        L.P.
                                (to Donna)
                        D.H.

                                   DONNA
                        Mom H.

        Eileen motors out.

                             DONNA (continued)
                                (to Laura)
                        Are you going to see James tonight?

                                   LAURA
                        Why are you suddenly so interested in
                        who I am going to see at night?
                        Nighttime is my time.

                                   DONNA
                        You're telling me, but only because you
                        never let me in on any of it...  you're not
                        going to see Bobby, are you?

                                   LAURA
                        Maybe.

                                   DONNA
                        Oh god, Laura.

                                   LAURA
                        Well, why not?

                                   DONNA
                        Because Bobby is a loser, you said so
                        yourself.  He's a goon.
                          (she sighs to herself)
                        James is the  one.
                           (getting very dreamy)
                        He loves you with that "lasting love"...
                        "true love".

        Laura looks at Donna.

                                   LAURA
                        Yes, James is very sweet.  Why don't you
                        get out your violin, Donna?

                                   DONNA
                        Sweet?  God, he's gorgeous.

                                   LAURA
                        James is very sweet and very gorgeous.

        Donna drifts off.

                                   DONNA
                        I wonder if Mike could ever write a
                        poem?

        Both of them drift off.

                             DONNA (continued)
                        Do you think that if you were falling in
                        space you would slow down after a
                        while or go faster and faster?

                                   LAURA
                        Faster and faster.  For a long time you
                        wouldn't feel anything.  Then you would
                        burst into fire...  forever.

        Donna studies her friend and thinks about what she has said.  After
        a beat.

                                   DONNA
                        Maybe I better start our homework.

                                   LAURA
                        Okay, I suppose I should go home.

                                   DONNA
                        Call me.

                                   LAURA
                        Sure.  What do you want me to call you?

                                   DONNA
                        Call me anything just don't call me late
                        for dinner.

        They laugh.

68.     EXT.  PALMER HOUSE - DAY

        Laura coming home from Donna's.

69.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE

        Laura comes in the front door.  No one seems to be home.

                                   LAURA
                        Mom...  Mom?

        No answer - she heads up to her room.

70.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE, STAIRS AND FAN

        Laura moves up to her bedroom.

71.     INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - DAY

        Laura comes into her room and drops her books on her bed.  She goes
        to the window and opens it - takes a package of cigarettes out, pulls
        one out and lights it.

        She goes to her "public" diary which she keeps on her desk.  Opens it
        to page one takes out a packet full of cocaine.  Like a pro she takes
        out her "cocaine gadget" from her purse and takes a snort.  Then
        another.  Big sigh of relief.

        Now she moves to her "private" diary behind her dresser - gets a pen,
        ready to write and starts to freak out.  Pages are missing.  First,
        she discovers one, then more.

        Laura panics.  Dropping her cocaine gadget back into her purse and
        taking her private diary, she sprints from the room.

72.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE, ENTRANCE WAY - DAY

        Laura runs down the steps nearly colliding with her mom, SARAH PALMER,
        coming home with a load of groceries.  A cigarette in her mouth.

                                   SARAH
                        Laura, honey...
                       (smoke going into her tearing
                                   eyes)
                        Cigarette...  Cigarette...

        Laura takes it out of her mouth.

                                   LAURA
                        Can I take the car?

                                   SARAH
                        Sure honey, what's the hurry?

                                   LAURA
                        I forgot my books at school.

        Laura runs from the house.

                                   SARAH
                        Laura.

                                   LAURA
                        What?

        Laura looks back to see her mom dangling the car keys in front of her.
        Laura comes back to get the keys still holding the burning cigarette.
        Sarah sternly takes the cigarette from Laura's hand.  As they make the
        exchange.

                                   SARAH
                        You'll never be a smoker if you don't

                             SARAH (continued)
                        start.  I mean it.

        Takes a drag.  With barely a nod, Laura is gone.

73.     EXT.  TWO LANE BLACK TOP IN LOTOWN - DAY

        Laura speeds through Lotown in her mom's '56 Roadmaster Buick.

74.     EXT.  HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Laura skids up outside the apartment.  Then backs the car up to a
        darker, more enclosed area amongst some trees.  Cautiously, she gets
        out of the car and then hurries to Harold's door.

        AT THE DOOR

        Laura frantically knocks at the door.  HAROLD SMITH answers.

                                  HAROLD
                        Laura?

75.     INT.  HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Laura rushes past him to the sofa, opening the book for him to see.

                                   LAURA
                        My secret diary.  There are pages
                        missing.

                                  HAROLD
                        Who would do that?

                                   LAURA
                        Bob.

                                  HAROLD
                        But Bob isn't real.

                                   LAURA
                        The pages are gone.  That's real.

                                  HAROLD
                        Maybe.

                                   LAURA
                        Bob is real.  He's been "having" me since
                        I was 12.

        Stunned, Harold doesn't know what to do.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        The diary was hidden too well.  He's the
                        only one who could know where it was.
                        He's getting to know me, now.  He's real
                        He speaks to me.

                                  HAROLD
                        What does Bob say?

                                   LAURA
                                 (whisper)
                        He wants to be me...  or he will kill me.

                                  HAROLD
                        No...  No...

                                   LAURA
                                (strangely)
                        Oh, yes...  yes...

        Laura starts towards him frightening Harold.

                                  HAROLD
                        What?  Please.

        She allows the feeling of Bob to come over her and she begins to
        scream.  Harold steps back, but Laura grabs him.  To his face with
        a horrifying expression on hers.

                                   LAURA
                        FIRE WALK WITH ME.

        She buries herself on his shoulder.

                                   LAURA
                                (whispers)
                        The trees...  the trees...

        They break.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        You have to hide the diary, Harold.  You
                        made me write it all down.  He doesn't
                        know about you.  You'll be safe.

        She stares at Harold.  Her eyes widen, terrified with suspicion.

                                   LAURA
                        You're not Bob are you, Harold?  If you
                        are, you can kill me right now.  Kill me
                        right now, if you are.

                                  HAROLD
                        Laura, no, I'm not.  I'm not Bob.
                         (begins to shake and cry)
                        Poor Laura.  I wish I could help you.

        He holds her.

                                   LAURA
                        I hate him, I hate it.  Sometimes I love
                        it.  But now I'm afraid.  I am so afraid.

                                  HAROLD
                        But you're strong Laura...  so much
                        stronger than I...  How can I help you?  I
                        can't.  I can't even go outside.

        Laura reaches up and tenderly touches his cheek.

                            HAROLD (continued)
                        What about James?  Can't James help
                        you?  You two are so in love.

                                   LAURA
                                  (flat)
                        He's in love with a girl who's dead.
                          (handing him the diary)
                        It _is_ dangerous for you to have it.  I'm
                        sorry.

                                  HAROLD
                          (thinking only of her)
                        I'm so sorry, Laura.

        She pulls him to her and kisses him passionately.

                                   LAURA
                        I don't know when I can come back.
                        Maybe never.

        Laura slowly goes out the door.  Harold can only watch.

76.     EXT.  HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Laura goes out to the car.

77.     INT./EXT.  BUICK ROADMASTER - DAY

        Laura starts the car and takes a snort of cocaine.

        Laura pulls out onto the highway.  We stay with her watching her
        face - struggling with the prospects of the terrifying future.

78.     INT.  PALMER DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        Laura rushes in to find her mom setting the table.  Sarah stops and
        stares at Laura.

                                   SARAH
                        You lied to me about those school books.
                        I found them upstairs on your bed.

                                   LAURA
                         (suspicion and paranoia)
                        What were you doing in my room?

                                   SARAH
                        I was looking for that blue sweater that
                        you borrowed which I found balled up in
                        the bottom of your closet.  Now why did
                        you lie to me?  Where did you go?

                                   LAURA
                        I had to see Bobby.  I know you really
                        don't like Bobby, but there was a
                        problem and I didn't think you would
                        understand.

                                   SARAH
                        Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me.
                        Ever.  You can tell me anything.  I'll
                        understand.

                                   LAURA
                        I'm sorry, Mom.

                                   SARAH
                        Now hurry, dinner's almost ready.  Your
                        father says he's starving.

79.     INT.  PALMER DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        Laura is already at the table.  Sarah puts the rest of the dinner on
        the table and sits down just as LELAND PALMER enters from the kitchen.
        He is pretending he is a giant.  Using a voice like a giant.

                                  LELAND
                             (big giant voice)
                        Hello, Laura.  Hello Sarah.  Where's my
                        axe?
                                 (singing)
                        "I'm hungry".

                                   SARAH
                        Oh, Leland.

                                   LAURA
                               (embarrassed)
                        Dad.

                                  LELAND
                       (suddenly speaking Norwegian)
                        Hyggelig a mote dem.  Jeg Heter Leland
                        Palmer.

        Translation is:  How are you?  My name is Leland Palmer.

        Laura and Sarah stare at him.

                                  LELAND
                        The Norwegians are coming next week
                        and I want you to learn to say what I
                        just learned in Norwegian.  So you can
                        talk to them.  I want you to learn to say,
                        "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".

                                   LAURA
                        But my name isn't Leland Palmer.

                                   SARAH
                        Neither is mine.  And can't we talk
                        about something serious for a change.

                                  LELAND
                        This is serious.  Mr. Benjamin Horne's
                        got a delegation of Norwegians coming
                        in next week and I want both of you to
                        learn to introduce yourself.  Sarah, you
                        first.

        Leland repeats his phrase for Sarah's benefit.

                                  LELAND
                        Hyggelig a mote dem.  Jeg Heter Leland
                        Palmer.

        Sarah stumbles through it.

                                   SARAH
                        Hyggelig a mote dem.  Jeg Heter Sarah
                        Palmer.

        Leland repeats his phrase back to her.  Extends his hand in a friendly
        handshake.

                                  LELAND
                        Good.  We'll practice some more.  Laura,
                        now you try it.
54.

79.     CONTINUED: (2)

        Laughingly, Laura does the same thing.

                                   LAURA
                        Hyggelig a mote dem.  Jeg Heter Laura
                        Palmer.

        After Laura is done.

                                  LELAND
                        All together now...

        Leland extends a hand to each of them.  An air of insanity seems to
        come over the Palmer dining room as they all begin to laugh
        hysterically and talk in broken Norwegian.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

80.     INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

        The clock reads:  11:30.  Laura's hands open the window and release
        the screen.  Laura silently sneaks out the window and down the side
        of her house.

81.     EXT.  SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - LATER

        A big semi comes to a stop at a wide spot in the road.  Laura climbs
        into the truck.

82.     INT.  TRUCK - SAME

        The TRUCKER smiles.  Eager.

                                  TRUCKER
                        Friend of Leo's, right?  Partyland?

        Laura begins to unbutton her blouse.  Turns and sneaks a toot of
        cocaine.

                            TRUCKER (continued)
                              (catching her)
                        Wait a minute.  Leo says this is my
                        party.

        Laura puts her hand between his legs.

                                   LAURA
                        If you can fuck and drive the party
                        starts right now.

        Momentarily taken aback, the trucker stares at her.  Laura takes his
        hand and puts it on the gear shift.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        You shift that one.  This one's mine.

        She climbs over on top of him.

83.     EXT.  THE TRUCK - SAME

        The stack blows.  The truck rolls away onto the road.  We watch it as
        it moans into the distance - the sound slowly diminishing and fading.

        Natures' nighttime sounds take over.  Finally, we hear the _hooting_
        _of_an_owl_.

84.     EXT.  PHILADELPHIA FBI OFFICE - DAY

        Reestablish.

85.     INT.  OFFICE - DAY

        Albert and Cooper.

                                  ALBERT
                        Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is
                        rising up above our heads.  Do you
                        honestly think Cole's practice of word
                        association works?

                                  COOPER
                        The very fact that we are talking about
                        word association means we are in a
                        space that was opened up by our
                        practice of word association.  The
                        world is a hologram, Albert.

                                  ALBERT
                        Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus
                        ride, isn't it, Cooper?

                                  COOPER
                        Albert.

                                  ALBERT
                        You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think
                        something is going on somewhere in the
                        world right now that is connected with
                        her murder?

                                  COOPER
                        Yes.  Either right now or right when I
                        thought of it.  The name and memory of
                        Teresa Banks is haunting me.  Lately I
                        have been filled with a knowingness
                        that the murderer will strike again.
                        Because it is only a feeling, I am
                        powerless to stop it.  And another thing,
                        Albert, when the next murder happens
                        you will help me solve it.

                                  ALBERT
                        Let's test it for the record.  Will the
                        next victim be a man or a woman?

                                  COOPER
                        A woman.

                                  ALBERT
                        What color hair will she have?

                                  COOPER
                        Blonde.

                                  ALBERT
                        Tell me some other things about her.

                                  COOPER
                        She's in high school.  She's sexually
                        active.  She's on drugs.  She's crying out
                        for some help.

                                  ALBERT
                        You're describing half the high school
                        girls in America.
                            (off Cooper's look)
                        What is she doing right now?

                                  COOPER
                     (closing his eyes to see a mental
                                 picture)
                        She is preparing a great abundance of
                        food.

        Albert lets go a small laugh of disbelief and shakes his head in
        exasperation.

86.     EXT.  DOUBLE R DINER - AFTERNOON

        Establish.

87.     INT.  DOUBLE R DINER - AFTERNOON

        Laura comes out of the kitchen stacking some of her "Meals on Wheels"
        on the counter.

        On screen it reads:

                        "FRIDAY - SIX DAYS BEFORE"

        NORMA JENNINGS and SHELLY JOHNSON watch from the cash register.
        Shelly is ringing someone out, handing back their change.

                                   NORMA
                        Shelly, would you give Laura a quick
                        hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?

                                  SHELLY
                        I'm kind of busy, Norma.

                                   NORMA
                        You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.

        With a little squeeze of the hand and a gentle shove, Norma moves
        Shelly towards Laura who is at the end of the counter.

        The door opens to the Diner and ED and NADINE HURLEY come in.  Nadine
        stops when she sees Norma.

                                  NADINE
                        I changed my mind, I don't want any
                        coffee, Eddie.

        Nadine goes out.  As she walks past Ed he looks at Norma and makes a
        "What can I do" gesture.

                                    ED
                        Sorry, Norma.

        Ed goes out.

        SHELLY AND LAURA

        Shelly approaches sheepishly.

                                  SHELLY
                        Can I give you a hand getting the dinners
                        together?

                                   LAURA
                        That's alright, Shelly.  I know you have
                        better things to do.

                                  SHELLY
                          (disregarding the jab)
                        Norma asked me to give you a hand.

                                   LAURA
                        Okay.  You can help me carry them to the
                        car.

        Shelly gathers up a pile of the dinners and takes them out to the
        "Meals on Wheels" car.

88.     EXT.  THE DOUBLE R - DAY

        Shelly loads her stuff in the back.  She returns to the diner and
        Laura follows doing the same.

        As Laura places her dinners in the back something catches her eye and
        she turns.

        LAURA'S POV

        Mrs. Tremond and her grandson are standing in the parking lot staring
        at Laura.  Mrs. Tremond waves to Laura to come over.  When Laura comes
        to them Mrs. Tremond holds out a framed picture.

                                  TREMOND
                        This would look nice on your wall.

        She hands Laura the picture.  It is a picture of a room with flowered
        wallpaper and a dark doorway in its corner.  Laura's study of it is
        interrupted by the grandson.

                                 GRANDSON
                        He's looking for a book with pages torn
                        out.  He's walking towards the hiding
                        place.  He's moving under the fan now.

        ANOTHER ANGLE

        Shelly comes out of the Diner with another load of meals.  Laura turns
        back to her and then back to the Tremonds, who are walking away from
        her and are farther away than they realistically could be.  Laura
        comes to Shelly in a panic.

                                   LAURA
                        Shelly, you really can help me.  I can't
                        do the "Meals on Wheels" today.  I just
                        can't.

                                  SHELLY
                        Okay.

        Laura runs off.  Shelly puts her load into the car as she watches
        Laura.

89.     INT.  DOUBLE R - DAY

        Shelly goes to Norma.

                                  SHELLY
                        Laura just took off.  She asked me to do
                        the run today.  Should I do it?

                                   NORMA
                        What's with that Laura?  Yeah, sure,
                        take a look around.  There's no one here
                        anyway.

                                  SHELLY
                        You're right.  There's no one here.

                                   NORMA
                        There's no one here.

                                  SHELLY
                        Norma, are you alright?

        Norma just turns away and picks up some dirty dishes.

                                   NORMA
                        Come back as soon as you can.

                                  SHELLY
                        If Leo comes here, he won't believe that
                        I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".

                                   NORMA
                        Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.

        Shelly leaves the diner.

        ON NORMA

        In the empty diner Norma walks over and sits in a booth.  She studies
        the empty diner.  After a while the cook, TOAD, calls from the
        kitchen.  A distant forlorn call.

                                   TOAD
                        Kind of quiet.

        CLOSEUP:  ON NORMA

        She starts to cry.

90.     EXT.  PALMER HOUSE - DAY

        Laura runs home.  Holding the picture from Mrs. Tremond throughout.

                                   LAURA
                            (frantic whispers)
                        He's looking for the book, he's going to
                        the hiding place!

        LAURA'S POV

        She stops and stares.  Her house suddenly looks very frightening to
        her.  She slowly crosses her front yard and enters the house.

91.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE - DAY

        Laura comes in the front door still holding the picture.  She crosses
        thru the dining room.

92.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE, STAIRS - DAY

        Laura moves ever so slowly up the stairs - the fan still and silent
        above her.

        At the top of the stairs, she stops and stares at her bedroom door.
        Her whole body is shaking.  Her hand goes out in front of her.  She
        touches her bedroom door and inches it open.

93.     INT.  LAURA'S BEDROOM - DAY

        The opening of the door reveals more and more of her room.  Suddenly
        it reveals Bob standing in her room at her dresser.  He has pulled
        the dresser away from the wall looking for something.

        ON BOB

        He is frozen.  Smiling at her.

        ON THE SCENE

        With a scream, Laura bolts from her room.

94.     EXT.  PALMER HOUSE - SAME

        Laura races out of the house still holding Tremond's picture.

95.     EXT.  PALMER'S NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE

        Laura runs across two yards to a large tree and falls to her knees,
        crying.  She looks up and sees her father come out the front door of
        her house.  She watches him cross to his car and drive away.

                                   LAURA
                             (frantic whisper)
                        What?  It can't be...  It can't be him...  no...
                        no...

        Laura is coming apart, sobbing.  Behind her, on the sidewalk,
        a NEIGHBOR has noticed her.

                                   WOMAN
                        Laura...

        A closer look reveals how upset Laura is.

                                   WOMAN
                        What...  Laura are you all right?

        Laura turns away so the woman can't see her crying.  The woman takes
        a couple of steps off the sidewalk onto the grass.

                                   LAURA
                       (trying to hold it together)
                        I...  lost my necklace...  it must have
                        fallen.

        Laura mimes that she has found her gold half-heart necklace.  She
        pretends to be clasping her gold half-heart necklace which was already
        around her neck.

                                   LAURA
                                (clumsily)
                        Oh, here it is.

        Woman moves back to the sidewalk.

                                   WOMAN
                        Well, I'm glad you found it, darling.

        Slowly, Laura stands and moves away - leaving Mrs. Tremond's picture
        on the grass under the tree.

96.     EXT.  PALMER HOUSE

        Laura stands in front of her house.  Terrified.

97.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE - SAME

        No Bob.  Listens to the house...  stands in the entrance way.

98.     LIVING ROOM - SAME

        Laura listens.  Hears nothing.

99.     STAIRS AND HALLWAY

        She stops and stares at the fan then slowly makes her way up the
        stairs towards her room.

100.    INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - SAME

        No Bob in her room.  The dresser is back in its place.  Laura races
        out.

101.    EXT.  PALMER NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY

        Laura runs down the sidewalk.

102.    INT.  HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY

        Donna answers the door.  Laura stands there out of breath.

                                   DONNA
                        Laura?

                                   LAURA
                        Donna, are you my best friend?

                                   DONNA
                        Of course...

        Laura dives toward Donna and into a hug.

                                   DONNA
                        What is it Laura?  What's wrong?

                                   LAURA
                        I just want a friend.  Just one friend for
                        just one minute...

                                   DONNA
                        Laura, how about one friend for the rest
                        of your whole life?

                                   LAURA
                        Yes, that's what I want.  Thanks D.

                                   DONNA
                        Okay, L.
                     (looks into Laura's eyes, a step
                       toward confronting something
                                 unspoken)
                        I am your friend...  always.  But
                        sometimes...  lately...  I feel that you
                        don't like being around me because I am
                        so uptight.
                            (off Laura's look)
                        No, I am uptight.  I hate it...  I don't want
                        to be this way, but Laura I don't...  I
                        mean...  I'm your friend no matter what
                        way you are.

                                   LAURA
                        You know, even when I think about your
                        face I get happier.

        They go in and sit down on the couch.

                                   DONNA
                        Do you want to talk?

                                   LAURA
                        No, I want to smoke.

        She digs for a cigarette in her purse.

                                   DONNA
                        I'm in a mess today, too.
                             (takes a breath)
                        I'm thinking about doing it with Mike.
                        What do you think?

                                   LAURA
                      (still looking for a cigarette)
                        Donna, you are such a crack up.  You
                        don't even like Mike.  Is this what you
                        are going to do to show me you are not
                        uptight.

                                   DONNA
                        This is about sex, not like.
                          (yells to the kitchen)
                        Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have
                        one of those huckleberry muffins.
                                (to Laura)
                        You want a muffin?

                                   LAURA
                        If I can smoke it.

                                   DONNA
                        You want a muffin?

                                   LAURA
                        Donna, you are a muffin.

        They hear DOC HAYWARD in the kitchen.  He walks in with a magician's
        handkerchief.  With a flourish he tries to pull something out of it.
        Instead he stands there empty handed.

                                    DOC
                        The red rose.  Where is the red rose?
                               (frustrated)
                        You know the light at Sparkwood and
                        21?  It worked right there.  I just did it
                        right there.

        Laura finds a cigarette finally and lights it.

                                    DOC
                        (stands and stares at Laura
                                 smoking)
                        Why is it that you can't smoke at your
                        home and I'm a doctor and I don't allow
                        smoking in my home and I let you smoke
                        in my home?

                                   LAURA
                        (smiling her killer smile)
                        Because you love me so much.

                                    DOC
                        I do love you, you little smoking
                        whipper snapper.

        Eileen Hayward brings out the muffins on her lap in her wheel chair.
        All four have muffins.

                                  EILEEN
                        These muffins each have at least seven
                        full huckleberries in them.

        While eating Doc takes out a piece of paper and stares blankly at it.
        The girls exchange glances about what Dad is doing as they chew on
        the muffins.  Doc is struggling.

                                   DONNA
                        Dad, what in the world are you doing?

                                    DOC
                        What the hell is this?

        Donna peeks over his shoulder.

                                   DONNA
                        It's a prescription.

                                    DOC
                        Is it?

                                   DONNA
                        Dad.

                                    DOC
                        My handwriting is so bad that now I
                        can't even read it.  You girls better
                        hurry up and graduate from high school
                        so you can take care of me.

                              DONNA AND LAURA
                        We'll take care of you.

        They go over to Doc and give him a knuckle rub.  Eileen laughs along
        with the two girls.  The phone rings and Doc gets it.

                                    DOC
                              (on the phone)
                        Yep, she's right here, Leland...
                                (to Laura)
                        It's for you.  It's your father.

        Laura goes tentatively to the phone.

                                   LAURA
                        Hello...

                              LELAND'S VOICE
                        Time to come home for dinner, honey.

        Laura hangs up the phone.

                                   LAURA
                        I gotta go.

        Donna leads Laura to the door.  There is something wrong and Donna
        is beginning to feel it.  Donna tries to cheer her up.

                                   DONNA
                        Goodbye, Muffin.

                                   LAURA
                        No, you're the muffin.

        Laura leaves.  As Donna closes the door, Laura calls back to her.

                                   LAURA
                        No, you're right.  I am the muffin.

103.    INT.  PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT

        Laura comes in the door and there is Leland at the dining room table
        ready for dinner.  Leland sees her.

                                  LELAND
                        Hi, honey, how's Donna?

                                   LAURA
                        Fine.

                                  LELAND
                        School?

                                   LAURA
                        ...school's fine...

                                  LELAND
                        Sit down...  sit down...  Are you hungry?

                                   LAURA
                        Not really.
66.

103.    CONTINUED:

        Laura just plops into her seat.

                                  LELAND
                        You didn't wash your hands before you
                        sat down for dinner did you?

        From across the table Leland looks at her fingernails.  He stands to
        come for a closer look.

                                  LELAND
                        Let me see.

                                   LAURA
                        Dad...

        CLOSEUP: LAURA'S RING FINGERNAIL

                                  LELAND
                        Your hands are filthy...  look, there is
                        dirt way under this fingernail.

        Sarah, cigarette draped from her lips, is delivering some mashed
        potatoes to the table.

                                   SARAH
                        Leland, what are you doing?

                                  LELAND
                        Look at this finger here.

        He is looking at THE FINGER.

                                   SARAH
                        Leland...

                                  LELAND
                        Laura didn't wash her hands before
                        dinner.
                          (noticing the necklace)
                        And look at this.

        He reaches for it.  Laura's hand flies up and stops him.  Leland's
        other hand comes up and she lets him take the HALF HEART out.

                                  LELAND
                        Oh, is this from a lover?

        Laura has no response.

                            LELAND (continued)
                        Did you get this from your lover?

                                   SARAH
                        They don't call them lovers in high
                        school, Leland.

                        Bobby didn't give you this?

                                   SARAH
                        How would you know if Bobby didn't give
                        her that?

        Leland starts pinching Laura's cheek.

                                  LELAND
                            (as he is pinching)
                        Did Bobby give you that or is there
                        someone new?

                                   SARAH
                        Leland leave her alone...  She doesn't like
                        that.  Stop it.

                                  LELAND
                        How do you know what she doesn't like?

        A beat then a return to what is normal.

                                   SARAH
                        Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you
                        dinner.

                                  LELAND
                        Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are
                        going to start eating till Laura goes and
                        washes her hands.

        Leland sits stoically.  Laura rises from the table.

104.    INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

        As Laura washes her hands, she stares at her reflection.  Terrified.

        LAURA'S CLOCK

        It says:  10:35.

106.    INT.  LELAND AND SARAH'S BEDROOM

        Sarah and Leland get ready for bed.  Leland stops, stands frozen for
        a moment, then begins to cry.

                                   SARAH
                        What is it, Leland?

        Leland can barely speak.

                                  LELAND
                        I can't remember the last time I told
                        Laura that I loved her.

        Sarah goes to Leland.  They embrace, tenderly, across the many years
        of their strained marriage.

                                   SARAH
                        Well, honey, go in and tell her now.

107.    INT.  LAURA'S BEDROOM

        Laura stares at the hands of the clock.  With a start, she looks up.
        Her father is in her room.  He stands in the doorway.

                                  LELAND
                        Laura, honey...

        He moves to her and touches her face.

                            LELAND (continued)
                        I love you.  I love you so much.

        Laura can hardly speak.  She squeezes his hand.

                                  LELAND
                        Goodnight, Princess.

        He leaves the room.  Laura watches the door close.  She sits frozen
        for a moment, with a tear in her eye, then she remembers something.

        MRS. TREMOND'S PICTURE

        The picture lies there in the night dew under the tree in the
        neighbor's yard.

108.    EXT.  PALMER HOUSE, OUTSIDE LAURA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Laura goes down the trellises and runs across the lawn.

109.    EXT.  NEIGHBOR'S LAWN - NIGHT

        Laura hunts around the tree for the picture, finally finds it.  She
        runs back towards her house.

110.    INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - NIGHT

        Laura climbs through the window and hangs the picture on a little
        hook on the wall and crawls into bed.  She turns off the light and
        stares at the picture in the dark.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

111.    INT.  LAURA PALMER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

        She is asleep.

112.    MRS. TREMOND'S PICTURE

        We hold on the picture.  As if by magic, we suddenly begin to move
        into the picture - into the room in the picture and thru the dark
        doorway in the room in the picture.

        On the other side of the dark doorway there is another room.
        Mrs. Tremond is standing in that room.  She is beckoning us towards
        her and beyond her thru yet another doorway.  We move thru the second
        doorway and on the other side of that doorway there is another room.

        Mrs. Tremond's grandson is standing in that room.  He is holding his
        hands above him as if he is grasping an imaginary glass ball.  As we
        move towards the space between his hands a ring of fire appears there
        and we move thru that into...

113.    INT.  RED ROOM

        The MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE walks into the red room to a table.
        A ring lies upon the table.

        COOPER ENTERS THE RED ROOM.  The Man From Another Place turns toward
        Cooper.

                          MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE
                        Is it future?  Or is it past?...  Do you
                        know who I am?...  I am the Arm...  And I
                        sound like this...

        The Man From Another Place puts his hand in front of his lips and
        makes an Indian Whooping sound.

        The Man From Another Place picks up the ring and moves it very close
        to us.  We recognize it as Teresa Banks' ring.  The symbols on the
        ring are identical to the symbols of Owl Cave.

        Cooper seems concerned.

                                  COOPER
                                (to camera)
                        Don't take the ring...  Laura, don't take
                        the ring.

        The Man From Another Place moves the ring towards us till the ring
        fills the screen.

114.    BACK IN LAURA'S ROOM

        Laura in a somnambular state is half awakened by a noise.  She tries
        to move her left arm, but it has fallen asleep.  She moves it with
        her right arm.

        SFX: THE NOISE

        It sounds as if someone is calling her name.

        ON LAURA

        She turns to her right to see who it is, then turning back to her left
        she discovers ANNIE BLACKBURN lying in bed with her.  Annie has blood
        around her mouth.  She tries to raise herself and strains to speak.

                                   ANNIE
                        My name is Annie.  I've been with Laura
                        and Dale.  The good Dale is in the lodge
                        and he can't leave.  Write it in your
                        diary.

        ON LAURA'S DOOR

        Her mother calls her name.  The sound is distant and mournful.

        ON LAURA

        Laura looks towards her door then turns back to Annie but she is gone.
        Filled with fear she looks down and in her hand is Teresa Banks' ring.
        SHE SCREAMS.  Again, her attention is drawn to her door and her
        mother's distant call.  Still holding the ring she gets out of bed
        and goes to her door and slowly opens it.

        It is dark on the other side of the door.

        AT THE DOORWAY OF LAURA'S BEDROOM

        In the doorway Laura gets a strange feeling in back of her and turns
        to look at Mrs. Tremond's picture.  There in the picture is Laura
        (herself) in the doorway looking back into the darkened rooms where
        Mrs. Tremond and her grandson were.

115.    MRS. TREMOND'S PICTURE

        Laura is in the picture.  In the picture Laura turns around in the
        doorway of the picture and looks down at her room.

116.    LAURA'S PICTURE POV OF HER ROOM

        Laura sees herself asleep in her bed.

        CLOSEUP: LAURA

        Asleep in her bed.

        ON THE SCENE

        She wakes up from her dream.  Trying to clear her head.  Looks at the
        photo and nothing is there -- looks like the day before.  She looks
        in her hand and the ring is gone.

        Laura gets out of bed and goes to Mrs. Tremond's picture hanging on
        the wall.  She stares at it.  She slowly takes it off the wall and
        places it in the trash.  Trembling she does two lines of cocaine.

        James comes by on his bike.  He beeps out a signal on the bike's horn.
        After a beat Laura runs out to him.

                                   JAMES
                        Where were you last night?  We were
                        supposed to get together.  You didn't
                        show up.

                                   LAURA
                        You were supposed to show up.  Maybe I
                        wasn't.

                                   JAMES
                        We were supposed to be together.

                                   LAURA
                        How can I be together if I'm not
                        together?

                                   JAMES
                        You're on somethin' again, aren't you?

                                   LAURA
                        James...

                                   JAMES
                        When am I going to see you?

        Leland comes out the door of the house.  Looks at Laura and James.
        Laura can feel him staring.

                                   LAURA
                        I gotta go.

        James just looks at her then guns his bike and roars away.

        Laura walks back to the front door where her father stands.

                                  LELAND
                        Who was that?

                                   LAURA
                        A friend from school.

                                  LELAND
                        A special friend?

        Laura looks at her Dad, eyeball to eyeball for a moment.  Then she
        walks past him to the stairs.

118.    INT.  THE STAIRWAY - DAY

        The fan turns slowly as Laura goes up the stairs.

                                BOB'S VOICE
                        Laura.

        Laura's head snaps around.

                                   LAURA
                        No...  No, go away.

                                BOB'S VOICE
                        I'm glad you let me talk to you.  You
                        used to not let me talk to you.

                                   LAURA
                        Go away.  I am not talking to you.

                                BOB'S VOICE
                        I want you.

        Sarah Palmer is at the bottom of the stairs.

                                   SARAH
                        Laura?

        Laura jumps.

                                   SARAH
                        Laura, now I can't find that blue
                        sweater.  Did you take it again?

                                   LAURA
                        Mom...  what are you wearing?

        Sarah looks down.  She is wearing the sweater that she is looking for.

                                   SARAH
                        My god, I am going to have another
                        breakdown.  God, god.

                                   LAURA
                        Mom, take it easy.

        Laura starts down the stairs towards her mother.

                                   SARAH
                        No, no... this can't be happening.

        Laura holds her mother.

                                   LAURA
                        Mom, you're not having a nervous
                        breakdown.

        Sarah pulls away from Laura and wanders into the living room.  Laura
        watches her go feeling helpless.

119.    INT.  JOHNSON'S KITCHEN - DAY

        LEO JOHNSON is ragging on Shelly.  He is down on his hands and knees
        showing her how to scrub the floor.

                                    LEO
                        Someone who knows how to clean knows
                        where the object was before she
                        started cleaning and then that object
                        goes back to its exact same spot.
                        Shelly, I know where everything in this
                        house is.  Sometimes on the road I
                        mentally go through this whole house
                        and picture where every item is.

                                  SHELLY
                        Lay off the bennies, Leo.

                                    LEO
                          (continuing his tirade)
                        Anybody can clean the surface of an
                        object, but dirt can find its way
                        anywhere.  To really clean, you have to
                        scrub below the surface.
                                (shouting)
                        WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY.

        He scrubs more.

                              LEO (continued)
                        That's one thing you are going to learn,
                        Shelly, - HOW TO CLEAN.  It takes
                        scrubbing, Shelly.  There is no easy way.
                        THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.

                                  SHELLY
                        As if I didn't know.

                                    LEO
                        I'm going to show you how to wash this
                        tile and then you're going to do it.

                                  SHELLY
                        Come off it, Leo.  I'm late for work...

                                    LEO
                        What did you say?

        Leo goes over the top pulls Shelly down to the floor.

                                    LEO
                        Shelly, I am not fooling around anymore.
                        The first thing you've got to WORK on is
                        a good attitude.  That's the key.
                        Anybody will tell you that.

        Gives her a good shot to the back of the head.  Shelly falls to the
        floor.  The phone rings.  Leo gets up to get the phone.

                                    LEO
                        Don't even _think_ about going anywhere,
                        Shelly.  I'm not finished with you.

        He answers the phone.

                                    LEO
                        What are you doing calling me here?...
                        No way, you already owe me money...
                        Five thousand, to be exact.

        Leo looks over at Shelly suspiciously.  (Did she hear him mention the
        five thousand?)

                                  SHELLY
                          (silently mouthing it)
                        Five Thousand???

120.    INT.  DOUBLE R - DAY

        Bobby is calling from the pay phone at the diner.  We hear the end of
        the conversation with Leo.  Bobby hangs up.  He puts in another
        quarter and dials again.  The phone rings on the other end.

121.    INT.  ROADHOUSE - DAY

        A nearly empty Roadhouse.  JACQUES RENAULT answers the phone behind
        the bar.

                                  JACQUES
                        How come you only call me when you are
                        desperate?  Are you desperate, baby?

                                                        INTERCUT WITH:

122.    INT.  DOUBLE R - DAY

        BOBBY

                                   BOBBY
                        You interested or not?

                                  JACQUES
                        Maybe, Bobby, baby.  Maybe.  I have
                        friend who has what you want. His
                        stuff is the best.

        Bobby starts to write information down on a napkin.

                                   BOBBY
                                 (excited)
                        Jacques...  you crazy Canadian.  This
                        sounds BIG...

123.    EXT.  PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT

        Donna drives up in her car and gets out.

124.    INT.  PALMER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        Laura is having a quick shot from the family liquor cabinet.  A knock
        on the door.  Laura pulls a jacket on and goes to the door.  Opens it
        and sees Donna.  Donna looks at her coat.

                                   DONNA
                        Where are you going?

                                   LAURA
                        No place, fast.
                                (a warning)
                        And you're not coming.

                                   DONNA
                        Come on, Laura.  I'm your best friend.

        They move back into the living room.

                                   LAURA
                            (change of subject)
                        Isn't tonight the night you are going to
                        do it with Mike?

                                   DONNA
                        Laura, aren't you going to fix me a
                        drink?

        Laura shoots her a look.

                                   DONNA
                        Where are the Cookies?

                                   LAURA
                        You mean Fred and Ginger?

                                   DONNA
                        Dancing.

        Donna looks around at all the ashtrays filled to the brim with butts.

                                   DONNA
                        (looking at the cigarettes)
                        If I had a nickel for every cigarette your
                        mom smoked, I'd be dead.

                                   LAURA
                        Gotta go, Donna.  I'll call you tomorrow.

        Laura leaves the house.  Donna trails behind.

125.    EXT.  PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT

        Laura gets into her Mom's Roadmaster and takes off.  Donna watches
        her go and gets in her car and follows.

126.    INT.  THE ROADMASTER - NIGHT

        At the first stop sign Laura takes another hit of cocaine.

127.    EXT.  ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

        Laura parks her car and gets out.  At the entrance to the Roadhouse
        she meets the LOG LADY, who seems to be waiting for her.  She steps
        close to Laura.

                                 LOG LADY
                        When this kind of fire starts.  it is very
                        hard to put out.

        The Log Lady touches her.  Her hand is cooling on Laura's head.
        Laura moves in behind it.  Pushing the cool hand into her face and
        forehead.

                                   LAURA
                                (whispers)
                        Margaret?

                                 LOG LADY
                        The tender bows of innocence burn first
                        and the wind rises - then all goodness
                        is in jeopardy.

        They look into each other's eyes.  The Log Lady turns and leaves.

128.    INT.  ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

        LOTS OF BIKERS and the usual gang.  On stage a SINGER sings.

        As Laura comes in she makes eye contact with Jacques Renault who is
        behind the bar.  Laura sits at a table.

        Jacques nods to a COUPLE of BURLY TRUCKERS who come over to Laura
        with drinks.  One of them slides her a fifty with a packet of cocaine
        inside.

                                  TRUCKER
                        Let's go around the world, babe.

                                   LAURA
                        This isn't going to get you to Walla-
                        Walla.

        They all take a drink.

                                  TRUCKER
                        You do go all the way, don't you, little
                        girl?

                                   LAURA
                        Sooner or later.

        Laura reaches below the table grabbing him hard by the balls.

                                   LAURA
                        You willing to go all the way?  Huh?  You
                        wanna do it for me.  All the way for me
                        means all the way - DEAD.

        The trucker turns a couple of shades towards white.  Donna comes in
        just as a beautiful song of lost love begins.

        Laura and Donna see each other -- As the truckers toss down bourbons
        and beer chasers, Laura gets _lost_in_the_song_and_starts_to_cry_.
        Donna just stares at her from the other side of the Roadhouse.

        AFTER THE SONG

        Donna stands and walks over to Laura's table.  She reaches down,
        picks up one of the trucker's bourbons and downs it.

                                   DONNA
                        Let's boogie.

                                  TRUCKER
                                (to Donna)
                        You part of the deal?

                                   LAURA
                            (answering for her)
                        No, she isn't.

        Laura and Donna stare at each other.  For Donna's benefit, Laura
        turns and gives a big, juicy French kiss to one of the truckers.

                                   LAURA
                             (to the trucker)
                        What was your name again?

                                  TRUCKER
                        Buck.

                                   LAURA
                        Buck, that was really nice.

        Donna grabs Buck's buddy, TOMMY, and gives him the same type kiss.

                             LAURA (continued)
                              (very serious)
                        All right, Donna.  Let's go.

129.    EXT.  HIGHWAY 21 - NIGHT

        The car barrels down the highway.  It's a beat up Chevy Biscayne,
        with a hot monster engine under the hood.

130.    INT.  CAR (BISCAYNE) - NIGHT

        Tommy drives sitting next to a case of ice cold beer.  Donna and
        Laura sandwich Buck in the back seat.  Donna takes a long swig of
        beer.  Laura hides a hit of cocaine from Donna.

                                   DONNA
                        (to Laura, a little afraid)
                        What are you doing?

                                   LAURA
                        Nothing.

        Laura laughs at Donna then holds a beer up to show Donna, then turns
        and French kisses Buck.  Donna reaches forward to the front dash and
        turns the radio up full blast.  Buck and Tommy start to whoop and
        yodel like cowboys.

        Buck does an Indian whoop in Laura's face.  Laura freezes in horror.

131.    FLASHBACK:  THE RED ROOM

        The Man From Another Place (The Arm) yodels.

132.    INT.  CAR (BISCAYNE)/HIGHWAY 21

        Slowly Laura reaches over and touches Buck's face and arm.  Buck
        uncorks another yodel.  The fear leaves Laura.

                                   DONNA
                                (to Laura)
                        I'm goin' for it.

        Donna starts making out with Buck.

133.    EXT.  BORDER TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

        Establish.  Tommy takes the car like a rocket into the parking lot
        and does a complete three sixty before rocking to a stop.  Several
        big rigs shadow the lot.  They all pop out of Buck's car sporting
        "long necks".

        Laura takes a hit of cocaine and looks up to see Donna watching.
        Buck circles Donna with his big arm and puts a toot under her nose.

                                   DONNA
                        No.
                             (turns to Laura)
                        I don't need to take this to be you
                        friend.

                                   LAURA
                        YES YOU DO, DONNA.  What a downer you
                        are!!!

                                   BUCK
                     (pointing to skid marks behind a
                             heat popping car)
                        Hey, Tommy, Jacques beat us here.

                                   TOMMY
                        Hold on, I'm chokin' the farm fed.

        Tommy stands in the lot with his back to them, pissing.

134.    INT.  BORDER TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

        The front room is a bar and restaurant with about THREE PATRONS.
        Above the bar is a sign that reads:

                   CAN - A - DO and U.S. OF FUCKIN' "A"

        The BARTENDER presses a release underneath the counter that allows
        Laura to take her three friends thru a door over which a sign hangs
        announcing in red neon letters:

                                "PARTYLAND"

135.    INT.  PARTYLAND

        The group enters a large room with the filthiest wall to wall carpet
        imaginable.  In the back corner is a small stage.  On it a three
        piece HELL-METAL BAND is building up toward oblivion.  The LEAD SINGER
        is dressed in a buffalo skin complete with at least half the buffalo
        head and horns.  He wears spray painted, day glow orange cowboy boots.

        Some HALF DRESSED GIRLS and COWBOYS are dancing to the band.  In
        darkened corners away from the stage other groups are racing the
        band to oblivion.

        Laura leans over to Donna noticing her shocked look.

                                   LAURA
                        Don't expect a turkey dog in here.

        Jacques Renault comes up to the group.

                                  JACQUES
                        Hey, slow pokes, guess what?  There's no
                        tomorrow.

        He grabs Laura up and gives her a big, sloppy wet kiss.

                                  JACQUES
                        Baby, you know why?  Cause it'll never
                        get here.

                                   LAURA
                        Hey, Jacques...

                                  JACQUES
                                 (slurred)
                        No "Jacques".  I am the Great Went.

                                   LAURA
                                (for Donna)
                        I am The Muffin.

                                  JACQUES
                        And what a muffin you have.

        The two truckers laugh with Jacques.  He mimes a gun with his right
        hand and pointing it to his forehead pulls the trigger with a weak,
        slack cheeked puff sound.

                                  JACQUES
                                 (slurred)
                        I am as blank as a fart.

        Laura winks at Buck as he SECRETLY drops a red depth charge into
        Donna's beer.

                                   LAURA
                        Hey, Donna, chug-a-lug.

        As the cowboys gather around and begin to chant, both Laura and Donna
        chug down their drinks.  They finish and Laura smiles and pushes
        Donna out onto the dance floor.

        They start to dance expertly and smile at each other.  Soon Buck and
        Tommy cut in separating the two.

        Buck dances Laura over to ANOTHER of his buddies.  The two of them
        start to unbutton Laura's blouse as they dance.

        The hell-metal band kicks into high gear.  In the pulsating red and
        black light Donna sees Laura now topless dancing and kissing with
        Buck and his friend.  Donna stops.  Jacques sweeps in.

                                  JACQUES
                        Oh, Laura's friend.  I am "The Great
                        Went".

        Jacques holds her head in his huge hands.

                            JACQUES (continued)
                        There is no tomorrow.

        DONNA'S POV

        The room starts to spin.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        WE MOVE AROUND THRU THE EVENING

136.    INT.  ROADHOUSE

        DONNA

        A completely stoned Donna is being dances around by Tommy, who is
        falling in love with her.  Through some dancing legs and feet she
        spots Laura's blouse on the floor.  Teetering she leans over, picks
        up the blouse, and ties it around her waist.

        RONETTE PULASKI, flying high, makes her way through the crowd to
        Laura.  They spot each other and give each other a hug.

                                  RONETTE
                        You smell nice.

                                   LAURA
                        Haven't seen you since I was thrown out
                        of One Eyed Jacks.

                                  RONETTE
                        (trying to focus on Laura)
                        What else did we do together?  Oh, I
                        remember...
                        (tries to dance with Laura)
                        Hey, you know what?  It's been a year.
                        She's been dead a year...  she's been dead
                        a year.

        Jacques comes up to them.

                                  JACQUES
                        The party twins.  My high school
                        sandwich.  Let's put some meat inside...

        The three of them move around together.

                                  RONETTE
                        She's been dead a year.

                                  JACQUES
                        Who?

                                  RONETTE
                        Teresa...

                                   LAURA
                        Teresa Banks?  Yeah, a whole year.

                                  RONETTE
                        Yeah, she was going to get rich...  she
                        was blackmailing somebody...

                                  JACQUES
                        That's right.  She called me.  She even
                        asked me what your fathers looked
                        like...

                                   LAURA
                                 (jolted)
                        What?  She asked about my father?

                                  JACQUES
                        But it wasn't him...  she was after a huge
                        guy, six foot four with a broken nose.
                        She said he looked just like a boxer.
                        Speaking of sandwiches...  I think Bobby
                        was arranging something for you...
                              (gets the idea)
                        Speaking of arrangements...
                                 (louder)
                        SPEAKING OF ARRANGEMENTS...  Why
                        don't you two come up to the cabin this
                        week?  Leo and I know that Santy Claus
                        is coming to town...  Thursday.

        Ronette, Laura, and Jacques sway with distorted smiles.

                             RONETTE AND LAURA
                       (as they hug and almost kiss)
                        Okay, Jacques.

                                   LAURA
                         (turning to kiss Jacques)
                        "The Great Went".

        Buck and another FRIEND move in on Laura and Ronette.  Buck pushes
        Laura down on the carpet and gets on behind her.  His friend does
        the same to Ronette.  The two girls find themselves face to face.

                                  RONETTE
                        Here we go again.  Like we're back at
                        One Eyed Jacks.

                                   LAURA
                          (moaning with pleasure)
                        Oh, god.  It sure is.

        Ronette looks over Laura's shoulder.

                                  RONETTE
                        Shit, is that Donna Hayward?

        Laura looks across the rug through dancing legs and sees Donna's head
        tilted way back with some NEW COWBOY on top of her.

        CLOSEUP: LAURA'S FACE

        Seeing Donna.

                                BOB'S VOICE
                        SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO
                        DONNA?

                                   LAURA
                                (screaming)
                        NO!  GOD, NO...

        ON THE SCENE

        Laura stumbles and runs to Donna grabbing Jacques on the way.

                             LAURA (continued)
                          (screaming to Jacques)
                        Get her out of here...  get her out.

        He doesn't seem to be listening.

                             LAURA (continued)
                                (shouting)
                        JACQUES...

        Laura falls full of panic to Donna.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Donna, what are you doing?

        Rips her blouse off her waist.  Donna is completely gone.  Laura
        shakes her and screams into her face.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever
                        wear my stuff.  Never.

                                   DONNA
                                (mumbling)
                        Okay, I won't wear your stuff...  Why
                        can't I wear your stuff?

                                   LAURA
                        Jacques, help me get her home.  NOW!

        Jacques lifts Donna up and Laura follows Jacques and Donna out of
        Partyland.  Donna continues to mumble.

                                   DONNA
                        I won't wear your stuff.
                              (then laughing)
                        I promise.

                                   LAURA
                      (crying, holding Donna's hand)
                        Not you, Donna, not you.

137.    EXT.  TWIN PEAKS CHURCH - SUNDAY MORNING

        On the screen it reads:

                        "SUNDAY - FOUR DAYS BEFORE"

        FOLKS filing out of church.  A COUPLE strolling down the sidewalk.
        A happy dog bounds about.

138.    EXT.  BIG ED'S GAS FARM AND THE HURLEY HOUSE - DAY

        Out in the yard of the Hurley House Ed Hurley tries to skin a deer
        which is hanging off a branch of a tree.  He is not having much luck
        and is not showing much enthusiasm either.  Nadine Hurley comes
        storming out the house with her own very large butcher knife - very
        upset with Ed's progress.

                                  NADINE
                        ED...  ED.
                            (pushing him away)
                        I'll take over here.

        Ed backs off and Nadine dives in slicing.

                                  NADINE
                        You were cutting this deer like a
                        sissy...  Sit down and watch while I do
                        it.  AGAIN.  THIS YEAR.

        Ed slowly backs into the house.

139.    INT.  HURLEY HOUSE - DAY

        Ed joins his assistant, SPARKY, and they stand in the living room
        gazing out the window at Nadine ferociously skinning the deer.

                                    ED
                               (with a wink)
                        Works every year...

        They laugh.

                                  SPARKY
                        Sure wouldn't work at my house.  My
                        wife couldn't take the wrapper of a
                        twinkie.

140.    EXT.  CLEARING IN THE WOODS - DAY

        SHERIFF TRUMAN and JOSIE PACKARD break from a kiss.  Smiling, Truman
        goes back to gently strumming his guitar.

                                  TRUMAN
                        Josie, I think we should go public.

                                   JOSIE
                        That would be wonderful, but it's only
                        been a year since Andrew died.

                                  TRUMAN
                        What are you afraid of?  What people
                        think?

                                   JOSIE
                        I don't want to offend the customs of
                        your country.

                                  TRUMAN
                        Believe me, Josie, you would not offend
                        the customs of this country.  For
                        instance, I don't eat fish eyes.

                                   JOSIE
                        Fish eyes?

                                  TRUMAN
                        Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't
                        eat a fish eye.

                                   JOSIE
                        Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?

                                  TRUMAN
                        I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in
                        Seattle.  He was digging through his
                        food with his chopsticks for about five
                        minutes till he found the fish eye and he
                        dropped it into his throat.  I guess it
                        must have gotten stuck in his uvula
                        because right away he started to have
                        trouble.  His throat began to flutter
                        there like there was a wind blowing.
                        And he couldn't swallow and they rushed
                        to him and loosened his collar and they
                        were asking him if he was alright and
                        he started to turn blue and his eyes
                        started to roll back into his head and he
                        still couldn't get the fish eye out and
                        they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver.  I
                        went over to him as they were
                        preparing to do an emergency
                        tracheotomy.  They were over him with
                        a knife when he suddenly shot the fish
                        eye out of his throat and right onto the
                        ceiling.  Splat!  It just stuck up there
                        and spread out.  It was about the size of
                        a half dollar.  And that's why I don't ever
                        eat fish eyes.

        He plays the guitar for Josie.  Then stops.

                            TRUMAN (continued)
                        I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's
                        just the way I feel.  It's the custom
                        thing I was thinking of.  In America we
                        don't use any part of the fish but the
                        meat just to the side of the insides.  We
                        throw away the tail, the rest of the
                        insides and the head.

                                   JOSIE
                        I understand.

                                  TRUMAN
                        We throw away the _whole_ head.

141.    INT.  MOTEL ROOM - DAY

        PHILIP GERARD, the one armed man, in a deep sweat kneels in front of
        a circle of twelve lit candles, fighting for air and struggling to
        hear something.

142.    INT.  HAYWARD HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

        Donna and Laura sit across from one another on the couch.

                                   DONNA
                        I can't remember anything about last
                        night.  Is there something I should
                        remember?

                                   LAURA
                        No, you should forget about last night.

                                   DONNA
                        Laura, I am your friend.

                                   LAURA
                        I know you are and you don't have to do
                        anything crazy to prove it.

                                   DONNA
                        You're not mad at me?

                                   LAURA
                        No.

                                   DONNA
                        I feel so bad.  I had nightmares all night
                        long.
                           (studies her friend)
                        They all knew you at that place.

                                   LAURA
                        What can I tell you?

                                   DONNA
                        How did the car get back here?

                                   LAURA
                        WE got it back, that's all.

                                   DONNA
                        How did I get in the house?  How did I
                        get into my bed?

                                   LAURA
                        I can't help you there.

                                   DONNA
                        Was I wearing something of yours and
                        you got mad at me?

                                   LAURA
                        All my things have me in them.  I don't
                        want you to be like me.

                                   DONNA
                        But I love you, Laura.

                                   LAURA
                        And I love you, too.  But don't wear my
                        stuff.

                                   DONNA
                        Why do you do it, Laura?

                                   LAURA
                        Cause I like it.

        She takes Donna's head into her hands and kisses her.

        ON LELAND

        Leland is standing at the other end of the room.  As he stares at the
        girls we move in on his face.

143.    INT./EXT.  BLUE DIAMOND CITY MOTEL

        LELAND FLASHBACK

        Leland looking into another room seeing Laura and Ronette sitting face
        to face on a bed.

144.    ON THE SCENE

        Leland looking at the girls.

                                  LELAND
                        Excuse me, honey...

        Laura turns to him with a start.

                            LELAND (continued)
                        We're late to meet Mom for breakfast.

                                   DONNA
                                (to Laura)
                        Catch you later.

        Leland and Laura leave.

145.    INT.  LELAND'S CAR - DAY

        Leland and Laura drive along.  Leland becomes preoccupied with
        something in his rear view mirror.  Laura turns to see a car
        erratically coming up behind them.  Leland slows down and stops for
        a red light at Sparkwood and Twenty One.  In front of them is a huge
        logging truck.  Laura smells something.

                                   LAURA
                        Dad, is the engine on fire?  Something
                        is burning.

        Leland turns and gives her a look.

        The car that was tailing them races around them, races around the
        logging truck, and comes back around stopping on Leland's side of
        the car.

        Leland spots Gerard, the one armed man, behind the wheel - sweating
        like crazy.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Something is burning.

        Leland starts to rev his engine while holding the brake with his left
        foot.

                                  LELAND
                        It's the engine.

                                  GERARD
                        You stole the corn.  I had it canned
                        above the store.

        Leland is panicked.  The car is slowly screeching towards the large
        lumber truck in front of them.

                                  GERARD
                            (shouting at Laura)
                        Miss, the look on her face when it was
                        opened.  There was a closeness.  Like
                        the formica table top.

        The car is now smoking and making a horrendous sound.  Gerard
        continues to yell, but we can barely hear it.

                                  GERARD
                        The thread will be torn, Mr. Palmer, the
                        thread will be torn.

        Leland turns to Laura.  Sweat pours from his forehead.

        While Leland is turned away, Gerard holds up his hand with a ring on
        the little finger.  He is shouting over the engine noise and the horn
        which Leland has begun to blow frantically.

                                  GERARD
                                (shouting)
                        It's him.  It's your father.

        Laura can't make this out over the noise.

        The light turns green.  Gerard takes off away from them.  As soon as
        the logging truck moves Leland lets go of the brake and the car flies
        into a service station on their right.  Everyone around there has been
        watching a commotion on a Sunday afternoon.

                                   LAURA
                        DAD!...  What was that all about?  Who
                        was that?

        A YOUNG MECHANIC runs up to their car.

                                 MECHANIC
                        Mr., Mr., you shouldn't do that to your
                        engine.  You ought to take it easy, Mr.,
                        you're going to burn your engine out.

                                  LELAND
                        What the hell was all that?  Why doesn't
                        someone do something about all of this.
                        My god, that guy came out of nowhere.
                        He was harassing my daughter.

        Leland stares at Laura trying to compose himself.

                                   LAURA
                        Dad, are you all right?

                        That sounds like fun...  Where did you see
                        my picture?...  Okay, come to the Blue

                        your side of Blue Diamond City...  I'll be
                        there.  Room one two three...  Right, as in

        LELAND

        On top of Teresa in bed.  All whispers.

                                  TERESA
                                 (smiling)
                        When's the next business trip, big fella?

                                  LELAND
                        Soon.  How about next time we party
                        with the girlfriends you told me about?

                                  TERESA
                        I can arrange that.  I like that.

        He kisses her and covers her eyes with a hand.

                                  TERESA
                        What are you doing?

                                  LELAND
                        Who am I?

                                  TERESA
                        I don't know.

                                  LELAND
                        That's right.

        End of flashback.

149.    BACK IN THE CAR WITH LAURA

        Leland is still sitting and staring at Laura.

                                   LAURA
                       (trying to get his attention)
                        Dad...  Dad...  Who was that?  How do you
                        know him?  He looked familiar.  Have I
                        met him?

                                  LELAND
                        No, you haven't met him.  Have you met
                        him?

                                   LAURA
                        No.

                        Just sit here for a moment.  You seem
                        very upset.

                           (mumbling to himself)
                        Guy just pulls up out of the blue...  I
                        mean...  what is this world coming to?

150.    LELAND FLASHBACK - BLUE DIAMOND CITY MOTEL

        Open on a sign saying Blue Diamond City Motel.

        Leland comes down an outside walkway towards an open room.  Suddenly,
        he stops short and jumps back.  He cautiously takes a second look and
        sees Laura and Ronette sitting on the edge of a king size bed talking.

        Leland is about to leave when there is a tap, tap, tap on his back.
        He spins around to see Teresa Banks who has come up behind him.

                                  TERESA
                        What's wrong?

                                  LELAND
                      (moving further from the room)
                        Nothing, I chickened out.

        He shoves a wad of money into her hand and practically runs away.
        Teresa cocks her head and wonders, while she watches him hurry away.

        End of Flashback.

151.    BACK IN THE CAR WITH LAURA

        Leland and Laura are in the car.  Leland starts the car.

                                   LAURA
                        Are you sure you're okay?

                        Yes.

        Leland pulls out onto the road.  After they drive for a bit.

                                   LAURA
                        Dad?

                        Yes.

                                   LAURA
                        Did you come home during the day last
                        week?

                                  LELAND
                        No.

                                   LAURA
                        Oh, I thought I saw you.

                                  LELAND
                        You know, I did come home, come to
                        think of it, on Thursday.  I had a severe
                        headache and I was driving in the
                        neighborhood so I just darted in and out
                        of the house.
                              (studies Laura)
                        Where were you, Laura?  I didn't see
                        you?

                                   LAURA
                        I was down the street.

        Laura studies the look in her father's eye as long as she dares and
        then turns away.

                                   LAURA
                        Okay.
                               (remembering)
                        Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday
                        today.

                                   JAMES
                        What about tonight?

                                   LAURA
                        I can't tonight.

                                   JAMES
                        What's going on?

                                   LAURA
                              (freaking out)
                        I just can't, James.  I can't do it.

        Laura keeps going.  Donna comes around next to James.  Together they
        watch Laura walk away.

169.    EXT.  GREAT NORTHERN - DAY

        Establish

170.    INT.  GREAT NORTHERN, BENJAMIN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY

        Open on Laura's picture on top of Ben Horne's desk.  Then discover
        that Leland is staring at Laura's picture.

        Wider we see BENJAMIN HORNE trying to blow up a large rubber Indian
        for his son JOHNNY.  SYLVIA and JERRY HORNE stand nearby supervising.

        Johnny comes up one inch in front of Leland's face.

                                  JOHNNY
                        Happy Birthday, Johnny.

                                  LELAND
                        Happy Birthday, Johnny.

        Johnny moves to one inch in front of Jerry's face.

                                  JOHNNY
                        Happy Birthday, Johnny.

                                   JERRY
                        Happy Birthday, Johnny.

        Ben reacts to a huge moccasin print in the middle of the birthday cake
        in the middle of his office floor.

                                    BEN
                        Why did we have to have the party here
                        in my office?

                                  SYLVIA
                        Because Johnny wants it in your office.
                        What's so "private" "private" about your
                        office, anyway?  Why can't we have the
                        party in your precious office?

                                   JERRY
                        It's a lovely place for a party, Ben.  And
                        look at the new decorations Johnny's
                        provided.

        They look down and see Johnny's foot completely ringed in white
        frosting roses.  Frosted footprints trail behind him everywhere.

        Johnny goes one inch in front of Laura's picture.

                                  JOHNNY
                        Happy Birthday, Johnny.

        Leland looks again at Laura's picture.  He looks up at Ben.

                                  LELAND
                          (oddly confrontational)
                        Don't you have a picture of Audrey, Ben?

        That sets Sylvia off again.

                                  SYLVIA
                        Don't you have a picture of your own
                        daughter, Ben?  Where's Johnny's
                        picture?
                                (exploding)
                        And where's _my_ picture I gave you?

                                    BEN
                        At the photographer's studio getting a
                        gold frame with floral monograms of
                        your birthday and our wedding vows.

        Johnny moves one inch in front of Ben.

                                  JOHNNY
                        Happy Birthday, Johnny.

                                    BEN
                          (trying not to explode)
                        Happy Birthday, Johnny.

                                   JERRY
                        Johnny, Johnny...  let your Daddy and your
                        Uncle and Leland talk.
                             (turning to Ben)
                        Ben...  Leland, we can play the French
                        against the Norwegians.  What do the
                        French love more than anything?

                                  LELAND
                      (part of Jerry's presentation)
                        Boating?

                                   JERRY
                        No.

                                  LELAND
                        Hiking?

                                   JERRY
                        No.

                                  LELAND
                        Eating?

                                   JERRY
                        You'd think so.

                                  LELAND
                        Sex?

                                   JERRY
                        You're getting warmer.

                                  LELAND
                        Trees?

                                   JERRY
                        Exactment.  They are nuts about wood.
                        They get goofy over trees.

                                  SYLVIA
                        I've never heard anything like this
                        before.  The French liking wood anymore
                        than anyone else likes wood.  Are you
                        three crazy?

                                  LELAND
                        Sarah's cousin is French and she can't
                        stop talking about the trees around
                        here.

                                   JERRY
                        History is on our side, Ben.  It's no
                        accident that the great explorers were
                        named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.

                                  LELAND
                        They were looking for wood.

                                  SYLVIA
                               (exasperated)
                        Oh...

        As they talk Johnny circles the blowup Indian and with a mighty bang
        pops it with his tomahawk.  "Bang".

                        Joey just called in.  Bernie, the mule,
                        left Canada about an hour ago.

                        Then stop watching Jacques and let's
                        set a trap for Bernie.

                                   ANDY
                        He's coming in on foot.

                                  TRUMAN
                        That's right, Andy.
                          (looks at him, waiting)
                        I guess you're saying there's an awful
                        lot of trails for us to cover.

                                   ANDY
                        No, I was thinking what a long hike
                        Bernie has to make.

                                   HAWK
                       (sensing an "Andy" situation)
                        I'll get on it.

172.    INT.  BEN'S OFFICE - DAY

        Laura quietly lets herself in.  Ben looks up, happy to see her.

                              (very quietly)
                        I just wanted to say, "Hello".

                                    BEN

                        Sure, I'd do a lot more than that for it.

                                    BEN
                        Ssshhhh, your father's in the next
                        office.  You should've seen him get upset
                        at Johnny's party about your photo here.

                                   LAURA
                        He's always been jealous of you.  You
                        know that.

        She moves in closer and kisses him.  He responds.

                        Hey, Pete.  Can't believe your tank's dry
                        up at the mill.

                        No...  hell, no.  Just got in the truck,
                        started drivin', looked down at the
                        gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.

                                    ED
                        You know what that Big "E" stands for?
                        Big Ed's Gas Farm.

                        I haven't got it yet.

        Ed laughs.

                            (flips him the rag)
                        The inside is your territory.

        Pete starts to clean the inside of his windshield while Ed returns to
        work on the outside.

                                   PETE
                              (as he cleans)
                        Even this heavy work beats being at
                        home with the old ball and chain.

                                    ED
                        Brother, I hear you talkin'.

181.    EXT.  THE WOODS - NIGHT

        Bobby and Laura pull into a little clearing.  Bobby kills the lights.
        The doors open.  Laura and Bobby start to make their way thru the
        woods.

182.    EXT.  THE WOODS - NIGHT

        Laura and Bobby continue thru the woods.  It gets spookier and
        spookier.

        They reach the meeting place.  Awesomely quiet until a twig snaps,
        then a distant howling of a wolf.

        Bobby and Laura sit on the floor of the woods and do some more toot.
        Laura picks up a leaf and shows it to Bobby.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Bobby, I found a leaf.

        After a moment of staring at it, they both begin to giggle.  She
        picks up a twig.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Bobby, I found a twig.

        They giggle twice as hard.  Laura picks up a pinecone and starts
        knocking him on the head with it.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Bobby, I found a pinecone.

        They giggle three times as hard and start crawling around giggling.
        Suddenly, they hear footsteps.  They freeze and try to stifle their
        giggles.

                                   BOBBY
                        Here he comes.

                                   LAURA
                        Here he comes.

        They both start laughing again.  They see a guy coming through the
        woods.  We recognize him as the sullen deputy from Deer Meadow,
        Cliff Howard.

                                   BOBBY
                            (suddenly serious)
                        Who sent you?

                                   CLIFF
                        Jacques.

                                   LAURA
                        That's right.

        The deputy takes out a very big bag of coke, showing it to them.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Wow.

        Laura just grabs it out of his hand.  The deputy takes out his gun.
        Bobby panics and pulls out his gun.  BANG!!

        Bobby shoots the deputy in the shoulder, but the deputy still prepares
        to shoot at Bobby so Bobby shoots him again.  This time in the chest.

        The deputy spins and tries to run, but Bobby shoots him in the back.
        He topples over dead.

        BOBBY AND LAURA

        They stand there frozen.  Absolutely no more giggles.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        God, Bobby.  What did you do?

        They just stand there looking at the dead body.

                                   BOBBY
                        I shot him.  Oh, my god, I shot him.

        Bobby starts for the dead body.

                             BOBBY (continued)
                        Come on, you gotta help me.

        With Laura's help they get the body back to the clearing.  They fall
        down to their knees, out of breath, staring at what they have done.
        Their faces register the shock of having just killed someone.  Laura
        looks at Bobby's stunned expression.

                                   LAURA
                        Look at your face.

        A laugh squirts out of Laura.  Bobby turns to her in disbelief.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Bobby, you killed Mike.

        Bobby stares at her for a second like Laura has gone insane.

                                   BOBBY
                        This isn't Mike.
                        (suddenly unsure - surreal)
                        Is this Mike?

                                   LAURA
                        Bobby...  ssshhhh...  you killed Mike.

        Bobby breaks.  They begin to laugh uncontrollably.

        Wide shot.  The distant sounds of Bobby and Laura laughing.  Up
        closer the wind takes over and even closer the hooting of an owl.

        ten thousand they were going to use to pay for the drugs last night.

                                   BOBBY
                        Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to
                        divvy up the product.  Put this cash in

        Bobby is about to get really pissed when Laura starts laughing again.
        Bobby fights to stay in control.

                        damn bit funny.

        Laura stifles her laugh with all her might.  Bobby hands her the
        money.  After a beat Laura starts to laugh, but stops herself again
        by biting her lip.  Bobby is furious and scared.  Laura covers her
        mouth.  Bobby breaks again.

186.    EXT.  THE WOODS - DAY

        Bobby's car skids to a stop.  Bobby jumps out and pops the trunk.
        He unwraps the big bag of cocaine from a blanket.  He tears a little
        hole in it to enjoy a taste test.  The second it touches the tongue
        he panics and frantically takes a deeper test.

                        A little trouble with your parents is the

        The room is dark.  Laura is pressed up against the headboard of her

        Slowly, what she always knew deep inside of her becomes clear.

        Laura gets up and leaves the room.  Leland stares at the empty door.
        He waits for a moment and then follows her.  Sarah, nervously,

        Never taking her eyes off him, she works her way around him and
        leaves the room.

        We stay on Leland.  His face changes.  He knows she knows and he
        knows what he has to do.

        MRS. BETTY BRIGGS lets Laura in the front door.

                                   LAURA
                        Hi, Mrs. Briggs...

                        Hi, Laura, Bobby's in the basement.

                                   LAURA
                        Right where he belongs, right.

        GARLAND BRIGGS chuckles off screen.

202.    INT.  BRIGGS HOUSE, BASEMENT RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT

        Laura comes down stairs and sees Bobby lying on the floor.  His hands
        covering his eyes.

                                   LAURA
                                (concerned)
                        What's up, Bobby?

        Laura sits down next to him.

                                   BOBBY
                        Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.

                                   LAURA
                        What was?

                                   BOBBY
                        The stuff we got last night.

                                   LAURA
                        Baby laxative?  We can't snort baby
                        laxative.

                                   BOBBY
                        No shit...
                                (whispers)
                        We killed a guy for baby laxative.

                                   LAURA
                        What is the world coming to when you
                        kill a guy for baby laxative?

                                   BOBBY
                        Don't get funny with me again.

                                   LAURA
                        I'm not...  Bobby I'm gonna need some
                        more stuff.  I mean it.  I'm out.

                                   BOBBY
                        Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten
                        thousand dollars back.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                   LAURA
                        Sure, but I can't get it till after school
                        tomorrow.

                                   BOBBY
                        Let's ditch this place and party.

                                   LAURA
                        Not tonight.  Just give me something to
                        take home to hold me over till
                        tomorrow.

                                   BOBBY
                        Why?  Why not?  Where are you goin'?

        Laura smiles and leans forward.  She kisses him and he responds.

                                   LAURA
                        Bobby, I'm goin' home.  To bed...  my nice
                        warm bed...

        They kiss again.  He looks up and listens for his parents.

                                   BOBBY
                                (whispers)
                        We can do it right here.

                                   LAURA
                                  (flat)
                        Bobby...

        Bobby sees that she is not in the mood.

                                   BOBBY
                        You don't want me.  You just want the
                        stuff, don't ya?

        Laura stares at him.

                             BOBBY (continued)
                        It's okay.

        He reaches in his pocket and gives her a nice bag of coke plus pills.

                             BOBBY (continued)
                        Bobby's got it.

                                   LAURA
                            (taking the packet)
                        Thanks, Bobby.
                          (looking at the packet)
                        And my little round friends, too.

        They head upstairs.

203.    INT.  BRIGGS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        Mr. Briggs is reading aloud to Mrs. Briggs from the book of
        Revelations.  As Bobby hears this he turns to Laura and makes a look
        of horror which says, "Can you believe I live here".  Laura smiles.

        Bobby takes Laura to the door.  He gives her a small kiss, "Good
        Night".  After she leaves he cuts back thru the living room and just
        as he clears the room he lights up.

                                  BRIGGS
                        (looking up from the Bible)
                        Robert, put out the cigarette.

        And Briggs returns to the Bible.

204.    INT.  SHERIFF'S STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

        Sheriff Truman and Andy sit at the small table with doughnuts and
        coffee.  Andy monitors the radio.  LUCY MORAN cuts thru on the
        intercom.

                                   LUCY
                            (over the intercom)
                        Sheriff Truman?

        Truman hits the intercom button.

                                  TRUMAN
                        Yes, Lucy?

                                   LUCY
                              (over intercom)
                        Mrs. Packard called and said she heard
                        what she thinks could be a prowler
                        outside her house.

                                  TRUMAN
                        Okay, Lucy.  I better get on up there.

        He releases the intercom button.  But Lucy continues to talk over the
        intercom.

                               LUCY'S VOICE
                        It's probably raccoons which is what it
                        was last week...

                                  TRUMAN
                                 (to Andy)
                        You stay here and monitor the radio.  Let
                        me know right away, if you hear from
                        Hawk.

                               LUCY'S VOICE
                        And last week I thought of the same

                                  (more)

                         LUCY'S VOICE (continued)
                        thing.

                                   ANDY
                        Okay, Sheriff Truman.

                               LUCY'S VOICE
                        Raccoons remind me of my aunt who
                        lives in Wyoming where they have
                        raccoons, too.

        Truman stands up, puts on his gun and leaves.  Lucy's voice continues
        as we watch Andy sit there alone.

                         LUCY'S VOICE (continued)
                        She couldn't get rid of her raccoons
                        because she made the big mistake of
                        feeding them albacore tuna.  I don't
                        know why she fed them albacore tuna.
                        And albacore tuna is so expensive.
                         (voice raising an octave)
                        Sheriff Truman how did you get up
                        here?

        Over the intercom Andy hears Lucy make a small hysterical cry.  He
        stands and runs from the room.  Stay on the intercom.  Lucy's voice
        continues.

                         LUCY'S VOICE (continued)
                        Andy?  Are you there?  I am very
                        confused.  Who am I talking to?  Andy,
                        are you there?

205.    INT. SHERIFF'S STATION, RECEPTION - SAME

        Lucy gets up from the intercom.

                                   LUCY
                        Maybe I'm alone.
                          (whispers, frightened)
                        Andy...  where did Andy go?

        She races from her station and collides with Andy coming up from the
        interrogation room.  They both scream.

206.    INT.  PALMER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        Sarah sits smoking and reading a cheap magazine as Laura moves thru
        the living room.

                                   LAURA
                        Good night, Mom.

        Laura moves up the stairs.

207.    INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - NIGHT

        She does three lines of Bobby's cocaine.

        ON THE CLOCK IN HER ROOM

        It reads:  9:30.

        ON LAURA

        Trying to hold on.  The phone rings.

                                   LAURA
                                 (whisper)
                        James...  Yes, okay...  No, James, I do love
                        you, but...  Okay, I'll meet you in fifteen
                        minutes...

        She hangs up the phone and does another line of cocaine then swallows
        down a handful of red round friends from Bobby - the pills.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Fifteen minutes...  god, why did I say
                        that?...  what did I say?...

208.    INT./EXT.  PALMER HOUSE

        As Laura sneaks out she sees her dad coming home.

209.    EXT.  PALMER HOUSE

        LELAND

        Leland comes out of the car.  Laura ducks into some bushes and hides.
        Leland stops in the middle of the yard sensing something.  He looks
        right at where Laura is hiding.  She can't tell if he can see her or
        not.

        CLOSEUP: LAURA

        She hears James' bike coming in the distance.

                                   LAURA
                         (frantically to herself)
                        Go inside...  go inside...

        James' bike sounds closer and closer.  Leland turns, opens the front
        door and goes into the house.

        James drives up.  Leland's face appears looking out the front window.
        Laura jumps on the bike behind James and off they go.

210.    EXT.  HIGHWAY 21 - NIGHT

        James and Laura drive thru the night.

211.    EXT.  CLEARING IN THE WOODS - NIGHT

        James brings the bike thru the woods and stops in the little clearing.
        James tries to kiss Laura, she pushes him away.

                                   JAMES
                        What the hell is wrong with you?

                                   LAURA
                        That's right.  There's no place left to go
                        is there, James?

                                   JAMES
                        What do you mean?

                                   LAURA
                        You know it and I know it.

                                   JAMES
                        What is wrong with us?...  We have
                        everything.

                                   LAURA
                        Everything, but everything.

                                   JAMES
                        Oh, Laura.

                              (mimicking him)
                        "Oh, Laura..."

        She gives him a terrible slap.

                                   JAMES
                                 (ironic)
                        You always hurt the ones you love.

                                   LAURA
                        You mean the ones you pity.

                                   JAMES
                        Say anything you want...  I know you love
                        me and I love you.

                                   LAURA
                        I do love you.
                                (whispers)
                        Let's get lost together.

211.    CONTINUED:

        They kiss again.  Hot.  Hands everywhere.

                             LAURA (continued)
                              (breaking away)
                        Shit, maybe he'll kill you.

                                   JAMES
                        What?

                                   LAURA
                        When he finds out.

                                   JAMES
                        What?

                                   LAURA
                        Bobby killed a guy.

                                   JAMES
                        What are you talking about?  Bobby
                        didn't kill anybody.

                                   LAURA
                        You want to see...

                                   JAMES
                        See what?

                                   LAURA
                                (disgusted)
                        Right.  Open your eyes, James.  You don't
                        know me.  Even _Donna_ doesn't know me.
                        Your Laura disappeared...  It's just me
                        now.

        James grabs her trying to control her.  She twists out of his arms.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        How 'bout this, James?

        She lifts her hand and gives him the finger.  James ignores the
        finger and kisses her, but she's gone ice cold.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        I think you want to take me home now,
                        James.

        She leads him back to the bike.  He won't start it.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Oh, quit crying.  I've had enough of your
                        fucking caring.

        He kicks the bike to a start.  Behind him, Laura watches and silently
        starts to cry.

212.    EXT.  HIGHWAY 21 - NIGHT

        Laura and James on the bike make their way down to Sparkwood and
        Twenty One.

        Laura leans way back on the bike.

        LAURA'S POV

        Looking up at the trees as they fly by in a dark blur.

        LAURA AND JAMES

                                   LAURA
                        The trees...  the trees...

        Laura screams with agony and tries to get off as they approach the
        light.  Laura falls off as they skid to a stop.

                                   JAMES
                         (confused and terrified)
                        Laura...

        Laura crawls back up and puts her hands around James' neck.

                                   LAURA
                        (from far away she screams)
                        JAMES, I LOVE YOU.

        For a moment she focuses on him.  She looks like the Laura that James
        loves.  Innocent and Beautiful.

        Laura turns and sees the woods.  It pulls her.  She releases her hold
        on James and runs into the waiting darkness.

        The red light swings in the wind above James.  It turns green, but he
        doesn't move.  When the light turns red again, James guns the engine
        and lifts the bike up on its back tire.  James screams then roars down
        the road away from us.

        Off to the side of the road lies Doc Hayward's wilted red rose.

213.    EXT.  PACKARD LOGGING ROAD - MIDNIGHT

        Laura runs up thru the woods.  At the Packard Logging Road Laura
        meets Jacques, Leo and Ronette all standing around Leo's red corvette.

                                  JACQUES
                        Right on time, baby.

                                   LAURA
                        Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.

213.    CONTINUED:

                                  JACQUES
                        We're on our way, Baby.

                                   LAURA
                        Let's go _all_ the way.

        They pile into Leo's 'Vet and peel down the dirt road.

214.    INT.  JACQUES' CABIN - NIGHT

        The foursome getting roasted and toasted - very high.

        Jacques starts to tie Laura up with some light rope.

                                   LAURA
                           (drugged, screaming)
                        Don't tie me up, tonight.  Don't tie me
                        up.

        Jacques and Leo laugh.  Jacques starts to tie Laura up while Leo holds
        her.  Laura struggles and screams begging them not to do it.  With
        Laura tied up, Leo starts to tie up Ronette.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

215.    INT.  JACQUES' CABIN - LATER

        Both girls are half naked and have been tied up.  WALDO the bird is
        screeching.  Jacques is straddling Laura and is hurting her badly.
        Leo puts a One Eyed Jacks THOUSAND DOLLAR POKER CHIP in her mouth.

                                    LEO
                        Bite the bullet, baby.

        Like a ghost Leland appears in the window.

        No one sees him.

        Laura continues to scream.  Leo gets up and goes for the bottle of
        bourbon.  He takes a swig and then steps back to Jacques and Laura.

                                    LEO
                           (referring to Laura)
                        Let me have a little of that.

                                  JACQUES
                         (pointing at the bourbon)
                        Let me have a little of that, baby.

        Leo holds the bottle tight.  Jacques stands up and decks Leo with his
        big French Canadian paw.  He grabs the spilling bottle from the floor
        and stumbles outside.

216.    EXT.  JACQUES' CABIN - NIGHT

        When Jacques comes out of the cabin, Leland trips him, grabs the
        bottle and breaks it over Jacques head, knocking him out cold.

        Leo hears the crash and comes outside.  He sees Jacques bleeding on
        the ground.  He panics and weaves down the hill to his corvette and
        takes off.

        Leland goes into the cabin.  His smiling eyes are on Laura while he
        rapes Ronette.  Laura watches as her fear drives her to hysteria.

217.    EXT./INT.  LOG LADY'S CABIN - NIGHT

        In the darkness the Log Lady holds her log and listens.  She hears
        distant screams.  The camera moves down her leg to reveal her tattoo,
        beet red and burning.

218.    EXT.  TRAIL - SAME

        Philip Gerard, the one-armed man, runs like a madman up the trail
        towards Jacques' cabin.

219.    EXT.  PATHWAY FROM THE CABIN - NIGHT

        With the face of the devil, Leland double time marches Laura and
        Ronette out the cabin door and thru the woods.

                                   LAURA
                    (screaming - pleading for her life)
                        DADDY...  DADDY...

220.    EXT.  JACQUES' CABIN - NIGHT

        Gasping for breath Gerard arrives at the cabin too late.  He stares
        at the open doorway.  Jacques lies passed out at his feet.  Gerard
        cocks his head straining to hear something.  He hears distant screams.

                                  GERARD
                        Bob, I can hear you singing.

221.    INT.  TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

        Leland hauls the two girls into the train car.

        He SLIDES THE DOOR SHUT and it is completely quiet.

        BOB AND LELAND going in and out like breathing.  The two girls shudder
        in the corner as he circles them.

        Leland grabs Laura and begins to wrap the twine around her arms
        bending the arms back.

                                   LAURA
                                (whispers)
                        Are you going to kill me?

222.    EXT.  WOODS - NIGHT

        Gerard tearing thru the woods.  The wind comes up carrying with it
        cries and screams and the sounds of BOB.

223.    INT.  TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

        Leland hoists Laura up so that she hovers facing the floor a foot
        off the ground.  He places a mirror on the floor directly under her
        face.

        IN THE MIRROR

        Laura sees herself turn into Bob.  Leland screams into space.

                                  LELAND
                        DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.

                                   LAURA
                        NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.

                                  LELAND
                        I always thought you knew it was me.

                                   LAURA
                         (into Bob in the mirror)
                        NO!  YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.
                                (to Leland)
                        KILL ME.

224.    EXT.  TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

        Gerard arrives outside.  He bangs on the train door.

                                  GERARD
                        LET ME IN.  LET ME IN.

        The door opens a little bit because Ronette is pushing it with her
        feet.  Gerard reaches up to help her when suddenly she flies over
        his head having been hit.

        Ronette hits the ground, her unconscious head bent back at an odd
        angle.

        ECU: GERARD

        He listens to the sounds of murder inside the train car.

225.    INSIDE THE TRAIN CAR

        Laura screaming

        Knife entering flesh.

        Bob screaming.

        Bloody knife thru the air.

        Leland screaming.

226.    EXT.  TRAIN CAR

        ECU: GERARD

        Gerard leans in to take a look and steps back laughing.  he yells out
        for Bob to hear.

                            GERARD (continued)
                        THAT'S HIS OWN DAUGHTER YOU'RE
                        KILLING.

        He continues to laugh and runs away from the train car.

        A few moments later Leland stumbles out of the car carrying the body
        of Laura Palmer wrapped in a plastic shroud.  Leland's shirt is puffed
        out - a bloody towel inside.

227.    EXT.  WOODS/RIVER - NIGHT

        Leland/Bob lowers the plastic shrouded Laura into the river.

228.    EXT.  GLASTONBURY GROVE - NIGHT

        Leland stumbles to the centre of Glastonbury Grove and stops.  A
        frightening wind carries haunting music.  He digs into his pockets
        for the pages torn from Laura's secret diary.  he tosses them and
        the bloody towel to the wind.

        He goes to the centre of the circle of the twelve sycamore trees.
        The red curtains appear and he passes between them entering the red
        Room.

229.    INT.  THE RED ROOM

        It is not empty.  Gerard is just leaving the other side of the room.

        LELAND walks thru the Red Room after him.  He walks down a corridor
        and _into_the_Red_Room_again_.

        There on the other side of the room Leland sees Gerard and the Man
        From Another Place sitting side by side in a chair facing him.

        Leland stops when he sees them.  He divides.  One half becomes Bob -
        opaque.  The other half floats up and becomes Leland - transparent.

        ON BOB

        He reaches up and grabs Leland's wound.

        ECU - LELAND'S WOUND

        Bob heals Leland's wound.

        ON THE SCENE.

        Gerard and the Man From Another Place speak in unison.

                            GERARD/THE MAN FROM
                               ANOTHER PLACE
                                (subtitled)
                                (in unison)
                        Bob, you're not going home without me.  I
                        want all my garmonbozia.  (corn)

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

230.    EXT.  WATER'S EDGE BY THE PACKARD SAWMILL - DAWN

        At high tide Laura Palmer's body is floating up to and bumping against
        the logs.

231.    EXT.  GLASTONBURY GROVE

        On screen it reads:

                            "TWO MONTHS LATER"

232.    INT.  HOSPITAL EMERGENCY WARD - NIGHT

        Annie is being brought in on a stretcher.  A NURSE talks to a
        PARAMEDIC as they rush her towards the emergency room.

                                   NURSE
                        What happened?

                                   MEDIC
                        I don't know.  Sheriff Truman just
                        brought her in from Glastonbury Grove.

233.    INT.  THE RED ROOM

        The Man From Another Place stands with Cooper.

                          MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE
                        Is it future?  Or is it past?...  Do you
                        know who I am?...  I am The Arm...  And I
                        sound like this...

        The Man From Another Place puts his hand in front of his lips and
        makes an Indian Whooping sound.

                                  COOPER
                          (looking at the table)
                        Where is the ring?

                          MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE
                        Someone else has it now.

                                  COOPER
                        That would indicate that it's the future.

                          MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE
                        The later events have never been kept a
                        secret.

                                  COOPER
                        Where am I?  And how can I leave?

                          MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE
                        You are here and there is no place to
                        go...

        A pause.

                          MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE
                                 (shouts)
                        BUT HOME!

        The Man From Another Place begins to laugh uncontrollably.

234.    INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

        A NURSE mops the sweat from Annie's forehead.  Annie tries to get
        thru to her.

                                   ANNIE
                        My name is Annie.  I've been with Laura
                        and Dale.  The good Dale is in the lodge
                        and he can't leave.  Write it in your
                        diary.

        The nurse pats Annie's forehead and takes her hand.  We see
        _TERESA/LAURA'S_RING_ on Annie's ring finger.  The nurse gently
        slides the ring off Annie's finger.

235.    INT.  ANOTHER ROOM IN THE HOSPITAL

        The nurse enters.  With an anticipatory smile, then a selfish laugh,
        she puts the ring on her finger.

236.    INT.  HOTEL ROOM, GREAT NORTHERN - NIGHT

        Doc Hayward and Sheriff Truman watch the door of the bathroom
        anxiously.

                                  TRUMAN
                        Coop...  Coop...

                                    DOC
                        Cooper are you alright?

        Not getting any response Truman breaks open the door.

237.    INSIDE THE BATHROOM

        Cooper, in his pajamas, lies on the floor.  The mirror above the sink
        is shattered with blood all over it and the sink.  Cooper smiles up
        at them strangely.

                                  COOPER
                            (smiling strangely)
                        I slipped and hit my head on the mirror.
                        The glass broke as it struck my head.
                                 (laughs)
                        It struck me as funny, Harry.  Do you
                        understand me, Harry, it struck me as
                        funny.

                                    DOC
                        You are going right back to bed.

        Doc and Truman help Cooper up.

                                  COOPER
                        But I haven't brushed my teeth yet.

        Cooper smiles at the uneasy pair.

238.    BLACK LODGE/RED ROOM

        Laura is sitting in a chair.  As the end credits begin...

        We move back to see that Laura is sitting in Cooper's lap in the
        same chair.

                                                        FADE OUT.

                                                June 14, 1999


FADE IN:

Moving through a murky haze.  Dark blues and greens, shafts
of prismed purple.  A pale shard appears in the distance.
Gliding closer, a group of tiny fish dart before the camera.
We're UNDERWATER.  Arriving at the form, it finally sharpens
into focus.  It's a WOMAN'S BODY submerged in dark water,
arms floating lazily at her side.  The face is obscured by
flowing hair.  All that is visible is a pair of COLD, STARING
GREEN EYES, which blink closed...

                                                    MORPH TO:

...then open as BLUE EYES, as a DIFFERENT FACE emerges from
water.  CLAIRE SPENCER awakens from this unsettling dream in
her bathtub.  She pivots the large BRASS SHOWER HEAD (the
kind that moves up and down on a pipe) off to one side,
reaches toward her feet and we hear the sound of a plug being
pulled.

INT.  BATHROOM - DAY

A HAZY SHAPE-- accompanied by a whirring sound.

A steam covered mirror is cleared with a BLOW DRYER.  Claire
starts to come into focus.  The dryer stops.  She presses the
red G.F.I. button on the socket.  ZAP!  A big blue spark
shoots out.  Claire pulls her hand back...and the dryer
starts whirring again.

She clears the mirror and replaces the dryer on a hook.  She
regards herself in the mirror, and attractive, elegant-
looking woman around forty.

Claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCAR
above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek,
as if confirming her existence.

INT.  CLAIRE'S HOUSE - DAY

Claire, now dressed, presses her face against a door,
listening for the sounds of stirring from within.  Silence.
She quietly pushes open the door.

INT.  ROOM - DAY

Claire makes her way past half-filled boxes and duffels to a
window, then pulls the curtains to reveal:

A LOVELY, WOODED LAKE.  It couldn't be more picturesque.  A
24' SAILBOAT is moored at the dock and an OLD STONE
LIGHTHOUSE sits on a point across the lake.

The sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from A FIGURE
still shrouded by covers.

Claire sits beside the sleeping form.  She scans the room
briefly, taking in a Greenpeace flag and a picture of a
tomboyish ten year-old girl at camp.

She gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same
face, now a waifish, pretty seventeen year-old, with chopped
hair and tiny nose ring.  Claire leans over and inhales the
sleeping scent of her only daughter, CAITLIN.  She places her
hand on a cheek.  The girl's eyelids flutter softly.

                     CLAIRE
          Morning, beauty.

Caitlin lets out a grunt and rolls over onto her belly.

                     CLAIRE
          Let's go.  Or we'll never leave on time.

From out of the pillow comes Caitlin's voice.

                     CAITLIN
               (muffled)
          I'm totally ready.

Claire glances around at the piles of unpacked clothes.

                     CLAIRE
          Come on, I'll make you some waffles,
          maybe we'll squeeze in a trip to the
          mall.
               (beat)
          Caitlin...

Claire gently swats at the tiny lump that is Caitlin's
behind.

                     CAITLIN
          Mother...

Claire stands and instinctively scoops up some clothes from
the floor, then folds and neatly stacks them on a box.
Caitlin turns her head sideways on the pillow.

                     CAITLIN
          You're such a morning person.

Claire turns at the door.

                     CLAIRE
          It is unwise to heckle the keeper of the
          plastic.

She starts to leave.  Caitlin calls out.

                     CAITLIN (O.S.)
          Blueberries!

Claire smiles as she closes the door behind her.

INT.  HALLWAY - DAY

Claire bends down to pick up one of Caitlin's socks.  When
she stands, something catches her eye out a window.  She
gazes down, transfixed.

ANGLE

Through a stand of trees over a HIGH WOODEN FENCE, A YOUNG
COUPLE is in the midst of a heated argument next door.
Claire watches as the HUSBAND, a large imposing man with an
unruly shock of red hair, snarls at his wife across the hood
of their huge old Buick.  She tries to get a glimpse of the
woman, but all that's visible is THE BACK OF HER BLOND HEAD.

A TAN, SINEWY ARM encircles Claire's waist.  She lets out a
small gasp as a hand closes on her breast.  It's Claire's
husband, DR. NORMAN SPENCER, nibbling gently at her neck.
He's older than she, pushing fifty, with silver streaks
beginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes him
look more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach than the
prominent academic that he is.  Claire, however, can't take
her eyes off the scene below.

                     NORMAN
          They at it again?

Claire nods.

                     NORMAN
          Christ, that's twice in...When did they
          move in?

                     CLAIRE
          I think three...

                     NORMAN
          Three weeks.

She continues to gaze downward.  The man leans over the hood,
murmuring darkly at his wife, though for Claire and Norman
the scene is entirely silent.

                     CLAIRE
          What's their name?

                     NORMAN
          Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures.
          They're all psychotic.

Outside, Mr. Feur turns and walks toward his house.  Norman
begins, once again, to nuzzle Claire.  Her eyes close, but
then she gently demurs.

                     CLAIRE
          She's awake.

                     NORMAN
          We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.

She turns to him.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't want to be either.

He smiles.  A really good smile.  The lips and tongue on his
faded T-shirt mark him as a 'Stones fan.

                     NORMAN
          When's she out of here?

                     CLAIRE
          Norman Spencer.

Norman gives up.  He busses her cheek.

                     NORMAN
               (moving toward the stairs)
          Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm
          going to class.

                     CLAIRE
          Don't.

                     NORMAN
          Claire, I have to show up for the--

                     CLAIRE
          It's Saturday.

Norman stops.

                     NORMAN
          I knew that.  You think I didn't know
          that?

She smiles at him.  After a beat:

                     NORMAN
          It's today?

                     CLAIRE
               (wistfully)
          Yep.

They share a warm, poignant look.  He turns and moves down
the stairs.

                     NORMAN
               (calling over his shoulder)
          We're going to have to leave by three if
          we want to beat the traffic.

Claire returns her gaze to the scene below as Mr. Feur says
something ominous to his wife, then stalks into the house.

                     NORMAN (O.S.)
          Claire?

                     CLAIRE
               (absently)
          Three o'clock.

ANGLE

Mrs. Feur drops her face into her hands.

EXT.  SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY

Claire peruses her "to do" list as Caitlin munches a panini.

                     CLAIRE
          ...and I still think we should get you
          some mittens.

Caitlin puts down the sandwich and regards her mother warmly.
The bond between them is palpable.

                     CLAIRE
          Do you have a scarf?

                     CAITLIN
          Hey.

Claire looks up from her little pad of paper.

                     CLAIRE
          Yes?

                     CAITLIN
          It's only two hours away.

                     CLAIRE
          I know that.

                     CAITLIN
          I'll come back all the time.

                     CLAIRE
          Of course you will.

                     CAITLIN
          I'm just saying, you're going to be
          fine.

Claire smiles.

                     CLAIRE
          Sweetheart, I've known this day was
          coming for a long time.  I've got your
          father and the garden and the new house.
          You really don't have to worry.

Caitlin smiles back and nods, her face betraying some
concern.  Claire takes her hand.

                     CLAIRE
          Really.

She nods reassuringly and pulls Caitlin into an embrace.  Her
eyes close.

                     CAITLIN (V.O.)
          Mother...

EXT.  COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DAY

Claire's frozen in the hug.

                     CAITLIN
               (beat)
          Mom.

Her eyes open.  Widen to reveal Claire, holding Caitlin on
the college campus.  The URBAN SKYLINE looms in the
background.

                     CAITLIN
          I have'ta go.

After a moment's hesitation, she releases her grip.  Caitlin
glances over her shoulder to make sure no one's witnessed
this overt display of maternal affection.

                     CAITLIN
          I'll call you.

Claire produces an ENVELOPE, which she presses into her
daughter's hand.  It's a book of TRAIN TICKETS.

                     CLAIRE
          Come home anytime.

Caitlin looks at Norman.

                     NORMAN
          Really gonna leave me, huh?

She nods.  They share a tender look.

                     NORMAN
          Be good.

She throws her arm, briefly, tightly around his waist.  A bit
overwhelmed, he slowly brings his hand to the back of
Caitlin's head.  After a moment, she steps back...

                     CAITLIN
          Bye.

...then turns and makes her way toward the large, old
Columbia dorm.  A banner is draped across its portals which
reads:

                  "WELCOME CLASS OF '04."

Claire watches her daughter melt into a crowd of similarly
shaggy freshmen, smoking and talking on the front steps.  Her
eyes are shining.  Norman wraps an arm around her waist as
she daps at a tear with a Kleenex.

                     CLAIRE
               (smiling)
          I almost made it.

They turn and head for the car.  Claire sneaks one last look
over her shoulder.

ANGLE

Caitlin glancing back at Claire with an apprehensive smile.

INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Claire walks in from the bathroom wearing a sexy cotton
nightgown.  Norman is in bed, absorbed in some notes.

She gets into bed, then picks up a thick text from beside him
and starts reading.  After a moment:

                     NORMAN
          Whatcha reading?

                     CLAIRE
               (reading the cover, sexy voice)
          Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic
          organisms.

                     NORMAN
               (slight smile)
          How is it?

Claire snuggles up.

                     CLAIRE
          Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells
          just gang divided a virginal cheerleader
          cell.

                     NORMAN
               (lost in his book)
          Nice.
               (beat)
          Almost done.

She pulls slightly away.

                     CLAIRE
          If you have to work...

                     NORMAN
          No, no.  I'm just about...
               (beat)
          There.

He places his book on the bedside table and turns to her.

                     NORMAN
          How are you?

                     CLAIRE
          Fine.

                     NORMAN
          It's okay if you're not.

                     CLAIRE
          I am, really.

                     NORMAN
          It's just she's been the focus for a
          while.

                     CLAIRE
          Not the focus.

                     NORMAN
          You know what I mean.

Claire thinks for a moment.

                     CLAIRE
          To tell you the truth...I'm
          excited.

                     NORMAN
          You are...

                     CLAIRE
          To get my life back.  To have some time
          for myself.  Some time for us.

He caresses her.

                     NORMAN
          You did a great job.  She's a good kid.

                     CLAIRE
          We did.

There's a weighty pause.

                     NORMAN
          It's just us now.

                     CLAIRE
          I know.

He kisses her.

                     NORMAN
          Tired?

                     CLAIRE
          Nope.

                     NORMAN
          Wanna fool around?

                     CLAIRE
          Yup.

They start to kiss.  It's slow and a bit methodical in the
manner of long time lovers.  Suddenly, the SOUND OF A WOMAN
WAILING can be heard.  They stop.

                     NORMAN
          Did you...

                     CLAIRE
          Shhh.

They listen.  The sounds start to become louder.  It is
clearly two people in the throes of some very vocal and
savage love making.

                     NORMAN
          Jesus.

He walks over and closes the window.  It doesn't help.

                     NORMAN
          I guess they're making up.

The woman's moaning becomes embarrassingly loud.

                     CLAIRE
          What is he doing to her?

They lie together in silence as the cacophony drones on.

                     NORMAN
          And we moved out here for the quiet.

                     CLAIRE
          Mmm.

Beat.  The mood has passed.

                     NORMAN
          Maybe we should just...

                     CLAIRE
          Tomorrow.

                     NORMAN
          I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with
          Stan.

                     CLAIRE
          After that.

                     NORMAN
          I'll be there.

Beat.

                     NORMAN
          Love you.

She smiles.

                     CLAIRE
          Night.

They lie together in the darkness as the Feurs finally
climax.

INT.  CAITLIN'S ROOM - DAY

Claire pushes open the door to Caitlin's room carrying an
armful of FOLDED LAUNDRY.  She moves quickly to the bureau,
not wanting to spend much time in here, then grabs a TINY
BLACK TOP from the pile, and drops it into a drawer.  She's
just about to close it, when something catches her eye.

CLAIRE'S POV

She drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered, old
JUILLIARD T-SHIRT with a very seventies logo from the drawer.
Claire gazes around the room, which is a reliquary of
Caitlin's recently concluded childhood; PICTURES, TROPHIES,
STUFFED ANIMALS.

She brings the now faded T-shirt to her face and drinks in
the smells.  She stares down at the word "Juilliard."

                                                MATCH CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT - DAY

"JUILLIARD"...now it's on the same T-shirt only Claire's
wearing it and she's much younger.  It's an old photograph in
an album.  Younger Norman stands next to her in the shot, his
arm draped around her waist.  A CELLO CASE stands beside her.

Claire glances around at several hastily unpacked boxes and
sees propped in the corner...THE CELLO CASE.  She gazes at
other photos.

-- Claire in her wedding dress, Norman beside her in a tux
   with a very wide bow-tie.

-- Claire and Norman in front of a UNIVERSITY BUILDING.  A
   tiny Caitlin rests on her hip.

Claire's chin begins to tremble and she chokes out a sob.

EXT.  FRONT YARD - DAY

Her face streaked with tears, Claire stumbles out into the
immaculately manicured ROSE GARDEN.

The yard is surrounded by a HIGH WOODEN FENCE.  She collapses
into a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside.  Suddenly,
she hears something coming from next door.

She cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound.  It
is, ironically, the sound of a WOMAN CRYING.  Claire makes
her way over to the fence.  The women's sobbing becomes more
plaintive and fevered.

She places her face against the prickly, vine covered fence
and tries to peer through the crack.  All she can make out is
A DARK BLUE BLUR that seems to be rocking.  Claire gathers
her nerve and calls out...

                     CLAIRE
          Hello...

There's no reaction.

                     CLAIRE
          Mrs. Feur?

The sobbing chokes down to a breathless whimpering.  The blue
shape vanishes from view.

                     CLAIRE
          Wait a minute.  I just want--

Something bumps against the fence.  Claire draws back.  She
hears heavy breathing.

                     MRS. FEUR
               (sniffling)
          Who are you?

                     CLAIRE
          It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From
          next door.  Is everything--

                     MRS. FEUR
          You're the flower lady.

                     CLAIRE
          Um...yes.

                     MRS. FEUR
          I've seen you.  From the window.

                     CLAIRE
          Is everything alright?

Claire leans closer to the tiny crack.  She sees a fleshy
blur and what might be part of an eye.  There's no response,
just the breathing.

                     CLAIRE
          Hello?

                     MRS. FEUR
          I'm not...

She seems on the verge of losing it again.

                     MRS. FEUR
          He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I
          can't breath...

                     CLAIRE
          Who?  Your husband?

                     MRS. FEUR
          And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid
          of...

She trails off.

                     CLAIRE
          What?  What are you afraid of?

                     MRS. FEUR
          I can't, no, no, I can't...

Claire edges closer to the crack.

                     CLAIRE
          Tell me.  Please.

                     MRS. FEUR
          That I'll just...that one day I'll
          just...disappear.

Beat.  Claire's taken aback by this admission.

                     CLAIRE
          Tell me.  I can help you.

                     MRS. FEUR
          How?  How can you help me?  With your
          flowers and your perfect life...

                     CLAIRE
          That's not...It's not like that.

                     MRS. FEUR
          I've never even met you.

                     CLAIRE
          I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed
          with...my daughter left...for school.

                     MRS. FEUR
          This fence...it's so...

                     CLAIRE
          I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why
          don't you...

Tires can be heard crunching the gravel as a car pulls into
the Feur's driveway.

                     MRS. FEUR
          Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please
          forget that I...I don't know what I'm
          saying.  Please...

                     CLAIRE
          Wait!  Don't go...

Claire listens to the sound of NAKED FOOTSTEPS, followed by a
LARGE FRONT DOOR swinging shut.  A CAR DOOR swings open and a
MAN'S SHOES follow down the path.

Claire pulls back from the crack and leans against the fence
as the door closes a second time.  She sits there for a
moment listening, but all is quiet.

                     CLAIRE (V.O.)
          She sounded terrified.

INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Claire and Norman eat dinner.  A rainstorm pelts the windows.

                     NORMAN
          Of what?

                     CLAIRE
          Of him I think.

                     NORMAN
          Did she say that?

                     CLAIRE
          More or less.

Norman chews.

                     NORMAN
          Honey, they're young.  They're probably
          newlyweds.

                     CLAIRE
          I'm telling you.  There was something in
          her voice...

                     NORMAN
          Remember how we were?

                     CLAIRE
          Not like this.  We were never like this.
               (beat)
          I want to go over there.  After dinner, we
          can--

                     NORMAN
          Why?

                     CLAIRE
          To make sure she's all right.

Norman puts down his fork.

                     NORMAN
          Claire, honey, we are not going to march
          next door and accuse our new neighbor of--

                     CLAIRE
               (overlapping)
          That's not what I'm sug--

                     NORMAN
          ...when tonight they'll probably be
          keeping us awake.

                     CLAIRE
          But what if something happens?

                     NORMAN
          Claire...

                     CLAIRE
          I'd never be able to live with mysel--

                     NORMAN
               (reassuring)
          Nothing's going to happen.
               (beat)
          Besides, I have to work tonight.  The
          conference is in less than two weeks.
          I've got to stay focused on that for just
          a little longer.
               (beat)
          This is...

                     CLAIRE
          I know.

                     NORMAN
          It's what I've been working for.

She glances down at her untouched plate.

                     CLAIRE
          I just wish you could have heard her.

                     NORMAN
          Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych
          department, see what I can find out.

                     CLAIRE
          Promise?

He gives her a "Didn't I just say so" look.  She smiles.

                     CLAIRE
          I'll make you some coffee.

She reaches for his plate to clear it.  Norman grabs her hand
and kisses it.

INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Norman snores softly.  Claire is awakened by the continuing
STORM.  She pads out to Norman's turreted library.  Rain
pelts the glass.  Her face is briefly illuminated by the
LIGHTHOUSE BEAM.

She hears the sound of a DOOR CLOSING and moves to get a
better view of the Feur's.  Nothing but blackness.  Just as
she's turning to go back to bed.  A LIGHTNING FLASH lights up
the night.  Claire's eyes go wide.

CLAIRE'S POV

In the split second of brilliance, she sees Mr. Feur, in
shirtsleeves, drenched, dragging A LARGE DUFFEL toward the
open trunk of his car.

                     CLAIRE
               (in a hoarse whisper)
          Norman!

He's dead to the world.  She calls to him again.

                     CLAIRE
          Norman, you have to look at this!

                     NORMAN
          Mmnph.

                     CLAIRE
          Hurry...

Another flash illuminates...Norman at her side.

                     CLAIRE
          Look!

...an EMPTY DRIVEWAY, then blackness.

                     NORMAN
          What is it?  What's the matter?

She stares down into the darkness.

                     CLAIRE
          Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw
          something.

                     NORMAN
          Is it gone?

THE BEACON illuminates the empty driveway.  She nods.

                     NORMAN
          Come on, let's go back to bed.

Yet another bolt of lightning reveals Claire, still at the
window.

EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING

Claire sets up a camera and tripod.  She steps back and aims
her camera.  She glances up at a large upstairs window at the
FEUR'S HOUSE.  One side of the curtain seems to be pulled
open, but no one's there.

Feeling self-conscious, she turns back to the camera.  The
morning sun hits the flowers just right and she SNAPS SEVERAL
PICTURES OF THEM against her lovely house.

She glances back at the Feur's window.  The CURTAIN IS NOW
CLOSED.

She walks over to the fence and tries to peek through it.
When this doesn't work, she drags a lawn chair over and peers
across the fence.  She can barely see over, but glimpses:

A DEEP FURROW in the mud of the driveway.  Just then, a car
pulls into the driveway, Claire scrambles down from her
perch.

EXT.  DRIVEWAY - DAY

Claire walks out to find her best friend, JODY, pretty, in
her forties, wearing hip, hippie-ish clothes.

                     CLAIRE
          Hey there.

Jody hugs her.

                     JODY
          How you holding up?

                     CLAIRE
          Good.  I'm good.

                     JODY
          You are?

                     CLAIRE
          Why does everyone find that so
          surprising?

                     JODY
               (are you kidding?)
          Cause...your...only daughter just went
          away to school...who you were incredibly
          close with aaand I'd be tripping...

                     CLAIRE
          Okay, I'm a little tender.

                     JODY
          Well good.  So you're human.

                     CLAIRE
          And so far my day has consisted of taking
          pictures of my roses for the garden club.

                     JODY
          Wow.  Got here just in time.
               (reaching into her bag)
          I brought you this.

She proffers several homemade tea bags.

                     CLAIRE
          What is it?

                     JODY
          Kambucha mushroom tea...

                     CLAIRE
          Jody--

                     JODY
          It soothes heart-ache and promotes
          psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--

                     CLAIRE
          You're discussing me with your psychic?

                     JODY
          She's not a psychic.  Just a very
          enlightened spirit.

                     CLAIRE
          Thanks, but I'm fine.

                     JODY
               (pressing it into her hand)
          So you'll have some later.
               (beat)
          Notice anything...different?

Claire gives her friend the once over, then notices the mint
Karman-Ghia behind her.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh my god.  You bought it.

                     JODY
          Yep.

                     CLAIRE
          It's niiice.

                     JODY
          Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband,
          get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up
          dudes?

                     CLAIRE
          Absolutely.

                     JODY
          Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought
          I'd stop by and see if you want to take
          the boat out, say Thursday morning?

                     CLAIRE
          You got it.

Jody grins.

                     JODY
          See you then.

Jody drives off.  Claire walks down the driveway to her front
door and sees Mr. Feur staring at her from a window.  She
starts to wave, but the curtain is drawn shut.

Claire arrives at the front door and reaches out to touch the
doorknob.  She stops.  A FAINT RUSTLING can be heard from
within.  Claire quietly opens the door and moves into:

INT.  FOYER - DAY

Claire stops inside the door.  Now it sounds like WHISPERING.
Two voices, tense, impassioned.  It seems to be coming from
Norman's study.  She gathers her nerve, then bursts into the
room.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY

But the whispering has suddenly stopped.

                     CLAIRE
          Hello?

The lovely circular room is completely empty.  She looks
around, puzzled.  Cooper, the family's aging lab, casually
ambles over.

                     CLAIRE
               (to Cooper)
          Please tell me you heard that.

EXT.  LAKE - DAY

Claire and Cooper, out on a walk, emerge onto large rocks at
the water's edge.  Claire tosses a long stick for Cooper, who
bolts out onto the LONG WOODEN DOCK.  Claire gazes at the
LIGHTHOUSE across the lake and a long BRIDGE in the distance.
Cooper starts BARKING and looking down into the water.

Claire arrives at Cooper's side and stares down into the dark
water.

                     CLAIRE
          Cooper...what do you see?

She looks down and sees nothing but her own reflection.
After a moment, she notices a FAINT WHITE SHAPE directly in
the reflection of her face.  Cooper rumbles a low growl.  The
shape seems to be gaining definition.

RRRING!

Claire gasps quietly, then reaches into a pocket in her
sweater and pulls out a cordless phone.

                     CLAIRE
               (into phone)
          Hi.

                     NORMAN (V.O.)
               (on the other end)
          I'm stuck here for another couple of
          hours.

Claire's smile fades.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh.

                     NORMAN (V.O.)
          Unless you need me to come home...

                     CLAIRE
          No, no.  It's fine.

Claire slowly leans out over the water to check her
reflection...

                     NORMAN (V.O.)
          You sure?

...but the shape is gone.

                     NORMAN (V.O.)
          Claire?

                     CLAIRE
          Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.

She clicks off the phone and looks down at the calm water.

INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT

Claire sits in a small workroom at a computer.  She focuses
intently on the screen.

ANGLE

It's ALICE'S COMPUTER SOLITAIRE.  She flips the last card and
an animated Queen of Hearts, accompanied by a series of
musical notes, parades across the screen.

                     QUEEN OF HEARTS
               (on computer)
          You lost!  Off with your head!

Claire hits "New Game" and watches as a fresh hand of cyber
solitaire is dealt.  She suddenly has a thought and
disappears into the kitchen.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

She glances at Jody's tea, smiles, then refills her glass of
red wine.  She picks up the phone from its cradle and moves
into:

INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

She dials a number.  LOUD REGGAE can be heard blaring through
the phone.

                     CLAIRE
               (straining to be heard)
          Hello?  I'm looking for Caitlin Spencer.
          She's in 314...Well, could you check?

She plugs one ear.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh.  Well, just tell her that her mother
          called.  Her mother.  Thank you.  Excuse
          me, how can you study with that?

The noise abruptly stops.  Claire clicks off the phone and
replaces it in the sweater pocket.  She tunes the stereo to a
classical music station.

INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT

She walks in, places the cordless phone on a BASE UNIT, then
hears a different set of musical notes from the computer.
She stares at the screen, stunned.

ANGLE

The game has been finished.  Cards with faces swarm
chaotically across the screen with the message:  YOU WIN!

                     CLAIRE
          Oh.  Kay.

Without warning, the radio dial rips cacophonously past
several stations and comes to a stop on some angry, punkish
rock and roll.

                     CLAIRE
          Jesus...

She bolts around a corner to the stereo.  The music is
chaotic and deafening.  She finds Cooper growling at...no
one.  She turns off the stereo.  Cooper suddenly bolts down
the hall.  She follows him.

INT.  FOYER - NIGHT

The foyer's empty, but the front door is open.  Claire
nervously walks out and looks around.

                     CLAIRE
          Cooper!

POV - THE GARDEN

No sign of the dog.

Claire turns to go back inside.  When she touches the
doorknob, she hears the whispering again.  A fleeting shadow
draws her eye to a COAT RACK MIRROR which reflects directly
into the study.

                     CLAIRE
          Hello...?!

The whispering stops.

INT.  NORMAN'S LAB - NIGHT

Claire walks in to find Norman surrounded by several GRAD
STUDENTS.  At school he's a very different man; pressed shirt
and tie, hair neatly brushed back.  They're preforming some
unseen procedure on a live sheep in a containment harness.
She stops by the door to watch him.

                     NORMAN
          ...and then what...Courtney?

An intense ASIAN GIRL answers.

                     COURTNEY
          We administer the Halothane.

                     NORMAN
          Dosage?

She glances at her notes.

                     COURTNEY
          Three point five cc's.

                     NORMAN
          Excellent.  Properties?  Andrew from
          downtown...

Andrew, tall razor thin, was waiting for this.

                     ANDREW
          An organic, neuromuscular blocking agent,
          which when administered in aerosol form
          temporarily renders the subject immobile.

                     NORMAN
          Nothing but net.

He measures out the liquid from a blue plastic bottle into an
apparatus connected to an inhalation mask on the sheep.

                     NORMAN
          Prudence here's an old friend.

He moves to the sheep's head and strokes it as he nods to
Courtney who turns a valve on the apparatus.  The sheep
suddenly goes completely still.  Norman moves around and
begins a brief procedure.

                     NORMAN
          I try to stay on her good side because I
          owe her my career and most of our grant
          money.  Why else?

He completes the procedure.  They look at him blankly.

                     NORMAN
          Always do unto others as you'd have
          others do unto your ewe.

Groans, laughter.  He stops Claire.

                     NORMAN
          That'll do it.  Write this up for Tuesday!

Andrew and Amy tend to Prudence, the rest leave.  Claire
moves over to him.  They kiss.  Norman packs notes and some
of the chemicals into a LEATHER CASE.

                     NORMAN
               (warm)
          What are you doing here?

                     CLAIRE
          There were some noises.  I didn't want to
          disturb you.

She watches as the sheep slowly becomes reanimated and is led
out of the room.

                     NORMAN
          What do you mean?  Some noises where?

                     CLAIRE
          In the house.  I was scared.

                     NORMAN
          Did you call the police?

                     CLAIRE
          No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you
          back in the morning.

                     NORMAN
          Of course.

He takes her arm.

INT.  THE FOYER - NIGHT

Norman pushes open the front door.  Cooper pads over, wagging
his tail.  They walk together past the stereo into...

INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

...the living room.  All is quiet.  They move into...

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT

It's undisturbed.  Norman checks the window locks.

                     CLAIRE
          It was there.  This angry music all by
          itself.  And I heard whispering.

                     NORMAN
          What kind of whispering?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.  Just...whispering.

He nods as Cooper appears.

                     NORMAN
          What'd you see, Coop?

The dog stares blankly.

                     CLAIRE
               (to Cooper)
          Tell him!

Norman smiles.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Norman sits on the bed and pulls off his shoes.

                     NORMAN
          I'm gonna have the police check on the
          house.

Claire leans against the window sill.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh great, "Can you look in on my wife,
          she's hearing voices?"  Wait'll that gets
          around.

He walks over to her.

                     NORMAN
          I've got the conference next week.  I want
          you to feel safe.

                     CLAIRE
          I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how
          was your day?

He goes to his dresser and fishes a little joint from a box
in his dresser.

                     NORMAN
          Think I may have cracked it.

                     CLAIRE
          Really?

She produces a match and lights it.  They sit on the bed.

                     NORMAN
          I think so.  Maybe.

                     CLAIRE
          You are so brilliant.

                     NORMAN
          Yep.

                     CLAIRE
          Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman
          Spencer...

                     NORMAN
               (smiling)
          You know what that does to me.

She takes a little puff on the joint as he kisses her neck.

                     NORMAN
               (stopping)
          Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw
          Schumway...

                     CLAIRE
          You're kidding.

                     NORMAN
          He's here giving some arcane spiel for
          the physics department, so Bob Shine
          introduces us...

                     CLAIRE
          Wow.

He nods, Claire passes the joint back.

                     NORMAN
          And he says...you'll fucking love this,
          he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great
          admirer of your work..."

                     CLAIRE
          Well, that's nice.

                     NORMAN
          "...especially Spencer's Theorem..."

                     CLAIRE
               (overlapping)
          Oh, no...

                     NORMAN
          "...of Perpetual Distances."
               (beat)
          Everybody's checking their shoelaces.
          Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken
          me,"  I say...

                     CLAIRE
               (overlapping)
          That's...

                     NORMAN
          "...for my father."

                     CLAIRE
          I'm so sorry.

                     NORMAN
          Didn't know he was dead, every stinking
          paper on the globe.

                     CLAIRE
          That's just mean.
               (indicating joint)
          Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get
          her some.

                     NORMAN
               (quickly glancing over)
          Did you tell her?

                     CLAIRE
          What?  No.  No.

                     NORMAN
          You didn't?

                     CLAIRE
               (with a smile)
          Norman, you are so funny about that.  No,
          I didn't.

He takes a little toke, then vanishes into the bathroom.

                     NORMAN (O.S.)
          Cause that would be really--

She lays back on the bed.  Sounds of flushing.

                     CLAIRE
          I didn't.

He reappears without the joint.

                     NORMAN
          Sorry.  You understand.

                     CLAIRE
          Did you call about the Feurs?

                     NORMAN
          Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a
          sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.

                     CLAIRE
          Huh.

Claire ponders this.  Norman turns off the light and joins
her on the bed.  He kisses her knee.

                     NORMAN
          Do the brilliant Norman stuff some more.

Then starts working his way up her thigh.

                     NORMAN
          And speak up.

Claire smiles.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Claire sits frozen, cello between her legs, bow hovering in
position.  After an uncomfortable long pause, she touches bow
to string, drawing in a breath at the power of the sound.

Claire takes another deep breath, then launches into a
beautiful and melancholy piece of music.  She's very, very
good.  Eyes closed.  Her body begins to sway slightly as her
left hand vibratos like butterfly wings on the neck.

She reaches a difficult transition and falters.  She seems
almost surprised.  She attacks the transition again, and
again falters.  Claire bites her lower lip and tries yet
again, this time failing completely.

She sits back in the chair, despondent.  Almost as an
afterthought, she sadly drags the bow across strings.  At the
end of the tone, something catches her ear.  She can just
make out the HINT OF A FAINT FEMININE VOICE echoing the tone.

She sits up and plays a different note, then another.  Each
time the soft mournful voice becomes more distinct.  Finally
she plays a sharp, higher pitched note.  The voice echoes
with a distinct, unsettling shriek.

CRASH!

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DUSK

Claire walks in and sees:

INSERT-- Lying on the floor...A FRAMED NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPH
OF NORMAN AND CLAIRE.

The caption announces that he's being promoted to the
"distinguished DUPONT CHAIR IN GENETICS."  Through the
spiderwebbed glass, Norman can be seen shaking hands with an
older academic, hugging a smiling Claire to his side.

Claire kneels down to gather the picture.  A single shard of
glass is missing.  She finds it a foot away by a distinctive
knot in the wood floor.

She notices a COPPER GLINT in the point of glass, but when
she moves it, it's gone.  She places the pieces of broken
glass on the frame and stands.

Out of the window directly in front of her sees:  Mr. Feur,
removing a DIRT COVERED SHOVEL from his trunk.  She glances
down at the picture, then back up at Mr. Feur, who carries
the shovel around back.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh no...

Claire wraps up the broken picture.  She hears a car door
slam and glances out the window in time to see Mr. Feur
driving off.

EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

A stiff autumn breeze.  Claire stands at the fence.

                     CLAIRE
          Mrs. Feur?

She looks through the tiny crack.  Nothing.

                     CLAIRE
          Hello?
               (beat)
          Are you there?

Silence.

EXT.  THE FEUR'S - DAY

Claire glances down as she walks past THE FURROW.  She looks
up at the house, which seems quite placid, then slowly heads
around back.

EXT.  FEUR'S BACK PORCH - DAY

She takes in the lake view from the large porch.  The wind is
really blowing.  Her eye catches on something.  Propped
against the back door...

THE SOIL COVERED SHOVEL

Claire takes a pinch of soil from the shovel and tastes it,
then knocks at the back door.  There's no answer.  She knocks
again.  Nothing.  She's turning to go, then the door swings
open.  The smile fades from Claire's face.

CLAIRE'S POV

The immense MR. FEUR filling the doorway.

                     MR. FEUR
          Yes?

                     CLAIRE
          Um...

                     MR. FEUR
          I'm running late here.  I just came back
          for my briefcase.

                     CLAIRE
          Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to
          welcome you to the uh, to the
          neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From
          next door.

                     MR. FEUR
          This really isn't a good time.

He starts to close the door.

                     CLAIRE
          Well maybe your wife...

                     MR. FEUR
               (growing cold)
          She isn't here.

                     CLAIRE
          When...when will she be back?

                     MR. FEUR
          I don't know.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh-kay...

                     MR. FEUR
          I have to go.

Slam.  And Claire is staring at a closed door.

                     JODY (V.O.)
          What do you mean she's gone?

EXT.  LAKE - DAY

Claire and Jody knife slowly through the water in the
Spencer's sailboat heading back toward the dock, the OLD
LIGHTHOUSE, the BRIDE in the background.

                     CLAIRE
          She's not there.  I haven't seen her since
          that morning.  Well, I mean, I've never
          actually seen her, but I'm telling you,
          she's disappeared.

Jody finishes securing a line.  The breeze is mild, so they
just cruise with the wind.

                     JODY
          What are you saying?

Claire just looks at her.

                     JODY
          You think he killed her?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds
          crazy.  But what else could it all be?

Jody shakes her head.

                     CLAIRE
          I mean, he's so kind of grim and
          daunting, and she sounded terrified of
          something.

Claire glances over at Jody.

                     CLAIRE
               (laughing to herself)
          Listen to me.  I sound like some middle-
          aged Nancy Drew.

Jody regards her.  After a beat:

                     JODY
          Know what I think?

                     CLAIRE
          What?

                     JODY
          Seance.

                     CLAIRE
          Jody, no...

                     JODY
          Telling you...

                     CLAIRE
               (overlapping)
          ...no...no...no...

                     JODY
          Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.

                     CLAIRE
          Please.  That's all I need.

Jody shrugs, "Have it your way."  Beat.

                     JODY
          Hey, look.

CLAIRE'S HOUSE across the lake.

                     JODY
          So pretty.

CLAIRE'S POV

A FIGURE in the turreted window of Norman's study.

                     CLAIRE
          Someone's there.

                     JODY
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          In the window.  Norman's at work.

                     JODY
          I don't...

Claire looks over at Jody.

                     CLAIRE
               (pointing)
          There.  In the study.  Don't you see--

She looks again-- nothing.

                     CLAIRE
          Wow.  I'm losing it.

                     JODY
          No, you're not.
               (beat)
          But a presence in your house is not
          something to be taken lightly.

Claire stares back at the house.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Claire walks in and sets down some packages.  She opens one
and pulls out new toothpaste and...AN ENVELOPE-- the kind
your pictures come back in.  She absently leafs through them,
then freezes.  She gapes at one of the shots.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh boy...

INT.  UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

Claire turns off the lights and crouches down.  She raises a
pair of BINOCULARS.

POV - BINOCULARS

Claire rakes the binoculars across the Feur's house...past
their car parked in front until she finds A LIGHT ON
DOWNSTAIRS.

The tall, powerfully built Mr. Feur walks into the room and
sits by himself at the dining room table, which is set for
one.  He eats a TV dinner, slowly chewing and staring
straight ahead.  He sips from a can of beer.

Just then...A HAND GRABS CLAIRE'S ARM.  She lets out a
screech and turns to see Norman standing beside her.

                     NORMAN
          What are you doing?

She glances back out the window and sees Mr. Feur standing
at the window, paging the curtain.  She squats down, pulling
Norman with her.

                     CLAIRE
               (shrill whisper)
          Get down!  He'll see.

                     NORMAN
               (also whispers)
          What's going on, Claire?

                     CLAIRE
          Shhhh.

She peers over the sill in time to see Mr. Feur turning away
from the window.  She takes Norman by the hand and leads him
downstairs.

INT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

She leads Norman in.

                     NORMAN
               (still whispering)
          Why am I...
               (full voice)
          Why am I whispering in my own house?

Claire turns.

                     CLAIRE
          He killed her.

                     NORMAN
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          He did.  She's in the picture.  I went
          over to look and she's gone.  The table
          was set for one.

                     NORMAN
          And that means he murdered his wife?
          This is getting ridic--

                     CLAIRE
          No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel,
          his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from
          here, believe me, I...
               (frustrated, she grabs the
                photos)
          All right, look at this.

She triumphantly thrusts one before him.  Norman looks at it.

                     NORMAN
          Our house.

                     CLAIRE
          No.  Look!  In the window.

The ROSES.  She points out a HAZY FIGURE in the TURRETED
WINDOW of the study.  Norman takes it over to the light.

                     NORMAN
          It's a flare.

                     CLAIRE
          A flare?

                     NORMAN
          From the sun.  It's a reflection on the
          glass.

                     CLAIRE
          It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered
          and turned on the music.  She's trying to
          contact me!

                     NORMAN
               (making sure he's got it)
          It's a ghost.

Norman shakes his head.  He looks again at the picture, does
a quick calculation.

                     NORMAN
          You took this in the morning, didn't you?

She nods slightly.

                     NORMAN
          When the sun would be exactly right.

She's got him.

                     CLAIRE
          Then why isn't it in any of the other
          pictures?

She thrusts the batch at him.  He peruses the other few shots
of the garden.

                     NORMAN
          A cloud passed.  Or it's a bounce off the
          lake.  See?

She looks.  He might not be wrong.

                     CLAIRE
          Where is she then?

                     NORMAN
          She could be out.  She could be sick in
          bed for all we know.

                     CLAIRE
          Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at
          this.

She leads him out of the room.

INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT

Claire stares at the computer screen triumphantly.

                     CLAIRE
          See?

                     NORMAN
          What am I looking at?

                     CLAIRE
               (indicating completed solitaire
                game)
          I didn't do that.

                     NORMAN
          Who did?  Mrs. Feur?

                     CLAIRE
          Maybe.  Point is...not me.

                     NORMAN
          Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed
          her, why doesn't she haunt him?

                     CLAIRE
          She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman,
          I know how it looks, but--

                     NORMAN
          Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under
          some strain.  But there's no such thing as
          ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor
          did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why
          aren't you dressed?

                     CLAIRE
          Dressed?

                     NORMAN
          Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.

                     CLAIRE
          When?

                     NORMAN
          What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about
          it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our
          first date since...

                     CLAIRE
               (she seems confused)
          Oh.

                     NORMAN
          ...since Caitlin.  You don't remember
          this?

                     CLAIRE
          Tonight?

                     NORMAN
          Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--

She looks at his watch.

                     CLAIRE
          Fashionably five minutes late.

She bolts up the stairs.

INT.  NORMAN'S PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT

They drive across the bridge.

                     NORMAN
               (concerned, exasperated)
          When you do this, I swear...

                     CLAIRE
               (overlapping)
          ...Don't get all...

                     NORMAN
          ...like it never even happened...

                     CLAIRE
          Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...

He pulls out a cell phone and punches in a number.

                     CLAIRE
          What are you doing?

                     NORMAN
          Restaurant.  Let them know we're running
          late.

                     CLAIRE
          Five minutes?

The phone flashes..."NO SERVICE."

                     CLAIRE
          You're not at the center.

                     NORMAN
               (overlapping)
          I know I'm not at the center of the
          bridge.

                     CLAIRE
          We're going to be fine.

They near the far side of the bridge.  Norman looks down at
the cell phone, which now reads, "ROAM."  He presses a
button.

                     NORMAN
          There we go.

                     CLAIRE
          Well, that's a relief.

He shoots her a look.

INT.  RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A cozy, candlelit Italian place in town.  Claire and Norman
arrive at the table.  STAN rises.  The chair next to him is
empty.  He kisses her cheek.

                     CLAIRE
          Hi Stan.  Sorry we're late.
               (too earnest)
          It was my fault.

She greets Stan, a friendly looking man in his forties.

                     STAN
          We just got here.

Claire flashes a semi-playful look back at Norman.

                     CLAIRE
          Where's the new squeeze?

A VOICE speaks out from behind her.

                     VOICE
          Here I am.

Claire turns to find A TALL, ELEGANT BRUNETTE standing behind
her.  The woman's face registers some shock.

                     STAN
          I'd like you to meet...

                     CLAIRE
          Elena?

                     ELENA
          Ohmigod...

The two women embrace, then beam at each other.

                     CLAIRE
          Wow.

                     ELENA
          This is...

                     CLAIRE
               (to Norman)
          We know each other.

                     NORMAN
          Hope so.

LATER

Post meal.  Several empty wine bottle decorate the table.

                     ELENA
          We had this Finnish conductor, Aki, Laki,
          something.  He had these ridiculous bangs.
          And he'd sweep them off with his baton
          every minute or so, and it drove us
          insane, remember?

Claire nods.

                     CLAIRE
          He looked like one of the Monkees.

                     ELENA
          Anyway, Claire slept with him...

                     CLAIRE
          I didn't sleep with him.

                     ELENA
          ...just so she could cut them off.

                     CLAIRE
          He was so pissed.

                     ELENA
          I came in from my room...

                     CLAIRE
               (interjecting)
          We were suite mates.

                     ELENA
          And there's this brilliant conductor in
          purple briefs with no bangs cursing his
          ass off in Finnish.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh God...

They dissolve into giggles.  Norman and Stan smile.

                     STAN
          Well...

                     NORMAN
               (to Stan)
          I made an honest woman out of her.

Elena puts her hand on Claire's.

                     ELENA
               (to Stan)
          You should have heard her play.

                     CLAIRE
          Stop.

                     ELENA
          We both auditioned for the Philharmonic.
          One cello position open.

                     CLAIRE
          Do we have to?

                     ELENA
          And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I
          stood in the hallway and listened to her
          audition...and I cried.

                     CLAIRE
          She's making this up.

                     ELENA
          I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for
          weeks.

                     STAN
          What happened?

Elena looks at Claire, then smiles.

                     ELENA
          She got it.
               (beat)
          Turned it down.

                     CLAIRE
          I met a dashing young grad student after a
          recital one night...

Claire puts her arm around Norman.

                     CLAIRE
          ...and three months later I was married.

He squeezes her hand.

INT.  WORK ROOM - DAY

Claire walks into the work room with the portable phone to
her ear and a cup of Jody's special tea.  She sniffs it and
makes a face as she turns on the computer.  After several
rings a GIRL picks up on the other end.

                     CLAIRE
               (on phone)
          Caitlin?

                     GIRL'S VOICE
               (overlapping)
          Can you hang up?  I'm trying to make a
          call.

The line goes dead.  Claire hits redial and gets...a BUSY
SIGNAL.  She clicks the phone off as the computer boots up.
Claire puts the phone down and starts a game of Alice's
Solitaire.  She turns a card and waits.

                     CLAIRE
          Gee, that's tricky.  Sure could use some
          help.

She waits, the cursor blinks benignly.

                     CLAIRE
          Come on...

Nothing happens.

INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - DAY

She walks into the room and notices STEAM wafting from the
cracked bathroom door.

INT.  BATHROOM - DAY

Claire enters the steamy bathroom.  The tub is nearly
overflowing with water.  She squats down to drain the tub.

She stops, feeling watched, then slowly peers behind her...no
one's there.  Claire reaches toward the water to yank the
plug's chain, then freezes.  In the bathwater's still
reflection she see:

A PRETTY YOUNG BLOND standing beside her.  Startled, she pops
up and slams into the SHOWER HEAD.

Claire collapses over the side of the tub, her head dipping
underwater.  A small cloud of red surrounds her.  Moments
later, an arm wraps around her.

                                                      CUT TO:

Blurry shapes.

                     VOICE (O.S.)
          Claire...

INT.  BATHROOM - DAY

CLAIRE'S POV - A FACE sharpens into focus hovering above
her...Norman.

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

Claire sits on the bed.  Norman dabs the blood from a tiny
cut on the back of her head.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't need a shrink.

                     NORMAN
               (gently)
          Harvey says he's amazing.

                     CLAIRE
          Norman...

                     NORMAN
          What can it hurt to talk to someone?

She goes to her dresser and gets a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and
starts to open it.  Norman gently places a hand on her arm.

                     NORMAN
          Please.

She shoots him a look...

                     NORMAN
          You promised.

...and puts the pills down.

                     NORMAN
               (gently)
          Claire, she's been a huge part of your
          life for seventeen years.  If you weren't
          thrown off balance by this, then
          something would be wrong.

                     CLAIRE
          I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course
          I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I
          know what I saw and what I heard...and it
          wasn't some "symptom" of something...

                     NORMAN
          I never said...

                     CLAIRE
          ...and I don't think I'm some lonely,
          middle-aged woman cracking up.

Beat.

                     NORMAN
          Are you lonely?

                     CLAIRE
          No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!

INT.  DR. DRAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY

Claire sits in a comfortable looking chair with her purse in
her lap, arms crossed.

                     DR. DRAYTON (O.S.)
               (a smooth, mellifluous
                baritone)
          Who's idea was it?

                     CLAIRE
          Mine.  His.  We both...thought...

She trails off.  Camera slowly pulls back to reveal, DR.
TIMOTHY DRAYTON, a stocky, light skinned black man in his
late forties with a kind face and piercing brown eyes.

                     CLAIRE
          I didn't want to come.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Then why did you?

                     CLAIRE
          Because he was worried about me.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Your husband?

                     CLAIRE
          Yes.
               (beat)
          I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full
          of prozac so he can live out his life in
          peace.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Do you really think so?

                     CLAIRE
          No.

There's a pause.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Why is he worried?

                     CLAIRE
          Because, I don't know, because
          sometimes...sometimes I forget
          things...and ever since Caitlin left,
          ever since my daughter left for school,
          there've been...I fainted and...
               (beat)
          Why is this so hard?

Dr. Drayton takes a little silver bowl full of shiny, red
FIREBALLS next to his chair.  He proffers it to Claire.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Fireball?

                     CLAIRE
          You're joking.

He shakes his head.  She shrugs, then grabs one and pops it
into her mouth.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          It's hard because I'm a complete stranger
          and what we're talking about is
          incredibly personal.  Besides, the first
          time most people come here, a part of
          them is wondering if I'm gonna think
          they're crazy.

She sucks on the fireball and slowly nods.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Don't worry, I'm required to have at
          least three sessions in order to commit.

Her eyes get a little wider.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Now that's a joke.

She manages an unsteady smile.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          I have some training at helping people
          through the stressful moments in life,
          one of which you may or may not be
          experiencing.  If you want to get some
          stuff off your chest, great.  If not...

He smiles and shrugs, "no problem."  She stares at him for a
moment.

                     CLAIRE
               (re: fireball)
          These are good.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Mm-hmm.

She studies him for a moment.

                     CLAIRE
          There's a ghost in my house.

He nods slightly, as if she's told him, "I have some
anxiety."  Claire goes on.

                     CLAIRE
          She finished my solitaire game and turned
          on the radio...she likes rock and roll.
          Angry rock and roll.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          How do you know it's a she?

                     CLAIRE
          I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She
          was filling the bathtub.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          What does she look like?

                     CLAIRE
          Pretty.  She's a blond.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Do you have any idea who she is?

                     CLAIRE
          Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Fine.

                     CLAIRE
          What do you think I should do?

He thinks for a moment, then:

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Try to contact her.

Claire nearly swallows her fireball.

                     CLAIRE
          What?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Try to communicate with her somehow.

                     CLAIRE
          You think that'll help?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Can't hurt.  And I think it's important
          you find out what she wants.

Claire ponders this for a moment, then looks back up at him.

                     CLAIRE
          Are you humoring me?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Nope.

She seems satisfied by his sincerity.

                     CLAIRE
          How?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          I don't know.  My aunt used to use my
          uncle's old pajamas and a candle.

He stands.  Claire nods, then stands.  She smiles too.

                     CLAIRE
          Is this time okay?

He nods.

INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

Claire walks in carrying a half-empty bottle of wine.  She
looks over at Jody, who turns off the lights.  Jody then
strikes a match and lights a LARGE CANDLE.  She unveils her
carved ANTIQUE OUIJA BOARD.

                     JODY
          Sit down here.

                     CLAIRE
               (nervous, jokey)
          Are we hoping the ghost is going to
          have to pee?

Jody turns to her, deadly serious.

                     JODY
          Isn't this where you saw her?

Claire's smile fades.  She nods.

                     JODY
          Then this is where she'll be.

They sit cross legged, the board between them.

                     JODY
          Place your fingers on the planchette.

                     CLAIRE
          The planchette?

                     JODY
          This.

Jody indicates the wooden pointing device.  Each woman grasps
an edge.

                     JODY
               (in a low voice)
          We wish to commune with the spirit of
          Mrs. Feur.
               (to Claire)
          What's her first name?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.

Jody closes her eyes.  Claire follows suit.

                     JODY
          I call forth the entity that is haunting
          this house.

They look down at the planchette, which hasn't moved.

                     JODY
          Mrs. Feur?

There's still no movement.

                     CLAIRE
          Nothing's happening.

                     JODY
          Shhh.

Jody focuses intently.
                     JODY
          Reveal yourself to us.

A long moment passes.  It's starting to seem like a bust.
Suddenly, THE CANDLE FLARES.  Even Jody seems startled.

                     JODY
               (to the spirit)
          Who...who are you?

At first, nothing happens.  Then, slowly, the planchette
starts to move across the board.

                     CLAIRE
          Are you doing that?

Jody shakes her head.

                     CLAIRE
          I'm not doing that.

The planchette comes to rest on the letter "M."  Moments
later, it starts to move again drifting over and stopping on
"E."

                     CLAIRE
          Oh...

                     JODY
          M-E...

It starts to drift again, moving slowly toward the space
between "E" and "F."  The planchette stops on "F."  Jody
removes her fingers from the device.

                     JODY
          Mef?  What's Mef?

                     CLAIRE
          It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.

Suddenly, the CANDLE starts flickering strangely and THE
PLANCHETTE SLIDES JERKILY ON ITS OWN...M-E-F, M-E-F...

                     JODY
          Shit...

Jody stumbles backwards, gasping.

                     JODY
          Did you see that?

Claire leans in.

                     CLAIRE
               (to ghost)
          What happened to you?

The CANDLE GOES OUT.

                     JODY
          Oh God...

Jody bolts.  Claire follows.

EXT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Claire catches up to the completely spooked Jody outside the
work room.  She holds onto her arm.

                     JODY
          I have to go.

                     CLAIRE
          Jody, wait.

Cooper's growling in the work room.  They look in.

                     JODY
          Claire, this is...this is...

Claire, transfixed, walks in.

INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT

She stares at the computer screen, which is being filled with
letters at an amazing speed.

MEFMEFMEFMEFMEFMEFMEF...

She hears the front door swing open.

                     CLAIRE
          Jody!

INT.  FOYER - NIGHT

Claire arrives at the open front door in time to see the
Karman-Ghia tearing out of the driveway.  She turns and goes
back into the house.

CRASH!

She edges into...

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT

The picture has, once again, tumbled from its spot.  She
drops to her knees over the picture.  This time THE GLASS IS
SHATTERED.  When she picks out the remaining shards, the
newspaper photo slides out.  Claire glances at the benign
news stories on the back.

She looks around and spots a piece of glass wedged in a crack
in the floor boards by the knot.

CLAIRE'S POV

The piece of glass, wedged next to what looks like A COPPER
COIN in the crack.  It's too big to be a penny.

She tries to use the piece of glass to pry it free, but
recoils.  A tiny drop of blood appears on her finger, which
she pops into her mouth.

INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

Still sucking on her finger, Claire walks in and begins to
clean up the remains of the seance.  She bends down to pick
up the Ouija board, then stops when she notices that the tub
is again full to the brink of overflowing.

                     CLAIRE
          What do you want?!

Claire peers around, frustrated, half waiting for a reply.
There is only silence.  She reaches in to pull the plug,
nearly scalding her hand.  When she turns for a hand towel
she finds a message traced into the steamed-up mirror:

                      "YOU KNOW"

She draws in a breath and darts out of the bathroom.

EXT.  LAB BUILDING - NIGHT

Norman nods to a SECURITY GUARD as he leaves a darkened
university building.  He sees Claire standing at the foot of
the steps.

                     NORMAN
          What are you doing out here?

                     CLAIRE
          He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed
          her and--

                     NORMAN
          This is the Feur thing?

                     CLAIRE
          Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.

Norman's momentarily speechless.

                     NORMAN
          How do you know this?

                     CLAIRE
          We had a seance.

                     NORMAN
          Who did?

                     CLAIRE
          Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman,
          she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to
          leave.

                     NORMAN
          How did you--

                     CLAIRE
          Jody brought a Ouija board and we
          summoned her.

He regards her for a moment.

                     NORMAN
          Are you angry at me?

This stops Claire in her tracks.

                     CLAIRE
          What?

                     NORMAN
          Maybe you resent how busy I've been.

                     CLAIRE
          What are you...?  No.

                     NORMAN
          You know what I've got at stake with this
          paper.  You know that.  I can't help but
          think that you're doing this now to hurt
          me, or to sabotage me somehow.

                     CLAIRE
          Sabotage?

                     NORMAN
          Ever since the accident I've been
          worried that you'd been unhappy, or...

                     CLAIRE
          The accident...?

                     NORMAN
          But then you've been so much better...

                     CLAIRE
          Norman, this isn't about you.  This is
          something that's happening to me.  It's
          not to get even...and it's not some
          warped bid for attention.  Some strange
          things are happening in our house,
          whether you believe in them or not...

                     NORMAN
          Sweetheart--

                     CLAIRE
          No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in
          what's happening.  I don't want to, but I
          do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think
          that would be enough for you.

She turns on a heel and walks toward her car.

EXT.  CAMPUS - NIGHT

Norman catches up to her as a LARGE CROWD is filing out of
the concert hall next door.

                     NORMAN
          You're overreacting.

She turns on him.

                     CLAIRE
          Don't tell me how to react!

Norman glances around at the crowded sidewalk.

                     NORMAN
          Keep your voice down.

                     CLAIRE
          I will NOT.

Some of the bystanders stop to watch.

                     CLAIRE
               (still loud)
          Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my
          mind...

                     NORMAN
               (looking around)
          Claire, please...

Claire leans in and lowers her voice without diminishing her
intensity.

                     CLAIRE
          ...But what if I'm not?  What if she died
          in terror and betrayal and some part of
          her can't move on while that's
          unresolved.  Can't you just...

Something behind him catches her eye.  She trails off.

                     CLAIRE
          Wow...

Claire walks past him toward the parking lot.

                     NORMAN
          Claire, please...

There's a dangerous energy to her walk.  People step out of
the way.

EXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Claire walks past several cars until she sees the one she's
after.  MR. FEUR steps out from behind the open trunk of his
old Buick.

                     CLAIRE
               (walking up)
          You!

He looks up at her.

                     CLAIRE
          You think you're smart, don't you?  You
          think you got away clean.  Well, I know
          you killed her.  You drowned her in the
          bathtub and got rid of her somewhere and
          I'm gonna find her, you murdering
          sonofabitch.

Mr. Feur stares, dazed, through the tirade.  Norman arrives
at her side.

                     MR. FEUR
          Who?

                     CLAIRE
               (scoffing)
          Give me that shit.  Your wife.

                     MR. FEUR
          I didn't kill my wife.

                     NORMAN
               (to Mr. Feur)
          I'm sorry...

                     CLAIRE
               (over Norman)
          Then where is she?

He stares at both Spencers for a moment.  Then calls past
them.

                     MR. FEUR
          Honey...

Claire and Norman turn.  A BLOND WOMAN backs out of the
passenger seat.  She turns.  IT'S NOT THE FACE CLAIRE HAS
SEEN.  Claire looks sucker punched.

INT.  DR. DRAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY

Claire sits back in the chair.  She looks drained.  A soft
rain taps against the windows.

                     CLAIRE
          And his face...it seemed so gentle, and I
          knew...in that second I knew that I'd
          imagined the whole thing.

Dr. Drayton takes this in.  She seems genuinely frightened.

                     CLAIRE
          What's happening to me?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Well, that's what we're here for.

He watches her calmly, some empathy on his face.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Whether you imagined it or not, you
          actually saw and heard things that
          frightened you...that gave you reason for
          concern.

                     CLAIRE
          Yes, but...

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Your friend saw them.

                     CLAIRE
          Isn't there something called group
          hysteria?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          You think you influenced her?

                     CLAIRE
          Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that
          when all this was happening, I felt, some
          part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody
          needed me.  And the more I reached out to,
          it, the fuller it became.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          You're saying you willed these events to
          happen?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know, I'm very confused right
          now.

Beat.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Did you ever find out what it wanted?

Claire remembers.

                     CLAIRE
          She said, "You know."  That I know.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Do you?

                     CLAIRE
          No.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          What do you think?
               (beat)
          Guess.

Claire ponders this.

                     CLAIRE
          I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by
          someone.
               (beat)
          This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the
          emotions of a figment of my--

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Have you been hurt?

                     CLAIRE
          Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was
          injured, but...

                     DR. DRAYTON
          You were in an accident?

                     CLAIRE
          Last year.  I drove my car up a tree.
          Nothing serious, this...
               (she indicates her scar)
          ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked
          bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it
          scared the hell out of Norman.

Beat.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          How's your marriage?

Claire's eyes widen.

                     CLAIRE
          Listen, don't hold back.

Dr. Drayton smiles kindly.

                     CLAIRE
          Well, he's been amazing throughout this
          whole thing.  Patient and caring...
               (beat)
          I mean, sure, he can be obsessed with his
          work, and...it's a very important time
          right now with all that.  But,
          sometimes...I mean with everybody, right?
          Sometimes it's like...

She trails off.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          That he doesn't...see me, or, you know,
          that I'm...that's something's wrong...with
          me.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          That can't feel good.

                     CLAIRE
          No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what
          you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry,
          but that's not it.  My marriage is fine.
          I've had some kind of "empty-nest"
          episode where I saw some things that
          weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm
          willing to deal with that.
               (beat)
          I just don't want to go conjuring
          problems where none exist.

Claire finishes her tirade.  Dr. Drayton lets her settle for
a moment.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Fair enough.  But you should know that I'm
          far less concerned with whether things
          you saw "existed," than I am with why you
          saw them.

She takes in the ramifications of that.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

Claire's carrying some cuttings into the house.  She hears a
knock at the gate, walks over and opens it to discover...Mrs.
Feur.  The real one.

                     MRS. FEUR
          I wanted to apologize.

                     CLAIRE
          You do?

                     MRS. FEUR
          For scaring you like I did.  When I
          thought about what that must have seemed
          like that day...

                     CLAIRE
          And then you weren't there.

                     MRS. FEUR
          Right.  I'm sorry.

There's an awkward pause.

                     CLAIRE
          Would you like some iced tea?

                     MRS. FEUR
          Very much.

Claire leads her toward the house.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

Claire pours Mrs. Feur a glass of iced tea from a pitcher.
She's small and delicate looking with big, watery eyes.

                     MRS. FEUR
          Your house is so beautiful.

                     CLAIRE
          Thank you.

                     MRS. FEUR
          And these roses.  They're much prettier
          up close.

She regards Mrs. Feur for a moment.  She seems skittish and
shy.

                     CLAIRE
          I...there's something I have to ask
          you.

Mrs. Feur waits.

                     CLAIRE
          That day...at the fence.  You seemed
          terrified.  I don't think I was imagining
          that.

There's a pause.  Mrs. Feur looks down into her lap.

                     MRS. FEUR
          No.

                     CLAIRE
          Of what?  What were you so afraid of?

                     MRS. FEUR
          You're going to think I'm crazy or
          something.

A tiny smile.

                     CLAIRE
          Not this week.

She looks away for a moment, then looks back at Claire.

                     MRS. FEUR
          Love.

                     CLAIRE
          What?

                     MRS. FEUR
          Have you ever felt so completely consumed
          by a feeling for someone that you
          couldn't breathe?  That the time together
          is so passionate and consuming that you
          felt physical pain when they would leave?

                     CLAIRE
          Um...sure.

                     MRS. FEUR
          I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a
          metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I
          never dreamed anyone would hear me back
          there...
               (beat)
          I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's
          in Boston.  He brought my things up and
          pleaded with me to come home.

Claire is mesmerized.

                     MRS. FEUR
          You must think I'm pathetic.

                     CLAIRE
          No.  No, I don't.

                     MRS. FEUR
          I'm sorry that I frightened you like
          that.  But I was so touched by your
          concern.  I've been lonely here.
               (beat)
          Perhaps we could be friends.

Claire stares at this strange, passionate woman.

                     CLAIRE
          I would like that.

Mrs. Feur smiles at her.

INT.  VOLVO - NIGHT

Claire pulls up in front of a large NEW YORK HOTEL.

                     NORMAN
               (on a cell phone)
          ...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for
          dinner.
               (to Claire)
          Sure you won't stay?

                     CLAIRE
          No, it's fine.  I'm fine.

                     NORMAN
               (tempting her)
          Really big bed.

She smiles and shakes her head.  Norman kisses her goodbye,
then grabs his bag from the backseat.

                     NORMAN
          Do I have everything?

                     CLAIRE
          Yep.

                     NORMAN
          Call ya later.

He starts to walk into the hotel.

                     CLAIRE (O.S.)
          And you glad you married me?

He turns.  She's standing next to the car.

                     NORMAN
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          Are you glad?  I'm glad.

Norman walks over to her and cradles her chin with his hand.

                     NORMAN
               (softly)
          You know I am.

                     CLAIRE
          Good.
               (She gazes at him, then
                softly)
          You sat in front...I saw you there...

Norman takes his cue.

                     NORMAN
          You were lost in the music...eyes
          closed...your chest heaving...

                     CLAIRE
          I felt you...looking through me...

                     NORMAN
          We walked all night...

                     CLAIRE
          You told me that I was...

He gently cups her chin in his hand.

                     NORMAN
               (overlapping)
          ...that you were everything I'd ever
          dreamed of.

She smiles, kisses him warmly, then gets in the car.

EXT.  COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

Claire stands outside Caitlin's Columbia dorm, watching young
lives in motion.

INT.  DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

Claire walks past a number of doors.  Music booms out of one,
shards of a conversation out of another.  Finally, she
arrives at a door that says "Fur is murder."  She smiles to
herself and knocks.  There's no answer.

                     DIFFERENT VOICE (O.S.)
          She's out.

Claire turns to find an attractive YOUNG MAN standing at her
elbow.

                     YOUNG MAN
          They're playing at CBGB's down on Bowery.
          Probably won't be back for awhile.  You
          her mom?

                     CLAIRE
          Yes.  Who was playing?

                     YOUNG MAN
          Bitch.  Caitlin's band.

                     CLAIRE
               (stunned)
          Caitlin's band?

                     YOUNG MAN
          Yeah.  They're really good.  I would have
          gone, but I have a paper.
               (beat)
          And I'm not just saying that because
          you're a mother.

Claire nods slightly.

                     CLAIRE
          Thank you.

She walks down the hall.

INT.  CBGB'S - NIGHT

Claire moves past a huge, BLACK SKINHEAD DOORMAN into an
entrance area in the dark throbbing punk club.  She looks out
over the MOB OF SEETHING YOUNG PEOPLE, swaying to a pulsing
power-pop band.  PUNKS and CLUB KIDS push past her as they
move into the throng.  She looks up and her face changes.

CLAIRE'S POV

A shaggy trio of musicians on the stage, pumping through a
jangly, but surprisingly melodic song.  Her eyes race across
the faces of a BUTCH FEMALE DRUMMER, an emaciated
GUITARIST/SINGER and stop on the BASS PLAYER...Caitlin.  She
rocks back and forth to her own hypnotic bass line, EYES
CLOSED, SWAYING TO THE MUSIC.

Claire is transfixed, her face a mix of pride and sadness.
The song ends and Caitlin's eyes open.  She smiles for a
moment, then the smile fades as she spots Claire.  Panicked,
Claire ducks behind a pillar.

EXT.  CBGB'S - NIGHT

The last groups of YOUNG PEOPLE file out of the club.  A
couple of them glance at Claire, who seems very out of place
standing on the Bowery late at night.

                     VOICE (O.S.)
          Mom?

She turns to see Caitlin standing before her, a bass guitar
case on a strap over her shoulder.  There's an awkward pause.

                     CLAIRE
          That was very good.

                     CAITLIN
          Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you.
          But it never felt right.

                     CLAIRE
          Why?

Caitlin stares at the ground.

                     CAITLIN
          I didn't want to bring up memories.  I
          didn't want to do anything that might
          make you regret your choices.

Claire winces silently.

                     CAITLIN
          Besides, Dad would have freaked.

                     CLAIRE
          No, he wouldn't.

                     CAITLIN
          I think playing in a band called "Bitch"
          might put a dent in the whole "perfect
          family" thing.

                     CLAIRE
          That's not true.

                     CAITLIN
          Yes it is.  Can we please not do that?
          Please?  Cause it is.

Claire doesn't disagree.

                     CLAIRE
          He loves you very much.  He just--

                     CAITLIN
          I know he does.

Beat.  Claire studies her surprisingly strong daughter.

                     CAITLIN
          Are you mad at me?

                     CLAIRE
          Listen to me.  The one thing in life that
          I definitely don't regret...is the choice.
          I made to be your mother.

They hug.  For a moment, Claire's got her little girl back.
Her eyes well up.

                     CLAIRE
          I miss you.

                     CAITLIN
          So much.

                     CLAIRE
               (laughing)
          It got so bad your father almost had to
          put me away.

                     CAITLIN
          What do you mean?

                     CLAIRE
          I started seeing things.

                     CAITLIN
          A ghost?

Beat.  Claire stares at her daughter.

                     CLAIRE
          Did you?

                     CAITLIN
          No.  But once I heard...

                     CLAIRE
          What?

                     CAITLIN
          Someone crying.  A girl.
               (beat)
          I thought I was crazy.

                     CLAIRE
               (quietly)
          Then we both are.

Caitlin nods.

INT.  PRESIDENT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

...a large cocktail party.  The house is crowded with
PROFESSORS, ADMINISTRATORS, and their SPOUSES.  PRESIDENT
TEMPLETON, a frosty-haired, avuncular chap, greets them with
his WIFE, a sharp looking woman in her late fifties.

                     TEMPLETON
          There they are.

                     NORMAN
          You remember my wife, Claire.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
               (shaking hands)
          Of course.  You must be so proud.

                     CLAIRE
          I am.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
               (to Norman)
          Everyone's very anxious to shake hands
          with our newest academic celebrity.

She takes their coats.  Dean Templeton leads them in.

                     TEMPLETON
          Must've been some paper.  Your father
          would be very proud.

This seems to strike a nerve.

                     NORMAN
          Uh-huh.

Claire notices this and squeezes his hand.  Templeton leads
Norman into a large living room which is filled with
colleagues.  Several of them turn and begin clapping.  Others
follow suit.

EXT.  PATIO - NIGHT

Claire stands at a small bar.

                     CLAIRE
               (to bartender)
          White wine please.

She scans the party and spots the Feurs deep in some intimate
conversation with each other.  She's speaking about something
astonishing.  He's rapt.

Claire locates Norman in a corner listening as some AGED
ALUMNUS holds forth.  He sees her and mouths, "I'm sorry."
He points to his watch and flashes five fingers.  She smiles
and nods.

                     VOICE (O.S.)
          Guess I'm not much of a medium.

She turns to see Jody.

                     CLAIRE
          Jody...

They hug.

                     JODY
          Are you okay?

                     CLAIRE
          I think so

                     JODY
          I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus,
          Claire...

                     CLAIRE
          It's alright.

                     JODY
          I mess around with this stuff, but I
          never thought anything would happen.

Claire looks uncomfortable.

                     JODY
          Does Norman know?

                     CLAIRE
          Jody, she's alive.

                     JODY
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her.
          She's really sweet.

                     JODY
          Then what was it?

                     CLAIRE
          Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been
          on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident.
          And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--

                     JODY
          Something was there.  You saw it.

                     CLAIRE
          Did I?

                     JODY
          Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a
          guy, this Pakistani guy down in
          Hartford...

                     CLAIRE
          Hartford?

                     JODY
          And he's the real thing.  Specializes in
          cases like this, like yours.

                     CLAIRE
          No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to
          listen to me.  This is not something that
          I can do right now.  Whatever it was,
          it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.

                     JODY
          But Claire--

                     CLAIRE
          Please.

Jody recognizes her fragility.

                     JODY
          Okay.  Okay.

                     CLAIRE
          I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call
          you.

Jody nods as Claire walks off.

INT.  POWDER ROOM - NIGHT

Claire stands in the spacious powder room, checking her
makeup in the mirror.  Mrs. Templeton enters from the
bathroom.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          How're you holding up?

                     CLAIRE
          Just fine.  It's a lovely party.

The two women fix their makeup side-by-side in the mirror.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          Norman was telling me the dream house is
          finally finished.

                     CLAIRE
               (nodding)
          Almost.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          Wonderful.  It's good to see you two doing
          so well.

Claire looks confused.

                     CLAIRE
          I'm sorry?

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          I know how hard it can be sometimes.

Claire turns to her.

                     CLAIRE
          Uh-huh.  What can be?

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          Well, I don't think I've seen you since
          the reception at Dean Ackerman's last
          year.

Claire's still in the dark.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          For the Dupont Chair.
               (off Claire's look)
          I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I
          used to run from at Amherst.

                     CLAIRE
          No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          There was just...some tension.  You were
          upset.  I remember being concerned.

                     CLAIRE
          At the party.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          Toward the end.  You remember?

                     CLAIRE
               (recovering)
          Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you
          know...We're fine.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness,
          but we do have to stick together you
          know.

                     CLAIRE
          Who's that?

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          The wives.

Beat.

                     CLAIRE
          Right.

Mrs. Templeton leaves.  Claire looks into the mirror.

                     CLAIRE (V.O.)
          What was it about?

EXT.  TEMPLETON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Claire and Norman walk toward the car.

                     NORMAN
          You don't remember?

                     CLAIRE
          When she said it, there was something
          familiar...but no.

He looks at her for a moment.

                     NORMAN
          You dropped a glass.

                     CLAIRE
          I...

                     NORMAN
          A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You
          started crying.  I tried to comfort you...

                     CLAIRE
               (something's triggered)
          In the living room...

                     NORMAN
          You shoved me away and ran out to the
          patio.  I took you home.

                     CLAIRE
          But why?  I can't understand how I could
          just completely--

                     NORMAN
          It was maybe a week after the accident.
          We were moving.  It was a hard time.

                     CLAIRE
          But I don't remember.

                     NORMAN
          Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.

                     CLAIRE
          What's wrong with me?

He stops, takes her shoulders gently.

                     NORMAN
               (reassuring)
          Nothing.  Nothing at all.  It's been a
          hard year.  But you're better now.  And
          things are really looking up for us.  So
          let's try to enjoy that.
               (gently)
          Please?

She thinks for a beat.

                     CLAIRE
          Yes.  Yes.  That's what I want.

She takes his hand and kisses it.

EXT.  CLAIRE'S HOUSE - DAY

Claire walks up to the door.  When she touches the knob she
hears...the WHISPERING.  She opens the door and moves into:

INT.  FOYER - DAY

The same intense whispered exchange.  She glances into the
mirror and sees...SHAPES MOVING, BODIES, A FLASH OF SILVER.
She turns the corner and again...NO ONE'S THERE.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY

She walks in and stands before:

The repaired photograph of herself and Norman...at the party
for the DUPONT CHAIR.

She takes it from the wall, stares at it for a moment, then
SMASHES IT ON THE EDGE OF THE DESK.  She extricates the
picture from the broken glass.  The caption reads:

"Dr. Norman Spencer being awarded the distinguished Dupont
Chair in Genetics by Dean of Sciences Torvald Ackerman."

She stares at the picture for a moment, then flips it over
and scans the stories on the back.  One tells of a hotly
contested city council race, another contains details of a
large alumni donation to the university.

She notices the bottom corner of another story she hadn't
noticed before.  It's only a small portion of one column, but
it seems to detail the search for A MISSING GIRL.

INT.  WORK ROOM - DAY

Claire, online, logs onto a missing persons website.  She
narrows her search to NEW ENGLAND.  A screen pops up with a
list of names.  She scrolls down the list until she
finds...FRANK, MADISON ELIZABETH.

                     CLAIRE
          M-E-F...

Claire double clicks on it, then waits breathlessly as a
blurry cyber photo fills the screen.  Slowly, higher
resolution moves down the image.

IT'S THE GHOST.

Under the photo is the legend:

             "DISAPPEARED - OCTOBER 22, 1998"

Claire stares at the familiar face, then shakily hits PRINT.

LATER

Claire is staring down at the girl's face on the print out.

                     VOICE
               (on phone)
          ...she was practically a townie.  Grew up
          in Bradford.

                     CLAIRE
          And she was never found?

                     VOICE
               (on phone)
          Nah.  She was a live wire.  Had this old
          Mustang Fastback.  It's gone too.  Most of
          her friends think she's tooling around
          Mexico somewhere.  Police downgraded her
          to a runaway.

                     CLAIRE
          Thank you, Mr...

She glances at the byline on the back of the newspaper photo.

INSERT

"by Neil McCann"

                     CLAIRE
          ...McCann.

She hangs up.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT

Norman is unpacking NOTES and CHEMICALS from his LEATHER BAG.
Claire walks in.

                     CLAIRE
          Remember this?

She places the printout on his desk.  He takes a long look at
it.

                     NORMAN
          Is this that girl from last year?

Claire nods.

                     CLAIRE
          Did you know her?

Norman looks again.

                     NORMAN
          I may have seen her on campus.

                     CLAIRE
          Not personally.

                     NORMAN
          No.
               (beat)
          I'm afraid to ask what this is about.

                     CLAIRE
               (solemnly)
          It's her.  This is the woman who I've
          seen.

                     NORMAN
          The...

                     CLAIRE
          Yes.  The ghost.

Norman leaves the hung frame and walks over to a window.

                     CLAIRE
          I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's
          not...

                     NORMAN
               (quietly overlapping)
          Stop...

                     CLAIRE
          ...I'm positive this time...

                     NORMAN
               (overlapping)
          ...Please stop...

                     CLAIRE
          It's Madison Fra--

                     NORMAN
          STOP IT!

Claire falls silent, Norman turns from the window.

                     NORMAN
               (calmly)
          Claire, I've tried to be there.  I know
          you're going through something that I
          can't understand...but it's enough.

Claire looks down.

                     NORMAN
          Do you want to go see someone?  Together?
          Should we call Dr. Drayton?

She shakes her head.

                     NORMAN
          Well then what?  Claire, what?  Tell me
          what I can do.

Long pause.  Claire looks up, then timidly holds out the
printout.

                     CLAIRE
          It's her.

Norman's jaw tightens.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't want to make you angry.  But she's
          here.  And I don't know why...

He silently walks out of the room.  Claire stares down at the
face in the photo.

EXT.  MADISON FRANK'S HOUSE - DAY

Claire parks in front of a small, clapboard house in a
neighborhood that is decidedly less upscale than her own.
She gets out and tentatively walks up to the tiny porch.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

Claire rings the bell.  A DRAWN LOOKING WOMAN in her early
fifties answers the door.

                     CLAIRE
          Mrs. Frank?

                     MRS. FRANK
          Yeah.

                     CLAIRE
          I'd like to talk to you about Madison.

                     MRS. FRANK
          You know where she is?

                     CLAIRE
          No, I don't.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Please leave me alone.

She starts to close the door.  Claire leans forward.

                     CLAIRE
          She's my friend.

The woman stops.

                     CLAIRE
          Was.  We were...acquainted.  I've been
          away for awhile.  When I came back...

She studies Claire.

                     MRS. FRANK
          What's your name?

                     CLAIRE
          Claire.

                     MRS. FRANK
          She never mentioned you.

Claire doesn't know what to say to this.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Then again, she didn't say much about her
          college friends.

She gives Claire the once over.

                     MRS. FRANK
          I'm watchin' my shows.

She motions Claire in.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY

Claire sits on a couch in the cramped living room.  Mrs.
Frank serves up a mug of coffee.  A soap plays silently on an
old 19" RCA.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha
          nonsense.

                     CLAIRE
          It's fine.

She sizes Claire up.

                     MRS. FRANK
          You look a little old for a student.

                     CLAIRE
          I'm not.  We...we met at a party.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Sounds about right.  Never understood how
          a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't
          get it from me.  They wanted to put her in
          a special school for the gifted when she
          was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.

                     CLAIRE
          She never mentioned her father.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was
          twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.

There's a silence.  Mrs. Frank stares at the TV.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Don't need the sound.  You can pretty much
          tell what's happening by the faces.  Turn
          it up sometimes, though.  Feels like
          someone's here.

Claire doesn't know what to say.  Mrs. Frank turns to her.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Why are you here?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.

                     MRS. FRANK
          It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No
          note.  Nothing.
               (beat)
          Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna
          know what happened.

Claire stares at this tough, tragic woman.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Wanna see her room?

Claire nods.

INT.  MADISON'S ROOM - DAY

Claire enters the room.  Her face freezes.

ANGLE

SEVERAL POSTERS FOR ALTERNATIVE AND METAL BANDS, side by side
with ACADEMIC PLAQUES AND AWARDS.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She
          wanted to stay close.

                     CLAIRE
          You must have been very proud.

She nods.  Claire moves along looking at pictures.  Some with
different men, others with rough looking friends.  Claire
stops at a picture tucked into a mirror.

INSERT

Madison singing at a recital of some kind.  She's lovely,
with striking GREEN EYES.  Around her neck is a distinctive
SILVER NECKLACE, with a perfectly wrought, SILVER ROSEBUD.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Such a pretty voice.  Surprised she didn't
          major in music.
               (beat)
          That's the last picture.

A phone rings in the hallway.

                     MRS. FRANK
          S'cuse me.

Claire's eye is pulled past the picture into the mirror, the
reflection of something pinned to the edge of a bulletin
board.  She turns and moves over to:

A SHORT BLOND BRAID.  She reaches out to touch it.  Claire
hears footsteps.  Mrs. Frank leans back into the room.

                     MRS. FRANK
          They're calling me in to work.

                     CLAIRE
          I should be going anyway.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

Mrs. Frank walks Claire out.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Y'hear anything you'll let me know?

                     CLAIRE
          Of course.

Claire walks to her car.  She turns and calls out:

                     CLAIRE
          What was her major?

                     MRS. FRANK
          Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.

Claire stands, frozen, as Mrs. Frank disappears into the
little house.

INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

Claire shuts the blinds, then places the large candle on the
floor, then places the MISSING GIRL PRINTOUT at the base of
the candle.  On top if it, she places THE BRAID.

Then Claire lights the candle, puts the braid on the picture,
and hunches over it, whispering intensely:

                     CLAIRE
          I need to know the truth.

She waits a beat.  Nothing.

                     CLAIRE
          Madison, please...help me.

Nothing happens.  She looks around at the seance props.

She stands and places her hands on the sink.  She glances at
herself in the mirror.

                     CLAIRE
          What am I doing?

Suddenly, her head droops over, she shudders softly.  When
she looks back into the mirror, her eyes are a DEEP GREEN.
She hears the front door open downstairs.

                     NORMAN (O.S.)
          Hello...Anybody home?!

A strange smile creeps across her face.

INT.  CLAIRE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

POV - Gliding down the stairs and into...

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

The refrigerator door is open.  Norman is leaning over.  Only
his ass protrudes.

REVERSE

Norman closes the refrigerator door and sees Claire standing
before him, stripped down to a skirt and slip top.  There's a
different physicality to her movements...a different rhythm
to her speech.

                     CLAIRE
          Hello, Dr. Spencer.

Norman smiles.

                     NORMAN
          Mrs. Spencer.

She shakes her head.

                     CLAIRE
          Forbidden fruit...

She takes the apple...

                     CLAIRE
          Got a problem with that...

...then takes a ravenous bite and walks out of the room.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY

Norman finds Claire seated on his desk, her legs spread.

                     NORMAN
          I take it your not mad at me.

                     CLAIRE
          Wouldn't go that far.

She grabs his belt and pulls him into her, then holds the
apple to his mouth.  Norman tentatively takes a bite.  She
mashes it slowly into his mouth until he recoils slightly.

                     NORMAN
               (mouth full)
          Okay...

When he chews the huge bite, a glistening drop of juice runs
down his chin.  Claire leans forward and licks it off.

                     NORMAN
          What's gotten into you?

She just smiles mischievously, then starts kissing him.  It
looks like she's eating his lips.  Norman's getting hot.  She
bites down on a lip.

                     NORMAN
          Ow!

                     CLAIRE
          What's the matter?

                     NORMAN
          It's too rough.

                     CLAIRE
          Since when?

Something about this response frightens him.  Claire yanks
Norman's belt open.  He steps back, tripping over his
castered desk chair.  She's on top of him in a flash, sitting
astride him.  She speaks in a forceful, sexy whisper.

                     NORMAN
          I don't like this, this...

                     CLAIRE
               (pinning his hands above his
                head)
          Why don't you shut up and fuck me,
          Professor.

She grinds up against him.  Suddenly, something pulls her eye
to the hallway.

POV - The COAT RACK MIRROR, now from inside the study.  In
it's reflection:  ANOTHER CLAIRE, shorter hair, stunned
expression.  Where she's standing...it's DAYTIME.

Claire leans over him until they're nose-to-nose.

                     CLAIRE
               (tense whisper)
          I think she's starting to suspect
          something.

                     NORMAN
               (through clenched teeth)
          Who?

                     CLAIRE
               (leaning down)
          Your wife...

                     NORMAN
          STOP IT!

Norman shoves her off of him onto the floor.  He stands,
breathless.

                     NORMAN
          What the hell are you doing?!

In a moment, it's Claire again, stunned and trembling against
the wall.

                     CLAIRE
               (to herself, remembering)
          "You know..."

                     NORMAN
               (rattled)
          What?

She looks up.

                     CLAIRE
          I was there.

                     NORMAN
          Claire--

                     CLAIRE
               (flooding back to her)
          I came to work in the garden and I saw
          you with her...in my house.

                     NORMAN
          Oh God...

                     CLAIRE
          I snuck back to my car, trying to
          convince myself it never happened.  And
          when I woke up in the hospital...somehow
          it hadn't.  Until now.

He just stares at her, his face anguished.

                     NORMAN
          It was last year.  We were having
          troubles.

                     CLAIRE
          So you fucked a student?!

                     NORMAN
               (reaching for her)
          That's not what I'm sayi--

                     CLAIRE
               (pulling back)
          DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me.
          Go!

He's frozen.

                     CLAIRE
          I SAID GET OUT!

Norman doesn't move.  He's never seen her like this.

                     CLAIRE
          Fine...

She bolts toward the living room.  He follows her.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

She grabs her coat.

                     NORMAN
               (welling up)
          Claire, please don't...

                     CLAIRE
          What did you think I would do?  Jesus
          Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...

                     NORMAN
          I never asked you to quit!

                     CLAIRE
          ...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect
          Daddy and that meant perfect wife,
          perfect family...

He follows her as she searches for her purse and keys.

                     NORMAN
          THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And
          then when you did, you hated me for it...
          so you gave it all to her.

                     CLAIRE
          Who?

                     NORMAN
          To Caitlin!!

She wheels on him with fury.

                     CLAIRE
          Leave her out of this!

                     NORMAN
          And then out of nowhere, some bright
          young woman found me attractive...

                     CLAIRE
          Stop...

                     NORMAN
          ...would do anything just to be around
          me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I
          slipped.

                     CLAIRE
          I'm not going to listen to this.

Claire goes to leave, Norman blocks her path.

                     NORMAN
          I tried to break it off!

                     CLAIRE
          You should have tried harder.

                     NORMAN
          Claire...

                     CLAIRE
               (seething)
          Get out of my way.

She brushes past him.

INT.  FOYER - NIGHT

He catches up, beside himself.

                     NORMAN
          PLEASE DON'T GO!

Claire's nearly disarmed by this rare emotional outburst.
She turns at the door and looks back.

                     CLAIRE
          You made it impossible for me to be
          someone you could be in love with.

She leaves.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Norman, rumpled and unshaven, is passed out on the couch, a
half empty whiskey bottle beside him on the coffee table.  He
awakens to find Claire sitting across from him.

                     CLAIRE
          I want you to answer one question.

He waits.

                     CLAIRE
          Did you have anything to do with her
          disappearance?

Beat.

                     NORMAN
          Yes.

Claire goes pale.

                     NORMAN
          She was damaged and unstable.  The more I
          tried to distance myself, the more
          desperate she became.  Finally, she showed
          up at the new house...

                     CLAIRE
          How did she know where it was?

He stares off.  The reality sinks in for Claire.

                     CLAIRE
               (softly)
          Our dream house.

Norman can hardly look at her.

                     NORMAN
          She was out of control.  She said she was
          going to kill herself...or you.  I never
          thought she'd go through with any of it,
          but then she was gone...

He trails off.

                     CLAIRE
          She did it.

                     NORMAN
          We don't know that for sure.

                     CLAIRE
          Of course she did, Norman.  What else
          could it be?

The enormity of this hits Norman.  His head drops into his
hands.

                     NORMAN
          Oh God, what have I done?  How could I
          have let this into our lives?

He looks up at her, teary.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.

She gets up and walks out of the room.

EXT.  JODY'S STUDIO - DAY

An old industrial loft filled with finished and half-finished
oil paintings.  Jody brings Claire some tea.

                     CLAIRE
          ...and everything I have, everything I
          thought my life was...Christ when I think
          of all the lies...

Jody looks down.

                     CLAIRE
          What?
               (beat)
          Jody what?

Jody looks up, tears in her eyes.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh God...you knew.

                     JODY
          I was down in Adamant...

                     CLAIRE
          Adamant?

                     JODY
          Artsy little village down seven.  There's
          a guy there who sells my work.  I had just
          dropped off some paintings and as I got
          in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this
          little cafe.

Claire waits for her to continue.

                     JODY
          I started to walk over...but he wasn't
          alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse.
          She was young.
               (beat)
          I should have said something right away.
          But I didn't.

                     CLAIRE
          Why?

                     JODY
          Partly because I didn't want to hurt
          you...but partly...partly because I was
          relieved.

                     CLAIRE
          Relieved?

                     JODY
          I had just been left by Richard.  I was
          bitter and miserable and for some fucked
          up reason, it made me feel better that
          your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.

Claire nods.

                     JODY
          By the time I finally got up the nerve to
          tell you, Stan called from the hospital
          and it was too late.

                     CLAIRE
          Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.

                     JODY
          Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of
          Valium in your system?

Claire walks over to a window.

                     JODY
          I got there first.  Stan covered up the
          pills and I had it out with Norman.  He
          seemed desperate not to lose you.  He
          promised to handle it.  And we all let it
          drop away.

                     CLAIRE
          All of us.

Beat.

                     JODY
          I'm a terrible friend.

                     CLAIRE
          No.

Claire turns.

                     CLAIRE
          How could I expect you to tell me
          something that I wouldn't even tell
          myself?

                     JODY
          What are you going to do?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.

                     JODY
          If she was dangerous before--

                     CLAIRE
          She could have hurt me if she wanted to.

                     JODY
          You don't know that.
               (beat)
          If it's your belief that gives her form,
          then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow
          you have to break the connection.

                     CLAIRE
          No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now
          that I do...I think she's at peace.

Jody isn't as sure.

INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

Claire walks in.  She notices the clock on the range is dark.
She flips on a light.  Nothing happens.  Worried, she heads
upstairs.

INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - MORNING

Claire enters.  The bed is empty.  The shower is running in
the bathroom.

                     CLAIRE
          Norman?

INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING

ANGLE - CLAIRE...her face a mask of terror.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh God...

CLAIRE'S POV

The BATHTUB, with the shower curtain drawn around it, the
water blasting.  Norman's limp hand pokes through the
curtain.  AN ELECTRIC CORD leads from the mirror socket into
the tub.

Claire races over and rips the plug from the wall.  She tears
the SHOWER CURTAIN AWAY to find A BLUISH NORMAN lying,
unconscious in the tub.

                     CLAIRE
          No, no.  Please no...

She hugs her face to his chest until she picks up a
heartbeat.

                     CLAIRE
          Norman!!  Wake up!  Please!

Claire shakes him to no effect.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh God...NORMAN!

She slaps him on the face...once, then twice.  He suddenly
sucks in a gulp of air, begins struggling and dazedly returns
to life.

                     CLAIRE
          It's me...it's me...

Sobbing, she shuts off the squeaky faucets and struggles to
pull him upright.  She discovered HER BLOWDRYER in the tub
and hurls it across the room.

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

Claire sits beside Norman on the bed as two E.M.T.'s, an OLD
GUY and a HEAVY WOMAN pack up.  Stan's on the phone, Jody off
to one side.

                     HEAVY WOMAN
          Vitals are good.  I'd take it easy for a
          couple of days.

                     NORMAN
          Thanks.

The E.M.T.'s leave as Stan hangs up.

                     STAN
          They'll take you for a CAT scan tomorrow
          if you're feeling dizzy at all.

                     NORMAN
          That won't be necessary.   

He glances at Claire as he walks Stan out.

                     NORMAN
          Not unless there's a miracle drug for
          clumsiness.

They leave.

                     CLAIRE
          Jody, she tried to kill him.

                     JODY
          I know.

                     CLAIRE
          I can't believe this is happening.

                     JODY
          We need help.  Please let me call the
          medium.

                     CLAIRE
          That could take days.  I need to do
          something now.  Don't you see?  She wants
          us dead.

Jody thinks for a moment.

                     JODY
          Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened
          this door.  There's got to be a way that
          you can close it.

                     CLAIRE
          Like what?

                     JODY
          I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just
          making this up...

                     CLAIRE
          What is it?

                                                      CUT TO:

MADISON'S SMILING FACE

EXT.  DOCK - DAY

Claire's staring down at the PRINTOUT.  She's kneeling at the
edge of the dock.  From her pocket she produces THE BLOND
BRAID and a piece of TWINE.  She wraps the braid up in the
printout with a rock and secures it with the twine.

                     CLAIRE
          Sorry.  Better or worse, he's mine.

She tosses the little parcel into the dark water.  Bubbles
stream up.  In the bubbles, Claire sees...THE PALE SHAPE,
which slowly becomes THE DROWNED GIRL, staring up from
beneath the dark water.

Claire wants to pull away, but she's transfixed.  Madison
reaches up toward the surface.  As the bubble diminish, she
seems to be FADING AWAY.  When she's gone, Claire reaches out
toward the water.  When her finger touches the surface...

WHOOSH!  She's sucked down into the water.

INT.  UPSTAIRS SITTING ROOM - DAY

Norman glances out of the window in time to see a splash off
the dock.  He races out of the room.

EXT.  UNDERWATER - DAY

Claire struggles furiously as the unseen attacker drags her
deeper into the murky depths.

EXT.  DOCK - DAY

Norman sprints toward the dock.

EXT.  UNDERWATER - DAY

As he oxygen begins to run out, Claire screams desperately as
her hand plunges into the muddy bottom.

Suddenly, she's released.  She yanks her hand free, the silt
swirls revealing...a COPPER COLORED GLINT in the mud.

NORMAN'S HAND grasps Claire's ankle and pulls her upwards.

EXT.  DOCK - DAY

Norman helps Claire, coughing, onto the dock.  They hold each
other.

                     NORMAN
          Are you okay?

She nods, catching her breath.

                     NORMAN
          We have to get out of here.

                     CLAIRE
          It's alright.

                     NORMAN
          Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.

                     CLAIRE
          She's gone.

                     NORMAN
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          She can't be here without me.

                     NORMAN
          How can you be sure?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know, but I am.  She was there and
          then she was gone.  I felt it.

                     NORMAN
          Claire...

She stares into the still water.

                     CLAIRE
          It's over.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Claire in bed with a blanket wrapped around her.  Norman
walks in with some steaming mulled cider.  He stokes the
blazing fire.  He sits on the edge of the bed.

                     NORMAN
          I know it's going to take awhile before
          things are back...until they're better
          than before.  But you've given us a chance
          to make a fresh start.  And I'm going to
          spend the rest of my life making you glad
          that you did.

The gaze at each other.  Tentatively, she places a hand on
his.

EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

Claire, dressed in a warm sweater, finishes wrapping her
rosebushes for the winter.  She picks up a basket of clipped
flowers and heads inside.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

She turns the doorknob and listens for the whispering.  All
is quiet.

INT.  FOYER - DAY

She looks into the mirror and sees only the study and the
lake behind it.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY

Claire places the roses in a vase on Norman's desk, and in
doing so, accidentally knocks it over.

With a towel she mops up the water which has dripped onto the
wooden floor.  The stream has flowed over to the knot and
dripped into the crack.  Claire stares down at THE STRANGE
COPPER COIN.

She grabs a letter opener from Norman's desk and pries the
coin out.  It's actually a SMALL BRASS KEY, the head of which
is THREE INTERLOCKING CIRCLES.  She stares at it for a
moment, then places it in her pocket.

EXT.  SAILBOAT - DUSK

Claire stands toward the bow watching the sunset.  The leaves
on the surrounding hills are stunning.  Norman appears beside
her.

                     NORMAN
          Last sail of the year.

She gazes out.

                     CLAIRE
          The leaves...

                     NORMAN
          Incredible.  We should take a drive before
          they're gone.  Spend the night at some
          cozy little bed and breakfast.

                     CLAIRE
          Look for antiques...

                     NORMAN
          Yep.  There's some great places nearby.

                     CLAIRE
               (a reflex)
          Adamant.

                     NORMAN
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          Little village down seven.  Supposed to be
          charming.

                     NORMAN
          Huh.

                     CLAIRE
          Do you know it?

                     NORMAN
          Don't think so.

                     CLAIRE
          Maybe we can stop there for lunch.

He wraps an arm around her.

                     NORMAN
          Whatever you'd like.

She leans against him, staring out.

EXT.  DRIVEWAY - DAY

Jody and Claire return from a walk.  Norman has the boat on
the trailer and is securing a tarp over it.  They stop under
a tree.

                     CLAIRE
          But he acted like he'd never heard of it.

                     JODY
          Did he say that?

                     CLAIRE
          Jody he was lying.

                     JODY
          What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to
          bring that up again just when you're
          trying to make a new start?

                     CLAIRE
          I guess not.

                     JODY
          He's trying to put it behind him, Claire.
          You should too.

Norman smiles and waves.  They wave back as they arrive at
the Karman-Ghia.

                     JODY
          You've got a beautiful life.  And even
          with this, it's always been clear that he
          loves you.
               (beat)
          I've come to think that's all that really
          matters.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know...

                     JODY
          Trust me, Claire.  You hear something...
          change the subject.  You find something...
          get rid of it, throw it in the lake.
               (beat)
          You know what happened.  The rest is only
          details.  And no one's ever glad they got
          a hold of those.  If you want to put this
          back together...just let it go.

Jody drives off.  Claire walks over to Norman.  She hugs him
tightly.

                     NORMAN
          What's that for?

                     CLAIRE
          Nothing.

                     NORMAN
          I'm cooking you dinner.

                     CLAIRE
          You don't have to do that.

                     NORMAN
          I know.

                     CLAIRE
          Fine.  I'll do the shopping.

They kiss.  She heads to the Volvo.

INT.  VOLVO - DAY

Claire is approaching a country market.  She spots a little
sign with an arrow:

                     ADAMANT - 11 mi.

She hesitates for a moment, then take the turn.

EXT.  ADAMANT - DAY

Claire stands on a street in the quaint little village.  She
looks around, spots a little cafe with outdoor tables.  A
friendly old HIPPIE WOMAN walks out of a store.  She watches
Claire gazing around.

                     HIPPIE WOMAN
          What are you looking for?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't really know.

                     HIPPIE WOMAN
          Know what you mean.

She ambles off across the street.  Claire watches her go.
Then notices a sign hung out above a little shop.  THREE
INTERLOCKED CIRCLES.  She walks toward it.

EXT.  SHOP - DAY

Claire stands in front of the store window.  A sign in the
window identifies it as "The Sleeping Dog - Hand wrought
jewelry and gifts."  Claire tries to open the door, but sees
a closed sign.

She steps back out to the window and looks in.  On display
are a selection of handcrafted jewelry and curios.

Suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an
intricate ROSEBUD.

Her eye travels up and behind it to the back of the display
where she spots, a small ORNATE COPPER CHEST.  Protruding
from its lock...THE INTERLOCKED CIRCLES.  Claire looks like
she's been punched.

INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Claire glances over at the soundly sleeping Norman.  She
gingerly slides out of bed.

INT.  BASEMENT - NIGHT

Claire sits among the boxes, leafing through the photo album,
tracking the years of their life.  Her hands tremble.
Finally she reaches the picture of their wedding, reaches
behind the photo and produces...THE KEY.

EXT.  DOCK - NIGHT

Claire in her nightgown and a jacket, walks slowly down the
dock.  An expensive looking flashlight illuminates her path.
She stops and stares out at the moonlit lake.

She holds out a fist.  Her fingers unfold and in her palm
lies THE KEY.  She holds the key out over the water and
stands there, frozen.  The lighthouse beam sweeps past her
once...then again.

Claire pulls her hand back and holds the key to her chest,
then carefully places it on the dock.  She very deliberately
takes off her jacket and slippers, steps to the edge of the
dock, shines the flashlight on the dark water...then steps
off the dock.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

AN ANGUISHED CRY from downstairs.  Norman bolts upright in
bed.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT

Norman walks through the darkened house into the moonlit
room.  He pulls up short when he sees the strongbox sitting
closed on his desk.  He looks around, sees the room is empty
and walks over to it.

The mud and silt has been wiped from the top, on which is
engraved:  To N.C.S. with love always, M.E.F.

He pulls open the lid and tentatively peers inside.

THE LIGHTS SWITCH ON.

Claire stands in the doorway, holding out the SILVER ROSEBUD
NECKLACE.

                     CLAIRE
          Looking for this?

Norman stares at her dumbly.

                     CLAIRE
          She's out there isn't she?  She's in the
          lake.

                     NORMAN
          Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what
          this is.

                     CLAIRE
          Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING
          NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!

                     NORMAN
               (nearly hysterical)
          I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus.
          Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she
          was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On
          my life!  She took pills and she killed
          herself in our house to destroy me!  To
          destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here
          before school, the painters would have--

                     CLAIRE
          I don't believe you.

                     NORMAN
          IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe
          me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!
               (beat, fighting tears)
          I did what I had to, Claire.  She was
          gone.  There was nothing I could do for
          her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I
          rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.
               (beat)
          And I've lived with that image ever since.
               (beat)
          I couldn't just stand there while
          everything-- my career, us,
          everything, just washed away.  Don't you
          see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is
          exactly what she wants you to think!

Claire's lip is quivering with confusion.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know what's true anymore.
               (beat)
          But that girl must be brought up.  Now do
          you want to call the police?  Or should I?

Norman stares at the phone.  He's a wreck.

                     NORMAN
          Fine.  I can't live with it anymore.

He takes the phone, punches in three numbers, waits.

                     NORMAN
          This is Dr. Norman Spencer.  No, it's not
          an emergency.

He looks at Claire.

                     NORMAN
          I have some information about a missing
          girl, Madison Frank...Yes.  Could you send
          an officer?  Fifteen Willoughby, about a
          mile before the bridge...Thank you.

He hangs up.  Long silence.  They look at each other.

                     NORMAN
          You did the right thing.
               (beat)
          I'm going to get cleaned up.

He walks out.  Claire walks over and stands before the box.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Claire walks into the bedroom.  The shower can be heard
through the bathroom door, which is partially ajar.  Steam
drifts out through the crack.

She stands in her dressing room and catches sight of her
weary, distraught countenance in the mirror.  She glances
down.

CLAIRE'S POV

The necklace still in her hand.

She looks up again into the mirror.  Her face goes strangely
blank and, almost mechanically, she clasps the necklace onto
her neck.

Suddenly, she stares over at the CORDLESS PHONE lying on the
bed for a long moment.  She walks over, picks up the phone
and looks at it.

CLAIRE'S POV

The redial button.

She stares at the bathroom door, then hits the button.  Two
rings, then:

                     VOICE
               (on phone)
          Directory assistance...

Claire's eyes widen in terror.  She clicks off the phone,
and, taking it with her, starts moving toward the door to the
hall.  She keeps a steady eye trained on the bathroom.  She
quietly pulls open the hallway door.

Suddenly, A HAND WITH A WASHCLOTH IS THRUST OVER HER FACE.

Claire shoves Norman's hand away and runs past him down the
hall.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

She's nearly at the top of the stairs when her body starts to
falter.  She tumbles over, dropping the phone, which clatters
down the stairs before her.

Claire is pulling herself down the stairs, moaning in terror.
Norman can be seen calmly following her, waiting for the
Halothane to take its full effect.  Finally, she freezes.
Norman picks up the phone and stands over her.

                     NORMAN
          God, how did we come to this?

He picks her gently up in his arms and starts carrying her
slowly up the stairs.

                     NORMAN
          The ghost stuff, that was impressive.

CLAIRE'S POV

Ceiling, shapes...

                     NORMAN
          I figure you saw her that day in the
          house and just gradually intuited the
          whole damn thing.  That would be pretty
          astonishing.  A passive-aggressive
          masterpiece.

INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

And into the bathroom.

                     NORMAN
          Wasn't until the shower that I realized
          you actually believed it.  Nearly froze to
          death waiting for you.  Thought the
          circuit breaker would kick back over and
          I'd be toast.

...then she's lowered into the tub.

                     NORMAN
          The crazy thing is...I have never for one
          moment stopped loving you.

He actually wipes a tear from his eye.  He kisses her lips.
We can feel her revulsion.  His face over her.

                     NORMAN
          Don't worry about Caitlin.  I'm sure in
          some tragic way this'll bring us closer
          together.

He turns on the faucets, then moves out of her line of
vision.  Sound of a number being dialed.

                     NORMAN (O.S.)
          Hey, it's Norman.  Listen, we had a huge
          blowout, so I'm going down to sleep at
          the lab.  I guess you're out, but...
          maybe...if you wouldn't mind stopping by
          to check on her in the morning?

She glances down and sees on the edge of the tub...a
prescription bottle of VALIUM with her name on the label.
Her eyes go wide.

                     NORMAN (O.S.)
          It's just...Jody, it's bad.  I've never
          seen her like this...
               (he trails off, choking up)
          I don't really know what to do anymore.

Norman, lit periodically by the sweep of the light house
beacon, squats with the phone and gazes down at her.

                     NORMAN
          If anything ever happened to her, I'd...
               (beat)
          Anyway, thanks.

Claire, mute, glances frantically around.  One of her fingers
begins to flutter.

                     NORMAN
               (tearfully)
          I'm so sorry.

The tub is rapidly filling.  He checks his watch, then
reaches for the Valium.  As much from will as the drug
beginning to fade, Claire lets out a garbled cry.

                     CLAIRE
               (sloppy, guttural)
          Mmmuh...

                     NORMAN
          Shhhh.

                     CLAIRE
               (slurry)
          Mauduh...

Norman stops.

                     NORMAN
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          MADISON!

Norman seems unnerved that she's still clinging to her belief
in the ghost.

                     NORMAN
          That's a little much, don't you think?

He sees the necklace on her neck.

                     NORMAN
          Oops.  Can't have that.

He puts down the bottle of Valium, then reaches around
Claire's neck to remove the necklace.  When his hands close
on the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack.

NORMAN'S POV

His arms around MADISON'S BEAUTIFUL CORPSE.

Norman explodes backwards, slamming his head into the BRASS
SHOWER NOZZLE.  He staggers out of the bathroom before
collapsing with a thud.  The water finally rises above
Claire's nostrils.

Claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and
yank it free.  The water slowly descends.

When it seems that her lungs must burst, her mouth finally
clears the descending water.  She chokes in great gulps of
air.

The drug is finally wearing off.  Claire sits up.  Norman's
unconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway.  She
turns off the water and stands unsteadily.

She looks around for the phone and finally spots the little
antenna protruding from under Norman.  She delicately pulls
the phone out of his back pocket, only to discover that it's
been broken by his fall.  She drops it and walks quietly out
of the room.

INT.  STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Claire stumbles as fast as she can down the stairs.

INT.  FOYER - NIGHT

She fumbles for some KEYS in a basket by the door, then looks
at the cell phone's recharging cradle.  It's empty.

She spots Norman's coat hanging on the coat rack and rifles
through the pockets.  She finds the phone, and flips it open
to see if it's working.  A drop of something splats on the
phone.  Then another.  It's blood.

She looks up and sees Norman, his forehead gashed, glaring
down from the landing.

She reaches for the door knob, but the keys and cell phone in
her hand make it difficult to open.  Norman hurls himself
over the banister.  THUD!

A BLOODY HAND yanks her backwards.  Claire slams into the
corner by the armoir.  Norman advances on her.  At the last
moment, she throws her shoulder into the armoir which tumbles
over on Norman.

EXT.  DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Claire races over to the Volvo, which is blocked by NORMAN'S
PICKUP, the dark hulk of THE SAILBOAT on a trailer behind it.

She starts to get into the pickup, then remembers to look in
the bed...nobody there.

INT.  PICKUP - NIGHT

The truck is cold and doesn't want to turn over.  She stares
at the door for signs of Norman.

                     CLAIRE
          Come on...come on...

...and VROOM, the truck roars to life.  Claire spews gravel
as she barrels the cumbersome rig out of the driveway,
constantly watching the door.

When she veers to the right out of the driveway, she looks
into the rear view mirror.  The boat momentarily blocks the
open door, then clears.  Still nothing.

EXT.  DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

Claire wheels the truck and trailer out onto a two-lane road.

INT.  PICKUP - NIGHT

Shivering with cold and adrenalin, she tries to work the
ancient heater.  She turns onto THE BRIDGE.

EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT

The PICKUP and BOAT race across the deserted bridge.

INT.  PICKUP - NIGHT

ANGLE

Claire through the windshield.  Her face striped by the
reflection of the bridge lights which whip one-by-one across
the windshield.  She flips open the cell phone and punches in
911.  It blinks:  "NO SERVICE."

                     CLAIRE
          Shit.

She glances into the rear view mirror.

CLAIRE'S POV

A stern section of the boat's COVERING TARP untied, flapping
in the breeze.

Claire desperately punches the "talk" button again..."NO
SERVICE."  She's past the center of the bridge.  She looks
again:  "ROAM."  Claire punches the talk button again.

SMASH!

A TRAILER CRANK punches through the window.  Norman's arm
follows, coiling like a python around Claire's neck, his grim
visage pressed against the glass.

She squashes down the accelerator.

EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT

The trailer starts to weave from side to side, swerving the
pickup.  Claire chokes, then blacks out.

EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT

The Pickup and trailer smash through the railing, barreling
over bumpy terrain straight toward the BOAT RAMP.

The truck hits the water at fifty and Norman is hurtled
through the rear window and into the passenger side
dashboard.

INT.  PICKUP - MOMENTS LATER

Claire is unconscious in the driver's seat, a trickle of
blood runs from her nose.  Norman stirs briefly as Claire
groggily comes to.  She hears the hissing of the smashed
radiator, then sees Norman, a shattered bloody mess on the
floor of the cab.

She leans over to see if he's dead, hears a squeak and
realizes that the pickup, with the BATTERED SAILBOAT AND
TRAILER miraculously still attached, is rolling deeper into
the water.

Before she can get the door open, the truck is half
submerged.  She frantically manages to lower her window
halfway and starts to pull herself out.

Her ribs have just cleared the glass when a bloody fist locks
onto her ankle and yanks her inside.  Norman pulls her down
until they're face to face.

                     CLAIRE
          Norman...NO...

She yanks the emergency brake, but it's too late...the
submerged wheels lock and slide slowly down the mossy ramp.
The truck is nearly submerged.

                     CLAIRE
               (desperately)
          Norman, please...

The water is up to the windows.  Norman shakes his head
slowly as he blinks away blood from his eyes.

                     CLAIRE
          Think of Caitlin...

Water sprays in through the hole in the rear window and
momentarily blinds Norman.  Claire jerks free and scrambles
out of the driver's side window as the truck sinks.

Just as she's free of the window, she jerks to a stop.  She
looks down and sees Norman, half out of the window, one hand
clamped onto her ankle.

There is a wrenching metallic creak.  The truck lurches
downward...then silence.  IT DOESN'T SINK.  The boat buoys it
like a fishing cork as it drifts out into the lake.

The headlights pierce the darkness of the steep underwater
drop off.  Claire tries to swim free, but Norman's not
letting go.

Suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer.
It hurtles downwards and the still-glowing headlights
reveal...

MADISON'S SUBMERGED MUSTANG

SMASH!

When the front of the pickup lands on the hood of the car,
the Mustang's windshield shatters.  A PALE SHAPE FLOATS
UPWARD.

Norman is suddenly entangled by something.  He tries to brush
it free but comes face-to-face with MADISON'S GHASTLY,
DECOMPOSED FACE.  The last of his air bellows out of him in a
scream as he releases Claire's ankle.

His dead staring face separates from Madison's as the truck
slowly tilts back and sinks to the bottom.

EXT.  LAKE - DAWN

Claire breaks the surface with a huge intake of air.

                                                      CUT TO:

UNDERWATER - DAWN

The sound of a furious cello solo.

COLD STARING EYES

Norman, half out of the truck, arms floating.

Follow his eyes to THE PALE CORPSE, drifting above, tethered
to the Mustang by an old seat belt around her ankle.

Move through the murky water toward the corpse's clothed
back.  As she twists into view...

MORPHS INTO:  MADISON'S PALE BEAUTIFUL FACE...at peace.

Camera drifts, moves upward and breaks the surface as the
distant lights of EMERGENCY VEHICLES approach.

                                                      CUT TO:

FINGERS

...filled with moist earth.  A hand tosses the clump of dirt
onto...

EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY

A CASKET

Widen to reveal Claire, dressed in black, stepping away from
the grave.  A tiny arm snakes around her waist.  She glances
down to see Caitlin, her eyes shining, clasping her mother
tightly.  Claire takes a last look into the grave.

                     CLAIRE
          Rest in peace.

THE GRAVESTONE - MADISON ELIZABETH FRANK

Mother and daughter turn and step back.  Next to them, also
in black, is MRS. FRANK.

                                                      CUT TO:

FINGERS

Racing across the neck of a cello.  The solo continues and
now reaches the difficult transition that had stumped Claire
before.

WIDEN TO REVEAL

INT.  A LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Claire, her hair short and sexy, eyes tightly shut, brow
beaded with sweat.  The piece builds to a dark, passionate
crescendo.

Her eyes remain shut for a moment, then flutter open.

CLAIRE'S POV

A New York apartment, the glimmering skyline visible through
a large window.  Cooper gazes up attentively.

Claire sips a glass of wine, her face unsmiling, but serene.

                                                    FADE OUT.

                           THE END
