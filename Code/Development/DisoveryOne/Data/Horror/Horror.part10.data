                                                         SHOOTING DRAFT

                

               FADE IN:

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

               A quiet upper-middle class neighborhood. The CAMERA is at 
               the curb, looking down the street. There are no sidewalks. 
               Trees arch overhead. CICADAS drone on the soundtrack.

               The OPENING TITLES briefly FADE IN and OUT, framed by the 
               trees on either side of the street. Footsteps are heard 
               approaching.

               As the picture TITLE FADES, out of the dark emerges a GIRL 
               17 years old, carrying schoolbooks. This is JILL. CAMERA 
               PANS with her ninety degrees as she comes to the front of a 
               house and stops.

               Lights are on in the bottom half of the house, and the 
               curtains across the windows are open. A single light burns 
               in the upper right side of the house, presumable in a bedroom, 
               but the curtains in the room are drawn.

               A scene TITLE appears on the lower half of the screen:

                               8 pm Tuesday, March 23, 1971

               The TITLE FADES, and Jill heads up the walk to the front 
               door of the house.

               The light in the upper floor of the house is turned off.

               INT. HOUSE - FRONT HALL

               A middle-aged DOCTOR is standing at the foot of the stairs. 
               His WIFE is descending the stairs, putting on her earrings. 
               She is in an obvious hurry.

                                     WIFE
                         Where's the girl?

                                     DOCTOR
                         I only called her ten minutes ago --

                                     WIFE
                              (passing into living 
                              room)
                         I made our reservation for 8:15. 
                         We're going to be late.

               The doorbell rings.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Here she is now.

               He crosses to the front door and opens it. The girl smiles 
               at him uncomfortably from outside.

                                     JILL
                         Dr. Minakis?

                                     DOCTOR
                         Mandrakis. It's okay. Everyone gets 
                         it wrong the first time. You're Jill? 
                         Come on in.

                                     JILL
                              (entering)
                         Thank you.

               The wife comes back into the front hall.

                                     WIFE
                         I've written the number of the 
                         restaurant on the notepad by the 
                         phone.
                              (to Doctor)
                         Zip me up, will you please?
                              (to Jill)
                         If we aren't home in two hours, it 
                         means we've decided to go on to a 
                         movie and won't be back until after 
                         midnight. Is that all right?

                                     JILL
                         Sure.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (helping wife on with 
                              her coat)
                         I've told my service to pick up any 
                         calls coming in to my office phone.

                                     WIFE
                         The children are asleep upstairs -- 
                         first door on your left at the top 
                         of the landing. They're both just 
                         getting over a cold -- so try not to 
                         wake them.

                                     JILL
                         Okay.

                                     WIFE
                         Do you have any questions?

               Jill shakes her head.

                                     WIFE
                         We have to go now. We're late.

               They cross to the front door and begin to exit.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Make yourself at home. The 
                         refrigerator's loaded.

                                     WIFE
                              (pulling doctor through 
                              the door)
                         Goodbye.

               The doctor pokes his head back through the door.

                                     DOCTOR
                         We even have some low-fat yogurt.

                                     WIFE (O.S.)
                         Will you please come on!

                                     DOCTOR
                         Bye.

               The doctor pulls the door shut behind him. Jill turns toward 
               the living room. Pause. She walks into the living room and 
               sets her books down on a table with the telephone on it.

               O.S. we hear the car doors close, the engine start up, then 
               the car backing out the driveway and heading down the street.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

               It is dark. O.S. we hear the phone in the living room being 
               lifted off its receiver, a dial tone, then a number is dialed. 
               Pause, then ringing. CAMERA SLOWLY DOLLIES from the dining 
               room, across the front hall and into the living room where 
               we see Jill talking over the phone to a girlfriend, NANCY.

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         Hello?

                                     JILL
                         Nancy?

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         Hello, Jill? How's it going?
                              (out of phone)
                         I got it, Dad!
                              (beat)
                         Father!
                              (into phone again)
                         Jesus Christ! My father's in one of 
                         his moods again. Male menopause, you 
                         know. So how are you?

                                     JILL
                         All right.

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         Are you over at Dr. Mandrakis'?

                                     JILL
                         Yeah, I've been here for about an 
                         hour already.

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         Isn't it a neat house?

                                     JILL
                         I guess... I haven't looked around 
                         very much.

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         Did you see his kids?

                                     JILL
                         No, they were asleep when I got here.

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         They're really cute. So what can I 
                         do for you?

                                     JILL
                         You didn't happen to talk to Billy 
                         today, did you?

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         Yeah, I talked to him.

                                     JILL
                         Did he say anything about me?

               Pause.

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         I don't know what you did to him, or 
                         said to him, or what... but he's 
                         really pissed off at you! What did 
                         you do?

                                     JILL
                         It's what I didn't do.

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                              (sarcastic)
                         Yeah, I can imagine.

                                     JILL
                         Do me a favor, Nance.

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         What.

                                     JILL
                         Do you think you'll be talking with 
                         Billy some time tonight?

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         Prabably. I'm going to the library 
                         in a few minutes. I just have to get 
                         out of this house!
                              (beat)
                         Hey! Why don't Billy and I come over 
                         there? He'll come along if I tell 
                         him to.

                                     JILL
                         That isn't what I had in mind.

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         You'll be safe with Billy. I'll be 
                         there. Come on.

                                     JILL
                         Nancy, all you want to do is come 
                         over here and get drunk.

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         Who? Me?

                                     JILL
                              (mimicking)
                         Who? Me?

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         You want to see Billy, don't you?!

                                     JILL
                         I've got a lot of work to do. I don't 
                         want you coming over!

               Long pause.

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         You know what your problem is, Jill, 
                         is you're so straight. I really mean 
                         that. You go to a private school, 
                         you wear a bra. No one can have a 
                         good time with you!
                              (beat)
                         You know, Billy asked me to go out 
                         with him this weekend, and I was 
                         really really tempted because I like 
                         Billy... a lot... as much as you do. 
                         But I told him I couldn't, that I 
                         didn't think it was right because 
                         you were my friend --

                                     JILL
                         You are my friend.

               Pause.

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         Yeah. I guess so.

                                     JILL
                         Listen, just give Billy the number 
                         here, but don't tell him I told you 
                         to. Okay?

               Pause.

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         Okay. I've got to go now.

                                     JILL
                         Okay, Nancy. Bye. And thank you.

                                     NANCY (O.S.)
                         Yeah. Bye.

               Jill makes a face at the phone and hangs up. She tries to go 
               back to her homework, but she cannot.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

               Jill is working now, diligently. The phone rings. She picks 
               it up.

                                     JILL
                         Hello?

               There is a brief pause; then the line goes dead and a dial 
               tone cuts in. Jill hangs up and goes back to work.

               Pause.

               The phone rings again. Jill picks it up.

                                     JILL
                         Billy?...

               A VOICE speaks on the other end of the phone.

                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)
                         Have you checked the children?

                                     JILL
                         What?

               The line goes dead. Dial tone. Jill hangs up and goes right 
               back to work.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

               Jill sits at the table as before, doing her homework, smoking 
               a cigarette. The phone rings. Jill picks it up.

                                     JILL
                         Hello?

                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)
                         Have you checked the children?

                                     JILL
                         Mrs. Mandrakis?

               The line goes dead. Dial tone. Jill hangs up and looks off 
               into space, thinking.

               O.S. we hear a faint rattling noise from somewhere in the 
               house. Jill hears it too. She stubs out her cigarette, gets 
               up from the table and walks out of the living room.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Jill enters the hallway and pauses. Then she starts walking 
               slowly down the hall to the kitchen door.

               Again the rattling noise O.S., only louder this time. Jill 
               stops dead, listens, then continues forward even more 
               cautiously.

               INT. KITCHEN

               As Jill enters. She cannot find the lightswitch, so she stands 
               in the darkness listening. Again the rattle, very close now. 
               Jill turns her head sharply, then walks to the refrigerator 
               and opens it. It is only the automatic icemaker creating the 
               rattle.

               Jill takes a piece of cake from the refrigerator and leaves 
               the kitchen.

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               Jill is sitting at the table, polishing off the cake. Then, 
               the phone rings. Jill stands up quickly and picks up the 
               phone.

                                     JILL
                         Hello!

               Pause.

                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)
                         Have you checked the children?

                                     JILL
                         Billy! I don't think this is very 
                         funny!

               Pause. "Billy" doesn't answer.

                                     JILL
                         ...Who is this?

               The line goes dead. Jill stands frozen beside the table with 
               the phone in her hand as the dial tone gets louder and louder.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

               Jill is standing at the wet bar in the corner, pouring herself 
               a drink. She samples the alcohol, doesn't cough, and starts 
               to pour a little more into the glass.

               The phone rings. Jill turns, then slowly walks to the table, 
               kneels down and quietly picks up the phone and brings it to 
               her ear. She waits and listens, a full three seconds. No 
               sound comes to her.

               She quickly hangs up the phone before the silence can be 
               broken by the voice she knows is waiting on the other end. 
               Then, she shuffles through her books and papers on the table-
               top until she finds the notepad the doctor's wife has left 
               for her with the name and phone number of the restaurant.

               Jill picks up the phone and dials. After several rings...

                                     MAITRE D' (O.S.)
                         Golden Bull...

                                     JILL
                         Hello, I'd like to speak to Dr. 
                         Mandrakis. This is his babysitter.

                                     MAITRE D' (O.S.)
                         Hold on a minute.

               Jill waits for several seconds until the Maitre D' comes 
               back on the line.

                                     MAITRE D' (O.S.)
                         Hello?

                                     JILL
                         Yes?

                                     MAITRE D' (O.S.)
                         Dr. Mandrakis left the restaurant 
                         about forty minutes ago.

                                     JILL
                         Forty minutes?

                                     MAITRE D' (O.S.)
                         That's right.

                                     JILL
                              (after a beat)
                         Okay. Thank you.

               She hangs up, thinks for a moment, then picks up the phone 
               again and dials "O"...

                                     OPERATOR (O.S.)
                         Operator...

                                     JILL
                         Hello, Operator? Can you get me the 
                         police?

                                     OPERATOR (O.S.)
                         Is this an emergency?

                                     JILL
                         Yes!
                              (beat)
                         No, not really.

                                     OPERATOR (O.S.)
                         The number is 555-9431. Would you 
                         like me to connect you?

                                     JILL
                         Please.

               Pause.

                                     MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker.

                                     JILL
                         Hello, I've been getting phone calls, 
                         every fifteen minutes or so. I think 
                         it's a man. He's trying to scare me.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         An anonymous caller?

                                     JILL
                         That's right.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Has he threatened you?

                                     JILL
                         No.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Has he been using obscene language?

                                     JILL
                         No. He just keeps calling me. 
                         Sometimes he doesn't say anything.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         There's really nothing we can do 
                         about it down here. Is the phone 
                         listed in your name?

                                     JILL
                         No, I'm just the babysitter.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         It's probably just some weirdo. The 
                         city's full of them. Believe it or 
                         not, we get reports like this every 
                         night. It's nothing to worry about.

                                     JILL
                         Oh...

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Have you tried whistling?

                                     JILL
                         What?

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         If you can find a good loud whistle 
                         somewhere in the house, blow it into 
                         the phone hard, next time he calls. 
                         Probably break his eardrum. He won't 
                         bother you after that.

                                     JILL
                         No, I... You're probably right. It's 
                         nothing to worry about.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Or you could just take your phone 
                         off the hook.

                                     JILL
                         No, the people I'm babysitting for 
                         might try to reach me.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Well, as I say, there's nothing we 
                         can really do to help you down here.

                                     JILL
                         Okay. Thank you.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         You bet. Goodnight.

                                     JILL
                         Goodnight.

               Jill hangs up. After thinking for a moment, she tries a couple 
               of ways of whistling as loud as she can, but frustrated and 
               feeling foolish, she soon gives up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

               Jill is sitting in an armchair facing the TV set. The TV is 
               on, but she is bored. She runs through several channels, 
               then gets up and turns the TV off.

               She looks around and moves aimlessly back to the table, but 
               O.S. a dog is barking and she is drawn to the window. A car 
               passes outside, its lights reflecting off the window and 
               Jill's face.

               Then the phone rings. Jill moves quickly from the window to 
               the table and answers the phone.

                                     JILL
                         Hello?

               Pause.

                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)
                         Why haven't you checked the children?

               Stunned, Jill hangs up the phone. She turns and goes slowly 
               back to the window. She pulls the shutters closed in front 
               of the window. Then she walks out of the living room.

               INT. FRONT HALL

               Jill goes to the front door, turns the bolt and draws the 
               chain across the door. Then she starts to go upstairs.

               The phone rings. She stops halfway up the stairs. She turns 
               and comes back down the stairs to answer the phone, but then 
               thinks better of it. She sits on the bottom step and lets 
               the phone ring and ring...

               Finally, it stops. Jill gets up and heads into the living 
               room.

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               Jill goes to the table, picks up the phone and dials...

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker.

                                     JILL
                         I called you before... about the man 
                         who keeps calling me?

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Oh, yeah.

                                     JILL
                         He called me again.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Did you try whistling?

                                     JILL
                         No, he's out there somewhere.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Out where?

                                     JILL
                         In the neighborhood. He's been 
                         watching me... through the windows.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Did you see him?

                                     JILL
                         No. I know he's there.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Is the house locked up?

                                     JILL
                         Yes.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         And the windows?

                                     JILL
                         Yes. Everything.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Then you're safe. If he wanted to 
                         break in, he wouldn't be calling 
                         you.

               Pause.

                                     JILL
                         Please, can't you help me? I'm all 
                         alone.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Tell you what. If this guy calls you 
                         again --

                                     JILL
                         He will call again! I know he will!

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Okay, calm down now. I can alert the 
                         phone company so that if he calls 
                         again we can try to trace the call. 
                         What's your number there?

                                     JILL
                         555-0672.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         And the address?

                                     JILL
                         3317 Oakridge Drive.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Oh, yeah, I know where that is. All 
                         right. If the guy calls again, try 
                         to keep him on the line for at least 
                         a minute so we can trace the call.

                                     JILL
                         But he never stays on that long! 
                         Sometimes he hangs up after just a 
                         couple of seconds.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         It's the only way we can help you.
                              (beat)
                         By the way, what's your name?

                                     JILL
                         Jill Johnson.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Jill, the important thing is to relax. 
                         You're safe where you are. We've got 
                         patrolmen cruising the area all night 
                         long. Just stay calm. Will you do 
                         that for me?

                                     JILL
                         Yes.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         In the meantime, we'll be watching 
                         your line. Okay, Jill?

                                     JILL
                         Okay.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Call again if there's any problem.

                                     JILL
                         Thank you.

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Goodnight.

               Jill hangs up the phone and looks forlornly off into space.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

               Jill is sitting on the sofa, a drink in one hand, a cigarette 
               in the other. She is waiting. She sets her glass down, stubs 
               out the cigarette, leans back and sighs. She is very tense.

               Then the phone rings. She rises from the sofa and slowly 
               crosses to the table. She sits down and picks up the phone. 
               During this conversation it becomes apparent that the VOICE 
               has a slight English accent.

                                     JILL
                         Hello?

               Pause.

                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)
                         It's me.

                                     JILL
                         I know. Who are you?

               Pause. No answer.

                                     JILL
                         I won't be here much longer. The 
                         doctor and his wife are coming home 
                         soon.

                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)
                         I know.

                                     JILL
                         Can you see me?

                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)
                         Yes.

                                     JILL
                              (turning toward the 
                              window)
                         I'm sorry I turned the lights down. 
                         It didn't work anyway. I can turn 
                         them back up if you like --

                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)
                         Don't.

                                     JILL
                         Don't?
                              (beat)
                         You've really scared me. Is that 
                         what you wanted?
                              (beat)
                         Is that what you wanted?

                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)
                         No.

                                     JILL
                         What do you want?

                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)
                         Your blood... all over me.

               Pause. Jill is terrified.

                                     JILL
                         You don't know me. You don't know 
                         who I am or where I live. I'll get 
                         Dr. Mandrakis to drive me home. Him 
                         or the police.

                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)
                         You've called the police?

               Pause. Jill searches for some way of answering him.

                                     JILL
                         I want to talk to you.

               The line goes dead. Jill hangs up. She stands. She starts to 
               shake.

               The phone rings and Jill snatches it up.

                                     JILL
                         Leave me alone!

                                     SACKER (O.S.)
                         Jill, this is Sergeant Sacker! Listen 
                         to me!
                              (beat)
                         We've traced the call. It's coming 
                         from within the house. A squad car's 
                         on its way over there now... just 
                         get out of that house!

               Jill hangs up. She stands frozen in shock. Several seconds 
               go by. She doesn't move.

               Then the phone rings. She turns and tiptoes toward the front 
               door. Halfway there, the phone stops ringing. She pauses for 
               a second, then continues.

               INT. FRONT HALL

               Jill reaches the front door. Carefully, quietly, she turns 
               the bolt. Then O.S. she hears a creak. She turns and looks 
               up the staircase. At the top, a door is opening. Someone is 
               coming out! A mumbling sound is heard on the sound track.

               Jill whirls around back to the door and yanks at it. It opens, 
               but only an inch. The chain is still across it! She 
               frantically works to get the chain free. After agonizing 
               seconds, the chain falls clear and the door swings open.

               Standing there on the other side of the door, is a police 
               Detective, JOHN CLIFFORD. (We have cut ahead in time some 
               twenty or thirty minutes.) Behind him on the street, several 
               patrol cars and an ambulance are pulled up at the curb, their 
               domelights silently flashing.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Are the parents here yet?

                                     COP'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Yeah, they arrived about ten minutes 
                         ago.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Christ!
                              (beat)
                         What a homecoming!

                                     COP'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         They wanted to talk to someone. I 
                         asked them to wait until you got 
                         here. Come on in.

               Clifford sighs and steps into the front hall. The door is 
               closed by the uniformed COP with whom Clifford has been 
               speaking. The cop is a man in his thirties. His name is 
               CHARLES GARBER. Garber and Clifford stand in the front hall 
               and talk as POLICEMEN and AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS move around 
               them. In the living room beyond can be seen several other 
               POLICEMEN, Dr. Mandrakis and his wife.

                                     GARBER
                         We were only a block away when the 
                         call went out. When we got here, the 
                         guy was still waiting upstairs in 
                         the children's bedroom. He was covered 
                         with blood.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Blood?

                                     GARBER
                         Not his own. The children had been 
                         dead for several hours.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Jesus...

                                     GARBER
                         He'd been using an old phone in their 
                         bedroom that the parents had never 
                         had disconnected.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Who is he?

                                     GARBER
                         We found a Merchant Seaman's card on 
                         him. He's English. Entered the country 
                         less than a week ago.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         How about the babysitter?

                                     GARBER
                         She's going to be all right.

               As Garber delivers his final line, we see ambulance attendants 
               dressed in white, taking a sheet-covered stretcher out the 
               front door.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               EXT. STREET - LATER AFTERNOON

               An upper-class neighborhood. The CAMERA is facing down the 
               street. A car approaches the intersection at the end of the 
               block, turns and comes slowly up the street.

               Because it is not a new car or an expensive car, and because 
               it is moving at a rate which suggests that its sole male 
               occupant is looking for house numbers, we can assume that 
               the DRIVER is a visitor to this neighborhood.

               The CAMERA PANS with the car ninety degrees as it turns into 
               the semi-circular driveway of a mansion and rolls up to the 
               front door.

               A TITLE appears across the bottom of the screen:

                             4:30 pm Thursday, April 20, 1978

               As the TITLE FADES, the driver shuts off the car engine and 
               opens the door to get out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MANSION - DAY

               The doorbell rings. A HOUSEBOY comes into the front hall, 
               goes to the door and opens it for the visitor. It is John 
               Clifford, the detective from six years ago.

               He has aged noticeably over the years. His hair is grayer, 
               his stance not so aggressive, but his eyes still smoulder 
               with the accumulated frustration of having spent years in an 
               uncertain, sometimes unsatisfying, and frequently unsafe 
               occupation.

               No words are exchanged as the houseboy leads Clifford across 
               the entrance hall and up an imposing flight of stairs. Still 
               keen in his observation of things, Clifford quickly takes in 
               this new atmosphere.

               The house is richly decorated but with an underlying theme 
               of melancholy. There are no bright or cheerful furnishings, 
               and the houseboy advances with guarded tread, his face steady 
               and reverent.

               The houseboy stops before a door at the top of the staircase 
               and raps lightly on it with his knuckles. Without waiting 
               for an answer, he opens the door and steps aside for Clifford 
               to enter.

               Clifford pauses briefly, then walks into what appears to be 
               an upstairs study.

               INT. STUDY - DAY

               A MAN is sitting behind a desk which faces the door. 
               Presumably he is the master of the house. Although his face 
               is hidden in shadows, we can see from his hands that he is 
               engaged in writing something down.

               Clifford quietly approaches the desk and takes a seat in 
               front of it. Then, vaguely in keeping with the spirit of the 
               house, he waits to be spoken to rather than interrupt the 
               pervasive stillness.

               After a moment, the master of the house lays down his pen 
               and leans back in his chair. Pause.

                                     MASTER
                         So you're in business for yourself 
                         now.

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (quietly)
                         Yes, sir, for the past three and a 
                         half years.

                                     MASTER
                         That's good.
                              (beat)
                         And you'd heard about Curt Duncan's 
                         escape?

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Oh, yes.

                                     MASTER
                         Do you think the police will... find 
                         him?

               Pause.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I know they haven't assigned anyone 
                         to it specifically. It's an old case.

                                     MASTER
                              (a tinge of bitterness)
                         An old case.
                              (beat)
                         Can you find him?

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Yes. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not 
                         this week, but I'll find him.

                                     MASTER
                         He could be anywhere by now.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I don't think so... because he's a 
                         foreigner. He'll come back to the 
                         city. After six years in confinement, 
                         it's the only place that's familiar 
                         to him. That's important.

               Pause.

                                     MASTER
                         A man murders two children in cold 
                         blood. A jury declares him insane. 
                         How could such a person not be?

               Clifford lowers his eyes, doesn't answer.

                                     MASTER
                         He is sent to a state mental 
                         institution where the security is... 
                         less than perfect. And he escapes. 
                         It... it isn't fair.

               The master of the house leans way forward over his desk, and 
               his face comes out of the shadows and into the light. It is 
               Dr. Mandrakis.

               He seems much older. His complexion is pallid. His eyes stare 
               out from beneath his brow like a wounded animal hiding in a 
               dark cave.

                                     MANDRAKIS
                         A thing like that should never be 
                         allowed to happen again.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I couldn't agree with you more.

               They look at each other for a long moment of acknowledgment. 
               Then Mandrakis stands up with a sigh.

                                     MANDRAKIS
                         Go ahead then. My accountant will 
                         contact you.

               Clifford stands and they shake hands.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Thank you.
                              (beat)
                         How is Mrs. Mandrakis?

                                     MANDRAKIS
                         She is... unable to have any more 
                         children.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I'm sorry. Please give her my best.

                                     MANDRAKIS
                         Of course.

               Clifford turns to go.

               INT. MANSION - STAIRCASE & ENTRANCE HALL

               As Clifford finds his own way down the stairs and out the 
               front door.

               A WOMAN watches Clifford leave from the back of the staircase. 
               It is Mrs. Mandrakis. As with her husband, the change in her 
               is remarkable. She is now a brooding, barren woman.

               O.S. the front door closes. Clifford is gone. Mrs. Mandrakis 
               walks around the front of the stairs and begins slowly 
               ascending them.

               The houseboy silently steps into the entrance hall from a 
               side door and watches her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A HALLWAY - MENTAL INSTITUTION - DAY

               A male PATIENT wearing green, institutional pajamas and 
               slippers shuffles slowly up the hall. His movement is 
               catatonic, unfocused.

               Canned Musak faintly underscores the scene.

                                     MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Curt Duncan isn't going to run right 
                         out and kill more children. I'm not 
                         worried about that.

               ANGLE ON CLIFFORD

               Standing in the doorway of an office, facing into the hall, 
               watching the patient.

                                     MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         We had him for six years... under 
                         continuous therapy, some of it rather 
                         forceful...

               ANGLE ON PATIENT

               Moving past CAMERA. He is really out of it. It is a 
               depressing, vaguely unnerving sight.

                                     MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         ...and drugs... tranquilizers 
                         depressants, lithium...

               ANGLE ON CLIFFORD

               He turns and goes back into the office.

               INT. OFFICE - DAY

               We see now the MAN who's been talking -- the director of the 
               State Hospital, DR. MONK. He is sitting comfortably behind 
               his desk; his jacket off, his tie loosened, his feet up on 
               the desk. He is very matter-of-fact.

                                     DR. MONK
                         Eventually, anyone will respond to 
                         the treatment here.

               Clifford sits down in front of the desk, picks up a folder 
               and leafs through it.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         You gave him electric shock?

                                     DR. MONK
                         Yeah, we zapped him a few times. 
                         It's fairly standard.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         It says here thirty-eight... thirty-
                         eight times.

               Monk shrugs, then yawns expansively. He needn't justify 
               himself to the layman.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         What will happen to him now, without 
                         the drugs he was on?

               DR. MONK'S SECRETARY enters the office and hands him a folder. 
               Without interrupting the delivery of his lines, Monk takes 
               the folder, opens it, initials something on the inside, closes 
               the folder and hands it back to the secretary who turns and 
               leaves the office without uttering a word.

                                     DR. MONK
                         There'll be some deterioration. That's 
                         inevitable, but we can't say how 
                         much.

               Pause. Clifford looks at the doctor as if questioning his 
               casual assessment of "some deterioration."

                                     CLIFFORD
                         During the time that you had him 
                         here, did you discover any particular 
                         habits of his, peculiarities, quirks, 
                         anything that might help me find 
                         him?

                                     DR. MONK
                              (shrugging again)
                         It's all in the folder.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Any letters from people back in 
                         England? Family?

                                     DR. MONK
                         That, too, is in the folder.

               Clifford directs a bleak look back down at the open folder, 
               then looks up again, his eyes narrowing.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Let's get something straight here, 
                         Doctor. I've been 33 years in the 
                         business of tracking people down and 
                         putting them away. I spent almost a 
                         year on Curt Duncan alone, with the 
                         trial, the testimonies, the background 
                         investigations. I didn't come here 
                         today to look in your goddamn folders. 
                         In fact, I wouldn't have come here 
                         at all if you'd done your job right.

               Pause.

                                     DR. MONK
                         Mr. Clifford, this is a hospital, 
                         not a penitentiary. Everything that 
                         pertains to one of our patients is 
                         meticulously recorded in that 
                         patient's folder... whether you can 
                         make sense of it or not.

               They glare at each other for several seconds. Monk is the 
               first one to look away.

                                     DR. MONK
                         Curt Duncan is a classic paranoid-
                         schizophrenic. They see themselves 
                         as victims, and they always blame 
                         other people for the way they are. 
                         When Duncan killed the Mandrakis 
                         kids, it wasn't an act of hostility 
                         against the children but against 
                         their parents. He was getting back 
                         at his own parents for traumas he 
                         suffered in early childhood. The 
                         criminal side of Curt Duncan is one 
                         of terrible, symbolic vengeance.

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (looking up)
                         Assuming he isn't found right away... 
                         what will happen to him?

               Monk rises and walks to a window.

                                     DR. MONK
                         I think you'll find him. Somebody 
                         will find him. He can't function out 
                         there. He'll make a mistake.
                              (turning to face 
                              Clifford)
                         This is where he belongs. After six 
                         years in here, he's suddenly gone 
                         out to confront the world again. I 
                         think he's in for a bit of a shock.

               Monk looks back out the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

               Not a terribly good section of town. We are looking at the 
               nondescript exterior of a bar across the street.

               INT. BAR

               This is not a slum bar, but it's close. There are a few tables 
               and chairs and a pool table in the back. The atmosphere is 
               quiet, almost depressed, and the handful of REGULARS here 
               are exercising their privacy without having to be alone.

               They include: HANK, the bartender, also the owner, who 
               absently polishes things with his cloth; TRACY, an unemployed 
               woman in her mid-forties who sits at the bar with a drink 
               and a cigarette and silently rummages through her current 
               feelings -- none of them new or particularly hopeful; a 
               COUPLE, probably retired, sitting at the same table they 
               come to every afternoon at this time -- him for his beer, 
               her for a glass of sweet white wine; and BILL, at the pool 
               table, a young man lithe and powerful, minding his own 
               business and playing his game of pool with a steady, 
               aggressive concentration.

                                     RETIRED MAN
                         Rackin' 'em up today, Bill?

               Pause.

                                     BILL
                              (over his shoulder)
                         Doin' all right.

               The old man smiles stupidly around the room. He racked 'em 
               up a little in his day, too. His smile fades as he looks at 
               his wife. He takes a sip of beer and lapses into memories.

               Then the door opens to the outside and the yellow-orange 
               light of late afternoon floods into the bar. The regulars 
               turn to glimpse who's coming in. They see the figure of a 
               MAN silhouetted in the doorway. He stands there for a long 
               moment, not coming in. Finally even Bill interrupts his game 
               to turn and look.

                                     HANK
                         C'mon in and shut the door.

               The intruder enters, indecisively. The door swings shut behind 
               him, plunging the room back into darkness. This man is "a 
               little weird", and the regulars continue to stare at him 
               until he makes his way to a table near the wall and sits 
               down. Then everyone returns to his own thoughts.

                                     HANK
                              (after a moment)
                         What'll it be?
                              (pause, no answer)
                         Hey! What'll it be?

               CLOSEUP - INTRUDER

               A bit startled, a bit defensive toward the directness of 
               this question. It is Curt Duncan. He looks understandably 
               harried. He hasn't slept or shaved in at least a couple of 
               days, and is wearing regular clothing.

               He clears his throat to answer...

                                     CLIFFORD (O.S.)
                         What kind of clothes was he wearing... 
                         when he escaped?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. MONK'S OFFICE -DAY

               Clifford is looking through the folder again.

                                     DR. MONK
                         Ordinary street clothes. Not all of 
                         our patients have to wear the green 
                         Gucci gowns.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Did he have any money with him?

                                     DR. MONK
                         Probably. But not more than, say, 
                         fifty dollars. Some of the patients 
                         are given little jobs around the 
                         ward, for which they are paid. It's 
                         part of the rehabilitation.

               Looking down, Clifford pauses over a page in the folder.

               CLOSEUP - FACT SHEET IN FOLDER

               A page of legibly organized facts and statistics about Curt 
               Duncan. One of the entries reads: Guy du Marraux.

                                     CLIFFORD (O.S.)
                              (reading)
                         What's Guy du Mar--

                                     DR. MONK (O.S.)
                              (pronouncing it 
                              correctly)
                         Guy du Marraux syndrom.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     DR. MONK
                         It's a psycho-motor dysfunction.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Duncan had it?

                                     DR. MONK
                         Only from time to time, which is 
                         unusual.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         What is it?

                                     DR. MONK
                         It attacks the nervous system. People 
                         suffering from it are irresistibly 
                         compelled to utter obscenities, 
                         sometimes one, sometimes a whole 
                         string of them. They can't control 
                         it.

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (somewhat taken aback)
                         Are you being serious?

                                     DR. MONK
                         Yeah. Here, I'll give you an example.

               He opens a file cabinet drawer, finds a reel of quarter-inch 
               magnetic tape and starts to thread it through a recorder on 
               his desk.

                                     DR. MONK
                         Duncan never had the twitch that 
                         sometimes goes with it. And with 
                         Duncan, as I said, the disease would 
                         only manifest itself in periods of 
                         extreme anxiety. When he was really 
                         flipping out, in other words.

               There is a pause as Monk fiddles with the tape recorder and 
               Clifford looks back down at the folder.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Duncan was Catholic?

                                     DR. MONK
                         Yeah.
                              (beat)
                         So am I.

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (mildly surprised)
                         That makes three of us.

                                     DR. MONK
                         Is that right? So we all share the 
                         same guilt.

               Clifford smiles. Monk keeps fiddling.

                                     DR. MONK
                         Here. This is Curt Duncan shortly 
                         after he was admitted here in 1972.

               Monk turns on the tape recorder as Clifford sits forward in 
               his chair to listen.

               At first, nothing can be heard. Then there is a click as if 
               the machine was turned on in the middle of a conversation:

                                     DR. MONK (O.S.)
                         -- to put the situation right. The 
                         hypodermic needles are only used to 
                         give you medication that will calm 
                         you down. They make you feel good, 
                         relaxed. All right?
                              (no answer)
                         We're not putting anything in your 
                         food either. The food is just food.

                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)
                              (extremely agitated)
                         No. I don't eat the food. It doesn't 
                         taste right.

                                     DR. MONK
                              (to Clifford)
                         That's Duncan.

               Clifford nods and keeps listening:

                                     DR. MONK (O.S.)
                         Curt, why are you fidgeting? Can't 
                         you get comfortable?

                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)
                         No, I'm not comfortable!

                                     DR. MONK (O.S.)
                         Wait a -- Hey!
                              (to someone else)
                         Hold him down there. Grab him! Never 
                         mind the chair!

               There are scuffling noises underneath which can be heard, 
               heavy breathing and then, getting louder and more furious, 
               Duncan falling into the throes of Guy du Marraux.

                                     DR. MONK (O.S.)
                              (periodically 
                              interjecting)
                         Pull him down... That's right... 
                         Just lay him out... Lay him right 
                         out... Steady... Pull out his knees...

               Finally Monk is heard no more and Duncan continues with the 
               frightening verbal torrent of Guy du Marraux.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BAR - LATE AFTERNOON - CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

               Sitting at his table inside the bar. He takes a long, noisy 
               drink from what looks like a bourbon on the rocks. It tastes 
               good, being the first real drink he's had in over six years. 
               But Duncan cannot relax enough to enjoy it fully. His eyes 
               are ever restlessly, suspiciously moving about.

               ANGLE ON BAR

               As Bill walks up and stands next to Tracy. Hank moves off to 
               get Bill another beer.

               Tracy looks up at Bill and smiles. As regulars at the same 
               bar, they are loose and comfortable with each other.

                                     TRACY
                              (sotto voce)
                         A little action for your game?

                                     BILL
                              (sotto voce)
                         What, him?

               They both turn and look across the room at Duncan.

               POV - DUNCAN

               As Bill and Tracy look straight at him over their shoulders 
               and then turn back.

               ANGLE ON BAR

               As they both smile at her joke.

                                     TRACY
                         I wouldn't bet against you.

                                     BILL
                         What's the matter? You don't like me 
                         playing with myself?

               Tracy grimaces as Hank comes back with Bill's beer. Bill 
               picks up the bottle, nods his thanks to Hank and heads back 
               to the pool table.

               CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

               As his eyes follow Bill to the pool table, then come back to 
               Tracy at the bar.

               POV - DUNCAN

               Looking at the back of Tracy. She reaches into her purse.

               ON TRACY

               She takes her pack of cigarettes from the purse. She pulls 
               out a cigarette, taps it lightly on the bar, puts it to her 
               lips.

               O.S. we hear the sound of a match being struck.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Duncan is standing beside her holding a lit match. He shoves 
               it forward at her. It goes out.

               Duncan fumbles for another match as Tracy regards him with 
               undisguised repulsion. Duncan gets the second match lit and 
               holds it out for her. She accepts the favor and lights her 
               cigarette.

               Duncan smiles. Tracy nods and turns away. Duncan is still 
               holding the burning match for her to blow out. As it doesn't 
               look like she's going to, he lets it drop, still lit, to the 
               floor.

               REACTION SHOT - BARTENDER

               He gives a look as if to say, "Jesus, what a fuckin' weirdo".

               TWO SHOT - DUNCAN AND TRACY

               Pause. Duncan is still smiling at her.

                                     DUNCAN
                         Hi.

               No response.

                                     DUNCAN
                         What you been up to?

                                     TRACY
                              (looking at him)
                         My own business.
                              (beat)
                         Thanks for the light. Okay?

               The Englishman sits down beside her, but doesn't look at 
               her.

               Tracy looks away too, determined to ignore him, not to let 
               him get into her space.

               Duncan coughs. After a long moment, he turns back to her.

                                     DUNCAN
                         Next round's on me.

               Tracy keeps her eyes straight ahead, acknowledging nothing.

               Pause.

               Duncan takes some money from his pocket and lays it on the 
               bar, staring at her. Tracy turns to him:

                                     TRACY
                              (annoyed)
                         Listen, mister, I've got my own money. 
                         So, if you don't mind...

               She looks away again. Pause.

                                     DUNCAN
                         After what I been through, I don't 
                         mind anything.

               Longer pause.

                                     DUNCAN
                         See, that's the whole point. My 
                         mind... Your mind... Where do they 
                         fit in? You know what I mean?

               Tracy abruptly picks up her purse and moves down the bar 
               away from him one seat, then another seat.

               ANGLE ON ELDERLY COUPLE

               They are watching this little spectacle with growing 
               curiosity.

               ANGLE ON DUNCAN

               Still looking at her. By pointing at what she has, he orders 
               two more drinks from the Bartender. When they arrive, he 
               takes a big swallow from one, picks up the other, stands, 
               moves down the bar and sits beside Tracy again.

                                     DUNCAN
                              (setting her drink 
                              before her)
                         Do you live around here?

                                     TRACY
                         Get offa me!!

               REACTION SHOTS

               Even Bill now looks up from the pool table. His expression 
               darkens.

               ANGLE ON BAR

               Tracy has clammed up -- her elbows on the bar, head between 
               her elbows, arms covering her ears, hands clasped behind her 
               neck. Duncan looks at her nervously and starts to talk again:

                                     DUNCAN
                              (rapidly)
                         Listen, I didn't mean nothin'. I 
                         don't live around here. See -- ?

                                     BILL (O.S.)
                         I think the lady wants to be left 
                         alone.

               Duncan looks up. Bill enters the frame and stands in front 
               of Tracy, confronting Duncan.

               CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

               Looking up at Bill, his eyes red, his gaze unsteady.

               WIDER ANGLE

               The air is charged with tension.

                                     BILL
                         I think an apology is in order.

               Duncan doesn't know how to handle this. He looks at Bill, 
               half shrugs, half smiles.

                                     BILL
                         That the best you can do?

               Duncan looks away. A long moment passes.

                                     BILL
                         I think you'd better just move along, 
                         pal.

               Duncan doesn't move, says nothing. He swallows hard.

                                     HANK
                         He'll be okay now, Bill. He just --

                                     BILL
                         No! I want him out of here!

               The bartender steps back, deciding to mind his own business. 
               Tracy gets up from her seat and cautiously moves even further 
               down the bar.

                                     BILL
                              (to Duncan)
                         Go on, beat it.

               They glare at each other. The longer Duncan sits there without 
               moving, without saying anything, the angrier Bill gets.

               REACTION SHOTS

               As the tension builds.

               ANGLE ON BAR

               Duncan looks away.

                                     BILL
                         I'm not going to say it again, mister.

               Duncan reaches for his drink, but Bill reacts quicker. With 
               a swipe of his hand, he knocks the glass off the bar, and it 
               shatters on the floor behind the bar.

               Duncan sits there, stunned, not looking up. After a long 
               moment, Duncan coughs. Then he turns and looks at Bill. He 
               purses his lips. It looks like a nervous facial movement. 
               Then suddenly, Duncan spits at Bill, hitting him square in 
               the face.

               Before anyone can register what's happened, Bill lunges at 
               Duncan, knocking him clean off the barstool and onto the 
               floor.

               The fight is fast, vicious and one-sided from the very start. 
               Pinned to the floor on his back, Duncan flails his arms 
               ineffectually like a panicked insect as Bill holds him in 
               place with a left-handed grip on the collar while his powerful 
               right arm, pumping up and down like a piston, pounds into 
               Duncan's face time and time again.

               Duncan's screams diminish into pathetic, sickening groans 
               and the others in the bar are compelled to avert their eyes 
               from this brutal spectacle.

               Hank has picked up a phone from beneath the bar and is dialing 
               a number. He turns away from the fight to talk.

               Then, as suddenly as Bill first sprang at Duncan, he leaps 
               to his feet and turns to the bar. He reaches over and grabs 
               the phone from Hank, slamming it down into the cradle.

                                     BILL
                         Who're you calling?

               Bill takes the cloth from the bar and vigorously wipes his 
               face off. He snaps his fingers and points to a row of bottles 
               on a shelf behind the bar. Hank quickly hands him a bottle. 
               Bill pours himself a shot and downs it, fast. He is still 
               charged with adrenaline and he takes two more shots in rapid 
               succession, spilling the alcohol on the bar and on himself.

               As Bill picks up the cloth to wipe himself off again, Tracy 
               stands up and quickly walks out of the bar, slamming the 
               door behind her.

                                     BILL
                              (calling after her)
                         You're welcome, baby!

               Then he throws down the cloth, picks up the bottle, turns 
               and, standing over Duncan's inert form, empties half the 
               bottle onto him. He sets the bottle back on the bar. He grabs 
               Duncan and, half dragging, hurries him out the back door and 
               throws him into the alley where Duncan falls in a heap.

               Bill storms back up to the bar and pours himself another 
               drink.

                                     BILL
                              (to Hank)
                         Okay?

               Hank just looks at him, doesn't answer. At the wife's silent 
               insistence, the elderly couple stand up to go.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Good riddance to bad rubbish, eh, 
                         Bill?

               Bill doesn't answer and the couple quietly leave.

                                     HANK
                              (apologetic)
                         A fight breaks out, there's gonna be 
                         damages. Insurance company doesn't 
                         pay without a police report...

                                     BILL
                         You see any damages?

               Hank lowers his gaze to the floor. Bill finishes his drink. 
               He is still very hopped up. He pulls a few dollars from his 
               wallet and drops them on the counter.

                                     BILL
                         See ya 'round.

               He turns and strides out of the bar.

               CAMERA HOLDS for a beat on Hank alone now in his empty 
               establishment. The phone starts to ring, presumably the police 
               calling back.

               After several rings, Hank picks up the phone and listens.

                                     HANK
                              (into phone)
                         No, it's over now...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LT. GARBER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               All the lights are out inside the house, but we should just 
               be able to see that we are in the hall, looking at the front 
               door. Footsteps approach on the walk outside. A key slips 
               into the lock...

               Inside the house we can hear faint whispering. Someone is 
               moving about in the darkness. Then the door swings open and 
               the shadowy figure of a MAN crosses the threshold. He stops 
               just inside.

                                     MAN
                              (calling out)
                         Donna. Donna! Hey!
                              (under his breath)
                         What the hell -- !

               Suddenly the lights come on and a chorus of voices cry out, 
               "SURPRISE!"

               A broad smile breaks across the man's face. We may recognize 
               him as the cop from six years ago -- Charles Garber. Today 
               he is a lieutenant on the force and dresses casually for 
               work, usually in slacks, turtleneck and jacket.

                                     GARBER
                              (genuinely surprised)
                         What is all this?!

                                     SCATTERED VOICES
                         Happy birthday, Charlie!

               Garber looks sheepishly at his hand holding the pistol he'd 
               drawn just before the lights came up.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Look at him!

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         Don't shoot us, Charlie!

                                     GARBER
                              (chagrined)
                         How was I supposed to know?

               Everybody starts to laugh, including Garber as he returns 
               the pistol to his shoulder holster.

               ANGLE ON DONNA

               Garber's wife. She comes out of the kitchen carrying a 
               birthday cake with lit candles and makes her way through the 
               crowd of GUESTS singing "Happy Birthday".

               Everyone joins in as Donna moves forward and stands beside 
               her husband. Clifford is one of the guests. He has his arm 
               around a young BLOND who is sort of pretty despite her 
               tacky/plastic appearance.

               When the song is over, Garber blows out the candles and hugs 
               and kisses his wife. Everybody cheers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GARBER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

               The party is still in full swing. Garber is following Clifford 
               up the stairs. They are both fairly loaded by now.

               Garber, in particular, has reached that stage of inebriation 
               where standing still is pretty hard to do.

                                     GARBER
                         Will you tell me what this is about, 
                         Cliff?

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Yeah, in a minute.

                                     GARBER
                         I don't think I can take any more of 
                         these surprises.

               INT. A BEDROOM

               As Clifford and Garber enter. Garber turns on a light as 
               Clifford closes the door, shutting out the sounds of the 
               party below.

                                     GARBER
                         Okay now, what's the big deal?

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Stand still. I want you to remember 
                         this in the morning.

                                     GARBER
                         If you want me to remember something 
                         in the morning, then tell it to me 
                         in the morning.

               Garber half comically turns to go. Clifford stops him.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Charlie, come on.

               ANGLE ON CORNER OF BEDROOM

               A BABY between a year and two years old is lying in a crib. 
               It opens its eyes and starts looking around.

                                     GARBER (O.S.)
                         All right, all right. What is it? 
                         You're getting married.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         No. I got a job today, tracking 
                         someone.

               TWO SHOT - CLIFFORD & GARBER

               Garber, still moving restlessly, pats his friend on the 
               shoulder.

                                     GARBER
                         That's great, Cliff; I'm sure you'll 
                         find your man.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         It's Curt Duncan.

               Garber stops suddenly, stunned. In an instant, he has become 
               stone sober.

                                     GARBER
                         What?

               ANGLE ON BABY

               Kicking and wiggling about.

                                     CLIFFORD (O.S.)
                         You didn't know he got out?

               The baby opens its mouth and starts to cry.

               TWO SHOT - CLIFFORD & GARBER

               Garber glances over his shoulder at the baby, then turns 
               back to Clifford.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I need your cooperation on this one.

                                     GARBER
                         Sure. Anything.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

               It is late. The block is virtually deserted. Across the street 
               is the exterior of a bar -- the same bar Duncan was in 
               earlier. Some PEOPLE are coming out of the bar. It must be 
               near closing time. The people turn left and walk away down 
               the sidewalk. Their voices diminish. Pause.

               A car passes. Then the door to the bar opens again and a 
               woman comes out onto the sidewalk. It is Tracy. She turns to 
               the right and starts to walk away.

               CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

               He is standing in shadows across the street, watching her.

               EXT. TRACY ON STREET - NIGHT

               A series of shots of Tracy walking home. The CAMERA remains 
               consistently behind her or off to one side, sometimes DOLLYING 
               with her behind a row of parked cars, sometimes picking up 
               her passing reflection in a darkened store window.

               The impression this gives is unmistakable. Curt Duncan is 
               following her. We do not see him, we do not hear him, yet we 
               know he is there. Often we can sense that the very angle 
               from which we see Tracy is his POV.

               But Tracy is aware of nothing. We know this when the CAMERA 
               begins to move in front of her, once more becoming an 
               impersonal observer of her walk homeward, to safety.

               Tension mounts as we start to expect that Duncan will jump 
               out at her from every alley and recessed doorway she passes. 
               But he doesn't.

               Finally, Tracy walks up to the CAMERA at the end of a block 
               and turns a corner; but the CAMERA HOLDS on the dark street 
               she has just come up. We hear a cough which confirms that 
               Duncan is lurking somewhere in the shadows.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Tracy walks up the steps and enters the apartment.

               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING

               Tracy steps into the elevator. The doors close. CAMERA HOLDS 
               on the elevator and watches the lights above it travel from 
               one to six.

               O.S. we hear the door to the apartment building open and 
               close.

               INT. SIXTH FLOOR

               Tracy steps out of the elevator and walks down the hall to 
               her door. She fumbles through her purse for keys, then bends 
               over the lock to let herself in.

               Behind her down the hall, Duncan appears. He watches her, 
               starts to move silently forward. Tracy gets the door open, 
               then turns and sees him. Duncan stops.

                                     TRACY
                         Oh, it's you!
                              (beat)
                         What do you want?

                                     DUNCAN
                              (moving forward)
                         ...Came to apologize. I...

                                     TRACY
                         Look, I'm the one who should be sorry. 
                         I didn't want that to happen.
                              (she sees his face; 
                              shudders)
                         Oh, God! Look at you. Are you all 
                         right.

               Duncan half shrugs, half smiles. Tracy edges into her door-
               way. Duncan stands opposite her.

                                     DUNCAN
                         I'm new in town. Don't know anybody...

                                     TRACY
                              (uncomfortable)
                         Where're you from?

                                     DUNCAN
                              (coughs)
                         New York. Ever been there?

                                     TRACY
                         Sure. Sure I've been there.

               They look at each other. Duncan coughs again.

                                     DUNCAN
                         Kind of a mean place to be. Everyone 
                         cold, unfriendly...

               Inside Tracy's apartment, the telephone rings. Tracy turns 
               vaguely, indecisively, and goes to answer it.

                                     TRACY
                              (over her shoulder)
                         Excuse me.

               She disappears into the apartment. O.S. she picks up the 
               ringing phone.

                                     TRACY (O.S.)
                         Hello?...

               INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT

               As she sits with the telephone.

                                     TRACY
                              (nervous)
                         ...No, I just got in... I don't know 
                         if I can... Listen, I can't talk 
                         now. Can I call you back?... Okay... 
                         Goodbye.

               She hangs up the phone, stands and turns back toward the 
               door. Duncan is standing right behind her.

                                     DUNCAN
                         I'm not from New York, actually. But 
                         I'm very, very far from home.

               He sits down.

                                     TRACY
                         Look, you can't come in here.

               Duncan looks at her for a moment, then looks about the 
               apartment.

                                     DUNCAN
                              (mumbling)
                         I thought we might get some coffee. 
                         Can I buy you -- ?

                                     TRACY
                         I don't think so.

                                     DUNCAN
                         Someplace nearby?

                                     TRACY
                         Not tonight. You'd better go.

                                     DUNCAN
                         I got no place to go.

                                     TRACY
                              (anxious)
                         You can't --

                                     DUNCAN
                         Just, just a little coffee?

                                     TRACY
                         Maybe tomorrow.

                                     DUNCAN
                         Okay, tomorrow. When?

                                     TRACY
                         I said maybe. I don't know.
                              (beat)
                         Listen, I'm sorry about this 
                         afternoon. I really am. All right? 
                         That was my boyfriend on the phone. 
                         He's coming over. So please leave. 
                         Now.

               Duncan doesn't move. He smiles at her.

                                     DUNCAN
                         I like you.

                                     TRACY
                              (her voice rising)
                         Look, do you want me to call the 
                         cops?

                                     DUNCAN
                              (standing)
                         It's okay. It's okay.

               He backs to the doorway and pauses.

                                     DUNCAN
                         I'll see you later... sometime. I 
                         still want to buy you that drink.

               He steps into the hall. Tracy closes the front door and bolts 
               it. She turns, leans against it and sighs.

               Outside the door, Duncan's footsteps move down the hall, 
               pause, then come back to the door. A moment passes. Then 
               there is a faint knocking on the door. Tracy doesn't move. 
               The knocking comes again, a little louder this time. Tracy 
               stands and waits, scarcely breathing. After another long 
               moment, the footsteps finally move away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

               A car pulls into the parking lot behind the station. Clifford 
               and Garber get out and walk into the building.

               INT. POLICE STATION

               Clifford and Garber walk down a hallway. Uniformed POLICEMEN 
               walk to and fro around them.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Jesus, I don't recognize anybody.

                                     GARBER
                         Three years is a long time in a place 
                         like this.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Three and a half.

               Garber stops at the WATCH COMMANDER'S desk and picks up some 
               paperwork. The WC looks up briefly and sees Clifford.

                                     WC
                         Hiya, Cliff. Howya doin'?

               The WC looks down again. Three and a half years mean nothing 
               to him.

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (taken aback)
                         Hi...

               He can't remember the man's name. Garber smiles at him and 
               they continue walking.

                                     GARBER
                         How long will you be here?

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Depends on how lucky I get.
                              (beat)
                         I'll only be coming around once, 
                         maybe twice a week.

                                     GARBER
                         You want to use your old desk? 
                         Someplace to sit down?

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (surprised)
                         Is it vacant?

               INT. OFFICE - POLICE STATION

               A. Clifford and Garber appear in the doorway. Clifford enters, 
               walks up to his old desk, opens some of the drawers -- they 
               are empty -- sits down in his old chair, smiles at Garber.

               B. We see Clifford opening a file cabinet and taking out a 
               folder stuffed with notices and reports --

               C. Clifford standing beside a Xerox machine running off a 
               copy of something --

               D. Clifford standing in a hallway talking to a PATROLMAN. 
               Clifford has a legal pad with him and is jotting something 
               down on it as the patrolman speaks --

               E. Clifford at his desk, making notes on the legal pad --

               F. Garber is at his desk, on the phone, Clifford appears in 
               the doorway carrying his legal pad. He waves goodbye to Garber 
               who nods in response.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOBBY OF A FLOPHOUSE HOTEL

               Clifford questions the DESK CLERK. He shows the clerk a photo 
               of Duncan taken some years ago in the mental institution. 
               The clerk shakes his head and starts to hand the picture 
               back when Clifford motions for him to keep it. As Clifford 
               leaves, the clerk turns the picture over...

               CLOSEUP - BACK OF PICTURE

               Revealing Clifford's name and phone numbers, and a twenty 
               dollar bill paperclipped to the back of the picture --

               EXT. STREET

               As Clifford pulls his car up to the curb, then consults his 
               legal pad --

               CLOSEUP - LEGAL PAD

               The top three addresses are crossed out. Clifford underlines 
               the fourth --

               BACK TO SCENE

               Clifford looks up from the pad to a bar he has pulled up in 
               front of -- the bar Duncan was in. It bears the address 
               Clifford has just underlined. Clifford gets out of his car 
               and walks up to the bar. A "Closed" sign is displayed in the 
               window. Clifford knocks on the door. After a moment, Hank 
               opens the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

               There are only a few CUSTOMERS sitting around, waiting for 
               their wash. A BUM is stretched out on his back across one of 
               the tables like a corpse awaiting autopsy. This is CHEATER.

               A MAINTENANCE MAN in grey work clothes enters from the back. 
               He opens a broom closet, takes out a bucket and mop and rolls 
               them toward the front of the laundromat. He stops at Cheater's 
               table and shakes him hard.

                                     MAINTENANCE MAN
                         Okay, man, move it out. Let's go.

                                     CHEATER
                         Wha -- ?

               Cheater sits up and starts to pull himself together. An OLD 
               WOMAN sitting against the wall points down one of the aisles 
               of washing machines and says to the maintenance man:

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         There's another one down there.

               The maintenance man goes to the end of the aisle and looks 
               down into the nook created by the absence of one of the 
               washing machines.

                                     MAINTENANCE MAN
                         Hey!

               He nudges at whatever's inside the nook with his foot.

                                     MAINTENANCE MAN
                              (nudging again)
                         Come on, bright eyes. Wake up. Wake -- 
                         Jesus Christ! What happened to you?

               ANGLE ON NOOK

               As Curt Duncan raises his head into the light and looks up 
               at the maintenance man. Overnight, his face has swollen 
               considerably and a bright yellow and purple discoloring around 
               his bruises has emerged.

                                     MAINTENANCE MAN (O.S.)
                         You get hit by a truck or what?

               He bends over and helps pull Duncan to his feet.

               WIDER ANGLE

               As the maintenance man guides Duncan to the door.

                                     MAINTENANCE MAN
                         I'm sorry, man, but you can't stay 
                         in here. Go out to the park, lay in 
                         the sunshine. You'll feel better. 
                         Okay?

               Duncan goes out the door. The maintenance man turns and sees 
               Cheater stretched out again on the table.

                                     MAINTENANCE MAN
                         God bless it! Hey!

               He pulls Cheater off the table and pushes him to the door.

                                     MAINTENANCE MAN
                         Out. Out. Out. Out. Out.

               EXT. LAUNDROMAT

               As Cheater is pushed out onto the sidewalk.

                                     CHEATER
                              (angry)
                         All right! All right!

               He straightens his rags indignantly, then looks at Duncan 
               and grins.

                                     CHEATER
                         Whaddya say, pardner. I'm dry as a 
                         bone. You got any money?

               Duncan looks at Cheater distrustfully and shakes his head.

                                     CHEATER
                         You neither, huh?
                              (with a laugh)
                         My name is Morgan, but it ain't J.P. 
                         Guess I better go to work. Take 'er 
                         easy now, pardner.

               Cheater shuffles off in one direction. Duncan turns and goes 
               in the other.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               A knock at the front door. After a moment, Tracy comes into 
               the front hallway and, crossing to the door, stubs her toe 
               on the open closet door. She swears under her breath and 
               angrily slams the closet door shut. Then, grabbing her injured 
               toe, she hops to the front door.

                                     TRACY
                         Who is it?

                                     CLIFFORD (O.S.)
                         My name's John Clifford. I'm a private 
                         investigator.

                                     TRACY
                         A what?

                                     CLIFFORD (O.S.)
                         A private detective.

               Pause.

                                     TRACY
                         What do you want with me?

                                     CLIFFORD (O.S.)
                         I'd just like to talk, ask a few 
                         questions.

                                     TRACY
                         I've got nothing to say about anything 
                         or anybody.

               Pause.

                                     CLIFFORD (O.S.)
                         Listen, lady, I can be back in thirty 
                         minutes with a search warrant and a 
                         handful of cops, and I can probably 
                         have you arrested, whether or not 
                         the charges would stick. Now do you 
                         want to let me in and talk?

                                     TRACY
                         Have you got a badge?

                                     CLIFFORD (O.S.)
                         I'll show you a badge when you open 
                         the goddamn door!

               Tracy unbolts the door and opens it. Clifford walks right in 
               and closes the door behind him.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I don't carry a badge. I'm issued a 
                         license, a piece of paper, and I 
                         left it at home. You're Tracy Fuller?

               Tracy nods.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Can we sit down?

               Tracy leads him into the living room. They sit. Clifford 
               gives her a picture.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Do you recognize this man?

                                     TRACY
                         Why?

               Clifford lets out a sigh of frustration, realizing that this 
               woman will continue to be difficult.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         He's escaped from the insane asylum. 
                         In 1972, he murdered two children... 
                         broke into a house and found them 
                         asleep in bed. It was a little boy, 
                         five an a half, and a little three-
                         year-old girl. After the coroner's 
                         investigation, their bodies were 
                         taken to the mortuary, where the 
                         undertaker took one look at them and 
                         said he couldn't have their bodies 
                         reconstructed for the funeral without 
                         six days of steady work. Then he 
                         asked what had been the murder weapon, 
                         because looking at the mess in front 
                         of him, he couldn't imagine what had 
                         been used. The coroner told him there 
                         had been no murder weapon. The killer 
                         had used only his hands.
                              (beat)
                         The undertaker went to work and had 
                         them done in four.

               The picture falls out of Tracy's hands. She is stunned to 
               the point of nausea.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         What's the matter?

                                     TRACY
                              (barely able to say 
                              it)
                         He's been here.

               EXT. STREET

               Duncan is standing on the sidewalk huddled close to a wall. 
               He is looking up at Tracy's apartment building across the 
               street.

               POV - DUNCAN

               Traveling up the wall of the building to the open window of 
               Tracy's apartment on the sixth floor. SLOW ZOOM IN:

                                     CLIFFORD (O.S.)
                         Do you think he'll try to see you 
                         again?

                                     TRACY (O.S.)
                         I don't know. He said he had no place 
                         else to go.

               INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Let's play it safe. Let's assume 
                         that he will.

               CLOSEUP - TRACY

               Reacting to this possibility.

                                     CLIFFORD (O.S.)
                         Will you work with me?

               She nods, hesitantly.

               EXT. STREET

               Duncan turns up an alley across the street from Tracy's 
               apartment building and disappears.

               Sound over: knocking on a door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BAR - DAY

               Clifford is standing at the door. The "Closed" sign still 
               hangs in the window. The door opens, and Hank sticks his 
               head out.

                                     HANK
                         You again?

                                     CLIFFORD
                         What are your hours tonight?

                                     HANK
                         No hours. Bar's closed on Mondays.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I want you to be open if that's 
                         possible.

                                     HANK
                              (closing the door)
                         No way. Monday's my night off. Come 
                         back tomorr...

               Clifford violently pushes the door open. The bartender backs 
               off, surprised.

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (through clenched 
                              teeth)
                         This is tomorrow! Now what are your 
                         hours?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LT. GARBER'S OFFICE - DAY

               Garber is sitting behind his desk as Clifford walks in.

                                     GARBER
                              (looking up)
                         Any luck?

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I've come to say goodbye, and thank 
                         you.

                                     GARBER
                         You found him?

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I think so.

                                     GARBER
                         Where?

               Pause.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         From here on, I go it alone.

                                     GARBER
                         What's the point of chancing it, 
                         Cliff? We'll let you take the credit.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         No.

               Pause. Clifford sits down.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I'm going to kill him, Charlie.

               Garber leans forward in his chair and stares at Clifford. A 
               long moment passes. A button on the lieutenant's phone lights 
               up and the intercom buzzes. Garber doesn't even look down at 
               it. The button flashes on and off, on and off. Finally it 
               stops.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         The closer I get to this guy, the 
                         more I... It gets to me. I don't 
                         know...

                                     GARBER
                         I think you'd better go on home, 
                         Cliff. You've fallen in.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         No. Not this time. This is the case 
                         that makes up for a whole career. If 
                         you can't understand it now, you 
                         will in a few years.

               Pause. Garber considers another tack and follows it.

                                     GARBER
                         What part does money play in all 
                         this? Play straight with me.

               Clifford is stunned by the question, but he tries to be 
               casual.

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (shrugging)
                         For what I'm being paid, it's not 
                         out of line.

                                     GARBER
                         Who's hired you for this?

               Clifford glares at his friend and doesn't answer.

                                     GARBER
                              (cynically)
                         So you're a hitman now.

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (passionately)
                         He murdered two kids in cold blood. 
                         You were there, too.

               Garber doesn't have to be reminded of his own feelings. He 
               doesn't pursue the argument.

                                     GARBER
                         You could get busted.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I understand that.

                                     GARBER
                         What are you going to use?

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Jimmy needles.

               Garber nods slowly, considering it a good choice of weapons 
               at least.

                                     GARBER
                         You're stretching our friendship, 
                         Cliff. If you blow this at all --

                                     CLIFFORD
                         You'll never hear from me again.

               Garber looks away for a moment. When he looks back, he just 
               shrugs his shoulders, "washes his hands".

                                     GARBER
                         Take your time. Do it right.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Don't worry.

                                     GARBER
                         Do you need any help preparing for 
                         this thing?

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (standing up)
                         I'm ready. I'm just trying to think 
                         where he could be in the meantime.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

               A few customers sit quietly minding their own business. A 
               WAITRESS leans near the cash register at one end of the 
               counter. A transistor radio plays country music blues. The 
               waitress looks up as somebody enters.

                                     WAITRESS
                         What happened to you?

                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)
                         Coffee.

               It is Duncan. He moves to the counter and sits.

                                     WAITRESS
                         You get mugged?

                                     DUNCAN
                         Black.

               Snubbed, the waitress comes back and sets the cup in front 
               of him. She looks down at the change on the counter. There 
               isn't enough.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Coffee's twenty-seven.

               Duncan looks up at her resentfully.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (pulling away the cup)
                         Coffee's twenty-seven cents. Ya got 
                         it or don't ya?

               Duncan glares at her. He doesn't have it.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Okay, buster, one cup. On the house.

               She pushes the cup back to him. Some of the coffee spills 
               onto the counter.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Drink it and be on your way.

               Duncan slowly reaches for the cup, raises it to his lips.

                                     WAITRESS
                         You're welcome.

               Duncan stops, sets the cup down, pushes it away from him and 
               slowly rises from his seat.

                                     DUNCAN
                         No, thank you.

               Duncan and the waitress stand face to face, shooting darts 
               at each other. Then a MAN sitting two seats away reaches 
               over and places a quarter on the counter between them.

               The waitress looks at the man irritatedly, then picks up the 
               money and moves away.

               Duncan slowly sits down again. He pulls the cup back to 
               himself, then turns and looks at the man for a long moment, 
               unable to express his gratitude.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY STREETS - DUSK

               A series of shots of BUMS, "homeless persons", hanging out, 
               in alleys, in the doorways of old buildings, sitting on the 
               sidewalk in front of liquor stores.

               Then we see Duncan, alone but looking no different from the 
               others. He is panhandling PASSERSBY, without much success. 
               We see him fall into a fit of coughing that incapacitates 
               him for several seconds. He's obviously getting sicker.

               We lose sight of Duncan as our MONTAGE continues. We see 
               Clifford talking to a BUM, then another. He is passing the 
               time combing the streets in the neighborhood of the bar.

               PARK - DUSK

               A handful of BUMS are sitting together on the grass passing 
               a bottle in a brown paper bag. Duncan is not among them, but 
               Cheater is there, sitting at the end of the line.

               CAMERA PANS from one bum to the next as the bottle is passed. 
               By the time it gets to Cheater, it is empty. Cheater looks 
               as if he's about to cry like a baby when a hand enters the 
               frame from the other side -- the hand holding out to Cheater 
               a full bottle of wine. Cheater takes the bottle and looks up 
               gratefully... to see John Clifford standing beside him.

                                     CHEATER
                         Well! I can't say much for your 
                         protocol, but your timing's dead on. 
                         Here's to you, pardner.

               Cheater takes a long drink, then passes the bottle back down 
               the line.

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (to all the bums)
                         I'm looking for an old buddy of mine, 
                         English fella. Name's Crazy Curt. 
                         Any of you guys seen him?

               Nobody responds.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I owe him some money.

                                     CHEATER
                         Aaahh. Show me an honest man...

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (gesturing)
                         Stands about so. Brown hair. Face 
                         kind of banged up. Was in an accident.

                                     CHEATER
                         Oh, yeah? I was just with that guy, 
                         not more'n an hour ago. Looked bad. 
                         Crazy Curt, huh?

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Where?

               Cheater scratches his head, and glances anxiously down the 
               line.

                                     CHEATER
                         Hell, I can't remember. Prob'bly see 
                         him again though. Tell you what. You 
                         leave the money with me, I'll see he 
                         gets it... as a favor to you.

               Clifford shakes his head.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I have to talk to him.

                                     CHEATER
                         Whatsa matter? You don't trust me? 
                         I'll have you know I used to be a 
                         college professor. We can work 
                         together.

               Clifford stands to go. The bottle comes back to Cheater, 
               three-quarters down.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Sure. Keep the bottle. I'll be back.

                                     CHEATER
                         "Long life to the grape! For when 
                         summer is flown, The age of our nectar 
                         Shall gladden our own." That's 
                         Shelley, you know.

               Clifford is gone. Cheater takes a long drink and almost 
               forgets that Clifford was ever there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CLIFFORD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Clifford is "suiting up" for his night's work. He is dressed 
               casually -- blue jeans, shirt open at the neck, sports jacket, 
               Adidas running shoes. He looks at himself in the mirror, is 
               satisfied. Then he picks up from the dresser two awl-like 
               instruments with short handles and long, glistening tapered 
               needlepoints -- his weapons. He slides them into a leather 
               sheath inside his jacket and turns to go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BAR - NIGHT

               It is lit up inside. The bar is open for business. Across 
               the street in a dark space between two buildings, Duncan is 
               waiting, watching the front door of the bar to see who comes 
               out.

               INT. BAR

               The place is empty but for Hank who half watches the 
               television over the bar, and Tracy who sits alone in a corner. 
               Several moments pass as both of them sit and wait.

               Then, the front door starts to swing open. Someone is coming 
               in. Tracy and Hank both glance nervously toward the door.

               A MAN'S head peeks in. He is somewhere in his forties, a 
               regular customer.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Hey, Hank, what're you doing open 
                         tonight?

                                     HANK
                              (relaxing)
                         Trying to make a buck.

               The customer walks up to the bar, sits down and talks quietly 
               with Hank.

               Tracy looks nervously at her wristwatch. She stubs out her 
               cigarette, takes one last gulp of her drink and stands up to 
               go.

               She walks to the bar, opens her purse and reaches inside.

                                     HANK
                         Keep it, honey. My treat.

               They exchange a meaningful look. Then she heads for the door.

                                     CUSTOMER
                              (under his breath)
                         That how you make a buck?

               EXT. BAR

               Tracy looks up and down the street, hoping to see Clifford 
               somewhere, afraid of glimpsing Duncan instead. Then she starts 
               walking quickly homeward.

               EXT. STREETS

               Following Tracy to her apartment. We pick up Clifford now, 
               and we cut back and forth between the two of them -- her 
               walking quickly, never looking back, and him sneaking along 
               several hundred feet behind her, looking everywhere for 
               Duncan, whom we never see.

               EXT. TRACY'S APARTMENT

               She walks up the steps and enters.

               INT. SIXTH FLOOR

               Tracy steps off the elevator and goes to her door. She fumbles 
               through her purse for the key. Then she hears footsteps on 
               the stairs. She turns. It's Clifford.

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (coming forward: half-
                              whispering)
                         No luck. You see him?

               Tracy shakes her head.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         He still could be out there, though.

                                     TRACY
                              (softly)
                         Oh, God...

               She is starting to come apart, and she suddenly leans on 
               Clifford for support.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Are you all right?

               Tracy stands there for several seconds to regain control of 
               herself. Then she steps away and turns back to the door.

                                     TRACY
                         I'm okay.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I'm going to hang around outside for 
                         awhile. I'll be back on and off again 
                         all night.

               Tracy gets the door unlocked. She pushes it open.

               INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL

               Tracy steps in. Clifford stays in the doorway. They are still 
               whispering.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Are you sure you're okay?

                                     TRACY
                         I'm fine.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         All right. Bolt your door. Don't let 
                         anybody in, no matter what.

                                     TRACY
                         Okay.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I'll be seeing you.
                              (starts to move off; 
                              comes back)
                         Listen. Thanks.

                                     TRACY
                         Sure.

               Tracy closes the door and throws the bolt. Then she walks 
               into the apartment and out of frame. CAMERA STAYS in the 
               hallway. We can hear Tracy moving about O.S.

               Then, as if on its own, the door to the hall closet slowly 
               swings open...

               ...until we can see Duncan standing inside the closet.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Tracy is putting some coffee on. Then she removes her coat 
               and walks out of the kitchen.

               INT. FRONT HALL

               Tracy goes up to the closet with her coat. The door is closed. 
               She opens it. She hangs up her coat and closes the door again. 
               Then she turns and starts walking out of the hallway to the 
               living room.

               As she is rounding the corner into the living room, she walks 
               right into Duncan. She barely has time to gasp before he 
               clamps his hand over her mouth and pushes her against the 
               wall.

                                     DUNCAN
                              (urgent whisper)
                         I just have to talk to you.
                              (pathetically)
                         I want you to be my friend.

               As she isn't struggling, he starts to loosen up on her.

                                     DUNCAN
                         Please...

               He takes his hand away from her mouth, lets go of her, and 
               slowly, cautiously steps back. Tracy looks at him for a 
               breathless moment, her eyes wild with fear. Then she screams.

               Duncan jumps back, stunned, frightened and confused. Tracy 
               doesn't move. She just keeps screaming hysterically.

               EXT. STREET

               Tracy's screams carry out into the night as Clifford races 
               across the street and into the apartment building.

               INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT

               Duncan runs to a window, throws it open and climbs out onto 
               the fire escape.

               INTERCUT - APARTMENT STAIRS AND FIRE ESCAPE

               As Clifford bounds up the stairs, flight after flight, and 
               Duncan tears down the fire escape.

               INT. SIXTH FLOOR

               The screaming has stopped when Clifford reaches Tracy's door. 
               He grabs the doorknob and heaves himself against the door. 
               It's bolted shut.

               Clifford pulls one of the needles from his jacket and hammers 
               it into the lock. The bolt springs and Clifford runs into 
               the apartment.

               INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT

               As Clifford bursts in. Tracy gestures toward the window. 
               Clifford runs to it and sticks his head out.

               POV - CLIFFORD

               Duncan is gone.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Clifford runs to a window on another wall and looks out onto 
               the street.

               POV - CLIFFORD

               No sign of the Englishman.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Clifford runs out of the apartment, yanking his needle from 
               the lock as he passes the door, and charges back down the 
               stairs.

               Tracy moves to the door and closes it. She is breathing 
               heavily.

               O.S. we hear the angry sizzle of coffee spilling onto the 
               hot stove, as Tracy goes to get it.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING

               Clifford comes out, looks around and moves rapidly up the 
               street.

               EXT. A STREET

               Duncan is hurrying along, dodging in and out of people, trying 
               to move quickly but not draw attention to himself...

               EXT. ANOTHER STREET

               Clifford is travelling along the sidewalk, crossing the 
               street, looking everywhere...

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Duncan is running up the alley. He comes to a stop beside 
               some piled up trash cans. He leans against the brick wall of 
               the building, huffing and puffing. He is frightened, but he 
               feels safe for now. He slowly slides down the wall to the 
               ground...

                                                             FLASH BACK TO:

               INT. MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY

               Duncan is curled up in the corner of a bare cell with padded 
               walls. He is in a strait-jacket. His head is shaved. We can't 
               tell what he is thinking, except that he's obviously deeply 
               frightened and cannot understand what's happening to him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A ROOM - NIGHT

               This is the children's bedroom in Dr. Mandrakis' house of 
               six years ago. It is dark. Two small beds occupy one corner 
               of the room. We can see two small lumps on the beds, but no 
               more.

               Duncan sits in the foreground with a telephone on his lap. 
               He is dialing a number. The phone rings three times before 
               it is answered -- or rather, picked up, because there is no 
               voice on the other end. After several seconds the phone is 
               hung up.

               Duncan hangs up and thinks for a moment. He picks up the 
               phone and dials again. This time he gets a busy signal. He 
               hangs up, stands and goes to the door. He opens it slowly, 
               peers out. Jill's voice can be heard faintly talking to the 
               operator, asking for the police.

               Duncan closes the door and comes back into the room, mumbling. 
               He goes to the window, looks out. Then he goes to the 
               children's beds.

               CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

               As he raises the covers and stares down into the CAMERA.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DECK OF A SHIP - MORNING

               A freighter, broad and low, arduously cuts through the water. 
               Early morning mist hangs over the deck which is empty but 
               for a lone FIGURE standing on the prow.

               MIDDLE SHOT - LONE FIGURE

               It is Curt Duncan. He is looking out over the front of the 
               ship. Another SEAMAN comes up behind him and claps him on 
               the shoulder.

                                     SEAMAN
                         So this will be your first time?
                              (laughs)
                         An old salt like you?

               Duncan moves away, wanting to be left alone.

                                     SEAMAN
                              (still laughing; 
                              slightly punchy)
                         You'll love it here. It's where they 
                         make the bombs. It's where they make 
                         the planes that carry the bombs; the 
                         planes we saw over Singapore and 
                         Manila.

               He walks away laughing.

                                     SEAMAN
                         There she is. That's America.

               DUNCAN'S POV

               The coast of Southern California emerges through the mist. A 
               foghorn blows somewhere in the distance.

               CLOSE-UP - DUNCAN

               As he peers ahead with inscrutable interest.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANOTHER ROOM - NIGHT

               Dark. A little BOY is lying in bed, apparently asleep. This 
               is Curt Duncan as a child.

               Some voices approach in the hallway outside the bedroom. 
               They are gruff, with heavy English accents, but subdued; a 
               MAN and a WOMAN, well into middle-age.

               The boy's eyes open as he listens:

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         What's the matter?

                                     WOMAN (O.S.)
                         Save it for later. Let's go out and 
                         get some food.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         What about the lad? You can't leave 
                         him.

                                     WOMAN (O.S.)
                         Curt's asleep. He'll never know we're 
                         gone.

               From outside, a key enters the lock of the bedroom door and 
               turns. The bolt slips and the door is securely shut.

               The boy sits up in bed, apprehensive. In TIGHT SHOTS of the 
               floor we see a rat come out from under the bed, then another. 
               They make "chit-chit" noises as they begin to explore. One 
               of them maybe goes up on its hind legs and nibbles on the 
               bedpost. Then we see two more rats appear.

               We go for a TIGHT SHOT of the boy on top of the bed. The 
               "chit-chit" noises grow steadily louder as the boy's 
               apprehension turns to fear, then to terror. The boy starts 
               to whimper.

               Suddenly, we cut back to a WIDE SHOT of the room. The floor 
               is crawling with rats, hundreds of them. The "chit-chit" 
               rises to practically a roar as the boy, alone on top of the 
               bed, begins to wail.

               The room seems to darken, and the boy becomes just a little 
               white speck in it. The focus is turned. The picture becomes 
               a black and white blur.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT - THE PRESENT

               At first all that can be seen is a white blur against a black 
               screen. The previous sound of a boy crying increases. Then 
               the blur grows larger, coming more into focus as the entire 
               screen image moves toward normal definition. Finally, we 
               know we are back in the alleyway, that it is night, and that 
               the white blur is actually a little BOY lost, sobbing 
               uncontrollably.

               CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

               Awakening to the scene, coming back to reality. He is 
               confused.

               WIDER ANGLE ON DUNCAN AND BOY

               The boy continues sobbing, moving about in little circles. 
               Duncan, amazed at what he sees, slowly crawls out from the 
               wall on his hands and knees, crawls toward the weeping child, 
               staring at it with a strange look on his face.

               Suddenly the boy stops crying and looks at Duncan quizzically, 
               hesitantly. They are less than a foot apart, almost face to 
               face. Together they form a kind of frozen tableau. Something 
               close to sympathy crosses the killer's expression, and the 
               boy, likewise, achieves a faint sense of recognition.

               Then, just as suddenly, the boy starts wailing again and he 
               runs off down the alleyway. Duncan watches him disappear. 
               Then he slowly pulls himself to his feet.

               EXT. STREET

               Clifford is coming up the sidewalk. As Clifford crosses the 
               entrance to an alleyway, the boy comes running out and almost 
               collides with him. Clifford grabs the boy and looks down at 
               him. Then he passes the wailing child off on a nearby 
               PEDESTRIAN and runs up into the alley.

               EXT. ANOTHER STREET

               Duncan is hurrying along the sidewalk. Something makes him 
               look up.

               POV - DUNCAN

               He is looking at a neon "Jesus Saves" sign above the doorway 
               to an inner city mission.

               BACK ON DUNCAN

               As he stares at the sign.

                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)
                         Hey, Crazy Curt!

               Duncan turns to see Cheater elatedly hobbling up to him.

                                     CHEATER
                         Hail fellow well met, and all that 
                         jazz. It's our lucky day!
                              (taking Duncan by the 
                              arm)
                         A friend of your's got money for 
                         you. We got to get back to the park 
                         and meet him.

               Duncan pulls his arm free.

                                     CHEATER
                         C'mon. He'll be comin' for you, Crazy 
                         Curt. S'got some money.
                              (reaching for Duncan's 
                              arm)
                         We'll get us a little joy juice.

               Duncan pulls free again and heads toward the mission.

                                     CHEATER
                         C'mon! Hey!! You really are crazy! 
                         C'mon!

               Duncan enters the mission and Cheater stands out on the 
               sidewalk for a moment, bitterly frustrated.

                                     CHEATER
                         "Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! 
                         Rage! Blow, you cataracts and 
                         hurricanoes, spout till you have 
                         drench'd our steeples and drown'd 
                         the cocks!"

               Several PEDESTRIANS stop and gape at this sudden outburst.

               EXT. ANOTHER STREET

               Clifford comes out of a derelict hotel, looks up and down 
               the street and hurries off, not giving up the chase.

               INT. MISSION - MOMENTS LATER

               A MAN is leading Duncan to the bathroom. Duncan enters slowly 
               and goes to one of the wash basins where there is an old 
               razor blade and a can of shaving cream. Duncan picks up the 
               razor for a moment and looks at it. He is lost in thought. 
               Then he sets it down and turns on the tap water.

               He glances at himself in the mirror and is suddenly transfixed 
               by his own image. He looks deeply into the mirror for several 
               seconds. Then he starts to cry, and having begun, a flood of 
               emotions comes pouring out of him. He drops to his knees.

               The man comes running back into the bathroom. He holds Duncan 
               and helps pull him back to his feet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Cheater is trudging along the sidewalk, hands in pockets, 
               head lowered. He looks up and sees something that brings him 
               back to life.

               POV - CHEATER

               Clifford is standing on the corner up ahead, looking around.

               WIDE ANGLE ON STREET

               Cheater calls out and starts to run toward Clifford.

               Clifford turns, sees Cheater.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MISSION - NIGHT

               The "sleeping dorm". It is a large empty room. Thirty or so 
               OUTCASTS are stretched out on the bare floor in the darkness. 
               Their combined snoring/wheezing creates a steady, ghastly 
               din.

               The door at the far end of the hall opens. A figure steps in 
               and quietly closes the door behind him. He stands for a moment 
               taking in the scene, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. 
               Then he slowly creeps forward to the prone body of the nearest 
               sleeper.

               CLOSEUP - FIGURE

               It is Clifford. He moves stealthily from one body to the 
               next. In one hand he carries a small flashlight. He turns 
               the bodies over just long enough to shine the light in their 
               faces and identify who they are, or rather who they are not. 
               Then he moves on. In his other hand he holds a small, gleaming 
               Jimmy needle.

               CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

               He's sleeping, but his eyes suddenly open, sensing danger. 
               He turns over and sees the dark figure of Clifford slowly 
               advancing toward him.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Clifford keeps coming, closer and closer to where Duncan 
               lies. He is but six or seven bodies away when Duncan jumps 
               up suddenly and bolts for the door.

               Clifford looks up, sees the fleeing figure and charges after 
               it.

               INT. CORRIDORS

               Racing through a maze of narrow hallways, Duncan can't stop 
               to think where he's going. Clifford is barreling after him 
               some forty yards behind.

               Duncan rounds a corner and ten yards up ahead, the hallway 
               deadends in a set of double doors. Duncan has no choice but 
               to hurl himself against the doors. They yield and he goes 
               through them.

               Four seconds later, Clifford comes to the same doors and 
               pushes through to the other side.

               INT. CHURCH

               As Clifford comes through the doors which are a side entrance 
               into the chancel of this large, gothic-style church. Behind 
               him now, is the altar. Before him stretches the nave of the 
               edifice with its rows of pews, its dimly glowing stained 
               glass windows, and way in the back, its choir loft. At regular 
               intervals, tiny shafts of light pierce the darkness from on 
               high.

               There is no sign of Duncan, but Clifford knows he must be in 
               here, hiding somewhere. He slowly walks forward to the front 
               of the chancel.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Duncan. Duncan. It's over now. Come 
                         on out.

               Pause. Duncan doesn't come out. Clifford holds very still. 
               He hears nothing. He speaks again and his voice echoes through 
               the large empty church.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         My name's John Clifford. I'm a private 
                         detective. I've been hired by 
                         Alexander Mandrakis to take you back. 
                         I'm not going to hurt you.

               CLOSEUP - DUNCAN

               Hiding beneath a pew. He hears the name "Mandrakis" and it 
               registers like a thunderbolt. He silently mouths the name 
               "Mandrakis".

               Then he hears Clifford's footsteps approaching.

               ANGLE ON CLIFFORD

               Slowly moving up the center aisle, looking from side to side 
               into the pews.

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (gently; coaxing)
                         I'm not going to hurt you... I'm not 
                         going to hurt you... There'll be no 
                         more pain... You're safe now...

               Clifford moves closer and closer to Duncan's row until 
               finally, Duncan can bear it no longer. He jumps up from 
               beneath the pew and runs.

                                     DUNCAN
                              (hysterical)
                         No! Mandrakis! No!

               Clifford chases him through the pews and up the aisles to 
               the front of the church. He is clutching a needle in both 
               hands, ready to strike.

               Duncan flees through a narrow door off to the side of the 
               church.

               INT. BELL TOWER

               Duncan faces a spiraling stone staircase. He has no choice 
               but to climb them, higher and higher, the sound of Clifford's 
               angry footsteps always coming up behind him.

               Finally, Duncan can climb no higher. He is at the top of the 
               bell tower. A lanceted opening in the stone wall ahead of 
               him looks out over the narrow shaft of the tower. Above him 
               are the huge iron bells. A rope hangs down from the bells, 
               dangling all the way down the shaft, forty or fifty feet to 
               the floor of the church.

               Clifford is bounding up the last flight of steps to get him. 
               Duncan has little choice. He is trapped. Just before Clifford 
               reaches him, Duncan leaps out into the shaft and catches the 
               bell rope.

               The bell starts to clang as Duncan, hanging in mid air, swings 
               back and forth within the narrow shaft. Clifford leans way 
               out through the lancet window and takes a swipe at Duncan, 
               but the madman is just beyond his reach and hurriedly climbing 
               down the rope.

               Clifford reaches out and tries to grab at the rope. At last, 
               he gets it, and he shakes it violently to get Duncan to lose 
               his grip and be dashed against the stone floor below.

               But Duncan holds firm, climbing ever downward. The bell 
               continues to clang, sending its alarm out into the night. 
               Then Clifford braces himself and slowly, laboriously begins 
               to haul up on the rope.

               Clifford gains momentum until Duncan is being pulled up faster 
               than he is climbing down. Still twenty feet off the ground, 
               Duncan lets go of the rope and plummets to the hard stone 
               floor.

               Then PEOPLE come rushing into the church, awakened by the 
               commotion of the bells. Duncan rolls into the shadows and 
               drags himself out a side door, while Clifford plans his own 
               escape from the bell tower.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ALLEYWAY NEAR CHURCH - NIGHT

               Clifford runs up the alleyway, looks around and finally 
               realizes he's lost his prey.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ANOTHER ALLEYWAY

               Duncan is hidden deep in the shadows of a nook between two 
               buildings, catching his breath. CAMERA MOVES IN on him, and 
               we see him looking the craziest he's ever been. He shakes 
               uncontrollably and begins to mumble, softly at first, then 
               getting louder. He's falling back into the grips of Guy du 
               Marraux.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CITY - MORNING

               A. All is still and quiet as soft, warm sunlight pours into 
               the dirty streets and alleyways. In the background, the bell 
               tower of the church rises above the skyline.

               B. We see a SHOT of the park -- all the bums are asleep.

               C. Then a SHOT of the mission -- its front door open, the 
               sidewalk empty.

               D. Then the bar, where the same peaceful mood prevails.

               E. Then the alleyway where we last saw Curt Duncan. Now he 
               is gone.

               F. Then the exterior of Tracy's apartment building. Clifford's 
               car is parked out front.

                                     TRACY (O.S.)
                         I used to see my two kids every 
                         weekend. They lived in a nice house 
                         with their father, outside the city.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT

               Tracy and Clifford are sitting at a small table in the 
               kitchen, looking haggard, drinking coffee.

                                     TRACY
                         Now... it's been years. They're grown 
                         up.

               They look at each other. Clifford is a sympathetic listener.

                                     TRACY
                         I look at where I am now. I know I 
                         could've done better, but... it's 
                         too late for that.

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (quietly)
                         I know.

               Pause.

                                     TRACY
                         Well, you've got to keep looking, I 
                         suppose.

               Taking his cue, Clifford slowly rises.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I don't think he'll come back here.

               Tracy looks up at him questioningly, wishing she could feel 
               as sure about it as he does.

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (extending his hand)
                         Thanks... for all your help.

               Tracy takes his hand. They shake warmly.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I know it wasn't easy.
                              (turning to go)
                         Maybe, someday, I'll be able to...

                                     TRACY
                         I wish you wouldn't leave me 
                         altogether...

               Clifford turns back to her.

                                     TRACY
                              (with a laugh)
                         I'm not a young woman anymore. I've 
                         given up all my dreams of the future. 
                         Now, I just want to make it to the 
                         end. You know what I mean.

               Clifford smiles at her gently. He knows exactly what she 
               means.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         I'll be around.

                                     TRACY
                         Sure.

               Clifford takes a few steps, turns back, looks at her.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         You like ice cream?

                                     TRACY
                         Yes.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         What flavor?

                                     TRACY
                         Chocolate chip.

               Clifford nods his head slightly, as if registering this in 
               his memory.

                                     CLIFFORD
                              (quietly)
                         Okay.

               They smile at each other for a second then Clifford leaves 
               and Tracy sits alone in her kitchen, listening to him go, 
               hearing the door close behind him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               CLOSE UP on a section of a newspaper lying in the gutter. A 
               pair of feet enters the frame and stands beside the newspaper. 
               We hear a familiar cough. Then a trembling hand reaches down 
               and picks up the newspaper.

               Pause. Something in the newspaper has caught his eye. Then 
               the feet shuffle out of frame.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

               A modest middle-income neighborhood where young married 
               couples buy their first home and start their family.

               CAMERA is facing down the quiet street. In the foreground, 
               on the street, two small CHILDREN, a little boy and a little 
               girl, are playing. They are adorable kids.

               CAMERA PANS ninety degrees with the children as they run out 
               of the street and up the sidewalk to their house.

               A TITLE APPEARS across the bottom of the screen:

                               5 pm Friday, April 28, 1978

               TITLE FADES as the children push open the front door and 
               enter the house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOUSE - FOLLOWING CHILDREN

               They noisily and excitedly make their way to the kitchen.

               The children are four and two and a half years old, STEVIE 
               and JUNE respectively.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN

               As the kids enter, their MOTHER is working at the stove, her 
               back to CAMERA.

                                     JUNE & STEVIE
                              (together)
                         Hi, Mommy!

               The mother turns around. It is Jill Johnson!

                                     JILL
                              (smiling)
                         Well, look what the wind blew in!

               CAMERA MOVES IN on her as she comes forward, bends down, 
               kisses Stevie, and picks up June. Jill looks older, more 
               mature, but still very pretty. She is Mrs. John Lockhart 
               now, and has left her memories of the past behind her.

                                     STEVIE
                         Mommy, what's for dinner? Could we 
                         have hamburgers?

                                     JILL
                              (teasing)
                         Is that all you ever want?

               A wall phone in the kitchen starts to ring. Stevie goes to 
               answer it.

                                     STEVIE
                         Hello?

                                     JOHN (O.S.)
                              (surprised)
                         Hey, how's my little tiger?

               It is JOHN LOCKHART on the phone.

                                     STEVIE
                         Daddy, Junie threw my baseball down 
                         the street; and I can't find it!

                                     JOHN (O.S.)
                         Well, we'll look for it real hard 
                         later. Let me talk to mommy.

               Jill, by this time, has come to the phone. She is still 
               holding June.

                                     STEVIE
                         Okay. Bye, daddy.

               Stevie hands the phone to Jill.

                                     JILL
                         Hi.

                                     JOHN
                         Hi, babe -- whaddya say you put on a 
                         sexy dress, and I take you out to 
                         dinner tonight?

               Jill is very happy about this.

                                     JILL
                         Great... what's the occasion?

                                     JOHN
                              (teasing)
                         Just a little surprise.

                                     JILL
                         What?

                                     JOHN
                         I'm leaving here now; be home in 
                         half an hour.

                                     JILL
                         Okay, see ya.

                                     JOHN
                         Bye, babe.

               As Jill hangs up the phone, Stevie pipes up O.S.

                                     STEVIE (O.S.)
                         Mommy, is Daddy gonna get me a new 
                         baseball?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DR. MANDRAKIS' HOUSE - NIGHT

               Clifford's car is parked in the driveway, and we see him 
               getting out. He goes to the front door -- the porch light is 
               on and perhaps one other lamp somewhere inside the otherwise 
               dark house. He rings the bell, waits, rings again...

               Finally the door is opened by the Houseboy.

                                     HOUSEBOY
                         Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis are out of 
                         town.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         For how long?

                                     HOUSEBOY
                         Three more weeks.

               Pause.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         It's just as well. Will you be here?

                                     HOUSEBOY
                         Yes.

               Clifford takes a business card from his pocket and gives it 
               to the Houseboy.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Here. Call if you need me.

               The Houseboy reads the card as Clifford walks back to his 
               car. Then the Houseboy closes the front door.

               Clifford pauses beside his car for a moment, looking back at 
               the rich, dark home.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JILL'S HOUSE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The children are in bed. Jill is sitting next to Stevie. 
               Only a nightlight is on.

                                     STEVIE
                         ...I pray the Lord my soul to keep. 
                         If I die before I wake, I pray the 
                         Lord my soul to take. God bless Mommy 
                         and Daddy and...

                                     JUNE
                         And me.

                                     STEVIE
                         ...and Granmom and Aunt Lucy and 
                         Uncle George...

                                     JUNE
                         And me!

                                     STEVIE
                              (pausing)
                         ...and her. Now will you tell us a 
                         story?

                                     JILL
                         No, I will not tell you a story. You 
                         go to sleep now. And be good. Carol 
                         will be here while we're gone.

                                     STEVIE
                         Goodnight.

               Jill kisses him.

                                     JUNE
                         Mommy, will you come here a minute? 
                         I want to tell you something.

               Jill stands up and goes over to June's bed.

                                     JILL
                         What is it?

                                     JUNE
                         Come closer.

               Jill bends closer to her daughter. O.S. the doorbell rings.

                                     JUNE
                         I love you.

                                     JILL
                         I love you, too, Junebug.
                              (kissing her)
                         Goodnight. Sleep tight.

               Jill stands up and leaves.

               INT. FRONT HALL

               As Jill comes down the stairs. CAROL, the sitter, is at the 
               foot of the stairs with John. Carol has an armful of 
               schoolbooks.

                                     JILL
                         Hi, Carol.

                                     CAROL
                         Hello, Mrs. Lockhart. I saw your 
                         picture in the paper the other day. 
                         Congratulations.

                                     JILL
                         Ugggh... wasn't it a dreadful picture?

                                     JOHN
                         I thought it was nice.

               Jill crosses to a hall table, picks up a phone book, flips 
               through it, then writes on a notepad beside the phone. Over 
               this action...

                                     JOHN
                         Are the kids asleep?

                                     JILL
                         They will be soon.
                              (to Carol)
                         Give them about twenty minutes and 
                         then take a peek -- but if Stevie 
                         sees you, you'll have to tell him a 
                         story.
                              (beat)
                         Here's the number of the restaurant. 
                         Call us if you need us. For police, 
                         ambulance, any emergency like that, 
                         just dial 911. You know that, right?

                                     CAROL
                         Nine-one-one? Oh, sure.

                                     JILL
                         And just in case, I've written the 
                         number of the children's Uncle George 
                         and Aunt Lucy here, too.

                                     JOHN
                         Honey, in ten seconds I eat the 
                         staircase.

                                     JILL
                         Okay. Okay.

               She puts down the pad and crosses to a closet where she takes 
               out a lightweight coat.

                                     JILL
                              (handing the coat to 
                              John)
                         Here.

                                     JOHN
                              (not taking the coat)
                         I'm not wearing that thing!

               Jill shoves the coat into his stomach. Smiling, he takes the 
               coat and dutifully helps her on with it.

                                     CAROL
                         Have a good time.

                                     JILL
                         Thanks, Carol.

                                     JOHN
                              (pulling her out the 
                              door)
                         Bye, Carol.

                                     CAROL
                         Goodbye.

                                     JILL
                         Goodbye.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               John and Jill walk to the station wagon in the driveway as 
               Carol shuts the front door in the background. Just before 
               Jill gets into the car, she takes a look back at the house -- 
               there is a moment's hesitance, and then she gets in the car.

               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               Carol picks up the phone and carries it into the living room 
               with her. As she does it, we see lying on the phone table, 
               the newspaper clipping with Jill's picture, and headline: 
               "Jill Lockhart Chairs Community UNICEF Drive."

               She puts the phone down, then her books, then herself. She 
               dials a number. Her BOYFRIEND answers.

                                     BOYFRIEND (O.S.)
                         Hello?

                                     CAROL
                         Hi. It's me.

                                     BOYFRIEND (O.S.)
                         Oh, hi.

                                     CAROL
                         Can you come over?

                                     BOYFRIEND (O.S.)
                         I can't. I really have a lot of work 
                         to do.

                                     CAROL
                              (disappointed)
                         Ohhh...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               An Italian Restaurant. Quiet music, soft lights, red and 
               white checkered tablecloths, candles, a smokey and seductive 
               atmosphere.

               DOLLY with a LATIN WAITER carrying a huge tray of food over- 
               head. He passes right by the table where Jill and John are 
               sitting. John watches him take the food to someone else.

                                     JOHN
                              (reaching for a 
                              breadstick)
                         I've eaten enough breadsticks to 
                         turn into a pretzel.

                                     JILL
                         John, tell me about the surprise.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh, yeah. Brace yourself.

                                     JILL
                         I'm braced.

                                     JOHN
                         Good. I got the sack today.

                                     JILL
                         What sack?

                                     JOHN
                         The can... I was fired!

                                     JILL
                         Oh, sure.

                                     JOHN
                         You don't believe me?

                                     JILL
                         No, I don't believe you.

                                     JOHN
                         Well, Wally did call me into his 
                         office today. And he did tell me I 
                         didn't have my old job anymore.

                                     JILL
                              (getting excited)
                         John, what did you get?

                                     JOHN
                         Are you ready for this?

                                     JILL
                              (guessing)
                         District Sales Manager!

                                     JOHN
                         Regional!

                                     JILL
                         Regional?!

                                     JOHN
                         Nah, District.

                                     JILL
                              (beside herself)
                         John, I don't believe it! District 
                         Sales Manager!

               The WAITER arrives with their food.

                                     JILL
                         Well, it's about time!

               The waiter looks up, offended.

                                     JILL
                              (to waiter)
                         Not you.
                              (back to John)
                         It's about time they recognized you 
                         for what you are.

                                     WAITER
                         Enjoy your dinner, folks.

               They ignore him. He moves away. John digs right in.

                                     JOHN
                              (mouth full)
                         I'll be the youngest District Manager 
                         in the company's history. God, am I 
                         hungry!

                                     JILL
                              (not eating yet)
                         Does this mean a raise?

                                     JOHN
                         It sure does.

               John flags down a passing WAITER and signals that their wine 
               glasses need filling.

                                     JILL
                         How much?

                                     JOHN
                         A lot.

                                     JILL
                         How much?

               John leans forward and whispers in her ear.

                                     JILL
                         You're kidding! And a car?

                                     JOHN
                         And a car.

                                     JILL
                         John, I'm so proud of you.

               John pauses, looks at her.

                                     JOHN
                         What's the matter? You don't like 
                         your food?

               The MAITRE D' has come up to the table. John stops suddenly. 
               They are both very chagrined.

                                     MAITRE D'
                         Mr. and Mrs. Lockhart?

                                     JILL
                         That's right.

                                     MAITRE D'
                         There's a telephone call for you.

               John starts to get up. Jill grabs his arm.

                                     JILL
                         Eat your dinner. It's probably Carol. 
                         I'll talk to her.

               Jill stands up and follows the Maitre D' through the other 
               tables to the telephone. She picks up the receiver. CAMERA 
               MOVES in on her.

                                     JILL
                         Hello?

               Pause.

                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)
                         Have you checked the children?

               Jill screams and falls to the floor.

               ANGLE ON JOHN

               Around him, other DINERS fall instantly silent and wonder 
               what is going on. WAITERS stop dead in their tracks.

               John leaps up from his seat and dashes through the tables 
               like a madman. Suddenly the restaurant comes alive with 
               excitement and alarm.

               ANGLE ON JILL

               As John runs up and drops to his knees beside her. She is 
               shaking and sobbing uncontrollably.

                                     JOHN
                         Jill, what's happening? What's wrong?

                                     JILL
                         It was him! Somebody call the police! 
                         Help me!

               Other PEOPLE have crowded around and are making urgent noises 
               now about calling the police, an ambulance, etc. John tries 
               to cut through the confusion and anxiety.

                                     JOHN
                         Wait a minute! Just hold on! 
                         Sweetheart, what was him? What are 
                         you talking about?

                                     JILL
                         That man... Curt Duncan... He's home 
                         again! He's got our children!

                                     JOHN
                         He was on the phone?

               Jill nods.

               John grabs the telephone and quickly dials a number. The 
               crowd tries to quiet down, as much to hear for themselves as 
               to let John talk. The phone rings and rings. Finally...

                                     CAROL
                         Hello?

                                     JOHN
                         Hello, Carol, it's Mr. Lockhart. 
                         What's going on over there?

                                     CAROL
                         Nothing's going on.

                                     JOHN
                         Is everything all right?

                                     CAROL
                         Yes, there's nothing --

                                     JOHN
                         Are you sure?

               Pause.

                                     CAROL
                         Everything's fine. Why? What's --?

                                     JOHN
                         Carol, listen to me very carefully. 
                         If there's a man in the house, if 
                         there's any reason why you can't 
                         talk to me right now, just answer 
                         yes to me over the phone. That's 
                         all. If there's any danger of any 
                         kind, just say yes.

               Long pause. They wait for her answer. Jill is listening into 
               the receiver now, too.

                                     CAROL
                         I don't understand what's happening. 
                         What man in the house?

               Jill is confused. John breathes a guarded sigh of relief. 
               Jill takes the phone.

                                     JILL
                         Carol, it's Mrs. Lockhart. Answer me 
                         truthfully. When was the last time 
                         you looked in on the children?

                                     CAROL
                         About forty-five minutes ago. 
                         Everything's fine. They were fast 
                         asleep.

               Jill gives her husband a look. John takes the phone again.

                                     JOHN
                         Carol, I'm sorry about all the 
                         hysterics. We're leaving the 
                         restaurant now. We'll explain 
                         everything when we get home. Before 
                         we hang up, could you do just one 
                         more thing for me, please?

                                     CAROL
                         What?

                                     JOHN
                         Would you go upstairs and, and check 
                         on the children for me?

               Jill is violently shaking her head. John silences her with a 
               gesture.

                                     CAROL
                         Sure. Hold on.

               Carol O.S. puts the phone down. Then there is silence on the 
               other end. The crowd of people around Jill and John begin to 
               shuffle and murmur. John tries to keep them quiet while 
               listening into the phone.

               Then TWO POLICEMEN come forward through the crowd. One of 
               them kneels down to John and Jill who are still on the floor.

                                     POLICEMAN #1
                         What seems to be the problem here, 
                         sir?

                                     JOHN
                              (whispering)
                         Officer, I'm John Lockhart. Just a 
                         second please, and I'll explain 
                         everything.

                                     JILL
                              (whispering to 
                              Policeman)
                         I'm Jill Johnson, the babysitter 
                         seven years ago with the child killer.

               This means nothing to Policeman #1.

                                     JOHN
                         The babysitter. The guy got into the 
                         house and killed the two children 
                         upstairs.

               Policeman #2 kneels down now.

                                     POLICEMAN #2
                              (whispering)
                         Oh, yeah, I remember something about 
                         that. A Greek doctor...

                                     JOHN
                         That's right. That's the one.

                                     POLICEMAN #2
                              (to Policeman #1)
                         It was in the seventh precinct...

               As the two policemen and John mumble between themselves, 
               Jill takes the telephone.

                                     JILL
                              (listening)
                         Hello?

               She presses the receiver tighter to her ear.

                                     JILL
                         Carol?

               John quiets down the policeman. Jill can now hear what she 
               couldn't a second ago.

                                     JILL
                              (growing hysterical)
                         Carol? Carol?!

               ZOOM into the telephone until we can also hear what Jill is 
               reacting to. It grows louder and louder... A dial tone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LOCKHART HOUSE - NIGHT

               John and Jill pull up in the station wagon followed by a 
               squad car -- no sirens or lights. They all get out and rush 
               for the front door.

               John pulls out his key to open the door... and discovers 
               that it's unlocked. Cautiously, they step inside.

               INT. FRONT HALL

               They look into the living room. Carol isn't there.

                                     JOHN
                         Carol? Carol?

               No answer. The policemen tentatively draw their guns. Jill 
               bolts up the stairway.

                                     JOHN
                         Jill!

               Policeman #2 runs up after her.

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALL

               As Jill runs down to the children's bedroom followed by 
               Policeman #2. She opens the door and rushes inside.

               INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM

               The children are in bed, asleep. Policeman #2 stands in the 
               doorway as Jill goes up to June and bends over her.

                                     JUNE
                              (opening her eyes)
                         Mommy?

               Jill kisses her gently on the forehead.

                                     JILL
                         Sshhh...

               June closes her eyes and immediately falls back to sleep. 
               Jill walks over to Stevie's bed and looks down at him. He 
               turns slightly in his sleep.

               Satisfied that her children are safe, Jill pulls up the covers 
               on Stevie and then walks slowly out of the bedroom.

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALL

               Jill quietly pulls the door shut, and Policeman #2 walks 
               back up the hallway. Jill leans against the wall and buries 
               her face in her hands. She is drained. She starts to cry.

                                     JOHN (O.S.)
                         Nothing was wrong?

                                     CAROL (O.S.)
                         When I got back to the phone, the 
                         line was dead. I figured we got cut 
                         off somehow. What's been going on?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Jill is sitting on a corner of the bed, looking at the floor. 
               John sits on the other corner, facing away from her, slowly 
               unbuttoning his shirt. After a long silence...

                                     JILL
                         What are you thinking about?

                                     JOHN
                         If I ever get my hands on the guy 
                         that made that call...

                                     JILL
                         John, it wasn't a prank. I know that 
                         voice.

                                     JOHN
                         He disguised it though, didn't he? 
                         Same as before?

                                     JILL
                         I know that voice.

               Pause.

                                     JILL
                         How can we just sit here?

               John turns and moves over beside her.

                                     JOHN
                         Look, we promised never to talk about 
                         this.

               REACTION SHOT of Jill. She is shocked.

                                     JOHN
                         What are we supposed to do? Leave 
                         town? Take the kids and lock ourselves 
                         up somewhere? Come on... Let's get a 
                         good night's sleep, and in the morning 
                         we can rethink this whole thing.

                                     JILL
                         Nothing has to be rethought. And I'm 
                         not about to fall asleep.

                                     JOHN
                         Try to relax, honey. I'm here. We're 
                         both here. The house is locked up. 
                         The cops'll be just outside all night 
                         long. We're safe now.

                                     JILL
                         That's what they told me before.

               John stands up and goes to his dresser.

                                     JOHN
                         Okay. Look. If it'll make you feel 
                         any better...

               He takes a revolver from the dresser drawer and emphatically 
               checks the action. Then he walks to his side of the bed and 
               sets the pistol on his bedside table.

                                     JOHN
                         I'll keep it right here beside me 
                         all night. You know I'm a light 
                         sleeper and a damn good shot. Are 
                         you satisfied?

               Pause. Jill tries to smile.

                                     JILL
                         John, I'm sorry to be putting you 
                         through all this.

                                     JOHN
                         Hey, you're not putting me through 
                         anything that you don't have to go 
                         through yourself. I'm with you all 
                         the way. Trust me. Okay?

               Jill nods. John leans forward and kisses her.

                                     JOHN
                         That's my girl.

               He gets up and walks out of the room talking.

                                     JOHN (O.S.)
                         Now try to relax. We'll get some 
                         sleep. You'll be surprised how 
                         differently things will look in the 
                         morning.

                                     JILL
                              (complaining)
                         Honey...

                                     JOHN (O.S.)
                         What?

                                     JILL
                         Not so loud. You're going to wake 
                         the children.

               John comes back into the bedroom with a glass of water and a 
               couple of pills in his hand.

                                     JOHN
                              (smiling)
                         Naw. Those kids'd sleep through an 
                         earthquake. They're good kids.
                              (handing her the pills 
                              and water)
                         Here, take a couple of these. They're 
                         just what the doctor ordered.

               CLOSEUP - JILL

               As she takes the pills and swallows them, one at a time.

                                     JOHN (O.S.)
                         You know, I read somewhere about 
                         this psychological thing called 
                         hysterical delusion or hysterical 
                         recall or something. It had to do 
                         with how an event from your past can 
                         sneak up on you sometimes and fool 
                         you when it's only just a memory. I 
                         don't know. We'll talk about it in 
                         the morning. Maybe there's someone 
                         we can see about that...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

               The lounge area in the back of the station. At one table, 
               three OFFICERS are playing bridge. Garber with his back to 
               CAMERA rounds out their game.

               At a nearby table closer to CAMERA, Policeman #1 is working 
               on a crossword puzzle. POLICEMAN #3, sitting next to him, is 
               reading a paperback novel.

                                     POLICEMAN #1
                         What's a word for "an outsider, of 
                         sorts"?

                                     POLICEMAN #3
                         Trespasser.

                                     POLICEMAN #1
                         Uh-uh. Eight letters.

                                     POLICEMAN #3
                         Stranger.

                                     POLICEMAN #1
                         Uh-uh. Starts with an "I".

               Policeman #3 thinks briefly, then goes back to his novel. 
               Policeman #2 enters the room carrying a printout of some 
               sort.

                                     POLICEMAN #2
                         Hey, Bert. A report just came in on 
                         that guy, Curt Duncan.

               ANGLE ON GARBER

               At the bridge table, perking up his ears, looking around.

                                     POLICEMAN #2 (O.S.)
                         Broke outta the nuthouse two months 
                         ago.

               Garber is keeping only half an eye on the card game. He pulls 
               a card from his hand and throws it down.

                                     POLICEMAN #1 (O.S.)
                         Oh, yeah? You going to put that in 
                         our report?

                                     OFFICER #1 (O.S.)
                         Diamonds, Charlie. Diamonds was led.

               Garber hastily picks up his card and throws down another.

                                     POLICEMAN #2 (O.S.)
                         Course I'm going to put it in the 
                         report. Maybe this gal tonight really 
                         did get a call from him. Who knows?

                                     OFFICER #1 (O.S.)
                         Your lead, Charlie.

               Garber throws down another card.

                                     OFFICER #1 (O.S.)
                         What the hell are you doing? That's 
                         a trump.

                                     OFFICER #2 (O.S.)
                         A card laid is a card played.

                                     POLICEMAN #1 (O.S.)
                         Yeah, you're right. We'd better leave 
                         that on Ruznik's desk in the morning.

                                     OFFICER #2 (O.S.)
                         Toss 'em in. I got the rest.

                                     OFFICER #1 (O.S.)
                         Jesus Kay-Reist!

               Garber throws down his cards. He stands up and approaches 
               Policeman #2.

                                     GARBER
                         Hey, Tucker, lemme see that a minute.

               Policeman #2 hands the sheet of paper to Garber. Garber 
               quickly scans the information.

                                     GARBER
                         You guys have a stake on the house?

                                     POLICEMAN #2
                         Bernstein and Waller are checkin' it 
                         every twenty minutes or so.

                                     GARBER
                              (handing back the 
                              sheet)
                         Thanks.

               Garber exits to his office. Policeman #2 walks over to where 
               Policeman #1 is still sitting, working the crossword.

                                     POLICEMAN #1
                         Hey, what's an eight letter word for 
                         "an outsider, of sorts"? Starts with 
                         an "I".

                                     POLICEMAN #2
                         Intruder!

                                     POLICEMAN #1
                         Right! Intruder!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GARBER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Garber sits thinking for a moment. He is trying to come to a 
               decision. He reaches for the phone and dials. It rings and 
               then is picked up.

                                     CLIFFORD (O.S.)
                         Hello?

                                     GARBER
                         Cliff?... I think I got something 
                         for you...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOCKHART HOUSE - NIGHT

               A shot of the downstairs hall. All is dark and still, very 
               still.

               INT. BEDROOM

               Jill is tossing in her sleep. John is fast asleep next to 
               her, on his side facing away from her. Then, Jill wakes up. 
               She is heavily sedated, groggy. She hardly knows where she 
               is at first.

               She pulls herself up to a sitting position on the side of 
               the bed. She tries to gather her wits. Then she gets up and 
               walks slowly out of the room.

               FOLLOWING JILL

               Through the upstairs hallway, down the staircase and toward 
               the kitchen. The darkness around her is ominous, threatening.

               She stops at the dining room window and looks out. On the 
               street a patrol car slowly passes and disappears down the 
               block.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Jill enters, turns on the light, opens a cupboard and takes 
               out a glass. She goes to the refrigerator and opens it. 
               Suddenly, the lights go out.

               Jill closes the refrigerator door and goes and turns on 
               another light. Apparently, only a lightbulb has blown. Jill 
               unscrews the burned-out bulb from its socket and throws it 
               in the trash.

               She leaves the kitchen.

               INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL

               Jill walks to a hall closet and opens it. A light comes on 
               inside as she does so. A puzzled, half-startled expression 
               comes onto her face.

               JILL'S POV

               Inside the closet, half the hangers with coats, etc., are on 
               the floor.

               Sound over: A telephone being dialed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CLIFFORD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Clifford has just finished dialing the phone. He waits, 
               nothing happens. Then a strange, siren-like noise comes out 
               of the telephone. Clifford listens, then hangs up.

               He picks up the .38 he has lying on the desk and idly starts 
               flipping the cartridge chamber with one of his jimmy needles. 
               After a moment, he lays the gun down and picks up the phone 
               again, this time calling the OPERATOR.

                                     OPERATOR (O.S.)
                         Operator.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Can you dial a local number for me?

                                     OPERATOR (O.S.)
                         What is the number, please?

                                     CLIFFORD
                         555-2183.

               The operator dials. There is a pause. Then the same strange 
               noise cuts in.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Operator, what does that mean?

                                     OPERATOR (O.S.)
                         I'm sorry, sir, that line seems to 
                         be disconnected.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Why don't I get a recording?

                                     OPERATOR (O.S.)
                         I don't know, sir. Maybe the number 
                         was just recently disconnected. Maybe 
                         there's a temporary malfunction in 
                         the wiring. Why don't you try it 
                         again in the morning?

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Yeah, okay. Thanks.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOCKHART HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Jill is walking down the hall to the children's bedroom. She 
               opens the door.

               INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM

               As Jill quietly enters. The children are asleep. Jill goes 
               to June and tucks her in. Then she walks over to Stevie's 
               bed. He is sleeping, but with a Sugar Daddy in his hand. 
               Jill looks down at him, again puzzled. She leans over, takes 
               the Sugar Daddy and gently wakes him.

                                     JILL
                         Stevie... Stevie...

                                     STEVIE
                              (stirring, but not 
                              fully awake)
                         Yes?

                                     JILL
                         Stevie, listen to me. Where did you 
                         get this candy?

                                     STEVIE
                         What?

                                     JILL
                         Where did you get this?

                                     STEVIE
                              (very groggy)
                         The man gave it to me...

                                     JILL
                         What man?

                                     STEVIE
                              (drifting off)
                         I don't know... He was... Wings on a 
                         horse...

               He closes his eyes and is asleep.

               Jill stands up, turns and starts to walk out of the room. 
               Halfway across the floor, Jill stops. She stands rigid as a 
               thought penetrates her own drowsiness. She turns very slowly 
               and moves to the closet in the children's bedroom.

               She stands before it a moment. Then she reaches her hand 
               forward for the knob on the closet door. She very slowly 
               pulls the door open. She looks inside. There is nothing.

               Jill quietly closes the closet door and leaves the room.

               INT. BEDROOM

               Jill enters. John is still asleep facing the wall. Jill gets 
               into bed, sitting up. She is wide awake now. She sits for a 
               moment in the darkness, thinking.

               Then she reaches for the princess phone on the bedside table. 
               She doesn't get a dial tone. She quietly pushes the phone's 
               disconnect button up and down several times. Still no dial 
               tone.

               Jill hangs up and thinks for another moment, apprehension 
               creeping over her face.

               Then, in the darkness of the bedroom, she begins to hear the 
               muttering of a man's voice, low and deep. It is Duncan in 
               the throes of Guy du Marraux.

               Jill freezes. As the voice gets steadily louder and more 
               menacing, her attention focuses on the door to the bedroom 
               closet which is a couple of inches ajar.

                                     JILL
                              (urgently whispering)
                         John?... John?...

               She reaches for the bedside lamp and turns it on, never taking 
               her eyes away from the closet door. As soon as the light 
               comes on, the voice stops.

               Her eyes still riveted to the door, Jill grabs her husband's 
               shoulder and shakes him, her voice cracking with fear.

                                     JILL
                         John!... John!...

               The body beside her stirs, rolls over, looks at her hideously. 
               It is Duncan!!

               Jill shrieks, and makes a move to leap out of the bed.

               Duncan, the hideous and terrifying sound of his madness 
               grumbling out of his throat, manages to grab the back of her 
               nightgown.

               As Jill struggles to get off the bed, the gown rips slightly 
               while she fights to get away.

               Duncan rolls to her side of the bed and manages to grab Jill's 
               ankle while letting go of the gown. It causes Jill to lose 
               her balance and tumble onto the floor just short of the 
               doorway leading out of the room.

               Duncan is on her in a flash, clutching at her and moving his 
               hands for her throat. Jill screams again. It is the desperate 
               sound of a woman facing certain death.

               Suddenly, two quick shots ring out, overwhelming all other 
               sound. Duncan falls back with a groan and a thud.

               Out of the darkness of the hallway steps Clifford, pistol in 
               hand. He crosses to Duncan. He is dead. Then Clifford walks 
               around the room to the far side of the bed and looks down.

               On the narrow strip of floor between the bed and the wall 
               lies John. Clifford nudges the body with his foot. John stirs, 
               as if he has been knocked unconscious, but it will be some 
               time yet before he comes to.

               Clifford starts to walk out of the room, stepping over 
               Duncan's body, edging past Jill who is propped up in the 
               doorway, sobbing hysterically.

                                     CLIFFORD
                         Your husband's okay.

               Then he is gone.

               As Jill sits there unable to rein in her emotions, June and 
               Stevie toddle up to her groggily from the hallway.

                                     JUNE
                         Mommy?

               Jill clutches her children to her heaving breast and buries 
               her face between them.

               INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL

               Looking through the open front doorway into the quiet night 
               beyond.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

1   INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - DAY                              1

    A GIRL'S FACE

    fills the screen, twenty-one years old, pensive, pretty.

    Camera lingers on her in CLOSE UP, noticing details: hair
    worn stylishly messy, no makeup, double-pierced ears (though
    no earrings today), the corner of her bottom lip a little
    frayed where she's been chewing it ruminatively.

    She's the kind of beauty who can withstand such bad lighting:
    institutional lighting, florescents HUMMING overhead, joining
    the chorus of ambient noises: a COUGH, papers RUSTLING, the
    SCRIBBLE of a pen, someone SHIFTING in their chair, etc. The
    shot lingers until it becomes uncomfortable, invasive,
    scrutinizing this unhappy girl in an unguarded moment, then -

    A new sound breaks her reverie, a muted BUZZING o.s., and her
    eyes cut down to -

    HER CELLPHONE

    skittering sideways across the closed cover of her blue final
    exam book, like a bug. She has an INCOMING TEXT MESSAGE.

                                                 WIDEN TO REVEAL:


2   INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - ESTABLISHING - DAY               2

    Our GIRL is just one of two hundred other STUDENTS filling a
    big auditorium-style lecture hall. Around her, classmates
    sit grim-faced, scribbling to beat the clock.

                                                         BACK TO:

    OUR GIRL traps the buzzing cellphone before it skitters right
    off the edge of the half-desk, looks at the display.


    INSERT CELLPHONE DISPLAY -

                                 u done?!

    BACK TO SCENE

    Our girl leans back a little in her seat, gives a little nod
    to her friend seated across the lecture hall. Types a reply.

                                   yes

    INTERCUT: CELL PHONE DISPLAY / OUR GIRL

    She looks down as her friend text-messages:

                          how r u getting home?
    Typing.

                                   bus
    She sends the message, a moment later the reply appears:

                                 sux 4 U
    She glances up, sees her friend shoot her a sympathetic look.

                        PROCTOR (O.S.)
              That's it, people! Wrap it up!

    There's a collective GROAN and the sound of two hundred
    panicked asses twisting in their seats.

    Our girl feels her phone buzz, looks down to see a final text
    message from her friend:

                     y don't u check the ride board?
    A slow smile lights up her face at the idea, as all around
    her students rise and begin stampeding out.

                        PROCTOR (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  (shouting to be heard)
              Test results will be posted on the
              Philosophy Department's web site in
              two weeks... Enjoy your break and
              have a Happy New Year.

    She gathers her things, begins to make her way down the
    stairs when -

                          GIRL
              Hey!

    - she's JOSTLED from behind by a CLASSMATE bolting past her.

    She hands in her exam book, waves to her friend, and exits.

3   EXT. NEW ENGLAND UNIVERSITY - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY               3

    Campus is a ghost town, most students having already left for
    the holidays: the DORMS abandoned, the LIBRARY STACKS empty,
    the LABS silent, the DINING HALLS eerie.

    Our GIRL hurries across the deserted college green dotted
    with little hillocks of snow from an earlier storm. She
    passes a forlorn pine tree decorated with CHRISTMAS LIGHTS,
    on her way to...


4   EXT. UNIVERSITY - QUAD - DAY                                    4

    She arrives at a large, partially-enclosed KIOSK covered with
    dozens of student-made notices, printed in a rainbow of eye-
    catching computer fonts and colors. A sign at the top reads:
    RIDE BOARD.

    She scans the posted notices. One catches her eye: torn
    hastily from a spiral notebook, on which is scrawled a
    handwritten message:


                  NE1 Need a Ride 2 Delaware 12/23?
                           Call 607-154-9835
    A gust of wind riffles the notice.

5   EXT. UNIVERSITY - STUDENT PARKING LOT - DAY                     5

    Our girl wheels her suitcase across a largely-empty parking
    lot. It's late afternoon, and already dark enough for the
    sodium vapor streetlights to have come on. A few snowflakes
    swirl in their sickbed glow.

    We follow her to...

    A beat-to-shit 1988 OLDSMOBILE idling in the middle of the
    lot. An unbroken dusting of snow indicates it's been the
    only vehicle here for some time.

    An underclassman GUY, 19, is asleep behind the wheel of the
    Oldsmobile. He's skinny, dressed in thrift-shop clothes, has
    the complexion of someone who doesn't get out in the sun
    much. His car is filled with all of his earthly possessions:
    books, CD's in plastic milk crates, dirty laundry, etc.

    She knocks on the driver's side window, startling him awake.

    He stirs, blinks uncomprehendingly at the empty parking lot.

                        GIRL
              Do you think you could have parked
              any further from the entrance?

    The sight of her quickly snaps him awake.   He scrambles out.

                        GUY
                  (still a little groggy)
              There were still cars when I got
              here. I thought we were going to
              get an early start to stay ahead of
              the snow?

                        GIRL
              What time is it?

                        GUY
              Quarter past three.

                         GIRL
               I'm two hours late?! Shit. Sorry.
               You should've just left without me.
               That's what I would've done. Hurry
               up and pop the trunk so I can stow
               my shit.

    He does.

    She walks back to the trunk, which is stuffed to capacity
    with more of his things: CLOTHES, a bag of GROCERIES, etc.

                         GIRL (cont'd)
                   (calling to him)
               Jesus, I'm just going home for
               Christmas. What are you doing?
               Pulling up stakes and movin' your
               Oakie family to Californey?

    She starts rearranging the trunk, making room for her bag.

                         GUY
               I'm kinda getting kicked out of my
               apartment. I didn't have time to
               find someplace new before exams.

    She takes out some of his things.   Puts them on the ground.

                         GUY (cont'd)
               Here, let me help you with that-

                         GIRL
               Why don't you just get the engine
               started and put the heat on? I can
               handle this.

    He watches her rearrange his things, a little flummoxed.

                         GIRL (cont'd)
                   (smiling)
               Well? What are you waiting for? I
               thought you wanted to stay ahead of
               the snow?

    He hurries back to the driver's seat.   Starts the engine.

    She hurriedly crams everything back in and slams the trunk.
    Then runs around to the passenger side and pulls on the door
    handle.

    Stuck.

         Now it's her turn to look impatient. She jerks on the handle
         again, until he leans over to open the door from the inside.

                             GUY
                   Sorry... it sticks.

         She rolls her eyes, climbs in.


6        INT. OLDSMOBILE - DAY                                           6

         She climbs in, tries to power her window all the way to the
         top. It keeps getting stuck, leaving a half-inch gap.

         She shoots him a look: "What the hell?"

                             GUY
                   That's as far as it goes.   Sorry.

         She rolls her eyes, never once interrupting her phone
         conversation.

         He puts the car in gear and they set out on their six hour
         roadtrip.

         As they drive off, reveal: a forgotten bag of GROCERIES,
         still sitting on the ground.


8        INT. OLDSMOBILE - DAY                                           8

         They leave campus.   He eavesdrops as she rattles on.

                       (on her cell)

     She looks out at the passing landscape as they cruise south
     on the interstate. The road is wet, though the snow hasn't
     yet started to stick.

                         GIRL
                   (laughs; on her cell)
               What, are you kidding? I'm bored to
               tears... No, we're still on the
               highway... how should I know, all
               highways look exactly alike.

     She looks up, catches him shooting irritated looks her way.

                         GIRL (cont'd)
               What?

                         GUY
               You going to be on that thing the
               whole-

     He doesn't finish the thought, just chokes back whatever he
     was about to say. Focuses on the highway ahead.

               Uh oh, somebody's upset. I better

               Who do you think? Ride Board Guy.
               Okay, `bye.

     She hangs up, aims the camera phone lens his way, and snaps
     another digital picture of him.

     She puts the cellphone away, looks up to see him glaring at
     her.

                            GIRL (cont'd)
               What?

               This isn't cool. If I have to

               What, I'm the in-flight

               That's how this ride-sharing thing

               much more entertaining than when
               I'm on the phone.

     He darkens, mutters under his breath:

                         GUY
                   (sarcastic)
               This is turning out great.

                         GIRL
               What's that mean?

                            GUY
               Forget it.

     They ride in silence for a moment. She tries to strike up a
     conversation, by way of extending an olive branch.

     They drive for a few moments in silence.

     He looks at her expectantly, as if she should remember him.

                          GIRL
               What? There were about a million
               people in that class. It was like

     She hoots with laughter. But he's not kidding.   He seems
     surprised by her response.

                         GUY (cont'd)
               You aren't majoring in philosophy?

                          GIRL
               No. Why?

               Why would you assume anything about
               me? We just met.

     She enjoys the pained look of surprise on his face, lets him
     twist for a second before explaining:

                          GIRL (cont'd)
               I only took Philosophy because I
               need a humanities credit. I heard

               on the final?

                         GUY
               Nietzsche's theory of eternal
               recurrence.

               Which is basically reincarnation,
               right?

               No, they're not really the same
               thing. Reincarnation is when you
               come back as something different

               He died of syphilis, you know.

     He stares grimly at the road ahead, biting back a comment.

     Its interior light is on.

     Her bare feet are propped on the dash, as she removes the old
     nail polish.

     Widen. She's turned the front seat into a nail salon.
     Cotton balls, emery boards, bottles of clear and colored
     varnish are strewn everywhere.

     She picks a bottle, opens it, begins painting her nails.

               Well, yeah, they do... But there's
               definitely peeling involved too. I

     A florescent oasis in the gathering dark. A tow truck and
     several old wrecks rusting in the weeds surrounding it.

     The Oldsmobile pulls off the highway and up to a gas pump.

     around his neck.

     Unsettling as the deeply-weird moment is, she decides it's

                         GUY
               Okay.

     He crouches so she can slide off. She gives him a look,
     slips on the pair of flip-flops she's brought with her, then
     heads off in search of the ladies bathroom.

     Meanwhile, our guy saunters up toward the front of the
     convenience store. He nods to the twitchy CLERK, 20s,
     engrossed in a tattoo fetish magazine behind the counter.


17   INT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - BATHROOM - THAT MOMENT                17

     The toilet is gross, tiled a queasy green, graffiti-covered.

     Our girl finishes peeing, gets up from the toilet, uses her
     foot to flush and her elbow to turn on the faucet. She
     washes her hands, holding them under the automatic dryer.

     Broken.

     She wipes her hands dry on her jeans. Is about to exit when
     she catches sight of her reflection in the dirty mirror.

     On impulse she takes out her glasses from her purse.   Slips
     them on. Checks herself out in the mirror.

     Cool? Sexy?

     With her glasses on she notices something scratched into the
     dirty mirror.

     CLOSE ON MIRROR

     Where we see:

                        "J.C.R. 12-24-88 R.I.P."

     She frowns, slips her glasses back in their case and moves to
     exit. But when she grips the doorknob she finds it LOCKED.
     She frowns. Rattles the doorknob a few times.

     A look of panic crosses her face, and she starts rattling the
     doorknob harder. Did someone lock her in?

     Suddenly the doorknob comes off in her hand.

     She pounds on the door with the heel of her palm, shouts:

                          GIRL
                HEY. HEY, I'M LOCKED IN HERE!

     Nothing.

     She turns, scanning the filthy bathroom, notices something.

     HER POV:

     A VENT above the sink, near the ceiling.

     BACK TO SCENE

     She puts a foot up into the sink, testing it to see if it can
     take her weight. Then climbs up and straightens on wobbly
     legs, until her face is near the filthy dust-clogged vent.

                          GIRL (cont'd)
                    (calling into vent)
                HEY. CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME?! HEY!

     Her voice ECHOES weirdly. When the echoes die down she hears
     something from the vent that makes her scowl: LAUGHTER. As if
     our guy and the clerk are having a good laugh at her expense.

     Pissed off now, she climbs back down, and attacks the broken
     doorknob with renewed urgency.

     And finally succeeds in getting the door to open.


18   INT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - OUTSIDE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS         18

     As she exits she sees the CLERK and our guy talking quietly,
     as if they know one another. She hesitates for a second,
     spying on them around a display of chips. Suspicious.

     AT THE COUNTER:

     She strides up as the guy pays for the gas and a couple
     bottles of water.

                         GIRL
               Didn't you hear me banging in
               there?

                         GUY
                   (startled; puzzled smile)
               When?

                         GIRL
               You think it's funny? Me locked in?

                         GUY
               Locked in where?

                         GIRL
               You're telling me you didn't just
               hear me banging on the door?

                         GUY
               I don't know what you're-

                         GIRL
                   (cuts him off)
               Forget it. Let's just get on the
               road.

     He gathers up the bottled water, heads toward the door.    The
     clerk calls to him:

                         CLERK
               Remember, highway's your best bet-

                         GUY
                   (dismissive)
               Don't worry about it man, I got it
               all covered.

     She frowns, following him to the exit.

               No, I've made this drive a million
               times.

     He holds the door for her, then follows her outside.


19   EXT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - CONTINUOUS                         19

     As they exit and start toward the car she offers him a
     twenty. He looks at the money, as if he's never seen U.S.
     currency before.

                         GUY
               What's that for?

                         GIRL
               My half of the gas.

                          GUY
               Keep it.

                         GIRL
               What do you mean? Isn't that how
               ride-sharing works? -- We split
               everything fifty-fifty?

                         GUY
               I don't take money from friends.

     Since when are they friends?

     They separate, walking around to their respective sides of
     the car. She tries the passenger door handle, only to find
     it stuck.

     She stares out at the road ahead, lulled by the sound of the
     windshield wipers sweeping snowflakes from side to side.

     HER POV:

     A nondescript exit comes up fast for a side road. Which
     wouldn't be cause for alarm or even interest except-

     He suddenly turns the wheel sharply, taking the exit.


22   EXT. OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT                                    22

     The car veers off the interstate onto a much smaller two-lane
     road marked with a simple sign, paint-on-wood, faded to
     illegibility: Scenic Route 606.

     The tires crunch across an old chain which had once prevented
     access to the road but is now half-buried in the snow.

     Attached to it is a diamond-shaped warning sign of a more
     modern vintage reading: Rough Road.

     She falls against him, bracing herself against the dash.

                          GIRL
                What the hell are you doing!?

                Relax, I checked it out on the map.
                It looks interesting.

     He looks a little pissed she's questioning his judgment.

                         GUY
               Will you chill. It's a shortcut.
               We'll be back on the highway before
               you know it.

     Hard to argue with a shortcut...

     Nonetheless, she glances back with a look of trepidation OUT
     THE BACK WINDOW at the highway receding into the distance.


24   EXT. SCENIC ROUTE 606 - NIGHT                                    24

     The Oldsmobile cruises by, the only car on the two-lane
     scenic highway.

     As it leaves FRAME camera PANS to the dead grass on the
     roadside where it finds a sad little SHRINE half-buried in
     the snow: two homemade crosses, candle stumps, a rotting
     stuffed bear, deflated Mylar balloons.

     Scrawled on the crosses are:

     She watches him suspiciously out of the corner of her eye.
     His face is eerie in the green light of the dashboard.

     He scans the radio dial for something other than static.

                         GUY
               Not many radio stations out here.

                         GIRL
               We're in a valley. FM radio waves
               travel in a straight line. They
               can't penetrate big obstacles like
               hills. Try AM.

     broadcasting Bobby Helms' 1957 "Jingle Bell Rock."

               dinners...two sets of presents to
               return for store credit. So
               normally I can deal, but this year
               mom decided to rent a condo at the
               beach. Which is like, what? Two
               hours away.

               Over where? There's no shoulder.

     He's right. On the passenger side the road abuts a steep
     wooded hillside. Opposite that it drops off into a ravine.

     They are both too distracted by the ONCOMING HEADLIGHTS to
     notice the Christmas SONG that's just come on the RADIO:

30   EXT. ROUTE 606 - THAT MOMENT                                     30

     The OTHER CAR continues barrelling toward the OLDSMOBILE.
     The game of chicken fast approaching the point of no return.

     Relief turns to dread as they realize the other car isn't
     slowing.

                         GIRL
               He's not stopping!

                            GUY
               Hold on!

     He jerks the wheel hard, sending the Oldsmobile fishtailing
     out of control.

     The OTHER CAR skids over a small bridge and drops out of
     sight.

     They spin out in the opposite direction. Skid off the road
     and SLAM into a snowbank with a bone-shuddering CRASH.

32   EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT                                 32

     The Oldsmobile has ended up on the opposite roadside facing
     the wrong way, its driver's side jammed into a snowbank.

     Snow boils in its headlights.


33   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT                                 33

     The interior is dark.

     The girl has been thrown under the dash. It's hard to tell
     in this light whether she's still breathing.

     Finally she stirs, disoriented.

     She climbs back into her seat, piecing together where she is.
     It takes her a beat to remember him. She looks over slowly.

     He's not moving, though thanks to his seatbelt he's still
     upright behind the wheel. His head rests limply against the
     driver's window, which now looks out on nothing but snowbank.

     A link of blood trickles down the glass.

     Dead?

     She's not taking any chances. Without a sound she slips into
     her shoes, coat. Gropes for her cellphone among the detritus
     at her feet.

     Suddenly he stirs, groaning.

     She freezes.

     The seconds ticking by on the DASHBOARD CLOCK.

     When he doesn't wake, she resumes fumbling for her cell.

     Finds it.   Then eases open the creaky passenger door.

     And launches herself into the frigid night.


34   EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT                      34

     She hurries down the road away from the car. Breath clouding
     in the frigid air. Punches in numbers on her cell phone.

     No SIGNAL BARS.

     She's starting to freak now.   She hits the REDIAL button.

                         GIRL
               ... please... please... please...

     Suddenly, from behind --

                         GUY (O.S.)
               What are you doing?

     She screams, spins around.

     He's standing right behind her, his face in silhouette.

                         GIRL
               C-Calling 9-1-1. Or trying to.

                           GUY
               Any luck?

                         GIRL
                   (shakes head `no')
               Can't... I can't get a signal here.

     He receives this news with a strange calm.

                         GIRL (cont'd)
               What about yours?

                         GUY
               I don't have a cell.

                         GIRL
               How can you not have a cell?

                         GUY
                   (ignoring her)
               How're you doing? You all right?

                         GIRL
               I... yeah, I'm okay. Nothing
               broken... What about you?

                         GUY
               I don't know. Think I hit my head.

     He puts his hand to the left side of his skull and pushes on
     it. Like someone testing a melon for ripeness.

     Come to think of it, his speech is a little wooden.

     She watches as he turns and takes a few aimless steps away.

                         GUY (cont'd)
               What happened to the, uh, the guy?

                         GIRL
               Who?

                         GUY
               Asshole who ran us off the road.

     She's completely forgotten all about the other vehicle until
     now. She turns to look, puzzled.

     There's no sign of the other vehicle anywhere. They're alone.

                         GIRL
               I don't know. I guess maybe he
               decided just to hit and run.

                         GUY
               So where are his tire tracks?

     She looks, sees an unbroken expanse of fresh white snow.

                         GIRL
               In case you haven't noticed, it's
               coming down pretty hard.

                         GUY
                   (points)
               Yeah, but you can still see our
               tracks.

     The mystery of the missing tracks seems to have penetrated
     his post-accident fog, bringing him back into sharper focus.

     She watches as he walks out in front of the Olds' headlights
     to the middle of the road, where the other vehicles track's
     should be.

                         GUY (cont'd)
               What the hell?!

     He walks back to the Olds and opens the passenger door (the
     only access into or out of the stranded car, thanks to the
     snowbank). He begins searching the glove compartment for a
     flashlight.

     ANGLE ON HER

     Deliberating whether to seize this moment of distraction to
     make a break for it.

     She looks back down the long dark road.

     Looks back at him bent over rummaging in the Oldsmobile.

     Too risky.

     Curiosity getting the better of her, she walks out to the
     middle of the road to have a look for herself.

     No tracks.

     Just an expanse of fresh powder and a few of his footprints.

                            GIRL
                      (to herself)
                  This doesn't make any sense...

     At that moment he emerges from the car with a flashlight. He
     spokes it, sweeps the strong beam over their surroundings.

     The left side of the road falls off into a darkness so deep
     even the flashlight's beam can't penetrate it. A precipice.

     He cups his hand and calls out at the top of his lungs.

                            GUY
                      (calling)
                  HELLO!

     She jumps at the sound of his voice, her nerves frazzled.

                            GUY (cont'd)
                      (calling)
                  ANYBODY OUT THERE!? ANYONE?! HEY!

     His voice is swallowed by the dark. After the echoes subside
     the only sound in the hush is the SIZZLE of falling snow and
     a weird otherworldly HUM.

     He snaps off his flashlight, thrusts it into his coat pocket.

                              GIRL
                  What now?

               I guess we see how bad we're stuck.

     They trudge back to the car, boots crunching in the snow.

                         GUY (cont'd)
               You steer, I'll push.

     He holds the passenger door for her while she scrambles in,
     scooting over into the driver's seat. He leaves the door
     open so they can communicate.

     He walks back to the rear of the stranded Oldsmobile.

     He's pulling on gloves when something half-buried in the snow
     nearby catches his eye. He takes out the flashlight, shines
     it at the roadside.

     Little wooden crosses.

     Just two this time. Another sad shrine, to a different set
     of anonymous victims of Route 606.

     Their proximity to the stranded Olds obviously unsettles him.

                   (calling)
               Ready?

     He bends with a little wince and braces his shoulder against
     the rear bumper.

                         GUY
                   (calling)
               Ready!

     The tail lights come on as she turns the ignition.   He hears
     her crank the starter motor.

     Cranking... cranking... cranking...

     Finally turning over.

     She slips the Oldsmobile in gear, and he starts pushing.

     The rear tires spin, throwing slush; but car won't budge.

                         GUY (cont'd)
                   (calling)
               Give it more gas!

     She floors it; the tires SCREAMING.

     He puts everything he's got into pushing, but it's no use.

     Suddenly his face contorts in pain and he clutches his side.
     He drops out of view, disappearing in a cloud of red exhaust.

     A beat later he pulls himself up, pounds on the trunk.

                            GUY (cont'd)
                  Stop!

     The tires stop spinning.

     She's sitting in the driver's seat of the idling car when she
     hears the crunch-crunch-crunch of his approaching footsteps.

     In that moment she makes a decision.

     Scrambles across the front seat, pulls the door shut hard.


36   INT./EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT                       36

     He arrives at the passenger side door handle just as the
     power locks all go THUNK.

     He's locked out.

                            GUY
                  Hey, open up.

     He tugs at the handle a few times.      Knocks on the window.

                  You wanna pop the locks?

     When there's no response from her he puts his lips to the
     half-inch gap at the top of the stuck window.

                            GUY (cont'd)
                  You gonna unlock the door or what?

     She sees him cup his hands and peering in through the window.

     She keeps her eyes down, focuses on her shaking fingers as
     they frantically dial her cellphone.

     No signal.

               Exactly.

     He straightens, exasperated, puts a hand to his injured head.

     She looks at him standing there, hugging himself against the
     sub-zero cold, his teeth chattering. He doesn't look like an
     ax-murderer.

     She doesn't know what to do. There's a long beat. Finally,

     Sticking his fingertips through the half-inch gap at the top
     of the stuck passenger side window.

                           GUY (cont'd)
                 ... I keep duct tape in the back.

                     (sarcastic)
                 I bet you do.

     He looks in at her one last time, exits.

     She listens to the crunch of his footsteps until she can't
     hear them anymore.

     Suddenly there's a loud BANG against the passenger side
     window. She jumps.

                           GUY
                 BUT IT'S MY CAR!!

     He goes crazy on the stranded Olds: punching the roof,
     jerking the door handle, kicking the door, screaming at her
     the whole time.

     She cowers inside, scared to death.

     Finally he gives up, and with a final BANG to the roof,
     exits.

     He turns and heads back down the road.

     We watch through the rear window as he trudges robotically
     away, his boots crunch-crunch-crunching in the snow.

     He stops.   Leans his weight against a tree.    Looks back at
     the car.

     Whatever it is he's doing, he's clearly not walking to the
     gas station.

     He straightens, and continues on until he's out of sight.


37   EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT                      37

     The stranded Oldsmobile sits on the roadside, engine running,
     hood and windshield covered in white. The interior lights
     are on, giving it an enchanted look, like a cottage in a
     Grimm's fairytale.

38   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT                                38

     She's in the back seat ransacking his suitcase and other
     possessions, looking for the duct tape. Despite the heater
     it's cold enough in the car (thanks to the gap in the window)
     to see her breath.

     A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT plays on the car's radio.

                         RADIO PSA
               ... The National Weather Service
               has issued a Winter Storm Warning
               for the entire Eastern Seaboard...
     Boxer shorts. Socks. Box of condoms. A copy of the Tibetan
     Book of the Dead. A cheap Radio Shack TELEPHONE wrapped in
     its cord. A CROW BAR, which she tosses up to the front seat.

                         RADIO PSA (cont'd)
               ... Carbon County residents can
               expect snow accumulations of four
               to six inches...
     Suddenly we see -

     A BLUR OF MOVEMENT outside the car's foggy REAR WINDOW...

     But she's too busy searching through the junk in the back
     seat to notice.

     Finally she finds what she's looking for: silver DUCT TAPE.

     Also a PAIR OF SCISSORS.

     She holds the scissors like a dagger, clearly thinking they
     could come in useful if she needs to defend herself.

     She climbs up front, rips off a three-foot length of tape.

     Again, in the b.g. -

     MORE MOVEMENT outside the car...

     But she's too busy sealing the passenger's side window
     against the frigid draft to notice that someone's outside.

               as wind chills plunge to fifteen
               below overnight...
     Finally -

     She glimpses MOVEMENT outside the passenger window.

     She gasps, ducking out of sight below the car's dashboard.

     She doesn't move, listening, her eyes bright with fear.

     After a long beat she risks a peek over the steering wheel.

     The windshield is fogged, so she wipes a peephole in the
     condensate. It's too dark to see much beyond the car's hood.

     She reaches shaking fingers toward the steering column.

     Flicks on the headlights.

     A STRANGER is walking away down the middle of the dark road.

     She screams, reaches instinctively to check the power locks.

     The stranger, a black man dressed in a dirty suit, walks with
     hunched shoulders. Snow swirling around him in the darkness.

     Who the hell takes a stroll in the middle of a snowstorm?

     Over her initial shock now, she reaches for the door handle.


39   EXT. ROUTE 606 - ROADSIDE - NIGHT                               39

     She gets out of the car, clutching the SCISSORS in both hands
     like a dagger. She stands behind the protection of the open
     car door and calls out to the stranger moving down the middle
     of the snowy road a dozen yards ahead.

     There's a weird HUMMING noise in the air she can't place.

                           GIRL
                 Hey!

     No reaction from the stranger.

                           GIRL (cont'd)
                 Hello? Do you live around here?

     Again, nothing.    Maybe he's deaf?

     She moves out from behind the safety of the car door and
     starts after the stranger, keeping her distance as she calls:

               We had an accident. My friend went
               for help. He'll be back any second.

     The stranger's dapper suit is more than dishevelled. It's
     soaking wet, caked in motor oil or some other dark slime.

                         GIRL (cont'd)
               Kinda crappy night for a walk,
               don't you think?

     And there's something definitely "off about his shuffling.
     It's like he's crippled, or injured. In fact he seems to be
     CRYING. (Or is it moaning?)

                            GIRL (cont'd)
               Hey, wait!

     But the stranger just keeps shuffling toward the shoulder of
     the road, headed in the direction of the DARK STAND OF TREES
     beyond. Soon he moves beyond the reach of the headlights and
     disappears into the gloom.

                         GIRL (cont'd)
               What the hell - !?

     Spooked, she begins to back toward the stranded Oldsmobile.

     Backs into -

                            GUY
               Hey.

     She SCREAMS.

                         GUY (cont'd)
               Jesus! Calm down. It's just me.

                         GIRL
               Stay away from me!

     She brandishes the SCISSORS.    He puts up two hands
     defensively.

                         GUY
               Whoa! Take it easy. What's wrong?

                         GIRL

                         GIRL
               I don't know, it was weird. I saw
               some guy walking down the road.

                         GUY
               Where did he go?

                         GIRL
               I don't know. Into the woods.

     Her eyes keep cutting back and forth between him and the
     woods where the stranger disappeared, as if not sure which is
     the greater threat.

                         GUY
               Look. It's freezing out here. Let's
               just get in the car and you can
               tell me what happened...

                   (paranoid)
               What are you doing back so soon?
               What about hiking to the gas
               station?

                         GUY
               It was closed. I was going to leave
               a note, but I didn't... You know.
               Have anything to write with.

     She clutches the scissors tighter, not believing a word.

                         GIRL
               But those places are supposed to
               stay open 24/7! Why wasn't it open?

               Independent operator. Look, can we

               off standing out here.

     He closes his eyes and shakes his head, beyond frustrated.

               Fine. Whatever. I'm getting in.
               You're welcome to join me.

     He turns and trudges back to the Oldsmobile, climbs in, and
     pulls the door shut after him. Leaving her there in the
     snowy road, clutching the scissors, her teeth chattering.

     She stands there, shivering, looking very small and alone.

     HOLD on her as she weighs her options: stay out here and
     freeze. Or risk seeking shelter with a stalker.

     Not much of a choice.


40   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - MOMENTS LATER                         40

     He looks over as the door wrenches open and she climbs in.

     She pulls the door shut behind her, then huddles against it.
     Eyeing him warily.

     He starts to reach toward her and she brandishes the scissors-

                         GUY
               Relax.

     - and switches off the overhead interior lights, explaining:

                         GUY (cont'd)
               We need to conserve the battery.

     With the interior light off the car fills with an otherwordly
     blue glow reflected off the snow. She pulls her knees up as
     if trying to make herself as small as she can, to position
     herself as far away from him as is humanly possible on a
     bench seat.

     Her eyes cut to the DASHBOARD CLOCK.    She frowns.

                         GIRL
               That's not right. The clock...

                         GUY
                   (checks watch)
               Huh? No, it's not. It should
               read...

     He frowns, looking down at his watch.    He holds it to his
     ear.

               My watch stopped. Oh well... Guess
               we'll just have to rely on my
               precisely calibrated body clock.

     He tosses his useless watch over his shoulder into the back
     seat.

     Suddenly she notices a trickle of blood coming from his head.

                         GIRL
               Hey.

                         GUY
               What?

                         GIRL
               You're bleeding.

     He touches two fingers to the left side of his head. They
     come away bloody. As he lifts his watch cap we see the left
     side of his head is matted with frozen blood, now beginning
     to melt. The collar of his coat is soaked with it.

                         GUY
               It's nothing...

                         GIRL
               It doesn't look like nothing.

                         GUY
               Scalp wounds bleed a lot. Head
               wounds in general. That's why, if
               you're ever in a bar fight, the
               thing to do is pick up a bottle and
               smash the other guy across the
               bridge of his nose. It'll make his
               eyes fill with blood and snot, and
               buy you enough time to run away.

                         GIRL
                   (softening, amused)
               That's really useful, thanks.

     A tense silence fills the car. He closes his eyes and leans
     his head back, as if trying to catch a few Z's.

                         GIRL (cont'd)
               So where are you from, really?

     She looks at him, the pieces all finally falling into place.
     He makes no effort to explain. Doesn't even open his eyes.

                            GUY
                      (bitter)
                  Forgive me for attempting a
                  romantic gesture.

                            GIRL
                  Romantic? Try stalkerish.

                            GUY
                  Not if things worked out between
                  us...I would've told you everything
                  eventually, and then it wouldn't be
                  stalkerish. It would just be this
                  sweet funny story we'd have.

                            GIRL
                  We?!

     He sits up sharply, temper boiling over, glaring at her.

                         GUY
               Okay, you've made your point! I'm a
               creep who gets off on chauffeuring
               women under false pretenses. Can we
               drop this already?
                   (changing subject)
               Christ. I'm starving. You hungry?

     He leans over the seatback, begins rummaging in the back.

                          GUY (cont'd)
               Did you see a bag of groceries in
               the trunk?

     At mention of groceries she temporarily drops the topic of
     the gas station. Remembers:

                         GIRL
               No. Oh, shit. I think I might've
               left it in the parking lot.

                           GUY
               What?!

                         GIRL
               I'm sorry. It was an accident-

                         GUY
               Shit! I spent sixty bucks on this
               gourmet crap you like! Saint
               Andre's cheese and Carr's crackers
               and those stupid little French
               pickles, I forget what they're
               called-

                         GIRL
                   (quietly)
               Cornichons... I love cornichons.

     He sighs, slumps back behind the steering wheel, defeated.

                           GUY
               I know.


43   EXT. ROUTE 606 - ROADSIDE - NIGHT                                43

     The wind blows.    In between gusts it's quiet, except for the
     strange HUM.

     She's still huddled up front, still holding her scissors.

     He's in the back seat, scouring the car for anything edible,
     scrounging Tic Tacs, stale pretzel nibs, a candy bar, etc.

                            GUY
                  I think I remember losing pack of
                  Big Red down the back seat cushions
                  last week...

     He thrusts his hand between the seat cushions like a scuba
     diver feeling for lobster under a coral reef.


     DOWN THE BACK SEAT:

     His hand fumbles in the dark space below the seat cushions,
     among the seatbelts, lost nickels and dimes, lint.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Suddenly his eyes go wide as something lurking under the
     seats seizes his hand and jerks him in hard.

     She GASPS.

     His face contorts in agony.

     Then changes to a smile, as he pulls his hand free, unhurt,
     holding a stick of gum.

                             GUY (cont'd)
                  Kidding.

     She looks at him in mute fury and disbelief. He shrugs,
     unwraps a stick of Big Red and pops it into his mouth.

                             GIRL
                  Asshole.

     Suddenly his hand shoots out and seizes her wrist holding the
     scissors. Her eyes go wide in terror and she starts to
     resist, but his grip is too strong.

                            GUY
                      (gritted teeth)
                  Let go, goddamnit...

               Give them to me!

                         GIRL
               No!!!

     With his free hand he reaches over and wrenches the scissors
     away from her, his eyes flashing. She gives a little
     terrified whimper as he pulls her close, brandishes the
     scissors.

                         GUY
               I need these.


45   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - LATER                               45

     With the blade of the open scissors he divides a stale candy
     bar, divvying it up.

     He closes the scissors. Serves up the two halves of candy
     bar on napkins with a side of stale pretzel nibs.

                         GUY
               I still can't believe you left all
               our food in a stupid parking lot.

                         GIRL
               Look, I'm sorry, okay? I'll write
               you a check for sixty bucks if it
               will make you get off my case. I
               don't know what else I can say.

                         GUY
               Let's just eat.

     They eat in silence, each chewing the unappetizing "dinner."

                         GUY (cont'd)
                   (to himself)
               Story of my life. Never fails...

               What?

                         GUY

               first.

                          GIRL
                What the hell are you talking
                about?

                          GUY
                You should all come with a warning,
                like car mirrors: "Objects in belly
                shirts are flakier than they
                appear."

                          GIRL
                You want to talk about fake? How
                about guys who pretend to be from
                Delaware to meet girls?

                          GUY
                How about we just stop talking
                altogether.

                          GIRL
                That's perfect. Because now that
                I'm not some Nietzche-spouting
                sexbot, suddenly I'm not worth
                knowing. And who's fault is that?

     He doesn't answer, only withdraws into himself, sulking.

     All of a sudden the Oldsmobile gives a SHUDDER.

     And then the engine DIES.


46   EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT                      46

     They leap out to investigate, dropping down on all fours to
     shine the flashlight under the chassis.


     HER POV:

     Under the car. The beam illuminates a yellow crater of melted
     snow beneath the car's undercarriage.


     BACK TO SCENE

     She reaches under to scoop up some of the yellow snow.
     Retrieves it so she can hold it under her nose and sniff.

                          GUY
                Well?

               Oh shit.

                         GIRL
               Fuel tank must've been ruptured in
               the accident.

                         GUY
               Can you fix it?

                         GIRL
               Not unless you have a welding rig
               in all that shit of yours. And even
               if you did, it wouldn't matter.
               We're out of gas.

                         GUY
               But we still have the battery,
               right?

               As long as we use it sparingly, it

                         GUY
               What do you mean?

     She gives him a sober look, as the storm rages around them.

                         GIRL
               No engine... no heat.

     He looks at her, a look of grim determination on his face.
     He marches to the car, pops the trunk.

     Retrieves her suitcase.


47   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT                                   47

     He dumps her suitcase in front.    She climbs in after it.

     Slams the door.

                           GUY
               Layers...

     He rolls into the back, fishes his suitcase out of the mess.

               Only thing that's gonna get us to
               sun-up. So put aside fashion sense
               and start layering everything you
               brought.

                         GIRL
               But I didn't bring anything.

     He raises an eyebrow, leans over the front seat to unzip her
     suitcase and see for himself.

     Christmas gifts, skimpy tees, panties and bras, a bikini.

                            GUY
               Ah, Jesus.

                         GIRL
                   (defensive)
               I'm sorry, but who could prepare
               for something like this?! I've got
               a complete winter wardrobe, it's
               just in Delaware... And no, that
               doesn't make me a flake!

     He unzips his suitcase.      Starts pulling out Ragg socks, long-
     sleeve pullovers, etc.

     He shoves a ball of clothes into her hands without a word.

     The kids have retreated to the front- and back seats for
     privacy while they change. Not an easy proposition in the
     cramped quarters.

     She strips down to bra and panties as demurely as possible.
     Puts on his insulated underwear and the rest of their things.

     He slips on his woefully inadequate shirts and pants. It's
     obvious he gave the warmest stuff to her. Also that he took
     the backseat because it's more cramped than the front.

     Once they're finished dressing he reaches up, switches off
     the interior light.

     They lie in the blue darkness for a few moments of silence,
     watching their breath plume in the cold air. [Note: from this
     point on, their breath will always be visible in the car.]

     He hears her sigh, restless.

                         GUY
               What's the matter?

                         GIRL
               I'm freezing. I can't feel my toes.

                         GUY
               Me neither.

     Nothing much they can do about it.   They fall silent again.

                         GUY (cont'd)
               You know, there is a better way for
               two people to conserve body heat-

                            GIRL
               Dream on.

     But we see her smiling a little in the dark front seat.

     They lie in silence for another beat as she tries every
     position possible to get comfortable. Finally she sits up.

                            GUY
               What?

                            GIRL
               Gotta pee.

     She starts to climb over into the cramped front seat,
     intending to go outside. He winces when she puts a hand on
     his chest to steady herself as she climbs over him.

                         GUY
                   (testy)
               Why didn't you go before, when we

                         GIRL
               Because it's freezing out. We're
               talking about an arctic air mass
               out of Canada.

               Promise not to look.

     She pops the door and exits.


50   EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT                      50

     She climbs out into the bitter cold, hunched against the
     howling wind, and moves off as far as she dares from the car.

     She fumbles with the buttons and zippers of her multiple
     layers, turns her back to the car, squats to pee.

     Her teeth chatter as she does her business, one wary eye
     peeled to catch the guy peeking.

     Suddenly, out of the gloom appears -

     A DARK FIGURE, moving by very near her.

     She GASPS. Tumbles back onto her ass.     As she's struggling
     to pull up her pants -

     MORE DARK FIGURES appear, moving in the same direction.

     As the figures enter the woods their leader turns so she
     glimpses his face: elderly and unremarkable at first glance,
     then for an instant CHANGING into a twisted ashen deathmask.

     Her SCREAM brings our guy BOLTING out of the car.

                         GUY
               What?! What happened?!

     But it all happened so fast she doesn't believe her eyes.
     She gestures at the procession of DARK FIGURES disappearing
     ahead.

                         GIRL
                   (still in shock)

     Our guy ducks back into the car, retrieves a flashlight from
     the glove compartment.

     He eases the door shut, carefully so it doesn't latch and
     accidentally lock them out.

     The he starts off running after the figures. Scared as she
     is, she decides to follow rather than remain at the car by
     herself.


51   EXT. ROUTE 606 - FURTHER DOWN ROAD / TOP OF A RAVINE - NIGHT 51

     The two kids arrive at the place on the road -- top of a
     ravine disappearing thirty feet below -- where the dark
     figures seemed to be headed.

     Only to find NO ONE THERE.

                          GIRL
                Where'd they go?!

                          GUY
                There!

     She looks where he's pointing with the flashlight-

     HER POV:

     On the wooded slope on the opposite slope of the ravine are
     SEVERAL TALL OLD MEN IN DARK COATS, dispersing through the
     woods. As if whatever somber occasion that brought them to
     the ravine has ended.

                          GUY (cont'd)
                    (calling)
                Hey! Wait! We need help here!

     Climbing down into the ravine seems too treacherous, so the
     kids are forced to backtrack to a place several yards away
     where they can follow the DARK FIGURES into the:


52   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                               52

     They follow the bobbing beam of the flashlight through the
     trees, in pursuit of the OLD MAN in black coat and fedora.

     Our guy falls behind, winded.

               Gotta - just a sec - catch my -

                         GIRL
                   (still unnerved)
               Maybe we should go back to the car.

                         GUY
               No! There must be a house or
               something. Keep going. I'll catch
               up.

                         GIRL
                   (reluctantly)
               Okay.

     She trudges on ahead, her footsteps growing FAINTER, finally
     fading entirely.

     He's alone now.

     He leans against a tree to catch his breath, wincing in pain.
     For an instant it seems like he's going to be sick. But then
     he just hocks up phlegm and spits into the pure white snow.

     Blood.

     Though still winded, he pushes on.


53   EXT. HILLTOP - NIGHT                                              53

     A few minutes later he trudges into view.   Looks around.    No
     sign of our girl.

                         GUY
               Hello? Hello?

     He arrives at the top of the hill.   Silhouetted against the
     night sky. Treeless.

     His flashlight finds the few vertical objects still standing.

     A RUINED BUILDING

     Windowless and long-abandoned, its ceiling and walls caved in
     around a large stone chimney.

     He crunches inside and examines the black maw of the large
     stone fireplace, now stuffed with trash and dead leaves. His
     flashlight beam finds a SMALL IRON DOOR built into the side
     of the chimney.

     A FIREBOX.

     He kneels in the snow and tugs the little iron door open.

     Gingerly slips his arm inside the firebox.

     Retrieves a bunch of OLD NEWSPAPERS. He stuffs them inside
     the front of his jacket. Continues rummaging around in the
     firebox.

     As he rises he winces in pain, one hand going to his side.

     He takes slow breaths until the pain subsides.

     He turns in a slow circle. His flashlight sweeps over the
     interior of the abandoned ruins, the beam picking out what
     look like branches -

     HUMAN HANDS

     frozen into claws, reaching from...

     A FROZEN BODY.

     It's lying on the bare springs of a metal bedframe: teeth
     clenched in a terrible rictus, icicles dripping from nose,
     clawlike fingers, eyes.

     He's so startled he nearly drops the flashlight.

     The wayward light finding ANOTHER FROZEN CORPSE in a nearby
     bed mere feet away: another rictus grimace, clawlike fingers
     seeming to reach for him. And then another. And another...

     All OLD MEN.

     Frozen in their death throes, like the bodies from Pompeii.

     ONE OF THE BEDS is EMPTY.

     Our guy sweeps the flashlight beam to the side and finds the
     bed's occupant: frozen sitting upright in an old wooden
     wheelchair.

     Eye to eye with him.

     He reels in horror, trips, LOSES THE FLASHLIGHT as he goes
     sprawling. Then recovers, snatching the flashlight up again
     and sweeping it back in the direction of the frozen bodies -

     And sees NOTHING:   No beds.   No old men...

54   EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - THAT MOMENT               54

     Our girl emerges from the trees, having decided to give up
     the chase and return to the safety of the car.

     Just as she's reaching for the door handle she GASPS -

     As a FIGURE suddenly appears out of the darkness.

     It's the black STRANGER from earlier, shuffling and mumbling.
     This time he's close enough for her to make out some of the
     words he's muttering:

                            STRANGER
                  ...please, officer, please don't...

                            GIRL
                  Wait!

     Determined not to let him vanish again, she takes off in
     pursuit, coming alongside him and keeping pace as he shuffles
     down the middle of the road.

                            STRANGER
                  ...don't put me in the river...

     Suddenly she glances down, sees why he's shuffling so oddly.

     His ankles above his sodden dress shoes are bound with BALING
     WIRE, as are his wrists.

                            GIRL
                      (shocked)
                  Oh my god! Who did this to you?!

                            STRANGER
                  ...please, officer, just take the
                  booze and let me go...

     She reaches toward him.

     The instant her hand nears him the wind HOWLS DEAFENINGLY.
     She experiences a sudden powerful JOLT, almost as if she's
     grabbed a live wire... only instead of electric heat she
     feels a terrible otherwordly cold...

     Frostbite.

     The jolt stuns the stranger out of his daze, and for the
     first time he becomes aware of her. He raises his frightened
     eyes to her slowly, and in doing so reveals his face.

     A scream builds in her throat at sight of him.

     The stranger's face is bloodless, bloated, swollen with rot.

     A sludgy gargling noise comes from his throat and his mouth
     moves, as if he's trying to speak.

     But instead of words emerging, his throat suddenly bulges.
     Something's in there, fighting its way up his esophagus.

     She watches in horror as it emerges, blind and wriggling like
     a blood-fattened leech. Forcing its way out through his lips
     to land at his feet with a wet PLOP.

     It lies there writhing in the fresh snow.

     A river eel.

     She SCREAMS.

     POV of our guy running blindly through the woods, FLASHLIGHT
     BEAM throwing weird bouncing shadows across the trees, boots
     CRUNCHING in the snow, sound of his GASPING BREATHS...

     He stops, wracked with pain, and doubles over with hands on
     knees to catch his breath.

     In the silence he hears her SCREAM coming from ahead.

     He stands, and though still winded, starts running again.

     Our guy emerges from the woods still carrying the newspapers
     he found in time to find our girl white with shock and
     SCREAMING. He grabs her by the shoulders, shakes her.

                         GUY
               It's okay! You're okay! It's okay!

     Her screams give way to hyperventilating sobs.

     Suddenly he looks down, notices her blackened mitten on her
     right hand. The palm is blistered and raw. He takes her

     Pan down to the road, where something moves weakly under the
     fresh powdering of snow.

     The RIVER EEL, in its death throes.

     They climb back inside. He pulls the old newspapers out from

     the passenger door shut.

     The duct tape has come loose, allowing a cold draft in
     through the cracked window.

     takes him a beat to understand. Then he crawls over to her,
     and they spoon together in the front seat, finding their best
     fit.

     Any awkwardness quickly passes.

     They lie there, too frightened to sleep.

     KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK --

     Someone is outside, knocking on the Oldsmobile's window.

     They both jump, startled. He glances up into the rearview
     mirror, sees HEADLIGHTS behind them and a RED FLASHING LIGHT.

     wearing a trim-fitting uniform and a stiff-brimmed trooper's
     hat.

     The kids speak over one another in their relief to see him.

                         GIRL
               Thank God! You don't know how glad
               we are to see you...

                         GUY
               ...you won't believe what's been
               happening...

     The cop listens without comment, shining his flashlight over
     the car's interior.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
               Having car trouble, huh?

                         GIRL
               Someone ran us off the road.

     He shines the flashlight directly in our girl's eyes.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
               There's no parking here.

                         GUY
               What are you talking about? We're
               not parking here. Didn't you hear
               what she said? Someone ran us off-

               ...Of course I might be willing to
               let you off with a warning this
               time... if we can come to some sort

                         GUY
               What are you talking ab-

     The girl, quicker to catch on than the guy, puts a hand on
     his arm.

                          GIRL
                    (whispers)
               It's a shake-down. He's probably
               partners with the guy who ran us
               off the road. Wouldn't be surprised
               if he has a deal with the tow guy,
               too.

     He turns to her, says in an angry whisper -

                         GUY
               You think this whole thing was a
               scam? Jesus, he could've killed us!

     But she's already digging cash out of her purse.

                         GIRL
                   (fierce whisper)
               How much cash do you have on you?

     He looks at her in disbelief. Sees that she's serious. He
     digs out his wallet, starts to climb over her to exit. She
     stops him.

                         GIRL (cont'd)
               How many speeding tickets have you
               sweet-talked your way out of?

     He concedes her point silently. She plucks the money from his
     hand. Opens the door.

     She exits the stranded car into the frigid cold.

     The cop waits, facing away, in the spotlight-like glare of
     his IDLING PATROL CAR's headlights.

     She walks back toward him, finds him mopping the back of his
     neck with a handkerchief.

                         GIRL
               This is all we have.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
               Some weather we're having...

                         GIRL
               Yeah, it's really coming down.
                   (indicating the money)
               So what do you say? How `bout a
               little Christmas spirit here?

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                   (still facing away)
               You know, this is one bad stretch
               of road. All kinds of trouble going
               on up here: Kids drag racing.
               Niggers hauling booze across the
               state lines. Lady drivers breaking
               down, no-one ever hears from them
               again...

     Her bravado begins to flag. This isn't the kind of police
     officer she's used to dealing with. She glances worriedly
     back in the direction of the Olds.

                         GIRL
               We just want to get out of here, so
               if you could just-

     She holds out the money, but he ignores it.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
               Let me tell you, I've seen a lot of
               fatalities on this road...

     He takes off his hat so he can mop his brow. As he turns,
     she gets a first good look at his face: handsome but hard,
     with cruel snake charmer's eyes looking back at her...

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd)
               You're lucky I came along when I
               did. So why don't we get in my
               car...

     She's scared now.

     She looks past him to where the HIGHWAY PATROL car sits
     idling in a red plume of exhaust fumes.

                         GIRL
                   (backing away)
               I think maybe I just want to go
               back-

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
               YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE!

     She startles as if slapped, too horrified to parse his
     meaning.

     She continues backing away until she's backed up against the
     trunk of the Olds.

                         GIRL
               No...

     The cop is advancing toward her when suddenly he catches
     sight of something high on the hillside behind her that makes
     him stop.

     She glances over her shoulder to see what he's looking at:

     A LIGHT on the hilltop, where the burned-out ruins stand.
     And weirder still, there's a FIGURE in silhouette standing
     nearby.

     Someone watching.

     The cop darkens, enraged by this unwanted audience. His face
     contorts, fury building in him until he trembles with it. He
     rests his hand on the butt of his service revolver, says to
     her in a low urgent voice:

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
               Get in the damn patrol car...

     She starts walking toward the parked patrol car ahead of him.

     The highway patrolman's boots CRUNCHING behind her.

     The patrol car's HEADLIGHTS are blinding. She moves towards
     them, squinting, as if moving down a tunnel of light.

                         GIRL
                   (terrified; beginning to
                    cry)

                     (begging)
                 But we didn't do anything! Please!

                 Get away from her you bastard!

     Suddenly the guy appears brandishing a CROWBAR.

     He swings it in a lethal arc toward the patrolman's head.

     The cop's head crumples inward. The cop's expression of FURY
     suddenly STUTTERS, like film slipping in the projector -

     As two worlds that should never intersect, do, violently -

     For an instant, the cop's face appears...charred. Like a
     human face projected onto a scorched and melting balloon.
     The image flickers -

     And on an ear-splitting HOWL we -

     Suddenly, jarringly, the kids are seated BACK INSIDE THE CAR.

     As if someone hit RESET.

                           GIRL
                     (stunned)

                     (unsure)
                 But it did happen, right? Or not...

     Our guy winces in pain.     TILT DOWN to reveal:

     HIS HANDS

     Frostbitten, still clutching the crowbar. She tries to take
     it out of his bloody, blackened hands and he GASPS in agony.

     and break the seal between the fused skin and metal.

                         GIRL (cont'd)
               OK, hold on, this is going to hurt.

                           GUY
               Do it.

     She fights her own gag reflex as she pulls the crowbar free.
     It comes away with several long black strips of dead skin
     still attached. His palms are bloody pulps.

     He fights to hold himself together as she ministers to him.
     The pain is so bad it brings tears to his eyes. His teeth
     chatter; he's teetering on the edge of shock.

                           GUY (cont'd)
               How bad?

                         GIRL
               Frostbite, second and third-degree.

                         GUY
               How do you know? You take a first
               aid course or something?

     She stretches herself out alongside him in the back seat.

     Tugs up her layers of sweaters to expose her stomach.

                   (weak)
               I'm kinda not in the mood anymore.

                         GIRL
               We have to rewarm your hands. You
               have ice crystals in your blood. If

               you could lose your fingers.

     She takes his frostbitten hands and gingerly as possible
     presses them against the warm skin of her belly, rewarming
     them.

     They lie there in silence for a beat, faces inches apart.

               Right?

               Yeah, but I mean really burn...

                         GIRL

               Tylenol-with-codeine in my purse.

     She climbs into the front seat and searches through her purse
     for the prescription bottle. With the poor light and without
     her contacts she has trouble finding it. She takes out her
     glasses and, a little embarrassed, slips them on.

                         GUY

     She's about to climb back when something catches her eye.


     INSERT OLD NEWSPAPER --

     The one used to patch the small gap in the passenger window.

     There's a faded PHOTOGRAPH of a group of ELDERLY PRIESTS
     gathered around a MANGLED `55 FORD CROWN VIC. We recognize
     one of them, glancing back over his shoulder at the camera,
     as the LEADER of the mysterious procession of DARK FIGURES
     from earlier.

     INTERCUT OLD NEWSPAPER / GIRL & GUY

                         GIRL (cont'd)
               Oh my god. I think I know who our
               old guys are... I mean, were...

     Below the accident scene photo are HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK
     PORTRAITS of TWO TEENAGE BOYS with crewcuts and letter
     jackets bearing a distinctive team insignia "The Cougars."

     Across the top of the paper is a torn headline: "North
     Granville Youths Killed In Joy Riding Accident" and below it
     "Cougars Coach Mourns Loss."

                         GIRL (cont'd)

                          GUY

     Suddenly, the interior light fizzles out, making her jump.
     She reaches up and taps on it until it flickers back on.

     She climbs over into the back seat, feeds him two of the
     Tylenol with a sip of water from a bottle. Then stretches
     out alongside him again.

     Both kids are asleep in the back seat.

     She's dreaming, her eyes roving behind closed lids.   All of a
     sudden she stirs, eyes fluttering open in the dark.   Shivers.

     Woken by a cold draft.

     She shivers, sits up, disentangling herself from the guy
     snoring quietly beside her in the cramped back seat.

     She locates the source of the draft.

     The STUCK PASSENGER WINDOW up front, where the duct-tape-
     newspaper patch has come loose. She shivers as a gust of
     wind blows a few snowflakes in.

     She grabs the roll of duct tape, climbs up into the front.
     Tears off a fresh strip of tape off to replace the old one.
     She smooths it in place, her teeth chattering between yawns.

     Just then the radio SNAPS on by itself.

               Rockin' around, the Christmas tree,

     She freezes.

     Her eyes cut to the backlit radio dial as the song continues.

               Mistletoe hung where you can see,
               ev'ry couple tries to STOP -
     The radio SHUTS OFF mid-song.

     She holds still, scared to move, scared to even breathe.

     Her eyes cut to the interior light as it starts flickering in
     a weird staccato way that's more Morse Code than loose wire.

     After a few seconds it stops.

     The seconds creep by on the dashboard clock.

     She peeks over the front seat looking out the back window,
     wondering where his highway patrol car is.

62   NIGHTMARE - EXT. `57 CHEVY / ROADSIDE - NIGHT (1958)             62

     ... and into a sweltering summer night in the late 1950s...

     What follows is brutal and hallucinatory: a SERIES OF SHOTS
     that thrust us into the sickening first person POV of a
     BLONDE young woman, 19, in the final moments of her life.
     The RASP of CICADAS in the treetops provide the only
     soundtrack to the assault, as we see:

     -- CLOSE ON their feet, high heels and boots, doing a violent
     two-step as he drags her along the gravel road shoulder

     -- HANDHELD footage as she's dragged toward his idling patrol
     car

     -- POV of a FULL MOON in the tree-tops, dispassionate
     spectator to the assault going on on this lonely stretch of
     road

     -- CLOSE UP of the COP'S MOUTH, twisted with lust as he
     whispers something obscene we cannot hear.

     -- CLOSE ON his HAND working it's way up to her throat,
     forcing his thick hairy thumb between her lips and making her
     suck.

     -- POV underneath his patrol car, as his boots kick her feet
     apart, and take up position between them

     -- The brim of his hat lifting to reveal him looking up with
     a scowl of surprise

     -- And the cop's scowl curdles into a look of outrage at
     sight of --

     -- SILHOUETTES of old men watching on the hilltop, roused by
     the commotion down on the road below --

     -- The cop wrenches open the back door of the car, hurls her
     in, slams the door shut.

     -- He shoots a warning look in the direction of the
     SILHOUETTES ON THE HILLTOP that says, "Don't fuck with me..."

     -- Then he climbs behind the wheel of his car and drives off.

63   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT                                63

     OUR GIRL's face as her eyes snap open and she bolts upright
     in the backseat, scaring the shit out of our guy.

                         GUY
               Thank god! You were having some
               kind of seizure or someth-

     He doesn't get to finish his sentence: Her eyes roll back in
     her head and she collapses again, as if yanked down by an
     undertow.

     She starts violently CONVULSING in the cramped confines of
     the back seat, limbs flailing, feet kicking windows, etc.

     Our guy tries everything to wake her: shaking her shoulders,
     slapping her face hard. But it's no use: the nightmare has
     her again.

     He sits back, helplessly looking on.

     Suddenly the radio SNAPS ON mid-song, scaring the crap out of
     him.

                         BRENDA LEE

               halls with boughs of holly"...
     The car's rear window brightens with APPROACHING HEADLIGHTS
     of a highway patrol car, it's strobe light flooding the
     Oldsmobile's interior with RED.

     From our girl's eyes going crazy in R.E.M.-pattern we--

      In a SERIES OF HALLUCINATORY SHOTS we see the BLONDE'S
      LIFELESS BODY -- shoeless, dress torn -- being dragged
      through the undergrowth and left in a secluded wooded spot.
      The COP kicks leaves and dirt over the body, then exits.

65    INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - AS BEFORE                            65

      CLOSE ON the RADIO, midway through "Rockin' Around the
      Christmas Tree..."

      Our guy listens to the CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH of the cop's
      boots outside in the snow, circling the snowbound Oldsmobile.
      Whistling along with the song that always accompanies him.

      Suddenly the dashboard air vents all OPEN SIMULTANEOUSLY.

      A gust of supernaturally frigid cold blows in, like the icy
      breath of Old Man Winter himself. White frost spreads with
      time-lapse velocity from the air vents across the dashboard.

      Our guy scrambles up front, slapping the air vents closed.
      Begins ripping off strips of duct tape to plaster over the
      vents to keep out the lethal chill.

      CLOSE ON OUR GIRL as her nightmare becomes even more violent-

      Another night, and a different victim. In a SERIES OF SHOTS
      we see: the black STRANGER pleading for his life as his
      WRISTS and ANKLES are bound roughly with baling wire by the
      COP. Ignoring the stranger's desperate pleas, the cop drags
      him by the bound wrists through the woods and shoves him down
      a muddy incline. He splashes facedown in a shallow stream.

67   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - AS BEFORE                             67

     And our girl finally surfaces from the dream as if coming up
     for air, with a huge GASP and eyes wild with fear. Only to
     find herself in a waking nightmare.

     The car interior flooded with red.    Our guy terrified.

                         GIRL
               What's happening!?

                         GUY
               It's him! Hurry! Help me!

     She climbs up front to help our guy frantically taping over
     the vents. A shadow moves by the WINDSHIELD and she gasps-

     As another shadow goes by in a blur past the BACK WINDOW and
     he gasps-

     The assault coming from everywhere at once now, the cop an
     elemental force, like the storm itself. Skittering along the
     undercarriage one moment, across the metal roof the next.
     Even appearing -- fleetingly, impossibly -- in the snow on
     the blocked driver's side window.

     All the electronics in the car start going crazy, power locks
     opening and closing, the interior light flickering, the
     dashboard clock hands spinning wildly, the windshield wipers
     sweeping back and forth, etc.

     Then stop all at once.

     Even the radio SNAPS OFF.

     Dead silence for a beat.

     Then an odd SCUTTLING SOUND underfoot, something crawling
     along the undercarriage of the car.

     Our guy sits there frozen with fear, too scared to move, to
     even breathe.

     Likewise, the girl sits nervously, watching her breath in the
     cold. Her eyes happen to wander to the rear view mirror-

     A blue-faced DEAD BABY stares back at her from the rear
     window ledge.

     She SWINGS around, looks back at the window.   But nothing's
     there.

     She turns back, he looks at her with concern. Unsure of her
     own senses, she shakes him off. Exhales slowly.

     Beat.

     Suddenly the scuttling noises outside EXPLODE into to a full-
     blown assault.

     There's the shriek of RENDING METAL, the thing outside begins
     HAMMERING at the car's hood, doors, etc.

     The car gives a violent shudder side-to-side tosses our kids
     around like plastic flakes in a snow globe.

     The radio snaps back on: the saxophone solo in the Brenda Lee
     song, accompanying the violent CLANGS and GROANS of metal
     being torn asunder as the thing under the car rips away
     muffler, brake lines, wrenches the handles from the doors,
     etc.

                         BRENDA LEE
               Rockin' around, the Christmas tree,
               Have a happy hol-i-day...
     Our guy claps hands over his ears so he can't hear the sound
     of the cop's rage as he attacks the car, fury growing and
     growing until it's indistinguishable from the HOWLING wind
     outside.

     The attack ends.

     The red police light in the rear window FADES.

     Leaving them sitting there in the dark in stunned silence.

                         GIRL
               What happened?

                         GUY
               I think... he's gone. I guess when
               he couldn't get in he gave up.

               I told you these `88 Olds were
               built like tanks!

     He turns around in the front seat to shake a bandaged fist at
     the rear window.

                         GUY (cont'd)
                   (nervous relief)

               Shhh! How do you know it's not a

                         GUY
               He's not! Listen!

               We just have to stay in the car
               until morning. Then we'll be safe.
               That can't be more than, like, a
               few more hours... Someone's bound
               to come along once the sun comes
               up... Someone human I mean. Think
               you can hold on until then?

                         GUY
               We can use the empty water bottles.
               From this point on, the back seat
               is a co-ed bathroom. Sound like a
               plan?

     Sounds like a plan.

                         GUY (cont'd)
               Why don't you try to get some
               sleep? I'll take the next watch.

     She shakes her head, eyes full of fear.

               I don't want to sleep.

     He nods, understanding.

     So they just hunker down in the front seat, staring at the
     snow covered windshield, and start the long wait to morning.

68   EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT                     68

     The snow is slacking off. The stranded Oldsmobile is now
     completely snowbound, a car-shaped hillock of white on the
     roadside.


69   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT                                69

     The interior of the car is eerily QUIET, cocooned in snow.

     The kids sit in silence in the front seat, fighting to stay
     awake. His face is pale, skull visible beneath the skin.
     She stares at the black, snow-covered windshield.

                         GIRL
               I gotta pee...

                            GUY

     She climbs over into the back seat and crouches down,
     urinating as demurely as possible into an empty bottle.

                            GIRL
                  I'm serious! It's hard enough doing
                  this in front of you.

                             GUY
                  What, are you one of those people

                            GIRL
                  No. But it's not something I
                  usually do until much later in a
                  relationship...

     She catches herself at the last second, but it's too late:
     the word "relationship" hangs in the air. Beat.

     Finished peeing, she twists the cap on the water bottle.
     Sets it on the floor with the other URINE-FILLED BOTTLES.

     Noticing ONE BOTTLE that doesn't look like the others.

     She climbs over into the front to confront him with the urine
     bottle, which is tinged with PINK.

     Blood.

                  What the hell is this? Is this

     No answer.

                  How badly were you hurt in the

     Suddenly he goes rigid in pain, his teeth clenched.   She
     looks on helplessly.

                         GIRL
               We've got to get you some help now.
               You won't make it to morning. I'm

     They sit there a moment in silence. She digs out her
     cellphone and checks for a signal: NO SIGNAL BARS.

               Damn it! We need a land line ...

     A long beat.

     Then she's struck by an idea.

     She switches on the wipers to clear snow from the windshield.
     Wipes at the foggy glass until she's got enough of a peephole
     to peek out.

                         GUY

                         GIRL
               Telephone poles. They must have a
               junction box or something to test
               the lines ... There! See that one?

     She indicates a TELEPHONE POLE twenty yards up from them.

     There's a SMALL GREY STEEL JUNCTION BOX near the top.

                         GUY
               So?

     She turns, leaning over the seatback to rummage among his
     junk in the back. She retrieves his old wall TELEPHONE,
     examines the jack at end of its cord.

     She keys the ignition, lowers the passenger side window.

     The duct tape rips away as the window glides down, admitting
     a mini-avalanche of powdery snow and a frigid blast of cold.

     She climbs out.

     And the iron rungs look a lot narrower, too.

     She's losing her nerve.

     She glances back to check no police lights are coming.

     The rungs are icy, forcing her to climb slower than she would
     like. She keeps her eyes forward, never once looking down.
     When the wind gusts she pauses and waits for it to subside.

     She's midway to the top when her foot SLIPS on an icy rung.

     She clutches the pole tightly, wind whistling in her ears.
     She waits until her heart slows and she's recovered from her
     near fall.

     Then looks up to gauge the distance left to the JUNCTION BOX.

     Keeps climbing.

     She reaches the last rung at the TOP OF THE TELEPHONE POLE.

     It's noisy up here, thanks to the WIND and the icy telephone
     wires, source of the mysterious HUMMING she's been hearing.

     She tries the little metal door of the grey JUNCTION BOX.

     Locked.

                         GIRL
               No!!!

     She fumbles in her coat, takes out the SCISSORS, uses them to
     try and pry open the junction box (which turns out to be
     frozen shut, not locked after all.)

     It finally yields, opening.

     Hurrying now, she tugs her glove off with her teeth, and with

     her sweater. In her effort to juggle all these items she
     loses her grip on the SCISSORS...

     Which drop all the   way down to disappear in the snow below.

     She concentrates now on the receiver.    But her fingers are so
     clumsy from the cold, she fumbles it.

     And the receiver FALLS too.

     Then jerks to a STOP a few feet below as it reaches the limit

                         GIRL
               Hello? Hello?

     The connection SPARKS and she feels a small shock that makes
     her drop the phone. When she retrieves it and holds it back
     to her ear the line is DEAD.

     No way of knowing if her message got through.

     It's a moment of such soul-crushing despair she shuts her
     eyes and leans her head against the pole, as if wanting to
     just quietly die up here thirty feet above the earth.

     Her eyes open, and she commences climbing back down to earth.

     She reaches the second set of rungs from the bottom and drops
     the last several feet. The snow does little to cushion her
     fall and she goes sprawling, lays there for a dazed moment.

     She starts crawling on all fours back toward the stranded
     Olds. Suddenly she stops as she comes upon-

     A WOMAN'S BARE FEET

     standing in the snow, veins visible through gravid skin.

     A thick spatter of mud lands on the bare foot.

     Our girl raises her eyes to see -

     A DEAD WOMAN

     It's the blonde we saw raped and murdered in the summer of
     1958. Her dress is in tattered ruins, coated in leaves and
     dirt like someone recently exhumed from a shallow grave.

     Her head is twisted at an unnatural angle on a broken neck.

     Our girl GASPS and scrambles to her feet, fleeing.

     Only to stop dead in her tracks as she nearly collides with-

     TWO DEAD TEENAGE BOYS

     The joyriding teens killed on Christmas Eve 1958.

     Both wear blood-soaked letterman jackets bearing the
     DISTINCTIVE COUGAR INSIGNIA and stand in a post-accident
     haze.

     One's chest is concave, stove-in by the impact with the
     steering wheel. The other's teeth are visible where his
     cheek has been torn away.

     She reels away in horror, forced to take the long way back to
     the Oldsmobile. She runs the last few yards to the car where
     we can hear the eerie sound of STATIC emanating from the
     radio as she hurls herself -


83   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT                                 83

     Inside.   Safe!

     She sits there, out of breath. She glances over quickly at
     our guy, gravely pale, slumped unconscious behind the
     steering wheel.

     She chafes her hands to get the circulation going again.

     She turns down the volume on the radio.

                           GIRL
                     (chattering teeth)
                 - I did it - got through - but I
                 don't know how much she understood -
                 the operator I mean -

     He doesn't respond.

                           GIRL (cont'd)
                 - Just have to hope - maybe - they
                 can trace the line -

     When this too gets no response from him she looks over,
     frowning. She scoots a little closer across the front seat
     toward him.

     Which is when WE SEE -

     HIS GHOST

     standing outside the car, slack-expressioned and staring.

     He stands there a beat, then drifts off into the night.

               Hang in there, can't be much

     She reaches to jostle him awake.    One touch confirms her
     worst fears.

     She reaches up to switch on the INTERIOR LIGHT, to get a
     better look at him.

                         GIRL (cont'd)
               Oh god!

     Her reaction is so sudden and violent and overwhelming it
     seems for a moment she's going to be sick. She covers her
     mouth, muffling a cry of raw-throated terror.

     Then shakes him again, harder this time, desperate to wake
     him.

                         GIRL (cont'd)
               No! Please! Don't leave me alone!

     Tears spill down her cheeks as she fights hysteria. She
     shakes him harder. His inert body spills to one side,
     slumping against her.

     Her grief turns to something else, instinctive and immediate:
     revulsion, at the feel of his cold dead weight against her.

     She scrambles across the front seat to put as much distance
     as she can between herself and the corpse.

     Cowers against the passenger door.

     The INTERIOR LIGHT flickers out as the battery finally dies.


84   EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - MOMENTS LATER                84

     The door opens and she backs out, hauling the dead body after
     her. Her face is red, tear-streaked.

                         GIRL
                   (crying)
               Sorry... sorry... I'm sorry...

     She strains to move his dead weight. Her feet slip on the
     ice and she lets go of him, catching herself on the open
     door.

     She grabs the body under the armpits, hauls with all her
     strength. Drags him a few yards away from the Oldsmobile.
     His boot heels ploughing twin gouges in the snow.

     Behind her, gravity pulls the heavy car door shut with a soft
     THUNK.

     Suddenly her feet go out from under her as she hits a patch
     of ice. She goes down hard on her ass, sprawling. Sits
     there a beat, as-

     HEADLIGHTS appear on the dark horizon.   We see them a split-
     second before she does...

     He's coming.

     When she glimpses the oncoming headlights out of the corner
     of her eye she turns her head slowly in their direction, and
     for an instant it almost seems as if they don't register.

     Then her eyes widen in terror, she lets out a small whimper,
     and leaps into action.

     She scrambles to her feet and makes a mad dash toward the
     Oldsmobile -

     Only to find when she tugs on the handle that it's STUCK.

     She yanks on it harder, getting frantic now, as -

     The HEADLIGHTS get brighter, bearing down, close enough now
     that we can hear the ROAR of the oncoming engine.

     She kicks the handle, tugs with all her might, rocking the
     car but not succeeding in getting the door open.

     As the headlights become BLINDING...

     Suddenly there's the sound of BRAKES being engaged, and the
     headlights slow to a stop just a few yards shy of where she's
     standing in the middle of the road.

     She shields her eyes with an upraised hand.

     It's a SNOWPLOW.

     The SNOWPLOW DRIVER, 50s, sticks his head out the window.

                         SNOWPLOW DRIVER
               You kids okay?

     She's too stunned to speak.

     The snowplow driver is a hale townie dressed like a high
     school principal on a hunting trip.

     He and our girl transfer our guy's lifeless body to the BACK
     SEAT of the snowplow.

     Inside the cab it's blessedly warm. The dashboard panel, GPS
     and CB radio are lit up like a Christmas tree.

     While the snowplow driver tests the front tire chains, our
     girl checks on our guy's body.

     The snowplow driver climbs up behind the wheel, gives her a
     sympathetic look. Picks up the C.B. microphone.

     The driver puts the snowplow in gear and sets off driving.

     Her eyes cut to the-

     Where she sees the STRANDED OLDSMOBILE receding in the
     distance.

     She stares blankly out the window at the snow swirling in the
     headlights.

     The snowplow driver makes small-talk to help pass the time.

               Been some real bad accidents on
               this road over the years. When I

     Their gaping mouths frozen open in a silent rictus scream.

               ... fire department had to hose
               them down with hot water for two
               hours to thaw them out. I remember
               back in high school there was a
               stupid rumor going around if you
               went driving out here on moonless
               nights and looked up in your
               rearview, you might see the dead
               baby in your backseat ...

     She frowns at this, reminded of her earlier vision.

     There's a metallic GROAN of hinges as the snowplow's driver's
     side door opens and the SNOWPLOW DRIVER, dazed but unhurt,

99   INT. WRECKED SNOWPLOW - THAT MOMENT                             99

     Our girl rouses from her post-accident daze. Sees the body
     of our guy thrown through the windshield. She eases it back
     inside and onto the seat beside her.

     She looks up in time to see through the windshield -

     The SNOWPLOW DRIVER making his way down the steep slippery
     ice-and-leaf-covered embankment.

     Her eyes go wide as she suddenly realizes where he's headed.

                         GIRL
               No!!!

     She unbuckles her seatbelt, throws open the passenger door,
     exits.

100   EXT. SNOWPLOW / ROADSIDE - NIGHT                               100

      The instant she sets foot outside she stops dead, the blood
      rushing from her face and her eyes going wide in disbelief.

      PAN 360-DEGREES to reveal a landscape she knows all-too-well:

      The stranded `88 Oldsmobile.

      The telephone pole she climbed.

      They haven't gone anywhere.

      No time to puzzle it out. The sound of the snowplow driver
      making his way down the embankment O.S. stirs her to action.


101   EXT. RAVINE - CONTINUOUS                                       101

      She starts down the steep snowy embankment after the snowplow
      driver, who is now far enough below to be out of sight.

                          GIRL
                    (calling down)
                Wait! Don't go down there! Stop!

      Suddenly the snowy leaves gives way under her and she SLIPS.

      Lands hard and SLIDES the rest of the way down on her ass.


102   EXT. BOTTOM OF RAVINE - CONTINUOUS                             102

      She comes to a stop thirty feet below at the bottom of the
      ravine beside the surprised SNOWPLOW DRIVER.

      And the HIGHWAY PATROL CAR.

      It's resting on its roof in the snow at the bottom of the
      ravine, wheels in the air. It looks like an overturned
      beetle.

      Something moves in its front seat.

      The snowplow driver calls to the TRAPPED HIGHWAY PATROLMAN.

                          SNOWPLOW DRIVER
                Hang on, officer! We'll get you
                out!

      She catches his arm to stop him.

                What!!? We have to get him out of
                there...

      Smoke rises from the car's gas tank, a small FIRE burning.

                          GIRL
                Doesn't matter! He's already dead!

                          SNOWPLOW DRIVER
                What the hell are you talking
                about?

      Inside the overturned car the trapped HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
      struggles. His hat has fallen off and floats in the icy
      water flooding the car, threatening to short the radio.

      Which is playing the same song as Christmas Eve fifty-seven
      years earlier. "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree."

      Despite being pinned upside-down and in pain from injuries
      sustained in the accident, he chuckles at his predicament.
      We realize he's been drinking.

      As he struggles to free himself the cop looks in the
      direction of the snowplow driver and our girl.

                           HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                Should've known you vultures would
                turn up...

                          SNOWPLOW DRIVER
                Try not to move, officer, you might
                have a neck injury.

      But the cop continues to struggle, pain sobering him.

                          HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                What are you waiting for, a letter
                from the Bishop?

      Suddenly it dawns on our girl that he isn't talking to them.

      Also that they aren't alone.

      Widen to reveal -

      A DOZEN ELDERLY PRIESTS in black winter coats and fedoras are
      standing all around them on the snowy embankment, faces grim.

      The residents of St. Christopher's Home for Retired Clergy.

      Suddenly there's a WHOOSH as the engine fire spreads across
      the car's undercarriage, moving toward the FUEL TANK.

      The priests exchange a look, reaching some silent decision.

      The LEADER of the elderly priests comes forward.

                          HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd)
                Hurry it up, I smell gas...

      The snowplow driver stands there, confused by what he's
      witnessing.

      The old priest crouches down, reaches through the open window
      past the trapped highway patrolman.

      Rips out the chattering TWO-WAY RADIO by its cord.

      The cop's face registers disbelief, then fury, as he realizes
      the priests aren't going to help him. Are in fact condemning
      him for years of crimes committed on this stretch of road.

                          HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd)
                    (struggling)
                Oh no you don't! You bastards have
                no right to sit in judgement of me.
                I know what you're thinking but I
                had nothing to do with that drunk
                girl's disappearance. I saw her
                home safely. Just ask the County
                investigators. And anything else
                you think you saw? All of it was
                lawfully done!

      He sputters as gasoline drips on his face from above.

      Another WHOOSH, blue flames spreading out from the fuel line.

      The cop smells smoke, a pleading note entering his voice now.

                          HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd)
                Please, father... For the love of
                Christ have mercy on a poor sinner!

      There's a SMALL EXPLOSION, and the inside of the car starts
      filling with FLAMES and black smoke.

      The trapped highway patrolman begins burning alive, cursing.

       The rest is lost in a second larger EXPLOSION.

       Flames flicker on the elderly faces of the priests gathered
       here to bear mute witness. They watch the burning patrol car
       for a moment longer, then one by one climb the embankment.

                                                                 CUT TO:


A103   EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT (1958)                                  A103

       Christmas, 1958. The crash scene we saw depicted in the news
       clipping. The wrecked `55 CROWN VIC. PRIESTS administering
       last rights two the two TEENS in letter jackets: one already
       dead, the other breathing his last breaths.

                                                                BACK TO:


B103   EXT. BOTTOM OF RAVINE - AS BEFORE                             B103

       Our girl and the rattled snowplow driver stand there in the
       silence and the flickering firelight from the burning car.

                              GIRL
                    Come on. We can go now. It's over.

       The snowplow driver, stunned, speechless, can only stand
       there and nod.

       Suddenly -

       The COP launches himself out of the window of the overturned
       car at them.

       Skin peeled and blackened, he starts crawling over the rocks,
       dragging his paralyzed lower body after them.

       The snowplow driver's eyes go wide and he stands rooted in
       place, unable to move.

       She grabs him by the arm, pulls him away.

                              GIRL (cont'd)
                    MOVE!!

       He comes to his senses, staggers up the embankment after her.
       He loses his footing on the icy rocks and goes sprawling.

       As the cop seizes him around the legs, and starts crawling up
       the length of his body.

       We hear the sizzle of instant FROSTBITE, the frost spreading
       with time-lapse speed up the snowplow driver's limbs as he
       shrieks in agony.

       Until even his shriek is FROZEN IN HIS LUNGS.

       ANGLE ON OUR GIRL

       As she begins scrambling up the snowy slope away from the
       horror below.

       Suddenly she loses her grip and starts to slide back down on
       her belly toward the cop a dozen feet below.

       She whimpers, fingers clutching at anything.

       Finally she succeeds, manages to haul herself up the steep
       embankment, climbing with everything she's got left in her
       until she reaches the road.


103    EXT. TOP OF THE RAVINE / WRECKED SNOWPLOW - NIGHT                103

       She hauls herself up from the gloomy abyss, wrenches the
       driver side door open and scrambles inside -


104    INT. WRECKED SNOWPLOW - CONTINUOUS                               104

       She pulls the door closed, twists the key in the ignition.

       Nothing.

                              GIRL
                        (urgently)
                    Come on, come on!

       She tries again.    And again.   But the engine is dead.

       Just then she notices the "power" light glowing on the C.B.
       She ducks under the dashboard, retrieves the microphone, sits
       up again -

       The cop.

       Unscathed.

      Standing right outside the snowplow, restored to his former
      glory, grinning at her.

      Then the smile curdles. He reaches through the shattered
      window. Grabbing for her.

      She scrabbles just out of reach.    Pins herself against the
      opposite door. Cornered.

      Suddenly -

                             GUY
                   Get away from her, you bastard!

      And OUR GUY'S GHOST appears out of the gloom.

      He swings a CROWBAR into the cop's skull.

      And, just like before, there's a VIOLENT FLASH OF light and -

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:


105   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT                                 105

      It's like someone pressed RESET.

      She's back inside the STRANDED OLDSMOBILE, seated beside the
      body of our guy.

      Her panicked breathing turns into hyperventilation as she
      realizes all efforts to escape the road are futile.

      Suddenly she spots something through the windshield that
      causes her breath to catch -

      OUR GUY'S GHOST

      heading down the road toward the trees.

      She gasps.    Starts sobbing.

      Throws open the door and scrambles out.


106   EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE    - CONTINUOUS                         106

      The sky is showing the first signs of approaching dawn.

      She watches OUR GUY'S GHOST moving into the woods, back
      toward the direction from which they came.

      She stands there, exhausted, spent.

      Suddenly -

      A familiar SONG begins to chime on her cellphone RINGTONE:

                       ("Rockin Around the X-mas

                   Ding-da-da DING, da-DING da-DING...
      Her eyes widen in terror. She fumbles out the cellphone.
      Stabs the "off" button with her thumb.

      She instinctively starts back to the stranded Oldsmobile -

      Stops -

      Looks at the ghost.

      And in that moment decides, for better or worse, to follow
      him.

      She takes off down the road.

      We follow as she hurries to catch up with our guy's ghost.

                             GIRL
                       (crying; breathless)
                   Wait!

      She's close enough now to hear that he's MUMBLING something.

                   ...I would've told you everything

      But it's no use. She stops trying to keep up and pauses
      briefly, devastated, catching her breath. Then she pushes on
      in the direction he went.

                                                     TIME DISSOLVE:

      It's almost light out now, and SHE'S ALONE, staggering along
      the road as quickly as her exhausted state allows. It's like
      running in a dream, never fast enough to outdistance an
      unseen pursuer.

      But then she hears it -

      THE HIGHWAY.

      She can't believe she's made it back to civilization.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK.


107   EXT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - MORNING                               107

      The gas pumps are crowded with EMERGENCY VEHICLES and
      PERSONNEL. The morning calm is broken by the BEEP BEEP BEEP
      of trucks backing up, the BLEET of arriving ambulances, the
      constant CHATTER of two-way radios.

      OUR GIRL is seated in the back of an open ambulance with a
      blanket draped around her shoulders, allowing EMTs to treat
      her frostbite.

      She watches ATTENDANTS from the county morgue zip the bodies
      of our guy and the snowplow driver into BODYBAGS.

      Suddenly she remembers her cellphone, and takes it out.


      INSERT CELLPHONE DISPLAY --

      It's the DIGITAL PICTURE OF OUR GUY when she first met him,
      asleep behind the wheel of the `88 Olds in student parking.

      She closes her cellphone.

      The EMT helps her into the passenger seat of the ambulance.

      As the ambulance drives off we CRANE UP to see...
