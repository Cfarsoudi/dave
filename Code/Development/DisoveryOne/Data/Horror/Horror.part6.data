                                            by

                                     William Goldman

                                  Based on the Novel by

                                       Stephen King

                

               FADE IN ON:

               A SINGLE CIGARETTE. A MATCH. A HOTEL ICE BUCKET that holds a 
               bottle of champagne. The cigarette is unlit. The match is of 
               the kitchen variety. The champagne, unopened, is Dom Perignon. 
               There is only one sound at first: a strong WIND--

               --now another sound, sharper--a sudden burst of TYPING as we

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               PAUL SHELDON typing at a table in his hotel suite. It's really 
               a cabin that's part of a lodge. Not an ornate place. Western 
               themed.

               He is framed by a window looking out at some gorgeous 
               mountains. It's afternoon. The sky is grey. Snow is scattered 
               along the ground. We're out west somewhere. The WIND grows 
               stronger--there could be a storm.

               PAUL pays no attention to what's going on outside as he 
               continues to type.

               He's the hero of what follows. Forty-two, he's got a good 
               face, one with a certain mileage to it. We are not, in other 
               words, looking at a virgin. He's been a novelist for eighteen 
               years and for half that time, the most recent half, a 
               remarkably successful one.

               He pauses for a moment, intently, as if trying to stare a 
               hole in the paper. Now his fingers fly, and there's another 
               burst of TYPING. He studies what he's written, then--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PAPER, as he rolls it out of the machine, puts it on the 
               table, prints, in almost childlike letters, these words:

                                         THE END

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A PILE OF MANUSCRIPT at the rear of the table. He puts this 
               last page on, gets it straight and in order, hoists it up, 
               folds it to his chest, the entire manuscript--hundreds of 
               pages.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as he holds his book to him. He is, just for a brief 
               moment, moved.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A SUITCASE across the room. PAUL goes to it, opens it and 
               pulls something out from inside: a battered red leather 
               briefcase. Now he takes his manuscript, carefully opens the 
               briefcase, gently puts the manuscript inside. He closes it, 
               and the way he handles it, he might almost be handling a 
               child. Now he crosses over, opens the champagne, pours himself 
               a single glass, lights the one cigarette with the lone match--
               there is a distinct feeling of ritual about this. He inhales 
               deeply, makes a toasting gesture, then drinks, smokes, smiles.

               HOLD BRIEFLY, then--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LODGE - DAY

               PAUL--exiting his cabin. He stops, makes a snowball, throws 
               it, hitting a sign.

                                     PAUL
                         Still got it.

               He throws a suitcase into the trunk of his '65 MUSTANG and, 
               holding his leather case, he hops into the car and drives 
               away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A SIGN that reads "Silver Creek Lodge." Behind the sign is 
               the hotel itself--old, desolate. Now the '65 Mustang comes 
               out of the garage, guns ahead toward the sign. As "Shotgun" 
               by Jr. Walker and the Allstars starts, he heads off into the 
               mountains.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SKY. Gun-metal grey. The clouds seem pregnant with snow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, driving the Mustang, the battered briefcase on the 
               seat beside him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD AHEAD. Little dainty flakes of snow are suddenly 
               visible.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CAR, going into a curve and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, driving, and as he comes out of the curve, a stunned 
               look hits his face as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD AHEAD--and here it comes--a mountain storm; it's as 
               if the top has been pulled off the sky and with no warning 
               whatsoever, we're into a blizzard and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, slowing, driving deeper into the mountains.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, squinting ahead, windshield wipers on now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, rounding another curve, losing traction--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, a skilled driver, bringing the car easily under control.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD

               Snow is piling up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL driving confidently, carefully. Now he reaches out, 
               ejects the tape, expertly turns it over, pushes it in and, 
               as the MUSIC continues, he hums along with it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SKY. Only you can't see it.

               There's nothing to see  but the unending snow, nothing to 
               hear but the wind which keeps getting wilder.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD. Inches of snow on the ground now. This is desolate 
               and dangerous.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, driving.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SNOW. Worse.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD, curving sharply, drop ping. A sign reads: "Curved 
               Road, Next 13 Miles."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, coming into view, hitting the curve--no problem--
               no problem at all--and then suddenly, there is a very serious 
               problem and as the car skids out of control--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, doing his best, fighting the conditions and just as it 
               looks like he's got things going his way--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD, swerving down and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, all traction gone and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, helpless and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, skidding, skidding and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD as it drops more steeply away and the wind whips 
               the snow across and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG starting to spin and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MOUNTAINSIDE as the car skids off the road, careens down, 
               slams into a tree, bounces off, flips, lands upside down, 
               skids, stops finally, dead.

               HOLD ON THE CAR A MOMENT

               There is still the sound of the WIND, and there is still the 
               music coming from the tape, perhaps the only part of the car 
               left undamaged. Nothing moves inside. There is only the WIND 
               and the TAPE. The wind gets louder.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WRECK looked at from a distance. The MUSIC sounds are 
               only faintly heard.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE AREA WHERE THE WRECK IS--AS SEEN FROM THE ROAD. The car 
               is barely visible as the snow begins to cover it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WRECK from outside, and we're close to it now, with the 
               snow coming down ever harder--already bits of the car are 
               covered in white.

               CAMERA MOVES IN TO

               PAUL. He's inside and doing his best to fight is, but his 
               consciousness is going. He tries to keep his eyes open but 
               they're slits.

               Slowly, he manages to reach out with his left arm for his 
               briefcase--

               --and he clutches it to his battered body. The MUSIC continues 
               on.

               But PAUL is far from listening. His eyes flutter, flutter 
               again. Now they're starting to close.

               The man is dying.

               Motionless, he still clutches the battered briefcase.

               HOLD ON THE CASE. Then--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The BRIEFCASE in Paul's hands as he sits at a desk.

                                     SINDELL (O.S.)
                         What's that?

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               We are in New York City in the office of Paul's literary 
               agent, MARCIA SINDELL. The walls of the large room are 
               absolutely crammed with book and movie posters, in English 
               and all other kinds of other languages, all of them featuring 
               the character of MISERY CHASTAIN, a perfectly beautiful woman. 
               Misery's Challenge, Misery's Triumph--eight of them. All 
               written by Paul Sheldon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, lifting up the battered briefcase--maybe when new it 
               cost two bucks, but he treats it like gold.

                                     PAUL
                         An old friend. I was rummaging through 
                         a closet and it was just sitting 
                         there. Like it was waiting for me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                              compliment)
                         It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... 
                         character.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TWO OF THEM

                                     PAUL
                         When I wrote my first book, I used 
                         to carry it around in this while I 
                         was looking for a publisher. That 
                         was a good book, Marcia. I was a 
                         writer then.

                                     SINDELL
                         You're still a writer.

                                     PAUL
                         I haven't been a writer since I got
                         into the Misery business--

                                     SINDELL
                              (holding up the cover 
                              art of MISERY'S CHILD)
                         Not a bad business. This thing would 
                         still be growing, too. The first 
                         printing order on Misery's Child was
                         the most ever--over a million.

                                     PAUL
                         Marcia, please.

                                     SINDELL
                         No, no. Misery Chastain put braces 
                         on your daughter's teeth and is 
                         putting her through college, bought 
                         you two houses and floor seats to 
                         the Knick games and what thanks does 
                         she get? You go and kill her.

                                     PAUL
                         Marcia, you know I started "Misery" 
                         on a lark. Do I look like a guy who 
                         writes romance novels? Do I sound 
                         like Danielle Steel? It was a one-
                         time shot and we got lucky. I never 
                         meant it to become my life. And if I 
                         hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd 
                         have ended up writing her forever.
                              (touches his briefcase)
                         For the first time in fifteen years, 
                         I think I'm really onto something 
                         here.

                                     SINDELL
                         I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really 
                         am. But you have to know--when your 
                         fans find out that you killed off 
                         their favorite heroine, they're not 
                         going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon 
                         can finally write what we've always 
                         wanted: An esoteric, semi-
                         autobiographical character study.

                                     PAUL
                              (passionately)
                         Marcia, why are you doing this to 
                         me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? 
                         Don't you think I remember how nobody 
                         gave a shit about my first books? 
                         You think I'm dying to go back to 
                         shouting in the wilderness?
                              (beat)
                         I'm doing this because I have to.
                              (Marcia is stopped)
                         Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try 
                         to finish this and I want your good 
                         thoughts--because if I can make it 
                         work ...
                              (beat)
                         I might just have something that I 
                         want on my tombstone.

               On the word "tombstone"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S TOMBSTONE--the upside down car with the blizzard coming 
               gale-force and his motionless body trapped inside the car.

               The WIND screams. PAUL'S EYES flutter, then close.

               Hold

               Keep holding as--

               Suddenly there's a new sound as a crowbar SCRATCHES at the 
               door--

               -- nd now the door is ripped open as we

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               A BUNDLED-UP FIGURE gently beginning to pull PAUL and the 
               case from the car. For a moment, it's hard to tell if it's a 
               man or woman--

               --not to let the cat out of the bag or anything, but it is, 
               very much, a woman. Her name is ANNIE WILKES and she is close 
               to Paul's age. She is in many ways a remarkable creature. 
               Strong, self-sufficient, passionate in her likes and dislikes, 
               loves and hates.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND ANNIE as she cradles him in her arms. Once he's 
               clear of the car, she lays him carefully in the snow

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND ANNIE: CLOSE UP. She slowly brings her mouth down 
               close to his. Then their lips touch as she forces air inside 
               him.

                                     ANNIE
                              (Their lips touch 
                              again. Then--)
                         You hear me--Breathe! I said 
                         breathe!!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as he starts to breathe--

               --in a moment his eyes suddenly open wide, but he's in shock, 
               the eyes see nothing--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE--the moment she sees him come to life, she goes into 
               action, lifting PAUL in a fireman's carry, starting the 
               difficult climb back up the steep hill.

               As she moves away, she and Paul are obliterated by the white 
               falling snow.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE WHITE OF WHAT SEEMS LIKE A HOSPITAL. Everything is bled 
               of color. It's all vague--

               --we are looking at this from Paul's blurred vision.

               And throughout this next sequence, there are these SOUNDS, 
               words really, but they make no sense.

               "...no... worry...

               ...be... fine...

               ...good care... you...

               ...I'm your number one fan..."

               The first thing we see during this is something all white. 
               It takes a moment before we realize it's a ceiling.

               Now, a white wall.

               An I.V. bottle is next, the medicine dripping down a tube 
               into PAUL'S LEFT ARM. The other arm is bandaged and in a 
               sling.

               ANNIE is standing beside the bed. She wears off-white and 
               seems very much like a nurse. A good nurse. She has pills in 
               her hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. Motionless, dead pale. He has a little beard now. Eyes 
               barely open, he's shaking with fever.

                                     PAUL
                              (hardly able to whisper)
                         ...where... am I...?

               ANNIE is quickly by his side.

                                     ANNIE
                              (so gently)
                         Shhh... we're just outside Silver 
                         Creek.

                                     PAUL
                         How long...?

                                     ANNIE
                         You've been here two days. You're 
                         gonna be okay.
                              (relieved)
                         My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--

                                     PAUL
                         --my number one fan.

               And now the gibberish words make sense.

                                     ANNIE
                         That's right. I'm also a nurse. Here.
                              (Now, as she brings 
                              the pills close)
                         Take these.

               She helps him to swallow, as Paul's eyes close.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               AN EXTERIOR OF THE PLACE. It's a farmhouse--we 're in a 
               desolate area with mountains in the background.

               THE HOUSE is set on a knoll so that Paul's room, although on 
               the first floor, is ten feet off the ground.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, in the room. He's not on the I.V. anymore. His fever 
               has broken. Annie enters, pills in her hand.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here.

                                     PAUL
                         What are they...?

                                     ANNIE
                         They're called Novril--they're for 
                         your pain.
                              (helps him take them)

               ANNIE applies a cool rag to his forehead.

                                     PAUL
                         Shouldn't I be in a hospital?

                                     ANNIE
                         The  blizzard was too strong. I 
                         couldn't risk trying to get you there. 
                         I tried calling, but the phone lines 
                         are down.

               PAUL tries to test his left arm.

                                     ANNIE
                              (Gently, her fingers 
                              go to his eyelids, 
                              close them)
                         Now you mustn't tire yourself. You've 
                         got to rest, you almost died.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP. Sometimes her face shows the most remarkable 
               compassion. It does now.

               HOLD ON IT briefly.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE UP ON PILLS IN ANNIE'S HAND

                                     ANNIE (O.S.)
                         Open wide.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM

               He lies in bed. His fever is gone, but he's terribly weak.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. As she lays the pills on PAUL'S TONGUE, she gives him 
               a glass of water from the nearby bed table.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, swallowing eagerly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, watching him, sympathetically.

                                     ANNIE
                         Your legs just sing grand opera when 
                         you move, don't they?
                              (Paul says nothing, 
                              but his pain is clear)
                         It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, 
                         I promise you.

                                     PAUL
                         Will I be able to walk?

                                     ANNIE
                         Of course you will. And your arm 
                         will be fine, too. Your shoulder was 
                         dislocated pretty badly, but I finally 
                         popped it back in there.
                              (proudly)
                         But what I'm most proud of is the 
                         work I did on those legs. Considering 
                         what I had around the house, I don't 
                         think there's a doctor who could 
                         have done any better.

               And now suddenly she flicks off the blankets, uncovering his 
               body.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring, stunned at the bottom half of his body as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S LEGS. From the knees down he resembles an Egyptian 
               mummy--she's splinted them with slim steel rods that look 
               like the hacksawed remains of aluminum crutches and there's 
               taping circling around.

               From the kness up they're all swollen and throbbing and 
               horribly bruised and discolored.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, lying back, stunned with disbelief.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's not nearly as bad as it looks. 
                         You have a compound fracture of the 
                         tibia in both legs, and the fibula 
                         in the left leg is fractured too. I 
                         could hear the bones moving, so it's 
                         best for your legs to remain immobile. 
                         And as soon as the roads open, I'll 
                         take you to a hospital.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP

                                     ANNIE
                         In the meantime, you've got a lot of 
                         recovering to do, and I consider it 
                         an honor that you'll do it in my 
                         home.

               HOLD on her ecstatic face.

               Then--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MISERY'S PERFECT FACE. We're back in SINDELL's office in New 
               York. The office looks just the same, posters and manuscripts 
               all over. But she doesn't.

               She holds the phone and she is fidgety, insecure.

                                     SINDELL
                         This is Marcia Sindell calling from 
                         New York City. I'd like to speak to 
                         the Silver Creek Chief of Police or 
                         the Sheriff.

                                     MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                         Which one do you want?

                                     SINDELL
                         Whichever one's not busy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SMALL OFFICE IN SILVER CREEK

               ...with a view of the mountains.

               A MARVELOUS LOOKING MAN sits at a desk, by himself, holding 
               the phone. In his sixties, he's still as bright, fast and 
               sassy as he was half-a-lifetime ago. Never mind what his 
               name is, everyone calls him BUSTER.

                                     BUSTER
                         I'm pretty sure they 're both not 
                         busy, Ms. Sindell, since they're 
                         both me. I also happen to be President 
                         of the Policeman's Benefit 
                         Association, Chairman of the 
                         Patrolman's Retirement Fund, and if 
                         you need a good fishing guide, you 
                         could do a lot worse; call me Buster, 
                         everybody does, what can I do for 
                         you?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SINDELL in her office. She pushes the speakerphone, gets up, 
               paces; she's very hesitant when she speaks about Paul. Almost 
               embarrassed--

                                     SINDELL
                         I'm a literary agent, and I feel 
                         like a fool calling you, but I think 
                         one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, 
                         might be in some kind of trouble.

                         Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon 
                         the writer?

                                     SINDELL
                         Yes.

                                     BUSTER
                         He's your client, huh?

                                     SINDELL
                         Yes, he is.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER'S OFFICE

               He rolls a penny across the back of one hand--he's very good 
               at it, doesn't even look while he does it.

                                     BUSTER
                         People sure like those Misery books.

                                     SINDELL
                         I'm sure you know Paul's been going 
                         to the Silver Creek Lodge for years 
                         to finish his books.

                                     BUSTER
                         Yeah, I understand he's been up here 
                         the last six weeks.

                                     SINDELL
                         Not quite. I just called, and they 
                         said he checked out five days ago. 
                         Isn't that a little strange?

                                     BUSTER
                         I don't know. Does he always phone 
                         you when he checks out of hotels?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SINDELL, really embarrassed now.

                                     SINDELL
                         No, no, of course not. It's just 
                         that his daughter hasn't heard from 
                         him, and when he's got a book coming 
                         out, he usually keeps in touch. So 
                         when there was no word from him...

                                     BUSTER
                         You think he might be missing?

                              (shakes her head)
                         I hate that I made this call--tell 
                         me I'm being silly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. He nods as a WOMAN enters, carrying lunch. It's his 
               wife, VIRGINIA. She begins putting the food down on a table 
               for the both of them.

                                     BUSTER
                         Just a little over-protective, maybe.
                              (beat)
                         Tell you what--nothing's been reported 
                         out here--
                              (he puts Paul Sheldon's 
                              name with a ? on a 3 
                              x 5 CARD)
                         --but I'll put his name through our 
                         system.

                              a bulletin board)
                         And if anything turns up, I'll call 
                         you right away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.

                         you finding me...

               ANNIE's soft, sweet laughter is heard. She stands over him, 
               finishing shaving him with a very sharp straight razor. She 
               wears what we will come to know as her regular costume--plain 
               wool skirts, grey cardigan sweaters.

                         a way, I was following you.

               ANNIE concentrates on shaving him with great care; she has 
               wonderful, strong hands.

                         Well, it wasn't any secret to me 
                         that you were staying at the Silver 
                         Creek, seeing as how I'm your number-
                         one fan and all. Some nights I'd 
                         just tool on down there, sit outside 
                         and look up at the light in your 
                         cabin--

                         on in the room of the world's greatest 
                         writer.

                         Well, the other afternoon I was on 
                         my way home, and there you were, 
                         leaving the Lodge, and I wondered 
                         why a literary genius would go for a 
                         drive when there was a big storm 
                         coming.

                         I didn't know it was going to be a

                              (Paul nods)
                         I noticed in your case there was a 
                         new Paul Sheldon book and...
                              (hesitant)
                         and I wondered if maybe...
                              (her voice trails off)

                                     PAUL
                         You want to read it?

                                     ANNIE
                              (quietly)
                         If you wouldn't mind.

                                     PAUL
                         I have a hard and fast rule about 
                         who can read my stuff at this early 
                         stage--only my editor, my agent, and 
                         anyone who saves me from freezing to 
                         death in a car wreck.

                                     ANNIE
                              (genuinely thrilled)
                         You'll never realize what a rare 
                         treat you've given me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. His eyes close briefly, he grimaces.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, watching him, concerned. She glances at her watch.

                                     ANNIE
                         Boy, it's like clockwork, the way 
                         your pain comes--I'll get you your 
                         Novril, Paul. Forgive me for prattling 
                         away and making you feel all oogy.

               She turns and goes out of the room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, watching her.

                         What's your new book called?

                                     PAUL
                         I don't have a title yet.

                                     ANNIE
                         What's it about?

                                     PAUL
                              (fast)
                         It's crazy, but I don't really know, 
                         I mean I haven't written anything 
                         but "Misery" for so long that--you 
                         read it you can tell me what you 
                         think it's about. Maybe you can come 
                         up with a title.

                                     ANNIE
                              (in the doorway)
                         Oh, like I could do that?

               Small, neat, one window--outside, snow covers all.

               BUSTER AND LIBBY, THE MANAGER, are going over books and 
               records. Libby is an old guy, walks with a cane.

                                     LIBBY
                         Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's 
                         leaving, Buster--you can tell by the 
                         champagne.

                         Maybe you can, Libby.

                         No, see, he always ordered a bottle 
                         of Dom Perignon when he was ready to 
                         go. Then he'd pay up and be out the
                         door.

                         out of the ordinary?

                              (head shake)
                         I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for 
                         things to be out of the ordinary. 
                         Considering who he is and all, famous 
                         and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives 
                         the same car out from New York each 
                         time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him 
                         think. He was always a good guest, 
                         never made a noise, never bothered a 
                         soul. Sure hope nothing happened to 
                         him.

                         I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling 
                         into New York right now.

                         I'm sure you're right.

               But you can tell he's not sure at all as we

               A SPOON FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH BEEF BARLEY SOUP

               PAUL'S ROOM.

               He lies in bed. Sun comes in the lone window. ANNIE sits on 
               the bed, a large bowl of soup in her hands, feeding him.

                                     ANNIE
                              (almost shy about 
                              this)
                         I know I'm only forty pages into 
                         your book, but...

               She stops, fills the spoon up again.

                                     PAUL
                         But what?

                                     ANNIE
                         Nothing.

                                     PAUL
                         No, what is it?

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to 
                         make a criticism to someone like 
                         you?

                                     PAUL
                         I can take it, go ahead.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, it's brilliantly written, but 
                         then everything you write is 
                         brilliant.

                                     PAUL
                         Pretty rough so far.

                              (beat)
                         There, I said it.

                         The profanity bothers you?

                         It has no nobility.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, these are slum kids, I was a 
                         slum kid, everybody talks like that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. She holds the soup bowl in one hand, the muddy-colored 
               beef barley soup close to spilling.

                                     ANNIE
                         They do not. What do you think I say 
                         when I go to the feed store in town?
                         "Now, Wally, give me a bag of that 
                         effing pigfeed and ten pounds of 
                         that bitchly cow-corn"--

               PAUL is amused by this.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SOUP, almost spilling as she gets more agitated.

                         --and in the bank do I tell Mrs. 
                         Bollinger, "Here's one big bastard 
                         of a check, give me some of your 
                         Christing money."

               PAUL, almost laughing as some soup hits the coverlet.

                                     ANNIE
                              (seeing the spill, 
                              suddenly upset)
                         There! Look there! See what you made 
                         me do!

               ANNIE, and she is just totally embarrassed.

                         Oh, Paul, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
                         Sometimes I get so worked up. Can 
                         you ever forgive me? Here...

               She hands him his pills and starts to clean the soup off the 
               coverlet. Then she makes the sweetest smile.

                                     ANNIE
                         I love you, Paul.

                              than ever)
                         Your mind. Your creativity--that's 
                         all I meant.

               Flustered, she turns away as we--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A ROAD IN THE MOUNTAINS. Piles of snow all around but it's 
               been ploughed enough so it's driveable.

               A CAR coming into view. Up ahead is the sign we've already 
               seen: "Curved Road, Next 13 Miles."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE CAR

               BUSTER AND HIS WIFE VIRGINIA: Virginia is driving while Buster 
               intently studies the terrain. He reaches for a large thermos, 
               pours some coffee, offers it to her. She shakes her head. He 
               begins to sip it.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         This sure is fun.

               She puts her hand on his leg.

                              (removing it)
                         Virginia, when you're in this car, 
                         you're not my wife, you're my deputy.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Well, this deputy would rather be 
                         home under the covers with the 
                         Sheriff.

               THE CAR. Suddenly, it goes into a little icy spin--she fights 
               it back under control.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Stop--stop right here.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         What? What is it?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CAR, skidding, slowing, stopping. BOTH OF THEM get out, 
               go to the edge of the road. Mountains of snow. Nothing much 
               else visible. Then Buster points.

                                     BUSTER
                         Look at that broken branch there...

               VIRGINIA, seeing it, unconvinced.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Could be the weight of the snow.

                                     BUSTER
                         Could be--or a rotten branch or a 
                         mountain lion could have landed on 
                         it. Could be a lot of things.

               He steps off the road, starts down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, watching him, worried--it's very slippery.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, graceful, in great shape, navigating down easily.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TREE that the car ran into. BUSTER reaches it, studies 
               it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, staring out after him--she can't see him because 
               the drop is both too steep and covered with trees and mounds 
               of snow.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Anything down there?

                                     BUSTER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Yeah. An enormous amount of snow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. He's moved away from the tree now, going toward where 
               the Mustang is buried.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MOUND OF SNOW with the Mustang inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, making his way closer to it, closer, staring around.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE AREA. Nothing to be seen--everything is covered with 
               mountains of snow. You could have a house down there and not 
               be able to see it. Just glaring white.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, angry, frustrated, turning around and around and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER from another angle, from behind the mound with the 
               Mustang inside--and out of his sight, glistening in the sun, 
               a bit of the door protrudes. But, of course, Buster can't 
               see it.

               HOLD ON BUSTER, in a sour mood, staring around as the edge 
               of the door continues to glisten.

               CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, on the road as Buster makes his way back up, still 
               ticked.

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (they move to the car)
                         You really think Sheldon's out there?

                                     BUSTER
                         Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's 
                         go to the newspaper office.

               As they get in the car--

               ANOTHER CAR DRIVING BY--it's Annie in her Jeep--neither she 
               nor Buster notice each other.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM

               The door opens and ANNIE enters.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake 
                         you.

                                     PAUL
                         It's fine.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               Paul's eyes fluttering awake to see the hardback copy of his 
               novel, Misery's Child, in Annie's hands. She's never been 
               more excited--

                                     ANNIE
                         They had it at the store, Paul, there 
                         was a whole batch of them there. As 
                         soon as I saw it, I slammed my money
                         down. I got the first copy.

                                     PAUL
                         Then the roads are open...

                                     ANNIE
                         The one to town is, but that's about 
                         it. I called the hospital and talked 
                         to the head orthopedic surgeon. I 
                         told him who you were and what had 
                         happened. He said as long as there's 
                         no infection, you're not in any 
                         danger, and as soon as the road to 
                         the hospital is open, they'll send 
                         an ambulance for you.

                                     PAUL
                         The phones are working?

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, mine's still out. But the ones 
                         in town were working just fine. I 
                         called that agent of yours.
                              (soft now)
                         Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very 
                         beginning.
                              (looks at him)
                         What a wonderful first page--just to 
                         read the name Misery Chastain...

                                     PAUL
                         My daughter must be going nuts.

                                     ANNIE
                         ...it's like a visit from my oldest,
                         dearest friend.

                                     PAUL
                         I was supposed to be home for her 
                         birthday three days ago.

                                     ANNIE
                         Your agent said she would tell her 
                         you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll 
                         have to wait until tomorrow if you 
                         want to speak to her yourself.

               She starts to leave, stops at the door.

                                     ANNIE
                              (She looks at him now 
                              with almost a look 
                              of amazement)
                         Oh, Paul, what a poet you are...

               As she leaves--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL, watching as she enters, moves to him, carrying a tray.

                                     ANNIE
                         I made you my speciality--scrambled 
                         eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 
                         75.

                                     PAUL
                         I guess that means it's okay.

                                     ANNIE
                         No. No, it isn't, it's--
                              (halts)
                         --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. 
                         Would "great" be insulting?

                                     PAUL
                         I can live with "great."

               He starts, with effort, to eat.

                                     ANNIE
                              (as she turns, goes)
                         No, it's not just great, it's perfect, 
                         a perfect, perfect thing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. MID-AFTERNOON

               ANNIE is clearing Paul's tray. She hands him his Novril; he 
               quickly swallows them.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm up to page 185. I always get sad 
                         when I pass the halfway point. Will 
                         you do me a favor? I'd love it if 
                         you would autograph my copy. I already 
                         have your autograph on a picture, 
                         but it would mean so much to me to 
                         get it in person. I know you're right-
                         handed, so don't worry if it's not 
                         so legible. I'll cherish it anyway.

               As PAUL signs the book:

                                     ANNIE
                         I don't mean to pry, but I've read 
                         in two magazines now where you were 
                         seeing this model who does those 
                         disgusting jeans commercials. And I 
                         said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon 
                         would never waste his time with a 
                         trampy woman like that.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, you can't believe everything 
                         you read in magazines.

                                     ANNIE
                         I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. 
                         Boy, how do they get away with 
                         printing stuff like that?

                                     PAUL
                         You'd be amazed at what some people 
                         will believe.

               He finishes the autograph, hands the book back to her.

                                     ANNIE
                         Thank you so much.

                                     PAUL
                         My pleasure.

               THE DOOR. IT opens and guess what--a sow lumbers in.

               PAUL, kind of stunned as this female pig skitters its way 
               around the room, excited, confused, slipping and sliding.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, all smiles and happiness, laughing in the doorway.

                                     ANNIE
                         I thought it was time you two should 
                         meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite 
                         beast in all the world, my sow, 
                         Misery.

               PAUL AND ANNIE, watching it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes. I told you I was your number-
                         one fan.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm getting to believe you.

                         This farm was getting kind of dreary, 
                         what with just the few cows and 
                         chickens and me--
                              (happy)
                         But when I got Misery here, everything 
                         Changed--she just makes me smile so.

                                     PAUL
                         She's a fine... uh... pig is what 
                         she is...

                                     ANNIE
                              (scooping up the pig, 
                              holding it tight as 
                              she stands by Paul)
                         I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, 
                         and it's better than perfect--it's 
                         divine. What's the ceiling that dago 
                         painted?

                                     PAUL
                         The Sistine Chapel?

                                     ANNIE
                         Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those 
                         are the only two divine things ever 
                         in this world...

               PAUL watches as the pig skitters out of the room with ANNIE 
               in pursuit, happily imitating the pig.

                         Woink! Whoink! Whuh-Whuh-WHOINK!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL staring after them--what the hell was that?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW. DUSK.

               ANNIE'S VOICE is heard softly.

                                     ANNIE
                         When my husband left me... I wasn't 
                         prepared, it wasn't an easy time...

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               ANNIE, standing at the window, her back to the room.

               In bed, PAUL is dealing with a bedpan, peeing.

                                     ANNIE
                         For a while I thought I might go 
                         crazy.

                                     PAUL
                         I know how that can be.

                                     ANNIE
                         I don't know about you, but what I 
                         did to get through it was I dove 
                         into work--days, nights--night shifts 
                         can be lonely at a hospital. I did a 
                         lot of reading. That was hen I first 
                         discovered Misery. She made me so 
                         happy. She made me forget all my 
                         problems.
                              (She smiles now)
                         'Course, I suppose you had a little 
                         something to do with that too.

               There is a peeing sound.

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah, well...

               He is embarrassed.

                                     ANNIE
                              (She isn't)
                         I just kept reading them over and 
                         over. I know when I finish this one--
                         and I've only got two chapters to go--
                         I'll just turn right to the front 
                         page and start reading it again.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm...

                                     ANNIE
                              (She turns around, 
                              moves to the bed)
                         Done?

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah, thanks.

                                     ANNIE
                         No problem.

               As she takes the bedpan...

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't get me wrong. I'm not against 
                         marriage per se. But it would take a 
                         pretty special guy to make me want 
                         to go down the aisle again.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, it's not something you should
                         enter into lightly.

                                     ANNIE
                         It boils down to respect. People 
                         just don't respect the institution 
                         of marriage any more. They have no 
                         sense of real commitment.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, attempting to smile. There is not much he can say to 
               this.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'd love to stay here and chat, but 
                         I'm right at the end and I gotta 
                         find out what happens.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, I hope you like it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Of course I'll like it. Misery's 
                         about to have her child. What's it 
                         gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't 
                         tell me.

               With that, she exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW. MOONLIGHT.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He's been dozing but now his eyes flutter awake as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOOR. It opens and ANNIE enters, comes to his bedside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. Hard to see. He squints up as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. CLOSE UP: her face is ashen pale.

                                     ANNIE
                         You...you dirty bird. She can't be 
                         dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! 
                         How could you?

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, in 1871, women often died in 
                         childbirth, but her spirit is the 
                         important thing, and Misery's spirit 
                         is still alive--

                                     ANNIE
                              (screaming)
                         I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER!
                         And you MURDERED her!

                                     PAUL
                         I DIDN'T...

                                     ANNIE
                         Then who did?

                                     PAUL
                         No one--she just died--she slipped 
                         away, that's all.

                                     ANNIE
                              (screaming)
                         She slipped away? She slipped away? 
                         She didn't just slip away. You did 
                         it. You did it. You did it. You did 
                         it. You murdered my Misery.

               And now she has lifted a chair--it's heavy but she's very 
               strong--and she raises it and turns on Paul, and it's high 
               above her head, and PAUL realizes that this might be it, she 
               might shatter him with it, crunch his skull--and that's just 
               what she seems she's about to do--and then she swings it, 
               not against him but against the wall, and it shatters and 
               she's panting from the effort as she turns on him again, her 
               voice surprisingly soft.

                                     ANNIE
                         I thought you were good, Paul, but 
                         you're not good, you're just another 
                         lying old dirty birdie and I don't 
                         think I better be around you for 
                         awhile.
                              (she crosses to the 
                              door, then stops)
                         And don't even think about anybody 
                         coming for you, not the doctors, not 
                         your agent, not your family--because 
                         I never called them. Nobody knows 
                         you're here. And you better hope 
                         nothing happens to me because if I 
                         die, you die.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, watching as she closes the door behind her. Then there 
               is a RATTLE OF A KEY and the sound of the door to his room 
               LOCKING.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, getting in her Cherokee and gunning away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROOM

               PAUL lies still. He looks around the room and listens for 
               sounds. All he hears are the SOUNDS OF A WINTER NIGHT in the 
               mountains. After a few beats, he takes a deep breath and 
               then begins his greatest effort of all: to force his body 
               out of bed, to make it move.

               He's still weak from what he's endured, but that's not the 
               main thing: it's the pain. Any attempt at movement and his 
               legs scream. He sags back, lies there still a moment. Slowly 
               he tries to maneuver his body off the bed. He rolls over 
               onto his stomach, then tries to lower himself onto the floor 
               by moving down head first. His good arm hits the floor, and 
               he is able to hold himself up but, realizing there is no way 
               to get out of bed without causing tremendous pain, he girds 
               himself and flings himself out of bed and comes crashing to 
               the floor.

               The pain is excruciating. After he regains his composure, he 
               slowly crawls toward the door.

               He reaches up and tries the handle. It is, in fact, locked. 
               He awkwardly tries to slam up against the door, but it is 
               much too painful and to no avail. He crawls back over to the 
               bed, realizes there's no way to climb back in, then grabs

               the blanket from the bed, wraps it around himself, and closes 
               his eyes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               BUSTER'S OFFICE. DAY.

               He sits alone at his desk on the telephone, staring at the 
               Rocky Mountain Gazette spread in front of him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE NEWSPAPER'S FRONT PAGE

               In a prominent spot on the top is what is most likely a book-
               jacket photo of Paul. Above the picture is the following: 
               "HAVE YOU SEEN PAUL SHELDON?"

               BUSTER is on the phone with Marcia Sindell.

                                     BUSTER
                         No, Ms. Sindell, there's no point in 
                         coming up here now. Everything that 
                         can be done is... Yes, we're working 
                         closely with the state police, and 
                         the FBI has been informed. Right... 
                         Right... As soon as we know anything 
                         we'll let you know. No, it's no 
                         bother. Call anytime. Bye, Ms. 
                         Sindell.

               VIRGINIA enters, carrying some files.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Here's the list of all Sheldon's 
                         credit charges. Nothing after the 
                         Silver Creek.
                              (With a glance at his 
                              dour face, she 
                              indicates the photo)
                         Any calls?

                                     BUSTER
                         Just from his agent.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. His eyes flick up to her. An almost imperceptible 
               shake of the head.

               HOLD FOR A MOMENT, then--

               FACES. They are distorted, and they come into view but 
               briefly, then change into the next distorted face. All kinds-- 
               there is no order to them

               --young, Oriental, female, male, pretty, sad, black, not so 
               pretty, happy, white, old--what we HEAR is this:

               "...You've changed my life..."

               "...I'm your number one fan..."

               "...I'm a really big fan of yours..."

               "...I'm your biggest fan..."

               "...Don't ever stop writing those Misery books..."

               "...I've read all your books, but the Misery's... well..."

               "...I'm your number one fan..."

               "...You've given me such pleasure..."

               "...I feel like you're writing just for me..."

               And now, it gets kicked up in speed and all goes faster, 
               many times overlapping.

               "...I love you... I'm your number one fan... I'm your biggest 
               fan... We love you... number one... love you... biggest... 
               love you... number one... number one... you poor dear 
               thing..."

               This last was said by Annie, out of focus, and for a moment, 
               she stays that way--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROOM, AS IT SNAPS BACK INTO FOCUS--ANNIE is standing by 
               the bed. It is dusk.

               She wears a dark blue dress and a hat with a sprig of flowers. 
               Her eyes are bright and vivacious--the fact is, this is the 
               prettiest ANNIE WILKES has ever looked.

                                     ANNIE
                         What are you doing on the floor?
                              (crossing to the bed)
                         It's my fault. If I'd had a proper 
                         hospital bed, this never would have 
                         happened. Here, let me help you back 
                         in.
                              (She lifts him back 
                              into the bed, which 
                              causes considerable 
                              pain)
                         I know this hurts, but it'll only 
                         take a few seconds. There you go. 
                         Comfy?

                                     PAUL
                              (in pain)
                         Perfect.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're such a kidder. I have a big 
                         surprise for you. But first there's
                         something you must do.

                                     PAUL
                         I don't suppose I could have a little 
                         snack while I wait for the
                         surprise?

                                     ANNIE
                         I'll get you everything you want, 
                         but you must listen first. Sometimes 
                         my thinking is a little muddy, I 
                         accept that. It's why I couldn't 
                         remember all those things they were 
                         asking me on the witness stand in 
                         Denver.

               Now she turns, goes to the doorway, keeping on talking. She 
               is never out of sight.

                                     ANNIE
                         But this time I thought clearly. I 
                         asked God about you and God said "I 
                         delivered him unto you so that you 
                         may show him the way."

                                     PAUL
                         Show me the way?

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes.

               She exits and re-enters wheeling something toward his bed. 
               It's a charcoal barbecue, the kind you use in summer for 
               cooking hamburgers. She holds several items in her arms: a 
               box of Diamond Blue Tip wooden matches, a can of lighter 
               fluid. And most noticeably, Paul's manuscript.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE AND PAUL. He watches, mute, as she takes off the grill, 
               puts the manuscript into the barbecue itself where the 
               charcoal goes, spritzes it with lighter fluid. The grill is 
               close enough to the bed for him to reach out and drop a match.

                                     PAUL
                         When I mentioned a snack, I was 
                         thinking more along the lines of a
                         cheese and crackers kind of thing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, looking at him.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, this is no time for jokes. You 
                         must rid the world of this filth.

               She hands him the box of kitchen matches.

                                     PAUL
                         You want me to burn my book?

                                     ANNIE
                              (she nods)
                         Yes.

                                     PAUL
                         You want me to burn my book?

                                     ANNIE
                         I know this may be difficult for 
                         you, but it's for the best.

                                     PAUL
                         This isn't difficult, my agent's 
                         made dozens of copies. There's gonna 
                         be an auction on this, and every 
                         publishing house in New York is 
                         reading it now. So if you want me to 
                         burn it, fine. You're not ridding 
                         the world of anything.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, watching him.

                                     ANNIE
                              (quietly)
                         Then light the match, Paul.

                                     PAUL
                         No big deal.

                                     ANNIE
                         So you've indicated. Do it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MATCHES. PAUL'S HANDS are starting to tremble now. He 
               can't do it.

                                     ANNIE
                         I know this is the only copy, Paul. 
                         When you were twenty-four you wrote 
                         your first book and you didn't make 
                         a copy, because you didn't think 
                         anybody would take it seriously. But 
                         they did. And ever since you've never 
                         made any copies because you're 
                         superstitious--it's why you always 
                         come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. 
                         You told that story to Merv Griffin 
                         eleven years ago.

                                     PAUL
                         You know, Annie, this book never 
                         would have survived without you. 
                         When it gets to new York, there will 
                         be a big auction, and whatever it 
                         brings we can split.
                              (pause)
                         God knows you're entitled to it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. 
                         It's about decency and purity. It's 
                         about God's values.

                                     PAUL
                         You're right. You're right. I don't 
                         know what I was thinking. I'll tell 
                         you what. It doesn't have to be 
                         published. Nobody ever has to see 
                         it. I'll just keep it for myself. No 
                         one will ever have to know it exists.

                                     ANNIE
                         As long as it does exist, your mind 
                         won't ever be free. I think you should 
                         light the match, Paul.

               There is a long silence. PAUL doesn't move.

                                     ANNIE
                         Can't you see it's what God wants?

               She's holding the can of lighter fluid in her hand as she 
               speaks and absentmindedly flicks a few drops of the fluid on 
               the bed.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're so brilliant. I would think 
                         you'd certainly be able to see that.
                              (More drops fall on 
                              the bed)
                         We're put on this earth to help 
                         people, Paul. Like I'm trying to 
                         help you.

               PAUL watches as the fluid continues to drop on the bed.

                                     ANNIE
                         Please let me help you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. His hands shaking. Almost robot-like, he strikes one. 
               It flames.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're doing the right thing, Paul.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARBECUE, as Paul's hand appears, drops the match on the 
               fluid-soaked manuscript. For a moment--nothing--

               --and then, KABOOM, the goddamn thing practically explodes 
               and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring, dazed, and as the flames leap higher,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, suddenly scared and startled at the heat and the size 
               of the flames and the full baking heat and

                                     ANNIE
                              (crying out)
                         Goodness!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARBECUE. The sound is LOUDER as the flames leap up and 
               now charred bits of paper begin floating upward and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, watching, as more bits of paper rise.

                                     ANNIE
                         Goodness--Goodness--Oh, my gracious--

               And she starts trying to catch them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A PIECE OF BURNING PAPER in midair, floating against the 
               gauzy curtain, and for a moment it looks like the curtain 
               will catch fire and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, panicked, racing out of the room, going "Goodness, 
               heavens to Betsy"--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARBECUE, and what's left of the book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, and he cannot take his eyes off the disaster.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, hurrying back in, carrying a big bucket, slopping 
               water as she lifts the bucket.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LAST of the manuscript as the bucket of water is tossed 
               onto it--there's hissing and steam and as the steam clears 
               it all looks now like a log in a brackish pond.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, isn't that an oogy mess?

               As she starts to wheel the barbecue out, suddenly there is a 
               new and different sound as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, head turning toward the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE taking  a step toward the window, stopping for a moment. 
               The sound we're hearing is a motor. A HELICOPTER MOTOR. And 
               it's getting louder. Annie goes to the window now, looks 
               toward the sky as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A HELICOPTER flying along.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

               BUSTER and a PILOT are in the machine. Buster has a pair of 
               binoculars looped around his neck, a map rumpled in his lap.

                                     BUSTER
                              (pointing out)
                         That's the Steadman place up there.
                              (The pilot nods. Buster 
                              points again)
                         The only other place up here is the 
                         Wilkes farm.

               Another nod. The PILOT points down. BUSTER stares through 
               the binoculars.

               WHAT HE SEES: ANNIE'S JEEP parked in front of her house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

                         That's no '65 Mustang. There's nothing 
                         else out this way--circle on back.

               off.

               PAUL, listening as the MOTOR sound recedes.

                         I do believe the winters are getting 
                         shorter and shorter every year. People 
                         say it has something to do with the 
                         ozone layer. What do you think?

                                     PAUL
                         I don't know.

                                     ANNIE
                         Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's 
                         your Novril.
                              (she wheels the 
                              barbecue to the door; 
                              stops)
                         How does tuna casserole sound for 
                         dinner?

                                     PAUL
                         Great.

               She exits. PAUL takes the two Novril, stares at them, then 
               deliberately tucks them under his mattress.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               As PAUL is finishing the last of his tuna casserole. There 
               are two Novrils on his tray. We hear strains of TV GAME SHOW 
               THEME MUSIC. These sounds are not surprising. Paul has heard 
               them before.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               It is much smaller than Paul's and filled with religious 
               bric-a-brac, pictures of Paul Sheldon, and a TV on a portable 
               stand. Annie lies in bed, with an open bag of Cheetos resting 
               on her stomach and a big quart-sized plastic bottle of Coke 
               on the nightstand. As she munches away, she is heavily 
               engrossed in her favorite TV show, "The Love Connection." As 
               Chuck Woolery extracts the embarrassing details of a couple's 
               romantic interlude, we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Paul faintly hearing the sounds of the TV. He has now finished 
               eating. He takes the two Novril from under the mattress. He 
               then undoes the sheet, takes his fork and delicately pokes a 
               hole in the mattress, then stuffs all four pills back into 
               the hole.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               FARMHOUSE

               Coming up to dawn.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S DOOR slowly opening.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring at  the door.

               WHEELS, seen from underneath the bed, being rolled around 
               the foot of the bed. We realize PAUL is in a wheelchair with 
               ANNIE pushing him.

                                     ANNIE
                         See, isn't this nice?

                                     PAUL
                         Great. I've always wanted to visit 
                         the other side of the room.

                                     ANNIE
                         And look what I've got for you. An 
                         electric razor so you can shave 
                         yourself now.

                                     PAUL
                         If I knew this was gonna be the 
                         surprise, you could've gotten me to
                         burn all my books.

                                     ANNIE
                              (She hands him some 
                              Novril)
                         Now don't josh. This is a very big 
                         day for you, Paul. Here. You just 
                         sit tight, and I'll set everything 
                         up.

               ANNIE exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, quickly shoving the Novril into the mattress.

                                     PAUL
                         Set what up?

                                     ANNIE
                         That's the big surprise. Your new 
                         studio--after all, writers do need a 
                         place to work.

                                     PAUL
                         Work? You mean write? What in the 
                         world do you think I'd write?

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, but Paul!
                              (flushed)
                         I don't think, I know! Now that you've 
                         gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, 
                         you can go back to doing what you're 
                         great at--

                         --you're going to write a new novel-- 
                         your greatest achievement ever--
                         Misery's Return.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I know you didn't mean it when you 
                         killed her, and now you'll make it 
                         right.

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP. In an almost religious fervor.

                         Yes. It will be a book in my honor. 
                         For saving your life and nursing you 
                         back to health. I'll be the first 
                         one to read it.

                         Oh, Paul, you're going to make me 
                         the envy of the whole world...

                         You just expect me to whip something 
                         off, that it?

                                     ANNIE
                              (nods)
                         I expect nothing less than your 
                         masterpiece.

                                     PAUL
                         You do understand that this isn't 
                         the ordinary way books get written--
                         I mean, some people might actually 
                         consider this an oddball situation.

               She rolls him over to a table she has set up by the window.

                                     ANNIE
                         I have total confidence in your 
                         brilliance--besides, the view will
                         inspire you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW, as the wheelchair approaches it.

               The sky is innocent of clouds. There's a green forest climbing 
               the flank of the nearest mountain. A plot of open ground 
               between the house and the mountain. A neat red barn where 
               the livestock stay. A Jeep Cherokee, maybe five years old. A 
               Fisher plow. And no neighbors in sight. This is a desolate 
               place.

                                     ANNIE
                         You just inhale that. I'll be right 
                         back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                              (calling out)
                         I guess you don't get bothered by
                         neighbors much.

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't worry about that. You'll have 
                         total solitude so you can concentrate 
                         on your work.

                                     PAUL
                         Great.

               pens and sharpener.

               PAUL, watching her--it's all kind of amazing. She hands him 
               a box of typing paper.

                         I got you this expensive paper to 
                         type on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, looking at the paper. It's Corrasable Bond. An idea 
               hits him; he masks it as best he can.

                                     ANNIE
                              (putting the rest of 
                              the paper on the 
                              table)
                         And I got a great deal on this fifty-
                         pound clunker--on account of it's 
                         missing an "n." I told the saleslady 
                         "n" was one of the letters in my 
                         favorite writer's name.

                                     PAUL
                         It's two of the letters in my favorite 
                         nurse's name, Annie.

                         You did great, except there's just 
                         one little thing--I can't work with 
                         this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it 
                         smudges. Maybe you could go back 
                         into town and bring me some white, 
                         long-grained mimeo.

                         see how it could smudge.

                         Well, it does smudge after all--isn't 
                         that fascinating?

                         Annie. Not just the finished book, 
                         but how it's written.

                         Thank you for thinking of me.
                              (She can be so charming 
                              when she wants)
                         Anything else I can get while I'm in 
                         town? Any other crucial requirements 
                         that need satisfying? Would you like 
                         a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a 
                         handmade set of writing slippers?

                                     PAUL
                         No, just the paper will be fine.

                                     ANNIE
                              (suddenly very agitated)
                         Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, 
                         I'll bring back the whole store for 
                         you.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, what's the matter?

                                     ANNIE
                         What's the matter? I'll tell you 
                         what's the matter. I go out of my 
                         way for you. I do everything to try 
                         and make you happy. I feed you, I 
                         clean you, I dress you. And what 
                         thanks do I get? "You bought the 
                         wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on 
                         this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get 
                         your stupid paper, but you just better 
                         start showing me a little more 
                         appreciation around here, Mister 
                         Man.

               With that, she throws the ream of paper in PAUL'S LAP, causing 
               considerable pain.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOOR as she slams it shut, locks it, stomps off and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW. Annie, in a parka, can be seen storming out in 
               the direction where her Cherokee was parked. She gets in and 
               drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He heaves a sigh, reaches out toward his tortured knees, 
               then drops his head. He sees something.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BOBBY PIN on the floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as he moves toward the bobby pin. Or tries to. It's 
               brutally hard for him. The chair moves half a foot. Stops. 
               Paul strains again. Another half foot. Another.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The BOBBY PIN. The wheelchair is beside it now. PAUL reaches 
               down for it. Can't make it. Tries again. Can't. He takes a 
               deep breath, forces himself to bend, ignoring the pain. The 
               bobby pin is in his hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, inserting the bobby pin into the keyhole, beginning to 
               jimmy the lock.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LOCK--it makes a SOUND--something has caught.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, excited, trying to force the bobby pin and he's doing 
               great--until it slips from his hands, falls to the floor 
               again.

                                     PAUL
                              (furious)
                         Shit...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BOBBY PIN. Paul reaches for it. The pain has him. He 
               reaches again, involuntarily cries out. But he grabs it, 
               clutches it tight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KEYHOLE. Paul is trying to jimmy the lock a second time.

               No luck.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. In wild frustration.

                                     PAUL
                         You've written how to do this--now 
                         do it!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KEYHOLE. There is a loud CLICKING sound.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOOR as Paul turns the knob. The door opens a crack.

                                     PAUL
                              (amazed)
                         What do you know, it actually works.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, trying to get out of the room--but it's a bitch because 
               in order to get to the lock he had to move the wheelchair up 
               to the door and in order to get out, he's got to maneuver it 
               out of the way of the door and every turn of the chair's 
               wheels is an effort for him. He works at it and works at it, 
               but his energy is failing him. He's pale, perspiring. Finally 
               he succeeds, barely forces his way into the hall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, in the hallway outside. He looks around for a phone. 
               Doesn't see one. He wheels himself over to the front door, 
               tries it. It's locked from the outside.

                                     PAUL
                         What a surprise.

               He looks off into the living room, and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TELEPHONE

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, wheeling into the living room. Dark red predominates. 
               It's a musty room. Over the mantel, a photograph of a six-
               year-old ANNIE, with her mother and father in front of the 
               family car--a new 1952 Buick. These were happier times.

               The windows have bars on them.

               As PAUL begins to wheel as fast as he can toward the phone--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PHONE as PAUL at last grabs for it, gets it, punches the 
               "operator" button--

                                     PAUL
                         Operator...
                              (nothing)
                         ...OPERATOR...
                              (wildly frustrated)
                         ...Shit!

               He shakes the phone. It's terribly light. He picks it up, 
               turns it over--it's hollow, just a shell of a telephone. He 
               stares at it for a long moment, shaking his head, the 
               disappointment plain.

                                     PAUL
                         You crazy bitch...

               He puts the phone back on the table.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE GENERAL STORE. DAY.

               Annie exits the store, carrying new paper, hops into her 
               Cherokee and drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE STUDY, as PAUL enters. He looks around.

               It's stuffed with heavy, graceless furniture as well as lots 
               of coffee tables covered with knickknacks. As he, with effort, 
               wheels across it--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A shelf of BOOKS. PAUL SHELDON books. EVERY Paul Sheldon 
               book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, pausing, looking at her collection. The only book on 
               the shelf that isn't his is a large scrapbook. The title on 
               the back reads "My Life."

               He glances back at the shelf as he forces his wheelchair 
               across the study, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A SMALL TABLE with little ceramic doodads on top. The 
               wheelchair his it, one of the doodads topples--it's a penguin, 
               fragile looking, and as it's about to fall to the floor and 
               shatter--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, grabbing for it, catching it, putting it back where it 
               was. He continues his slow way across the room and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE HALLWAY.

               Out in the hallway, on his way toward the kitchen, PAUL 
               notices a door to his right. He wheels over and surprisingly 
               it opens. However, this is not a door to the outside of the  
               house, only a storage pantry. He looks around--nothing but 
               canned goods, potato chips, cereals and large plastic Coke 
               containers, etc. Just as he is about to close the door, he 
               notices an open cardboard box. He opens the flap and sees 
               all kinds of prescription drugs. Among them are a couple of 
               strips of Novril encapsulated in blisters. He grabs them and 
               stuffs them into his sweatpants. Now he closes the pantry 
               door and heads to the kitchen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN

               As PAUL approaches it. He starts to wheel his way in, but he 
               has trouble.

               He backs up slightly, wheels forward again--

               --but the door is too narrow for the chair to fit through. 
               He pounds his fists on the chair arm, staring as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BACK DOOR. It's at the far end of the kitchen leading to 
               the outside. It seems somehow less formidable than the front 
               door did. The windows around the kitchen are barred.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring at the kitchen door--

               --then without warning, he makes his move, starting to lower 
               himself out of the chair

               gently to the floor--

               --only it doesn't work that way. It's too awkward, he doesn't 
               have the strength to maneuver properly--

               --and his body tilts awkwardly out of the chair, slams hard 
               against the hard floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, crying out in pain as he lands. He lies there for a 
               moment. Little droplets of sweat are on his forehead now. He 
               is hurting.

               He closes his eyes, gathering strength--

               --and then slowly, very slowly, inch by inch, he moves his 
               body across the floor toward the kitchen door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN DOOR. It's still a long way away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, ignoring his pain, his awkwardness, making his body 
               move.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN DOOR. Closer now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, growing pale, but he won't stop, and now the door is 
               just ahead of him, and with his good arm he reaches out and 
               up and grabs the doorknob--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN DOOR. Locked solid.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP. The disappointment and anger is plain on his 
               face. His arm drops. He lies still for a moment, panting 
               from his effort. Then--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, and his eyes are wide for a moment. You can feel his 
               wild excitement, as we

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               Sitting on the counter: A SET OF CARVING KNIVES sticking out 
               of a slotted wooden block.

               They seem to be out of reach, but that doesn't stop him. He 
               starts to crawl over to the counter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD

               ANNIE is driving along in her Cherokee. She is heading home.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN

               Now at the counter, PAUL tries to pull himself up with his 
               one good arm, but even though he is able to chin himself up 
               to the top of the counter, he is still unable to reach the 
               knives. He makes a desperate attempt which sends him crashing 
               to the floor.

               As he starts to force his way up again--from outside there 
               comes a sound--the motor of a car.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE ANNIE'S

               ANNIE, driving up to the house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN

               PAUL, throwing himself back to the floor, starting a wild 
               crawl back across the kitchen toward the wheelchair and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE ANNIE'S

               ANNIE, getting out of her Jeep and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KITCHEN

               PAUL, crawling, crawling and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE ANNIE'S

               ANNIE, walking around to the back of the Jeep and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KITCHEN

               PAUL, scrambling wildly up into his wheelchair, starting to 
               get it turned and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE'S

               ANNIE, opening the back of the Jeep and lifting out several 
               rectangular boxes of paper and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, straightened out now, forcing the wheelchair to move, 
               and now we're into a race, a crazed life-and-death race and 
               the cuts go fast--

               --and ANNIE closes the door of the car--

               --and PAUL is suddenly stuck, there's no traction on the rug--

               -- ow ANNIE, purchases in hand, starts away from the car for 
               the house--

               --and now PAUL is finally moving toward the bedroom.

               --and ANNIE is moving swiftly toward the front door.

               -- he drops one of the packages of paper.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, still biting down, churning his arms with all the 
               strength he has left. PAUL'S ARMS, aching, start to turn to 
               rubber.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE'S FEET, walking quickly across the snow-covered area 
               in front of the house and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BEDROOM DOOR as Paul gets through it, shuts it, and 
               attacks the bedroom lock with the bobby pin and

               ANNIE, unlocking the front door of the house and

               THE BEDROOM DOOR, as it locks and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE FRONT DOOR, unlocking and

               ANNIE balancing the bundles under her chin as she jiggles 
               the key out of the front door lock and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, soaked.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                              (her voice from the 
                              hallway, close and 
                              growing closer)
                         Paul, I've got your paper.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He wheels to exactly where he was when she left him. 
               He at last allows himself a sigh of relief.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOOR as the sound of a lock CLICKING is heard.

                                     ANNIE
                         Just the kind you asked for.

               And as the door opens--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL--looking down. Paul's waistband--a half a dozen strips 
               of Novril ominously stick out.

               As the door swings open, he quickly covers the Novril with 
               this hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, in the doorway, a strange look on her face.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, you're dripping with 
                         perspiration, your color is very 
                         hectic--what have you been doing?

                                     PAUL
                         You know goddamn well what I've been 
                         doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE 
                         SUFFERING. I need my pills.

                                     ANNIE
                              (tenderly, as she 
                              starts toward him)
                         Poor dear... Let's get you back in 
                         bed and I'll get them for you.

                                     PAUL
                              (exploding--a real 
                              child's tantrum)
                         I want my pills NOW!

                                     ANNIE
                         It'll only take a second.

                                     PAUL
                         I want my pain to go 'way, Annie--
                         make it go 'way, please Annie--
                              (She looks at him--
                              you can't tell if 
                              she's buying it or 
                              not)
                         --please...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. She stares a moment more, then turns, starts for the 
               door.

                                     ANNIE
                              (upset)
                         It just breaks my heart to see you
                         like this...

               CUT TO:

               PAUL watching, and the instant she is out the door in the 
               hallway, he stuffs the Novril into his pants.

                                     ANNIE (O.S.)
                              (coming closer)
                         I've done a lot of thinking on the 
                         drive...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, entering the room, the Novril in her hand. She is 
               genuinely contrite.

                                     ANNIE
                         ...and I'm absolutely convinced that 
                         the main reason I've never been more 
                         popular is because of my temper. You
                         must be so mad at me. The truth now.

               She hands him the pills. And rolls him over to the bed.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, I don't  hold grudges. After 
                         all, who doesn't let off a little 
                         steam once in a while.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL putting the pills in his mouth, as she picks him up 
               from the chair and puts him gently down in bed.

                                     ANNIE
                         My genius needs his rest before he
                         writes.

               She hands him a pad and pencil.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here, in case you think of any ideas.

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too 
                         much.

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. 
                         Think of me as your inspiration.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOORWAY, as ANNIE starts to it.

                                     ANNIE
                         I have faith in you...
                              (beat)
                         ...my darling...

               On that she turns--for the first time, a coquettish look 
               comes to her face.

                                     ANNIE
                         Catch this--
                              (she throws him a 
                              kiss--it's grotesque)
                         --ummmm-wahhhh.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, summoning up all his courage, as he mimes catching it 
               and forces a smile on. She waves, closes the door.

               HOLD ON PAUL. The smile dies. He reaches in and pulls the 
               two Novril capsules out of his mouth. Now--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

               BUSTER AND PILOT flying along. Buster is all bundled up as 
               he stares out, using the binoculars...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SOMETHING SHINY reflecting the sun.

               HOLD AS IT ALMOST BLINDS US--we're looking at the part of 
               Paul's Mustang that was revealed by the snow when Buster 
               almost found the car.

                                     BUSTER
                              (to Pilot)
                         Walter, we could be skipping lunch 
                         today.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CRASH SITE

               Paul's car being hoisted by chains from the ground and, as 
               it starts to rise up into the afternoon air...

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               THE AREA BY THE CAR--BUSTER is there and a bunch of STATE 
               POLICEMEN and various MEDIA PEOPLE are there--Buster stands 
               with the STATE POLICE CHIEF watching as the car is hoisted 
               via derrick; the sound of the powerful MOTOR lifting the car 
               is enormous and as the car keeps rising higher and higher 
               and PEOPLE take pictures and stare and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE STATE POLICE CHIEF is addressing maybe a dozen REPORTERS. 
               It's very cold. BUSTER stands slightly away from the group.

                                     STATE POLICE CHIEF
                         The presumption must now be that 
                         Paul Sheldon is dead. We know he 
                         somehow crawled out of his car. But 
                         we have been unable to locate his 
                         body in the vicinity of the crash. 
                         We also know if anyone had found 
                         him, they would have taken him to an 
                         area hospital. His body is undoubtedly 
                         out there buried somewhere in the 
                         snow. We'll find him after the first 
                         thaw--unless the animals have gotten 
                         to him first.
                              (beat)
                         I'll take questions.

               After the first sentence, a very cold and very unhappy BUSTER 
               leaves the gathering.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S CAR as Buster studies it, especially the area by the 
               driver's side where there are still dents visible from Annie's

               VIRGINIA moves to him now. They exchange a glance, start 
               walking together toward their car.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CHIEF, surrounded--people are asking questions, raising 
               hands for attention, and as he answers them--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER AND VIRGINIA, close together, walking toward their 
               car.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         You don't think he's dead, do you?

                                     BUSTER
                         He might well be. But not the way 
                         they say. He didn't crawl out of 
                         that car by himself. You saw those 
                         dents on the door--someone pulled 
                         him out.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         It was an old car--those dents could 
                         have been there forever.

                                     BUSTER
                         There's two kinds of people that 
                         drive around in old cars: the ones 
                         that can't afford new ones, and the 
                         ones who wouldn't give 'em up for 
                         anything in the world. That second
                         bunch don't drive around with twenty-
                         five-year-old dents.

               As they drive off...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               PAUL lies in bed listening to the strains of "The Love 
               Connection," coming from upstairs. As Chuck Woolery drones 
               on, Paul is intently involved in folding a piece of paper 
               from his pad. He is making a container of some sort. He 
               finishes, then reaches down and grabs the Novril capsules 
               that he has been stashing in the mattress.

               Carefully, he opens one and pours it into the palm of his 
               hand. First he smells it--no odor--then he takes a tiny bit 
               on a finger and tastes it--no taste. Then, he takes his paper 
               container and empties the contents of all the pills into it, 
               then places it under the mattress.

               Now, what to do with the empty capsules. He thinks for a 
               second, then--what the hell--he swallows them. He then places 
               the packet back in the mattress.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TYPEWRITER. DAY.

               The window is visible behind it. From this angle, it almost 
               seems to be staring at PAUL, broken "n" and all. PAUL tests 
               his wounded arm. He's able to raise it a few inches, but 
               that's it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

               ANNIE is visible heading for the barn, followed by MISERY, 
               the pig. For a moment, she stops, turns to look back.

                                     ANNIE
                              (calling out)
                         Don't be nervous--
                              (beat)
                         --just remember, I'll treasure 
                         whatever you do.

               Now, as she turns again, moves quickly away--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He rolls in a piece of paper, types briefly.

               PAUL, studying the paper. He takes it out, starts to roll in 
               a new sheet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring at the blank page. He takes a deep breath, 
               glances outside, then back to the paper.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, and now there's a brief light behind his eyes and 
               suddenly he types a burst, stares at what he's written.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He closes his eyes briefly, mutters something, kind of 
               nods, opens his eyes, grabs for another piece of paper, rolls 
               it in and starts mechanically to type.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL WORKING in his room. ANNIE  enters, the first pages of 
               manuscript in her hands. It's dusk.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, 
                         you'll have to do it over again.

                                     PAUL
                              (totally stunned)
                         What? What happened to "I'll treasure
                         whatever you do?"

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw 
                         it all out except for the part of 
                         naming that gravedigger after me. 
                         You can leave that in.

                                     PAUL
                         I really value your criticism, but 
                         maybe you're being a little hasty 
                         here.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, what you've written just isn't 
                         fair.

                                     PAUL
                         --not fair?

                         That's right--when I was growing up 
                         in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in 
                         all the world was to go to the movies 
                         on Saturday afternoons for the chapter 
                         plays...

                                     PAUL
                              (it just comes out)
                         --cliff-hangers--

                              (suddenly angry)
                         I know that, Mister Man--they also 
                         call them serials. I'm not stupid, 
                         you know.
                              (and she's a child 
                              again)
                         Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, 
                         and once it was a no-brakes chapter, 
                         the bad guys stuck him in a car on a 
                         mountain road and knocked him out 
                         and welded the doors shut and tore 
                         out the brakes and started him to 
                         his death and he woke up and tried 
                         to steer and tried to get out, but 
                         the car went off a cliff before he 
                         could escape and it crashed and burned 
                         and--I was so upset and excited and 
                         the next week you better believe I 
                         was first in line and they always 
                         start with the end of the last week 
                         and there was Rocket Man trying to 
                         get out, and here came the cliff and 
                         JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped 
                         free and all the kids cheered--
                              (standing up now)
                         --but I didn't cheer, I stood right 
                         up and started shouting, "This isn't 
                         what happened last week--have you 
                         all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED 
                         US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP. Still in her childhood reverie. Shouting:

                         "HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE 
                         CAR!"

                                     PAUL
                         They always cheated like that in 
                         cliff--
                              (stops himself)
                         --chapter plays.

                         But not you. Not with my Misery. 
                         Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary 
                         at the end of the last book, but his 
                         horse fell jumping that fence and 
                         Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs 
                         and lay there all night in the ditch 
                         so he never reached the doctor, so 
                         there couldn't have been any 
                         "experimental blood transfusion" 
                         that saved her life. Misery was buried 
                         in the ground at the end, Paul, so 
                         you'll have to start there.

               As she goes--

                                     PAUL
                         Look at this, I've got Lizzie Borden 
                         for an editor, here.

               PAUL slumps, staring barefully at the typewriter.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NEXT MORNING.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. DAY.

               PAUL is at the table. He takes the Novril off his breakfast 
               tray, wheels over to the bed, and stuffs them into the 
               mattress. He hears FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall. He smoothly 
               wheels back to the table. A pause.

               ANNIE enters to remove the tray.

                                     ANNIE
                         What's the matter, Paul? You haven't 
                         written a word.

                                     PAUL
                         I can't write this anymore.

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't be silly. Of course you can.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm telling you, I can't.

                                     ANNIE
                         You can--you have the "gotta"--

                                     PAUL
                         The what?

                                     ANNIE
                         The "gotta." Remember, you talked 
                         about it in Playboy magazine. You 
                         said there's a million things you 
                         can't do in this world; you can't 
                         hit a curve ball, you can't fix a 
                         leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- 
                         but there's one thing you always 
                         have, and that's the power of the 
                         "gotta."

                                     PAUL
                         I said that?

                                     ANNIE
                         You said you can make it so they 
                         gotta turn the page. You know, "I 
                         'gotta' know will she live," "I

                         ends." You said it. I don't usually 
                         buy that magazine. I only got it,

                              (quietly)
                         What about a bee...?

                                     PAUL
                         Nothing.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               PAUL in the wheelchair watching as ANNIE finishes reading.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?

                                     ANNIE
                         You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian 
                         realized that the reason they'd buried 
                         Misery alive was because the bee 
                         sting had put her in that temporary 
                         coma--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, in a fervor.

                         --and when Gravedigger Wilkes 
                         remembered how thirty years earlier, 
                         the same thing had happened to Lady 
                         Evelyn-Hyde--
                              (hands clasped)
                         --and then old Dr. Cleary deduced

                         long-lost daughter because of the 
                         rarity of deadly bee-stings--my heart 
                         just leapt.

               PAUL, watching her. It's as if he had nothing to do with 
               anything she's read as she goes on.

                                     ANNIE
                         I've known from the very first book 
                         that Misery had to be born of nobility 
                         and I was right!

                                     PAUL
                              (mumbling  to himself)
                         Yeah, yeah...

                         Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter 
                         when you finish? I can fill in the 
                         "n"s.

                              off again)
                         Will she be her old self, now that 
                         Ian has dug her out, or will she 
                         have amnesia...?

                                     PAUL
                         ...have to wait.

                         Will she still love him with that 
                         special perfect love?

                         Not even a hint?

               Paul shakes his head.

                         Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, 
                         it's so romantic--this whole house 
                         is going to be filled with romance. 
                         I'm going to put on my Liberace 
                         records--
                              (Stops, looks at Paul)
                         --you do like Liberace, don't you?

                              (quickly)
                         Whenever he played Radio City, who 
                         do you think was right there in the
                         front row?

                         I'm going to play my records all day

                         --to inspire you--he's my all-time 
                         favorite.

               And with that, she starts to leave.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie?

               She stops at the door.

                                     PAUL
                         Would you have dinner with me tonight?

               She can't speak.

                                     PAUL
                         To celebrate Misery's return. I 
                         couldn't have done it without you.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.

               ANNIE dashes excitedly out of the room. PAUL wheels over to 
               the bed, pulls the packet of Novril powder out from the 
               mattress and stuffs it in his pants. The sound of Liberace 
               playing "Tammy" with orchestra and chorus booms in from beyond 
               the door.

                                     PAUL
                         Jesus Christ.

                         No, he's not here. I don't know where 
                         he went. He never tells me anything 
                         anymore. He's probably out having an 
                         affair somewhere. Wait a minute. I 
                         think I hear him coming.

               BUSTER enters carrying a bagful of books.

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (to Buster)
                         It's Jim Taylor. He wants to know 
                         who you've been having an affair 
                         with.

               BUSTER. He puts the bag down, shoots Virginia a look and 
               grabs the phone. VIRGINIA looks in the bag.

                         Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh-
                         huh... Jim, we've been over this. If 
                         you're gonna have benches in front 
                         of your store, people are gonna sit 
                         on them. I don't like him either, 
                         but I'm not going to come over there 
                         and tell him to move. Give my best

                         Virginia, I'm flattered you think I 
                         got that much energy. I just figured 
                         if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at 
                         least I can find out what he wrote 
                         about.

                         cliff in a snowstorm?

                         Now, you see, it's that kind of 
                         sarcasm that's given our marriage
                         real spice.

               STUDY. NIGHT.

               PAUL is sitting at a table that Annie has set up with her 
               best china and silverware. It is as romantic as Annie Wilkes 
               gets. ANNIE enters, carrying a basket of rolls. She sits and 
               serves Paul.

                                     ANNIE
                         I hope you like it.

                                     PAUL
                         It looks wonderful. And so do you.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh...

               They eat in awkward silence. Finally:

                                     PAUL
                         I've never had meatloaf this good,
                         what do you do to it?

                                     ANNIE
                         My secret is I only use fresh 
                         tomatoes, never canned. And to give 
                         it that little extra zip, I mix in
                         some Spam with the ground beef.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh.
                              (pause)
                         You can't get this in a restaurant 
                         in New York.

               After another pause:

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, I think we should have a toast.

                                     ANNIE
                         A toast?

                                     PAUL
                         Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some
                         more wine.

               Paul pours more of the Gallo wine, then raises his glass.

                                     ANNIE
                         To Misery.

                                     PAUL
                         Wait, let's do this right. Do you 
                         have any candles?

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll 
                         go look.

               She exits into the kitchen. PAUL quickly pulls the packet 
               filled with Novril powder from his pants. He empties it into 
               her glass of wine, stuffs the empty packet back into his 
               pants, talking the whole time:

                                     PAUL
                         Did you study decorating, or do you 
                         just have a flair?

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, you. I just picked things up 
                         over the years.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, it certainly says you.

                                     ANNIE
                         You really think so?

                                     PAUL
                         Absolutely. Listen, if you can't 
                         find any, it's okay. I just thought
                         it might be nice.

               ANNIE re-enters with a candle.

                                     ANNIE
                         Are you kidding? If anyone ever told 
                         me that one day I'd be having a 
                         candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon 
                         in my own house, I woulda checked 
                         both legs to see which one was being 
                         pulled. Will this do?

                                     PAUL
                         It's perfect.

               She places the candle on the table. With a slight tremor in 
               her hand, she lights the candle. PAUL raises his glass.

                                     PAUL
                         To Misery and Annie Wilkes, who 
                         brought her back to life.

               ANNIE raises her glass.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul, every time I think about 
                         it, I get goosebumps.

               They clink glasses.

               And with that, her emotions having gotten the best of her, 
               she knocks over the candle. In trying to right the situation, 
               she places her glass back down, and as she reaches for the 
               candle, she knocks over her glass, spilling the wine.

                                     ANNIE
                              (wiping up the spilled 
                              wine with her napkin)
                         Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so 
                         sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful 
                         toast. Will you ever forgive me? 
                         Here, let me pour another one.
                              (she does)
                         Can we pretend this never happened? 
                         To Misery?

                                     PAUL
                         To Misery.

               So they drink their wine.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. DAY.

               The snow, although still present, has melted somewhat. And 
               starting now and continuing throughout is this: the sound of 
               typing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER sitting in his den reading a Misery novel by the fire. 
               VIRGINIA brings him a cup of tea.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. DAY.

               PAUL, the sling off, moving his injured arm. It's more mobile 
               than before. Testing his strength, he uses his arm to remove 
               the page and place it on the pile. He puts in another page 
               and continues to type.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Paul, this is positively the best 
                         Misery you've ever written.

                                     PAUL
                         I think you're right.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, out by the barn. She stares in at the house. Framed 
               in the window is PAUL, working. She smiles, enters the barn.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               He stretches but only briefly, then back to his typing.

               PAUL'S ROOM

               PAUL, arm out of the sling. He manages to lift the typewriter 
               once, sets it back down, puts the sling back on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, bringing a tray of food.

                                     ANNIE
                         I think it's so wonderful that Misery 
                         would sacrifice her title to take up 
                         the cause of her people. That's true 
                         nobility.

               Paul hands her some new pages. As she exits,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Annie is reading by the fire. Her pig Misery sits beside

               His lips move silently. He's not even aware of it as he nods 
               and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The pile of manuscript has doubled. Maybe two hundred pages.

               PAUL, with some effort, is pumping the typewriter up and 
               down. Finally, he places it back down and puts his arm back 
               in the sling.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE RAIN. Worse. The SOUND hit s the roof of the house, hits 
               the window.

               ANNIE, lumbering in--she's never looked like this: She's 
               wearing her slippers and her pink quilted housecoat. Her 
               eyes are without life. Her hair, loose and straggly, hangs 
               around her face. Slowly, like a  robot, she goes to PAUL, 
               who looks silently up at her.

               She drops them on the table.

                         The rain... sometimes it gives me 
                         the blues.

                         When you first came here, I only 
                         loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. 
                         But now I know I love the rest of 
                         him too. As much as Misery loves 
                         Ian.
                              (beat)
                         I know you don't love me--don't say 
                         you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, 
                         famous man of the world; and I'm...not 
                         a movie star type. You'll never know 
                         the fear of losing someone like you 
                         if you're someone like me.

                                     PAUL
                         Why would you lose me?

                         The book is almost finished. Your 
                         legs are getting better. Soon you'll 
                         be able to walk. You'll be wanting
                         to leave.

                                     PAUL
                         Why would I want to leave? I like it
                         here.

                                     ANNIE
                         That's very kind of you, but I'll 
                         bet it's not altogether true.

                                     PAUL
                         It is.

               She slowly reaches into the pocket of her bathrobe and pulls 
               out a .38 Special.

                                     ANNIE
                         I have this gun, and sometimes I 
                         think about using it.

               She is absentmindedly clicking the empty gun.

                                     ANNIE
                         I better go now. I might put bullets 
                         in it.

               Robot-like, she crosses to the door and leaves. As she closes 
               and locks the door--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, stunned, listening, waiting--

               --here is the sound of the front door closing--

               --then footsteps on the outside walk--

               --the sound of a car door opening and slamming shut.

               Now comes the GUNNING of the motor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW as ANNIE drives by, hunched over the wheel. The 
               MOTOR sound grows fainter, faint...

               ANNIE'S KITCHEN.

               The kitchen KNIVES on the counter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, now using both arms, forcing his body up toward them.

               This isn't easy, it was a bitch the first time he tried it, 
               but nothing's going to stop him now. He's leaning against 
               the cupboard, using it for balance--

               --his balance starts to go but he won't let it as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KNIVES, AS HIS HAND grabs the largest one, a fat-handled 
               sharp beauty and

               PAUL, and you can sense the relief as he begins to lower 
               himself to the floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE STUDY

               PAUL, back in his wheelchair, knife in his lap, carefully 
               opening drawers of little tables, looking inside. He closes 
               them, moves on, unmindful of the rain. Now--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SHELF OF PAUL SHELDON BOOKS. As before--

               --except the "My Life" scrapbook is gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, glancing around--

               --and there it is, on a coffee table in the living room. 
               Also on the table are a roll of Scotch tape, a pair of 
               scissors, and a copy of Newsweek. Paul wheels toward the 
               table and the book, which is as big as a folio Shakespeare 
               play and as thick as a family Bible.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LIVING ROOM

               PAUL, opening the book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE FIRST PAGE OF THE BOOK, as Paul opens it. It's a newspaper 
               clipping as is almost all of what follows. A small article: 
               simply a birth announcement for Anne Marie Wilkes.

               PAUL turns the page. This headline reads: "Investment Banker 
               Carl Wilkes Dies in Freak Fall."

               "USC Nursing Student Dies in Freak Fall." That's the headline 
               on the next page.

               Now: "Miss Wilkes is Nursing School Honors Graduate."

               Paul turns the page.

               Manchester, New Hampshire, Union Leader: "Ernest Gonyar, 79, 
               Dies After Long Illness."

               Now that phrase seems to be what catches our eye--"after 
               long illness" is from the next article. "Long illness" from 
               the one after that. Then, on the next page, a variation: 
               "Short Illness."

               Now we're in Pennsylvania: "New Hospital Staff Announced."

               And here come those phrases again on page after page--"After 
               Long Illness." "After Long Illness."

               "After Long Illness."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, transfixed; he keeps on turning the pages--the states 
               keep changing, moving west. Pennsylvania to Minnesota, 
               Minnesota to North Dakota. And always the clippings reporting 
               deaths and deaths and--

               --and now we're in Colorado. "NEW HEAD MATERNITY NURSE NAMED." 
               And now the dead are young and helpless; babies. More and 
               more of them.

                                     PAUL
                              (stunned)
                         Holy shit.

               Then a headline which reads:

               "HEAD MATERNITY NURSE QUESTIONED ON INFANT DEATHS"

               Next page: "MISS WILKES RELEASED."

               Next page: "THREE MORE INFANTS DIE."

               Next page, at last: "DRAGON LADY ARRESTED."

               Then a photo: the front page of the Rocky Mountain Gazette. 
               Annie on the courthouse steps. "DRAGON LADY CLAIMS INNOCENCE," 
               under which there is a statement by Annie Wilkes.

               Paul turns quickly to the next page and a very large headline:

               "DRAGON LADY FOUND NOT GUILTY"

               PAUL just sits there, shaking his head in bewilderment.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BOOK, as Paul turns the LAST page.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, stunned and now we find out why, as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PAGE IN THE BOOK. It's an article from Newsweek magazine, 
               a picture of Paul's car being hauled up out of the snow. 
               Above it this caption: "Presumed Dead--Paul Sheldon."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. Slamming the book shut, putting it back on the coffee 
               table, then quickly turning his wheelchair as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, steering his wheelchair toward the front door. He tries 
               to position himself for a surprise attack of ANNIE, but he 
               can't find a way to get close enough. The wheelchair is too 
               cumbersome. He looks around and decides to head back to his 
               room. He is faced with the same problem there--so he struggles 
               into bed and, lying on his back, he rests the knife on his 
               chest and stares up at the ceiling.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL'S WINDOW, hours later. The rain has stopped.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL--trying to stay awake. After a few beats, he hears 
               something. It's the sound of a CAR PULLING UP.

               HEADLIGHTS can be seen flashing through the window. PAUL 
               grips the knife and hides it under the covers. The sound of 
               a CAR DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING, then FOOTSTEPS.

               As the FRONT DOOR OPENS, PAUL girds himself for attack. THE 
               FRONT DOOR CLOSES, then a couple of FOOTSTEPS. Then silence. 
               Then the FOOTSTEPS continue down the hall and up the stairs.

               After a beat, we hear the TELEVISION. Someone is explaining 
               how you can buy millions of dollars of prime real estate 
               with no money down.

               PAUL, allowing himself to relax, slips the knife under the 
               mattress. As the TV DRONES ON, Paul lies staring up at the 
               ceiling.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NIGHT.

               We hear a clap of THUNDER and once again the rain pours down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE UP: PAUL--eyes closed. There is another loud THUNDERCLAP 
               which causes Paul to stir and open his eyes.

               He turns his head and another CLAP OF THUNDER is heard, 
               LIGHTNING flashes and reveals ANNIE standing over his bed.

               Before he can react, she jabs a needle into his arm, pulls 
               it out and starts out of the room.

               PAUL tries to raise himself, but the power of the drug causes 
               him to collapse, unconscious.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROOM. EARLY MORNING.

               It's stopped raining, PAUL lies asleep. Now, surprisingly, 
               we hear a VOICE we've never heard in the movie before--loud--
               for an instant we don't recognize the voice, then we do: 
               It's LIBERACE talking to his audience on a record going, 
               "Thank you, thank you, what a wonderful thing it is for me 
               to be back with you in Paris..." PAUL stirs and awakens to 
               discover that he is strapped to his bed. He can move his 
               arms, but that's it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, standing in the room, and she looks very together; 
               her eyes are bright. Too bright. Way too bright.

               She comes to the foot of his bed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, groggy from being drugged, tries to clear the cobwebs.

                                     ANNIE
                              (in a soft voice)
                         Paul, I know you've been out.

                                     PAUL
                         What?

                                     ANNIE
                         You've been out of your room.

                                     PAUL
                         No, I haven't.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, my little ceramic penguin in 
                         the study always faces due south.

                                     PAUL
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

               PAUL looks up at her--he is totally honest and sincere. As 
               he talks, his hand surreptitiously begins moving toward the 
               mattress edge.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, as she brings the fat-hand led knife out of her skirt 
               pocket.

                                     ANNIE
                         Is this what you're looking for? I 
                         know you've been out twice, Paul. At 
                         first, I couldn't figure out how you 
                         did it, but last night I found your 
                         key.
                              (She holds up the 
                              bobby pin)
                         I know I left  my scrapbook out, and 
                         I can imagine what you might be 
                         thinking of me. But you see, Paul, 
                         it's all okay.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, as she walks slowly back to the foot of the bed.

               And now a THUMP comes from the foot of the bed. Something is 
               out of sight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring at her; waiting.

                                     ANNIE
                         Last night it came so clear. I realize 
                         you just need more time. Eventually, 
                         you'll come to accept the idea of 
                         being here. Paul, do you know about 
                         the early days at the Kimberly Diamond 
                         Mine? Do you know what they did to 
                         the native workers who stole diamonds? 
                         Don't worry, they didn't kill them. 
                         That would be like junking a Mercedes 
                         just because it had a broken spring--
                         no, if they caught them they had to 
                         make sure they could go on working, 
                         but they also had to make sure they 
                         could never run away. The operation 
                         was called hobbling.

               And with that, she reaches down out of sight and comes up 
               holding a 16-inch piece of 4 x 4 wood.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, whatever you're thinking about, 
                         don't do it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. She wedges the 4 x 4 firmly between his legs, just 
               above the ankles, secures it and adjusts his feet.

                                     ANNIE
                         Now don't fuss, Paul.

                                     PAUL
                         Why would I run away? I'm a writer, 
                         Annie--it's all I am--and I've never 
                         written this well--even you said 
                         that this is my best, didn't you?

               ANNIE picks up a sledgehammer.

                                     PAUL
                         Didn't you? Why would I leave a place 
                         where I'm doing my best work? It 
                         doesn't make any sense.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, positioning herself to the side of his right ankle.

                                     ANNIE
                         Shh, darling, trust me--
                              (taking aim at his 
                              ankle)
                         It's for the best.

               She takes the sledgehammer back.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, for God's sake, please.

               As ANNIE swings, the sledgehammer makes contact with the 
               ankle. It breaks with a sharp CRACK.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP, shrieking.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, moving to the other side of the bed.

                                     ANNIE
                         Almost done, just one more.

               And as she breaks the other ankle, PAUL shrieks even louder.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP.

                                     ANNIE
                         God, I love you...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S FACE. He is beyond agony.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               For a long moment, nothing.

               Then... a FAINT SOUND. After a moment, it begins to become 
               more intrusive and we can tell what it is: a car horn HONKING.

               FADE IN ON:

               SILVER CREEK and ANNIE in her Cherokee, HONKING for another 
               car to get a move on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A HAND AND A COIN MOVING ACROSS IT, from finger to finger.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               BUSTER, sitting by the front window of his office, reading 
               The Rocky Mountain Gazette.

               He watches idly as ANNIE yells out the window to the car in 
               front of her. THE DRIVER of the car yells back. Annie yells 
               louder. The Driver guns off, and Annie pulls into the parking 
               space next to the General Store.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, getting out, shaking a fist at the other car, calling 
               out, "You poop!" She enters the store.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, staring straight ahead. Something is gnawing at him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, in his office, tidying the desk. BUSTER enters, 
               looks angry.

                                     BUSTER
                         Just leave it, all right?

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Oh, I like that tone.

                                     BUSTER
                         How many times do I have to tell you--
                         I have a system here.
                              (rooting through a 
                              pile of papers)
                         Where the hell is that thing?

                                     VIRGINIA
                         What thing?

                                     BUSTER
                         That thing.
                              (finding what he's 
                              looking for, a 3 x 5 
                              card)
                         Here it is. Right where it's supposed 
                         to be.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         What is it?

                                     BUSTER
                         I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         It's good you found it.

                                     BUSTER
                         There's that spice again.

               As BUSTER leaves, VIRGINIA goes back to tidying the desk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LIBRARY STACKS

               BUSTER, wearing bifocals, sits poring over bound volumes of 
               The Rocky Mountain Gazette.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, tense, adjusting his bifocals.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A SERIES OF HEADLINES pertaining to Annie Wilkes' murder 
               trial.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A HEADLINE which reads, "DRAGON LADY CLAIMS INNOCENCE."

               Under a PICTURE OF ANNIE on the courthouse steps, we see a 
               CAPTION: "Wilkes told reporters on the courthouse steps, 
               'There is a higher justice than that of man; I will be judged 
               by Him.'"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The CARD--on it is printed the exact quote we just saw in 
               the paper.

               BUSTER, sitting there, staring at the quote.

               ANNIE, carrying a bag of feed, followed by MISERY, the sow, 
               comes into view. She slows, smiles, waves--

                         Hi, Punkin.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Give us a smile?

                              finger. She laughs)
                         Such a kidder.

               As she exits our view--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, lifting the typewriter and repeatedly raising it over 
               his head, this time without any difficulty.

               THE GENERAL STORE IN SILVER CREEK. EARLY AFTERNOON.

               BUSTER enters. The place is empty. It's one of those wonderful 
               spots that stocks pretty much everything in what seems like 
               complete disarray. Buster goes to the coffee urn behind the 
               counter, helps himself. He speaks to the guy who sits behind 
               the counter nearby; these two have known each other forever.

                                     BUSTER
                         Hey, Pete.

                         If I can.

                         Do you have any of those new Paul 
                         Sheldon books?

                         We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three 
                         days.

                         You wouldn't happen to remember if 
                         Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?

                                     PETE
                         Are you kidding? Every time that 
                         fella writes a book, she makes me 
                         set aside the first copy.

               BUSTER opens the cash register, drops his coffee money inside, 
               closes the register.

                                     BUSTER
                         Has she been buying any odd things 
                         lately?

                         that.

               ANNIE, entering Paul's room. He lies back in the wheelchair, 
               eyes closed. Liberace music playing in the background. From 
               the start, PAUL'S TONE is different--strong, he's in control.

                         Paul, don't you think it's time for 
                         you to start writing again? It's 
                         been over a week.

                         I don't know, it's weird, but a couple 
                         of broken bones hasn't done a lot 
                         for my creative juices. Get the fuck 
                         out of here.

               move. Now he closes his eyes, stretches, sighs as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN

               ANNIE, busily making cocoa.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER IN HIS CAR. He stops at a mailbox. The name on the 
               box is WILKES. Buster turns his car slowly into the driveway 
               by the mailbox.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He yawns, opens his eyes briefly. Closes them. In the 
               distance now, growing more and more visible is Buster's car--

               --and now PAUL'S EYES go open wide, and he's staring out the 
               window at the car as it keeps on coming, closer, closer and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, looking around. He's driving very slowly, carefully.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. Fixating on the window and now it's all going to be 
               all right, everything's going to be all right--

               --and then ANNIE is on him, hypodermic needle in hand, jabbing 
               it into his arm. He desperately tries to fight her off, but 
               the drug starts to take hold. He tries to grab her by the 
               neck, but she fights him off as she wheels him out of the 
               room, down the hall and towards the cellar door.

                                     ANNIE
                         I don't think I'll ever understand 
                         you. I cook your meals, I tend to 
                         you practically twenty-four hours a 
                         day, and you continue to fight me. 
                         When are we going to develop a sense 
                         of trust?

               ANNIE opens the cellar door. PAUL is all but limp by now. As 
               she picks him up and starts to carry him down the steps--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER pulling up in front of the house. As he gets out of 
               his car--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE placing Paul on the cellar floor and heading up the 
               stairs. PAUL is out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER heading up the steps to the front door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE stashing the wheelchair in the hall closet. She crosses 
               to the front door, opens it, revealing BUSTER.

                                     ANNIE
                              (Gasping)
                         Oh, my!

                                     BUSTER
                         Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. 
                         You didn't give me a chance to knock.

                                     ANNIE
                              (all charm)
                         Guess you can tell from my reaction, 
                         I'm not all that used to visitors 
                         out here. What can I do for you?

                                     BUSTER
                         I was just wondering if you happen 
                         to know anything about Paul Sheldon.

                                     ANNIE
                              (stammering)
                         What do you want to know?

                                     BUSTER
                         Anything you can tell me might help.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. The words pour out--

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, he was born in Worcester, 
                         Massachusetts, forty-two years ago, 
                         the only child of Franklin and Helene 
                         Sheldon, mediocre student, majored 
                         in history...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, watching her, surprised.

                                     BUSTER
                              (cutting in)
                         Excuse me, that's not exactly the 
                         kind of information I was after. You 
                         see, he's been missing for quite 
                         some time now, and...

                                     ANNIE
                         I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his 
                         number-one fan...I've got all his 
                         books, every sentence he ever put 
                         down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon 
                         collection...
                              (stops suddenly, almost 
                              embarrassed)
                         ...here I am, prattling on and my 
                         manners have just flown away. I 
                         haven't invited you in. Please.

                                     BUSTER
                         Thank you.

               ANNIE lets BUSTER in, closes the door. They linger in front 
               of Paul's door. Buster idly checks out the hallway.

                                     ANNIE
                         'Course you must know about that 
                         horrible accident.

               BUSTER nods and wanders into the living room. ANNIE follows. 
               He crosses into the study and checks out a bookcase that 
               contains the complete works of Paul Sheldon. One shelf below 
               contains Annie's infamous scrapbook.

                                     ANNIE
                         Almost killed me, too. I prayed when 
                         I heard the news. I got down on my 
                         knees and begged for it not to be 
                         true.

               CUT TO:

               ANNIE. She's so moved. Buster wanders into the kitchen.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're going to laugh at what I'm 
                         about to say, but go ahead, I don't 
                         care...
                              (beat)
                         ...when I was praying, God told me 
                         to get ready.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, watching her. This isn't at all what he expected.

                                     BUSTER
                         Get ready for what?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, trying to fight the drug; just his eyes flutter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE and BUSTER heading back down the hallway toward Paul's 
               room.

                                     ANNIE
                         To try and be his replacement--he 
                         gave so much pleasure to so many 
                         people and there's a shortage of 
                         pleasure on this planet these days, 
                         in case you hadn't noticed.

               BUSTER enters Paul's room. ANNIE follows.

                                     ANNIE
                         God told me, since I was his number-
                         one fan, that I should make up new 
                         stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. 
                         So, went to town. And I bought a 
                         typewriter. And paper to type on. 
                         The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And 
                         I turned the guest bedroom into a 
                         writing studio. Would you like to 
                         see it?

                                     BUSTER
                         Sure.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's right this way.

               BUSTER takes a look in the bathroom. ANNIE waits for him.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's right here. I knew how he wrote, 
                         the kinds of words he used, the 
                         wonderful stories he told--
                              (moved)
                         --I've spent the last four weeks 
                         trying to write like Paul Sheldon.
                              (sad shake of the 
                              head)
                         But I can't do it right. I try and I 
                         try and I know all the words--
                              (eyes closed in despair)
                         --but it's just not the same.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. He just stands there, watches her.

                         Well...
                              (long pause)
                         ...maybe it takes time to get the 
                         hang of it.

                              from the manuscript)
                         I could give you a couple of hundred 
                         pages of mine, and you could tell me 
                         what you think.

                                     BUSTER
                         I'm not much of a critic.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, I just thought--oh, look at 
                         me. You'd think I'd never had a house 
                         guest before. Would you like something 
                         to drink?

                         Sure.

                         How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?

                                     BUSTER
                         Sounds good.

               As she exits into the kitchen.

                                     ANNIE
                         There's some already made.

               BUSTER lingers in Paul's room for a beat, then goes into the 
               hallway.

                                     BUSTER
                         Must get lonely, living out here all 
                         by yourself.

                         I always say if you can't enjoy your 
                         own company, you're not fit company 
                         for anyone else.

                                     BUSTER
                         You got a point there...

               As Buster moves up the stairs--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, still fighting the drug. His arm twitches almost 
               involuntarily, grazing the barbecue.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER opening the door to Annie's room. He looks around and 
               just as he is about to turn to leave--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, standing right in front of him.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here you are.

               BUSTER heads down the stairs, ANNIE follows.

                                     BUSTER
                         Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want 
                         to take up any more of your time. I 
                         best be going.

                                     ANNIE
                         But you didn't even taste your cocoa.

               They cross to the front door.

                                     BUSTER
                         I'm sure it's wonderful, but really 
                         should be getting back.

               BUSTER opens the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL stirring.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER and ANNIE at the door.

                                     BUSTER
                         If you don't mind, perhaps I could 
                         pay you another visit sometime.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'd be delighted. Now that you know 
                         the way...

               With that, she closes the door. We stay with BUSTER. He stands 
               on the front porch for a beat, thinking, then starts heading 
               down the porch steps. Just as he reaches about halfway down, 
               we HEAR A LOUD CRASH coming from inside the house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL--he has managed to partially fight his way through the 
               drug, and in waking has accidentally knocked over the 
               barbecue. He fights to clear the cobwebs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     BUSTER
                         Miz Wilkes, are you all right?

               There is no answer. He quietly moves into the house.

                                     BUSTER
                         Miz Wilkes?

               Again, no answer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, still fighting to gain complete consciousness.

                                     PAUL
                              (weakly)
                         Here. I'm down here. Down here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. Hearing Paul's muffled call for help, he tracks the 
               sound to the cellar door. As PAUL continues to call out, 
               Buster looks around, sees no one, and opens the cellar door. 
               The shaft of light from the open door pours down on Paul, 
               who is still lying on the floor.

                                     BUSTER
                         Mr. Sheldon?

               But before Paul can answer, there's the sound of a LOUD 
               EXPLOSION. Seemingly from nowhere a hole is ripped through 
               Buster's chest, knocking him out of frame, revealing Annie, 
               smoking shotgun in hand, standing at the top of the cellar 
               steps.

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't feel bad, Paul. It had to 
                         happen. I've been waiting for this 
                         sign.

               ANNIE walks toward BUSTER'S BODY and very casually takes his 
               gun out of its holster.

                                     ANNIE
                         I've known for some time why I was 
                         chosen to save you. You and I were 
                         meant to be together forever. But 
                         now our time in this world must end. 
                         But don't worry, Paul. I've already 
                         prepared for what must be done. I 
                         put two bullets in my gun, one for 
                         you and one for me. Oh, darling, it 
                         will be so beautiful.

               With that, ANNIE turns and exits the cellar.

               Paul's mind races desperately. He looks at the barbecue again. 
               Next to it is a messy table with a dozen jars and cans on 
               it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TABLE. One of the cans is LIGHTER FLUID.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He stares at it for a moment. An idea hits him--

               --now, PAUL struggles and crawls over to the table. He grabs 
               the lighter fluid in his hands, jams it into the rear of his 
               pants and scrambles back to where ANNIE left him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE returning with her .38 Special and a hypodermic needle. 
               She stops at the top of the stairs.

                                     ANNIE
                         Now don't be afraid. I love you.

               She starts toward him.

                                     PAUL
                         I know you do. I love you too, Annie.
                              (this stops her)
                         And you're right. We are meant to be 
                         together. And I know we must die. 
                         But it must be so that Misery can 
                         live. We have the power to give Misery 
                         eternal life. We must finish the 
                         book.

                                     ANNIE
                         But the time is now. Soon others 
                         will come.

                                     PAUL
                         It's almost done. By dawn we'll be 
                         able to give Misery back to the world.

               ANNIE stares at Paul. She could go either way on this. Then, 
               without a word, she turns and goes back up the stairs.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here, Paul. I'll fix you something 
                         to eat.

               She exits. PAUL hesitates for a moment, then realizes he has 
               no choice. He starts dragging himself over BUSTER and up the 
               stairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               PAUL working. Typing like a madman, totally concentrated on 
               the white paper. His lips move but he's not even aware of 
               it.

               ANNIE enters quietly, holding a few pages.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.

                                     PAUL
                         Three more chapters to go.

               She looks at him now, enthralled.

                                     ANNIE
                         The stranger staying at the Inn, is 
                         he someone from Misery's past?

                                     PAUL
                         Maybe.

                                     ANNIE
                         This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, 
                         her first love, right?

                                     PAUL
                         Maybe. Are you ready for the next 
                         chapter?

               He taunts her with it.

                                     ANNIE
                              (brimming with 
                              enthusiasm)
                         Oh you!

               She takes the pages and goes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. LATER.

               PAUL types a moment then rips out the page and starts over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, putting the coffee down for him, putting the pages 
               back on the main pile.

                                     ANNIE
                              (more excited now 
                              than the last time)
                         It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what 
                         does that do to her love for Ian?--
                              (thinks)
                         --of course, if she hadn't thought 
                         Windthorne was murdered she never 
                         would have fallen in love with Ian 
                         in the first place.
                              (Paul glares at her, 
                              she turns to the 
                              door)
                         Sorry, it's just that this is so 
                         wonderful.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm glad you like it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, this will be our legacy.

                                     PAUL
                         It will.

               He hands her a few more pages, she starts reading as she 
               exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. MUCH LATER.

               PAUL rubs his eyes. For a moment, he sags, but he fights it. 
               He puts a clean page into the typewriter.

               ANNIE bursts in.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind 
                         up with Ian or Windthorne? You have 
                         to tell me.

                                     PAUL
                         You'll know very soon. I'm starting 
                         the last chapter. And when I finish, 
                         I want everything to be perfect. 
                         I'll require three things.

                                     ANNIE
                         What things?

                                     PAUL
                         You don't know?

                                     ANNIE
                              (smiling)
                         I was fooling, silly.
                              (ticking them off)
                         You need a cigarette, because you 
                         used to smoke but you quit except 
                         when you finish a book, and you just 
                         have one, and the match is to light 
                         it. And you need one glass of 
                         champagne.
                              (thinks)
                         Dome Pear-igg-non.

                                     PAUL
                         Dome Pear-igg-non it is.

               AS ANNIE exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW

               The first light of morning is starting to break through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, stretching. He makes sure everything is set.

                                     PAUL
                              (calling out)
                         Annie! Annie!

               With that, she enters.

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes, Paul.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm almost done.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian 
                         and Windthorne dueling for the right 
                         to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, 
                         don't me. It's Windthorne, right?

                                     PAUL
                         You'll know everything in a minute. 
                         Get the champagne.

                                     ANNIE
                              (dying from the 
                              suspense)
                         Ahh!!!

               She exits; PAUL adjusts the manuscript on the table and then 
               types the last line.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE IN THE KITCHEN. She takes the bottle of Dom Perignon 
               out of the icebox, places it on a tray with two glasses--
               opens a drawer--takes out the gun--places it in her pocket--
               then takes out the hypodermic needle and places it on the 
               tray.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM

               ANNIE enters with the tray. She sets it down on the table.

                                     ANNIE
                         Did I do good?

                                     PAUL
                         You did perfect. Except for one thing. 
                         This time we need two glasses.

               He takes the last page out of the typewriter.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul.

               As soon as she exits, PAUL drops the manuscript to the floor, 
               pulls the lighter fluid from his pants, and starts dousing 
               the manuscript with lighter fluid. He grabs the last chapter 
               and twists the last few pages together torch style. He douses 
               it with the fluid and holds the match out of sight.

               He smiles as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE entering with the second glass...

                                     PAUL
                         It's all right here, Annie. Remember 
                         how for all those years no one ever 
                         knew who Misery's real father was, 
                         or if they'd ever be reunited? It's 
                         all right here. Will Misery finally 
                         lead her countrymen to freedom? Does 
                         she finally marry Ian or will it be 
                         Windthorne? It's all right here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MATCH, as he strikes it and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE screaming--

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, you can't.

               And as her hands fly out beseechingly--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE--it falls to the floor, explodes like a 
               torpedo, shards of glass all over, curds of foam everywhere--

                                     PAUL
                         Why not? I learned it from you...

               And on that--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LAST CHAPTER as Paul brings the match close to it and it 
               bursts into flame. And Paul, holding it like the torch it 
               is. Annie starts moving forward now.

                                     ANNIE
                         No, no, NOT MISERY--NOT MY MISERY...!

               He drops the last chapter into the soaked manuscript and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MANUSCRIPT, as KABOOM!, it bursts into flame and--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, transfixed by the sight for a moment,

               --and then she charges.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE FIRE as ANNIE rushes to the book, stoops down, grabs it 
               with both hands, brings the burning mass up to her body, 
               both arms across it, trying to smother the flames--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, grabbing the typewriter, raising it high above his 
               head, then throwing it down on her with all his power and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TYPEWRITER, crashing into the back of her head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, screaming, driven to the floor by the blow, the book 
               beneath her, and the flames fly up, her sweater is starting 
               to burn and she's covered with shards of glass from the 
               shattered bottle of champagne and some of the manuscript is 
               hissing from the liquid, but she is able to struggle to her 
               knees--

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm going to kill you, you lying 
                         cocksucker...

               As she struggles to her feet, she pulls out the gun and shoots 
               at Paul, hitting him in the shoulder. Just as she's about to 
               shoot again, Paul quickly wheels the chair up to her, throws 
               himself out of the chair, and tackles her. The gun flies out 
               of her hand and lands in the hallway, going off as it lands. 
               They wrestle on the floor.

               Flames still around them, PAUL gets on top of her, grabs 
               some burning pages, stuffs them into her mouth, shouting --

                                     PAUL
                         Here. Here. You want it? You want 
                         it? You can eat it--eat it--eat it 
                         till you fucking CHOKE--you sick, 
                         twisted fuck.

               And as he forces more paper into her mouth--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, and she's hideous--blistered, her hands claw at her 
               throat. She makes horrible sounds, spitting the charred chunks 
               of manuscript out of her mouth. Shards of glass are in her 
               hair. Now a shriek and a tremendous jerk of her body and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, falling away --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, still making the sounds as she gets to her feet, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, trying to crawl away after her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE--heading for the door, she takes a step away from Paul, 
               then another, then

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, suddenly kicking out with his shattered leg, screaming 
               in pain as it crashes into her ankle and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, trying to keep her balance, not doing well, her arms 
               windmilling as she fights for balance one last moment, fights 
               and loses, and now, as she topples over--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TYPEWRITER as she falls and her head slams into it, 
               collides with the sharp metal and a great wound opens in her 
               head. There is one final cry. Blood pours. It's over. All 
               over. We are looking at a dead body.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, exhausted, panting, lying there, trying to gather his 
               energy. He starts to crawl for the door. Just as he reaches 
               the doorjamb, an arm grabs his leg, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, shrieking, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, pulling herself up his body and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, trying to buck her off, but he can't and

               ANNIE, the stronger, relentless, moving up on him, and

               PAUL, his grip broken as he turns and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, all-powerful, looming over him and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, swelling, and the blood pours down and if she feels 
               his blows she doesn't show it and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, whatever energy he has left he uses now, trying to 
               twist and strike and as his body moves--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               METAL BASED FLOOR LAMP and

               PAUL, grabbing the thing, suddenly bringing it across his 
               body, clobbering Annie in the face and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, startled by the power of the blow and for a moment 
               she is stopped and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as with everything he has left, he crunches her forehead 
               with the sharp heavy metal base, just creams her as the air 
               is forced out of her--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. Her eyes roll up into her head. For a moment all we 
               see are the whites--

               --then she collapses on PAUL, a motionless mountain of slack 
               flesh.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, scrambling free, pushing her off him, crawling for the 
               door--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               --outside the door, as PAUL crawls into view, makes it to 
               the corridor, reaches back, closes the door, locks it.

               Safe, he collapses, exhausted against the wall opposite the 
               door.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL. HOURS LATER. It is dawn. He is awakened by a loud 
               smashing at the front door. After a couple of heart-stopping 
               pounds,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE FRONT DOOR smashes open, revealing two cops with guns 
               drawn.

               THE POLICEMEN, hurrying to PAUL. The YOUNGER COP kneels beside 
               Paul.

                                     YOUNGER COP
                         It's the writer--the dead one--

                                     PAUL
                              (trying to keep himself 
                              together)
                         --right! I'm the dead one--

                         Where's Sheriff McCain?

                                     PAUL
                         He's in the cellar. She killed him.

                                     OLDER COP
                         Annie Wilkes?

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah. She's in there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The OLDER COP, taking the key to the room, unlocks the door, 
               throws it open, and as he steps inside--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE BEDROOM

               The OLDER COP has his gun ready to fire, but even with it 
               tight in his hand, he's edgy as hell.

               He looks around--

               --glass and bloodstains on the floor. The charred remains of 
               a manuscript.

               He kneels quickly, glances under the bed--nothing.

               He looks at the window--wide open.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL and the YOUNGER COP. Pause. The OLDER COP is in the 
               doorway now.

                                     OLDER COP
                         Mr. Sheldon? There's no one in there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP. In shock.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PALM COURT, PLAZA HOTEL

               This legend appears: ONE YEAR LATER

               MARCIA SINDELL is seated at a table. PAUL enters, walking 
               briskly, and he's never looked this good before. He's gained 
               his weight back, his color is normal again. He appears to 
               be, for the first time in the movie, a jaunty, happy figure.

                                     PAUL
                         Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball 
                         game went into overtime. If anybody 
                         ever told me I'd have a daughter 
                         who'd get a triple double, I'd...

                         Did they win?

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah. They're in the semis.

                                     SINDELL
                         Here it is.
                              (big moment)
                         Very first copy.

               And she hands him a wrapped package. PAUL sits, begins 
               unwrapping it. It's a book. A new one by Paul Sheldon. The 
               Higher Education of J. Phillip Stone. Paul turns it over 
               gently in his hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         The word I'm getting is the Times 
                         review is gonna be a love letter.

                                     PAUL
                         That'd be a first.

                                     SINDELL
                         And my contacts at Time and Newsweek 
                         tell me they're both raves. And don't 
                         laugh--for the first time, I think 
                         you've got a shot at some prizes.

                                     PAUL
                              (flatly)
                         Great.

                                     SINDELL
                         I thought you'd be thrilled. You're 
                         being taken seriously.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm delighted the critics are liking 
                         it, and I hope the people like it, 
                         too. But it's not why I wrote the 
                         book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP. There is a genuine sense of peace about him. 
               He has been through the fire and survived.

                                     PAUL
                         I like it. Remember how you once 
                         said I live my whole life as if I'm 
                         in danger of being found out? Well, 
                         I believe I've managed to get that 
                         guy down on paper.
                              (He touches the book. 
                              Beat.)
                         Don't think I'm completely nuts, but 
                         in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole 
                         experience, helped me.

                                     SINDELL
                         Paul, since you brought her up, I 
                         have to ask you this, or I'd be 
                         drummed out of the agents' union--
                         what about a non-fiction book? The 
                         truth about what went on in that 
                         house.

                                     PAUL
                         Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you 
                         better, I'd think you were suggesting 
                         I dredge up the worst horror of my 
                         life just so we could make a few 
                         bucks.

                                     SINDELL
                         Now you've hurt me, Paul.

               As Paul glances around...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, looking past MARCIA.

               DESSERT TROLLEY, some distance away, being pushed by a 
               waitress. It is ANNIE.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I thought you were over it.

                                     PAUL
                         I am. Well, maybe not completely--

               He glances toward the trolley.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DESSERT TROLLEY, moving inexorably closer to PAUL. ANNIE 
               reaches down and pulls out a very sharp knife.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND SINDELL

                                     PAUL
                         I don't know if you can ever be 
                         totally over something like that--I 
                         just don't think about it as much 
                         anymore, and when I do, it's not so 
                         terrifying.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, with the knife raised.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring up at ANNIE.

                                     PAUL
                         I mean, once they found her body, my 
                         nightmares stopped.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND ANNIE--only it isn't Annie, just a WAITRESS. She 
               stands by the trolley, the knife in her hand, ready to slice 
               whatever anyone wants.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Would you care for anything?

                                     PAUL
                              (smiles)
                         Cut me something sinful...

               PAUL. The smile holds. In the background now, soft music: 
               someone might be playing "Liberace."

               HOLD ON PAUL

                                                            FINAL FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
"MISERY"

                                            by

                                     William Goldman

                                  Based on the Novel by

                                       Stephen King

                

               FADE IN ON:

               A SINGLE CIGARETTE. A MATCH. A HOTEL ICE BUCKET that holds a 
               bottle of champagne. The cigarette is unlit. The match is of 
               the kitchen variety. The champagne, unopened, is Dom Perignon. 
               There is only one sound at first: a strong WIND--

               --now another sound, sharper--a sudden burst of TYPING as we

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               PAUL SHELDON typing at a table in his hotel suite. It's really 
               a cabin that's part of a lodge. Not an ornate place. Western 
               themed.

               He is framed by a window looking out at some gorgeous 
               mountains. It's afternoon. The sky is grey. Snow is scattered 
               along the ground. We're out west somewhere. The WIND grows 
               stronger--there could be a storm.

               PAUL pays no attention to what's going on outside as he 
               continues to type.

               He's the hero of what follows. Forty-two, he's got a good 
               face, one with a certain mileage to it. We are not, in other 
               words, looking at a virgin. He's been a novelist for eighteen 
               years and for half that time, the most recent half, a 
               remarkably successful one.

               He pauses for a moment, intently, as if trying to stare a 
               hole in the paper. Now his fingers fly, and there's another 
               burst of TYPING. He studies what he's written, then--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PAPER, as he rolls it out of the machine, puts it on the 
               table, prints, in almost childlike letters, these words:

                                         THE END

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A PILE OF MANUSCRIPT at the rear of the table. He puts this 
               last page on, gets it straight and in order, hoists it up, 
               folds it to his chest, the entire manuscript--hundreds of 
               pages.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as he holds his book to him. He is, just for a brief 
               moment, moved.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A SUITCASE across the room. PAUL goes to it, opens it and 
               pulls something out from inside: a battered red leather 
               briefcase. Now he takes his manuscript, carefully opens the 
               briefcase, gently puts the manuscript inside. He closes it, 
               and the way he handles it, he might almost be handling a 
               child. Now he crosses over, opens the champagne, pours himself 
               a single glass, lights the one cigarette with the lone match--
               there is a distinct feeling of ritual about this. He inhales 
               deeply, makes a toasting gesture, then drinks, smokes, smiles.

               HOLD BRIEFLY, then--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LODGE - DAY

               PAUL--exiting his cabin. He stops, makes a snowball, throws 
               it, hitting a sign.

                                     PAUL
                         Still got it.

               He throws a suitcase into the trunk of his '65 MUSTANG and, 
               holding his leather case, he hops into the car and drives 
               away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A SIGN that reads "Silver Creek Lodge." Behind the sign is 
               the hotel itself--old, desolate. Now the '65 Mustang comes 
               out of the garage, guns ahead toward the sign. As "Shotgun" 
               by Jr. Walker and the Allstars starts, he heads off into the 
               mountains.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SKY. Gun-metal grey. The clouds seem pregnant with snow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, driving the Mustang, the battered briefcase on the 
               seat beside him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD AHEAD. Little dainty flakes of snow are suddenly 
               visible.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CAR, going into a curve and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, driving, and as he comes out of the curve, a stunned 
               look hits his face as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD AHEAD--and here it comes--a mountain storm; it's as 
               if the top has been pulled off the sky and with no warning 
               whatsoever, we're into a blizzard and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, slowing, driving deeper into the mountains.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, squinting ahead, windshield wipers on now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, rounding another curve, losing traction--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, a skilled driver, bringing the car easily under control.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD

               Snow is piling up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL driving confidently, carefully. Now he reaches out, 
               ejects the tape, expertly turns it over, pushes it in and, 
               as the MUSIC continues, he hums along with it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SKY. Only you can't see it.

               There's nothing to see  but the unending snow, nothing to 
               hear but the wind which keeps getting wilder.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD. Inches of snow on the ground now. This is desolate 
               and dangerous.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, driving.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SNOW. Worse.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD, curving sharply, drop ping. A sign reads: "Curved 
               Road, Next 13 Miles."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, coming into view, hitting the curve--no problem--
               no problem at all--and then suddenly, there is a very serious 
               problem and as the car skids out of control--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, doing his best, fighting the conditions and just as it 
               looks like he's got things going his way--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD, swerving down and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, all traction gone and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, helpless and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG, skidding, skidding and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD as it drops more steeply away and the wind whips 
               the snow across and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MUSTANG starting to spin and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MOUNTAINSIDE as the car skids off the road, careens down, 
               slams into a tree, bounces off, flips, lands upside down, 
               skids, stops finally, dead.

               HOLD ON THE CAR A MOMENT

               There is still the sound of the WIND, and there is still the 
               music coming from the tape, perhaps the only part of the car 
               left undamaged. Nothing moves inside. There is only the WIND 
               and the TAPE. The wind gets louder.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WRECK looked at from a distance. The MUSIC sounds are 
               only faintly heard.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE AREA WHERE THE WRECK IS--AS SEEN FROM THE ROAD. The car 
               is barely visible as the snow begins to cover it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WRECK from outside, and we're close to it now, with the 
               snow coming down ever harder--already bits of the car are 
               covered in white.

               CAMERA MOVES IN TO

               PAUL. He's inside and doing his best to fight is, but his 
               consciousness is going. He tries to keep his eyes open but 
               they're slits.

               Slowly, he manages to reach out with his left arm for his 
               briefcase--

               --and he clutches it to his battered body. The MUSIC continues 
               on.

               But PAUL is far from listening. His eyes flutter, flutter 
               again. Now they're starting to close.

               The man is dying.

               Motionless, he still clutches the battered briefcase.

               HOLD ON THE CASE. Then--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The BRIEFCASE in Paul's hands as he sits at a desk.

                                     SINDELL (O.S.)
                         What's that?

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               We are in New York City in the office of Paul's literary 
               agent, MARCIA SINDELL. The walls of the large room are 
               absolutely crammed with book and movie posters, in English 
               and all other kinds of other languages, all of them featuring 
               the character of MISERY CHASTAIN, a perfectly beautiful woman. 
               Misery's Challenge, Misery's Triumph--eight of them. All 
               written by Paul Sheldon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, lifting up the battered briefcase--maybe when new it 
               cost two bucks, but he treats it like gold.

                                     PAUL
                         An old friend. I was rummaging through 
                         a closet and it was just sitting 
                         there. Like it was waiting for me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     SINDELL
                              (searching for a 
                              compliment)
                         It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... 
                         character.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TWO OF THEM

                                     PAUL
                         When I wrote my first book, I used 
                         to carry it around in this while I 
                         was looking for a publisher. That 
                         was a good book, Marcia. I was a 
                         writer then.

                                     SINDELL
                         You're still a writer.

                                     PAUL
                         I haven't been a writer since I got
                         into the Misery business--

                                     SINDELL
                              (holding up the cover 
                              art of MISERY'S CHILD)
                         Not a bad business. This thing would 
                         still be growing, too. The first 
                         printing order on Misery's Child was
                         the most ever--over a million.

                                     PAUL
                         Marcia, please.

                                     SINDELL
                         No, no. Misery Chastain put braces 
                         on your daughter's teeth and is 
                         putting her through college, bought 
                         you two houses and floor seats to 
                         the Knick games and what thanks does 
                         she get? You go and kill her.

                                     PAUL
                         Marcia, you know I started "Misery" 
                         on a lark. Do I look like a guy who 
                         writes romance novels? Do I sound 
                         like Danielle Steel? It was a one-
                         time shot and we got lucky. I never 
                         meant it to become my life. And if I 
                         hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd 
                         have ended up writing her forever.
                              (touches his briefcase)
                         For the first time in fifteen years, 
                         I think I'm really onto something 
                         here.

                                     SINDELL
                         I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really 
                         am. But you have to know--when your 
                         fans find out that you killed off 
                         their favorite heroine, they're not 
                         going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon 
                         can finally write what we've always 
                         wanted: An esoteric, semi-
                         autobiographical character study.

                                     PAUL
                              (passionately)
                         Marcia, why are you doing this to 
                         me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? 
                         Don't you think I remember how nobody 
                         gave a shit about my first books? 
                         You think I'm dying to go back to 
                         shouting in the wilderness?
                              (beat)
                         I'm doing this because I have to.
                              (Marcia is stopped)
                         Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try 
                         to finish this and I want your good 
                         thoughts--because if I can make it 
                         work ...
                              (beat)
                         I might just have something that I 
                         want on my tombstone.

               On the word "tombstone"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S TOMBSTONE--the upside down car with the blizzard coming 
               gale-force and his motionless body trapped inside the car.

               The WIND screams. PAUL'S EYES flutter, then close.

               Hold

               Keep holding as--

               Suddenly there's a new sound as a crowbar SCRATCHES at the 
               door--

               -- nd now the door is ripped open as we

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               A BUNDLED-UP FIGURE gently beginning to pull PAUL and the 
               case from the car. For a moment, it's hard to tell if it's a 
               man or woman--

               --not to let the cat out of the bag or anything, but it is, 
               very much, a woman. Her name is ANNIE WILKES and she is close 
               to Paul's age. She is in many ways a remarkable creature. 
               Strong, self-sufficient, passionate in her likes and dislikes, 
               loves and hates.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND ANNIE as she cradles him in her arms. Once he's 
               clear of the car, she lays him carefully in the snow

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND ANNIE: CLOSE UP. She slowly brings her mouth down 
               close to his. Then their lips touch as she forces air inside 
               him.

                                     ANNIE
                              (Their lips touch 
                              again. Then--)
                         You hear me--Breathe! I said 
                         breathe!!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as he starts to breathe--

               --in a moment his eyes suddenly open wide, but he's in shock, 
               the eyes see nothing--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE--the moment she sees him come to life, she goes into 
               action, lifting PAUL in a fireman's carry, starting the 
               difficult climb back up the steep hill.

               As she moves away, she and Paul are obliterated by the white 
               falling snow.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE WHITE OF WHAT SEEMS LIKE A HOSPITAL. Everything is bled 
               of color. It's all vague--

               --we are looking at this from Paul's blurred vision.

               And throughout this next sequence, there are these SOUNDS, 
               words really, but they make no sense.

               "...no... worry...

               ...be... fine...

               ...good care... you...

               ...I'm your number one fan..."

               The first thing we see during this is something all white. 
               It takes a moment before we realize it's a ceiling.

               Now, a white wall.

               An I.V. bottle is next, the medicine dripping down a tube 
               into PAUL'S LEFT ARM. The other arm is bandaged and in a 
               sling.

               ANNIE is standing beside the bed. She wears off-white and 
               seems very much like a nurse. A good nurse. She has pills in 
               her hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. Motionless, dead pale. He has a little beard now. Eyes 
               barely open, he's shaking with fever.

                                     PAUL
                              (hardly able to whisper)
                         ...where... am I...?

               ANNIE is quickly by his side.

                                     ANNIE
                              (so gently)
                         Shhh... we're just outside Silver 
                         Creek.

                                     PAUL
                         How long...?

                                     ANNIE
                         You've been here two days. You're 
                         gonna be okay.
                              (relieved)
                         My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--

                                     PAUL
                         --my number one fan.

               And now the gibberish words make sense.

                                     ANNIE
                         That's right. I'm also a nurse. Here.
                              (Now, as she brings 
                              the pills close)
                         Take these.

               She helps him to swallow, as Paul's eyes close.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               AN EXTERIOR OF THE PLACE. It's a farmhouse--we 're in a 
               desolate area with mountains in the background.

               THE HOUSE is set on a knoll so that Paul's room, although on 
               the first floor, is ten feet off the ground.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, in the room. He's not on the I.V. anymore. His fever 
               has broken. Annie enters, pills in her hand.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here.

                                     PAUL
                         What are they...?

                                     ANNIE
                         They're called Novril--they're for 
                         your pain.
                              (helps him take them)

               ANNIE applies a cool rag to his forehead.

                                     PAUL
                         Shouldn't I be in a hospital?

                                     ANNIE
                         The  blizzard was too strong. I 
                         couldn't risk trying to get you there. 
                         I tried calling, but the phone lines 
                         are down.

               PAUL tries to test his left arm.

                                     ANNIE
                              (Gently, her fingers 
                              go to his eyelids, 
                              close them)
                         Now you mustn't tire yourself. You've 
                         got to rest, you almost died.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP. Sometimes her face shows the most remarkable 
               compassion. It does now.

               HOLD ON IT briefly.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE UP ON PILLS IN ANNIE'S HAND

                                     ANNIE (O.S.)
                         Open wide.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM

               He lies in bed. His fever is gone, but he's terribly weak.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. As she lays the pills on PAUL'S TONGUE, she gives him 
               a glass of water from the nearby bed table.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, swallowing eagerly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, watching him, sympathetically.

                                     ANNIE
                         Your legs just sing grand opera when 
                         you move, don't they?
                              (Paul says nothing, 
                              but his pain is clear)
                         It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, 
                         I promise you.

                                     PAUL
                         Will I be able to walk?

                                     ANNIE
                         Of course you will. And your arm 
                         will be fine, too. Your shoulder was 
                         dislocated pretty badly, but I finally 
                         popped it back in there.
                              (proudly)
                         But what I'm most proud of is the 
                         work I did on those legs. Considering 
                         what I had around the house, I don't 
                         think there's a doctor who could 
                         have done any better.

               And now suddenly she flicks off the blankets, uncovering his 
               body.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring, stunned at the bottom half of his body as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S LEGS. From the knees down he resembles an Egyptian 
               mummy--she's splinted them with slim steel rods that look 
               like the hacksawed remains of aluminum crutches and there's 
               taping circling around.

               From the kness up they're all swollen and throbbing and 
               horribly bruised and discolored.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, lying back, stunned with disbelief.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's not nearly as bad as it looks. 
                         You have a compound fracture of the 
                         tibia in both legs, and the fibula 
                         in the left leg is fractured too. I 
                         could hear the bones moving, so it's 
                         best for your legs to remain immobile. 
                         And as soon as the roads open, I'll 
                         take you to a hospital.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP

                                     ANNIE
                         In the meantime, you've got a lot of 
                         recovering to do, and I consider it 
                         an honor that you'll do it in my 
                         home.

               HOLD on her ecstatic face.

               Then--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MISERY'S PERFECT FACE. We're back in SINDELL's office in New 
               York. The office looks just the same, posters and manuscripts 
               all over. But she doesn't.

               She holds the phone and she is fidgety, insecure.

                                     SINDELL
                         This is Marcia Sindell calling from 
                         New York City. I'd like to speak to 
                         the Silver Creek Chief of Police or 
                         the Sheriff.

                                     MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                         Which one do you want?

                                     SINDELL
                         Whichever one's not busy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SMALL OFFICE IN SILVER CREEK

               ...with a view of the mountains.

               A MARVELOUS LOOKING MAN sits at a desk, by himself, holding 
               the phone. In his sixties, he's still as bright, fast and 
               sassy as he was half-a-lifetime ago. Never mind what his 
               name is, everyone calls him BUSTER.

                                     BUSTER
                         I'm pretty sure they 're both not 
                         busy, Ms. Sindell, since they're 
                         both me. I also happen to be President 
                         of the Policeman's Benefit 
                         Association, Chairman of the 
                         Patrolman's Retirement Fund, and if 
                         you need a good fishing guide, you 
                         could do a lot worse; call me Buster, 
                         everybody does, what can I do for 
                         you?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SINDELL in her office. She pushes the speakerphone, gets up, 
               paces; she's very hesitant when she speaks about Paul. Almost 
               embarrassed--

                                     SINDELL
                         I'm a literary agent, and I feel 
                         like a fool calling you, but I think 
                         one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, 
                         might be in some kind of trouble.

                         Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon 
                         the writer?

                                     SINDELL
                         Yes.

                                     BUSTER
                         He's your client, huh?

                                     SINDELL
                         Yes, he is.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER'S OFFICE

               He rolls a penny across the back of one hand--he's very good 
               at it, doesn't even look while he does it.

                                     BUSTER
                         People sure like those Misery books.

                                     SINDELL
                         I'm sure you know Paul's been going 
                         to the Silver Creek Lodge for years 
                         to finish his books.

                                     BUSTER
                         Yeah, I understand he's been up here 
                         the last six weeks.

                                     SINDELL
                         Not quite. I just called, and they 
                         said he checked out five days ago. 
                         Isn't that a little strange?

                                     BUSTER
                         I don't know. Does he always phone 
                         you when he checks out of hotels?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SINDELL, really embarrassed now.

                                     SINDELL
                         No, no, of course not. It's just 
                         that his daughter hasn't heard from 
                         him, and when he's got a book coming 
                         out, he usually keeps in touch. So 
                         when there was no word from him...

                                     BUSTER
                         You think he might be missing?

                              (shakes her head)
                         I hate that I made this call--tell 
                         me I'm being silly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. He nods as a WOMAN enters, carrying lunch. It's his

               for the both of them.

                         Just a little over-protective, maybe.

                         Virginia? When was that blizzard?

                         Four or five days ago. Why?

               BUSTER. The penny flies across the back of his hand. He 
               doesn't look at it, stares instead out the window at the

                                     PAUL'S VOICE
                              (soft)
                         I guess it was kind of a miracle... 
                         you finding me...

               ANNIE's soft, sweet laughter is heard. She stands over him, 
               finishing shaving him with a very sharp straight razor. She 
               wears what we will come to know as her regular costume--plain 
               wool skirts, grey cardigan sweaters.

                                     ANNIE
                         No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in 
                         a way, I was following you.

                                     PAUL
                         Following me?

               ANNIE concentrates on shaving him with great care; she has 
               wonderful, strong hands.

                                     ANNIE
                              (explaining, normally)
                         Well, it wasn't any secret to me 
                         that you were staying at the Silver 
                         Creek, seeing as how I'm your number-
                         one fan and all. Some nights I'd 
                         just tool on down there, sit outside 
                         and look up at the light in your 
                         cabin--
                              (gently moves his 
                              head back, exposing 
                              his neck; this next 
                              is said with total 
                              sincerity, almost 
                              awe)
                         and I'd try to imagine what was going 
                         on in the room of the world's greatest 
                         writer.

                         Say that last part again, I didn't 
                         quite hear--

                              (smiles)
                         Don't move now--wouldn't want to 
                         hurt this neck--
                              (shaving away)
                         Well, the other afternoon I was on 
                         my way home, and there you were, 
                         leaving the Lodge, and I wondered 
                         why a literary genius would go for a 
                         drive when there was a big storm 
                         coming.

                                     PAUL
                         I didn't know it was going to be a 
                         big storm.

                                     ANNIE
                         Lucky for you, I did.
                              (pauses)
                         Lucky for me too. Because now you're 
                         alive and you can write more books. 
                         Oh, Paul, I've read everything of 
                         Yours, but the Misery novels...

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         eight of them. I love them so.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         And you're very brilliant, and you 
                         must be a good man, or you could 
                         never have created such a wondrous, 
                         loving creature as Misery Chastain.

               ANNIE starts cleaning up.

                         When do you think the phone lines'll 
                         be back up? I have to call my 
                         daughter, and I should call New York 
                         and let my agent know I'm breathing.

                                     ANNIE
                         It shouldn't be too much longer.
                              (gently)
                         Once the roads are open, the lines'll 
                         be up in no time. If you give me 
                         their numbers, I'll keep trying them 
                         for you.
                              (suddenly almost 
                              embarrassed)
                         Could I ask you a favor?
                              (Paul nods)
                         I noticed in your case there was a 
                         new Paul Sheldon book and...
                              (hesitant)
                         and I wondered if maybe...

                                     PAUL
                         You want to read it?

                         think it's about. Maybe you can come

                         things to be out of the ordinary.

                         Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to 
                         make a criticism to someone like 
                         you?

                                     PAUL
                         I can take it, go ahead.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, it's brilliantly written, but 
                         then everything you write is 
                         brilliant.

                                     PAUL
                         Pretty rough so far.

                                     ANNIE
                              (a burst)
                         The swearing, Paul.
                              (beat)
                         There, I said it.

                                     PAUL
                         The profanity bothers you?

                                     ANNIE
                         It has no nobility.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, these are slum kids, I was a 
                         slum kid, everybody talks like that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. She holds the soup bowl in one hand, the muddy-colored 
               beef barley soup close to spilling.

                                     ANNIE
                         They do not. What do you think I say 
                         when I go to the feed store in town?
                         "Now, Wally, give me a bag of that 
                         effing pigfeed and ten pounds of 
                         that bitchly cow-corn"--

               PAUL is amused by this.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SOUP, almost spilling as she gets more agitated.

                                     ANNIE
                         --and in the bank do I tell Mrs. 
                         Bollinger, "Here's one big bastard 
                         of a check, give me some of your 
                         Christing money."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, almost laughing as some soup hits the coverlet.

                                     ANNIE
                              (seeing the spill, 
                              suddenly upset)
                         There! Look there! See what you made 
                         me do!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL--his smile disappears.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, and she is just totally embarrassed.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
                         Sometimes I get so worked up. Can 
                         you ever forgive me? Here...

               She hands him his pills and starts to clean the soup off the 
               coverlet. Then she makes the sweetest smile.

                                     ANNIE
                         I love you, Paul.
                              (more embarrassed 
                              than ever)
                         Your mind. Your creativity--that's 
                         all I meant.

               Flustered, she turns away as we--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A ROAD IN THE MOUNTAINS. Piles of snow all around but it's 
               been ploughed enough so it's driveable.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A CAR coming into view. Up ahead is the sign we've already 
               seen: "Curved Road, Next 13 Miles."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE CAR

               BUSTER AND HIS WIFE VIRGINIA: Virginia is driving while Buster 
               intently studies the terrain. He reaches for a large thermos, 
               pours some coffee, offers it to her. She shakes her head. He 
               begins to sip it.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         This sure is fun.

               She puts her hand on his leg.

                                     BUSTER
                              (removing it)
                         Virginia, when you're in this car, 
                         you're not my wife, you're my deputy.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Well, this deputy would rather be 
                         home under the covers with the 
                         Sheriff.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CAR. Suddenly, it goes into a little icy spin--she fights 
               it back under control.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE CAR

                                     BUSTER
                              (suddenly)
                         Stop--stop right here.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         What? What is it?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CAR, skidding, slowing, stopping. BOTH OF THEM get out, 
               go to the edge of the road. Mountains of snow. Nothing much 
               else visible. Then Buster points.

                                     BUSTER
                         Look at that broken branch there...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, seeing it, unconvinced.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Could be the weight of the snow.

                                     BUSTER
                         Could be--or a rotten branch or a 
                         mountain lion could have landed on 
                         it. Could be a lot of things.

               He steps off the road, starts down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, watching him, worried--it's very slippery.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, graceful, in great shape, navigating down easily.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TREE that the car ran into. BUSTER reaches it, studies 
               it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, staring out after him--she can't see him because 
               the drop is both too steep and covered with trees and mounds 
               of snow.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Anything down there?

                                     BUSTER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Yeah. An enormous amount of snow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. He's moved away from the tree now, going toward where 
               the Mustang is buried.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MOUND OF SNOW with the Mustang inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, making his way closer to it, closer, staring around.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE AREA. Nothing to be seen--everything is covered with 
               mountains of snow. You could have a house down there and not 
               be able to see it. Just glaring white.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, angry, frustrated, turning around and around and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER from another angle, from behind the mound with the 
               Mustang inside--and out of his sight, glistening in the sun, 
               a bit of the door protrudes. But, of course, Buster can't 
               see it.

               HOLD ON BUSTER, in a sour mood, staring around as the edge 
               of the door continues to glisten.

               CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, on the road as Buster makes his way back up, still 
               ticked.

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (they move to the car)
                         You really think Sheldon's out there?

                                     BUSTER
                         Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's 
                         go to the newspaper office.

               As they get in the car--

               ANOTHER CAR DRIVING BY--it's Annie in her Jeep--neither she 
               nor Buster notice each other.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM

               The door opens and ANNIE enters.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake 
                         you.

                                     PAUL
                         It's fine.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               Paul's eyes fluttering awake to see the hardback copy of his 
               novel, Misery's Child, in Annie's hands. She's never been 
               more excited--

                                     ANNIE
                         They had it at the store, Paul, there 
                         was a whole batch of them there. As 
                         soon as I saw it, I slammed my money
                         down. I got the first copy.

                                     PAUL
                         Then the roads are open...

                                     ANNIE
                         The one to town is, but that's about 
                         it. I called the hospital and talked 
                         to the head orthopedic surgeon. I 
                         told him who you were and what had 
                         happened. He said as long as there's 
                         no infection, you're not in any 
                         danger, and as soon as the road to 
                         the hospital is open, they'll send 
                         an ambulance for you.

                                     PAUL
                         The phones are working?

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, mine's still out. But the ones 
                         in town were working just fine. I 
                         called that agent of yours.
                              (soft now)
                         Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very 
                         beginning.
                              (looks at him)
                         What a wonderful first page--just to 
                         read the name Misery Chastain...

                                     PAUL
                         My daughter must be going nuts.

                                     ANNIE
                         ...it's like a visit from my oldest,
                         dearest friend.

                                     PAUL
                         I was supposed to be home for her 
                         birthday three days ago.

                                     ANNIE
                         Your agent said she would tell her 
                         you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll 
                         have to wait until tomorrow if you 
                         want to speak to her yourself.

               She starts to leave, stops at the door.

                                     ANNIE
                              (She looks at him now 
                              with almost a look 
                              of amazement)
                         Oh, Paul, what a poet you are...

               As she leaves--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL, watching as she enters, moves to him, carrying a tray.

                                     ANNIE
                         I made you my speciality--scrambled 
                         eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 
                         75.

                                     PAUL
                         I guess that means it's okay.

                                     ANNIE
                         No. No, it isn't, it's--
                              (halts)
                         --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. 
                         Would "great" be insulting?

                                     PAUL
                         I can live with "great."

               He starts, with effort, to eat.

                                     ANNIE
                              (as she turns, goes)
                         No, it's not just great, it's perfect, 
                         a perfect, perfect thing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. MID-AFTERNOON

               ANNIE is clearing Paul's tray. She hands him his Novril; he 
               quickly swallows them.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm up to page 185. I always get sad 
                         when I pass the halfway point. Will 
                         you do me a favor? I'd love it if 
                         you would autograph my copy. I already 
                         have your autograph on a picture, 
                         but it would mean so much to me to 
                         get it in person. I know you're right-
                         handed, so don't worry if it's not 
                         so legible. I'll cherish it anyway.

               As PAUL signs the book:

                                     ANNIE
                         I don't mean to pry, but I've read 
                         in two magazines now where you were 
                         seeing this model who does those 
                         disgusting jeans commercials. And I 
                         said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon 
                         would never waste his time with a 
                         trampy woman like that.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, you can't believe everything 
                         you read in magazines.

                                     ANNIE
                         I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. 
                         Boy, how do they get away with 
                         printing stuff like that?

                                     PAUL
                         You'd be amazed at what some people 
                         will believe.

               He finishes the autograph, hands the book back to her.

                                     ANNIE
                         Thank you so much.

                                     PAUL
                         My pleasure.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE WINDOW - LATE - AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOOR. IT opens and guess what--a sow lumbers in.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, kind of stunned as this female pig skitters its way 
               around the room, excited, confused, slipping and sliding.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, all smiles and happiness, laughing in the doorway.

                                     ANNIE
                         I thought it was time you two should 
                         meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite 
                         beast in all the world, my sow, 
                         Misery.

                                     PAUL
                         Misery?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PIG, snorting around the room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND ANNIE, watching it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes. I told you I was your number-
                         one fan.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm getting to believe you.

                                     ANNIE
                         This farm was getting kind of dreary, 
                         what with just the few cows and 
                         chickens and me--
                              (happy)
                         But when I got Misery here, everything 
                         Changed--she just makes me smile so.

                                     PAUL
                         She's a fine... uh... pig is what 
                         she is...

                                     ANNIE
                              (scooping up the pig, 
                              holding it tight as 
                              she stands by Paul)
                         I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, 
                         and it's better than perfect--it's 
                         divine. What's the ceiling that dago 
                         painted?

                                     PAUL
                         The Sistine Chapel?

                                     ANNIE
                         Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those 
                         are the only two divine things ever 
                         in this world...

               PAUL watches as the pig skitters out of the room with ANNIE 
               in pursuit, happily imitating the pig.

                                     ANNIE
                         Woink! Whoink! Whuh-Whuh-WHOINK!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL staring after them--what the hell was that?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW. DUSK.

               ANNIE'S VOICE is heard softly.

                                     ANNIE
                         When my husband left me... I wasn't 
                         prepared, it wasn't an easy time...

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               ANNIE, standing at the window, her back to the room.

               In bed, PAUL is dealing with a bedpan, peeing.

                                     ANNIE
                         For a while I thought I might go 
                         crazy.

                                     PAUL
                         I know how that can be.

                                     ANNIE
                         I don't know about you, but what I 
                         did to get through it was I dove 
                         into work--days, nights--night shifts 
                         can be lonely at a hospital. I did a 
                         lot of reading. That was hen I first 
                         discovered Misery. She made me so 
                         happy. She made me forget all my 
                         problems.
                              (She smiles now)
                         'Course, I suppose you had a little 
                         something to do with that too.

               There is a peeing sound.

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah, well...

               He is embarrassed.

                                     ANNIE
                              (She isn't)
                         I just kept reading them over and 
                         over. I know when I finish this one--
                         and I've only got two chapters to go--
                         I'll just turn right to the front 
                         page and start reading it again.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm...

                                     ANNIE
                              (She turns around, 
                              moves to the bed)
                         Done?

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah, thanks.

                                     ANNIE
                         No problem.

               As she takes the bedpan...

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't get me wrong. I'm not against 
                         marriage per se. But it would take a 
                         pretty special guy to make me want 
                         to go down the aisle again.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, it's not something you should
                         enter into lightly.

                                     ANNIE
                         It boils down to respect. People 
                         just don't respect the institution 
                         of marriage any more. They have no 
                         sense of real commitment.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, attempting to smile. There is not much he can say to 
               this.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'd love to stay here and chat, but 
                         I'm right at the end and I gotta 
                         find out what happens.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, I hope you like it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Of course I'll like it. Misery's 
                         about to have her child. What's it 
                         gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't 
                         tell me.

               With that, she exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He's been dozing but now his eyes flutter awake as we

               THE DOOR. It opens and ANNIE enters, comes to his bedside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. Hard to see. He squints up as we

               ANNIE. CLOSE UP: her face is ashen pale.

                                     ANNIE
                         You...you dirty bird. She can't be 
                         dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! 
                         How could you?

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, in 1871, women often died in 
                         childbirth, but her spirit is the 
                         important thing, and Misery's spirit 
                         is still alive--

                                     ANNIE
                              (screaming)
                         I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER!
                         And you MURDERED her!

                                     PAUL
                         I DIDN'T...

                                     ANNIE
                         Then who did?

                                     PAUL
                         No one--she just died--she slipped 
                         away, that's all.

                                     ANNIE
                              (screaming)
                         She slipped away? She slipped away? 
                         She didn't just slip away. You did 
                         it. You did it. You did it. You did 
                         it. You murdered my Misery.

               And now she has lifted a chair--it's heavy but she's very 
               strong--and she raises it and turns on Paul, and it's high 
               above her head, and PAUL realizes that this might be it, she 
               might shatter him with it, crunch his skull--and that's just 
               what she seems she's about to do--and then she swings it, 
               not against him but against the wall, and it shatters and 
               she's panting from the effort as she turns on him again, her 
               voice surprisingly soft.

                                     ANNIE
                         I thought you were good, Paul, but 
                         you're not good, you're just another 
                         lying old dirty birdie and I don't 
                         think I better be around you for 
                         awhile.
                              (she crosses to the 
                              door, then stops)
                         And don't even think about anybody 
                         coming for you, not the doctors, not 
                         your agent, not your family--because 
                         I never called them. Nobody knows 
                         you're here. And you better hope 
                         nothing happens to me because if I 
                         die, you die.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, watching as she closes the door behind her. Then there 
               is a RATTLE OF A KEY and the sound of the door to his room 
               LOCKING.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, getting in her Cherokee and gunning away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROOM

               PAUL lies still. He looks around the room and listens for 
               sounds. All he hears are the SOUNDS OF A WINTER NIGHT in the 
               mountains. After a few beats, he takes a deep breath and 
               then begins his greatest effort of all: to force his body 
               out of bed, to make it move.

               He's still weak from what he's endured, but that's not the 
               main thing: it's the pain. Any attempt at movement and his 
               legs scream. He sags back, lies there still a moment. Slowly 
               he tries to maneuver his body off the bed. He rolls over 
               onto his stomach, then tries to lower himself onto the floor 
               by moving down head first. His good arm hits the floor, and 
               he is able to hold himself up but, realizing there is no way 
               to get out of bed without causing tremendous pain, he girds 
               himself and flings himself out of bed and comes crashing to 
               the floor.

               The pain is excruciating. After he regains his composure, he 
               slowly crawls toward the door.

               He reaches up and tries the handle. It is, in fact, locked. 
               He awkwardly tries to slam up against the door, but it is 
               much too painful and to no avail. He crawls back over to the 
               bed, realizes there's no way to climb back in, then grabs

               the blanket from the bed, wraps it around himself, and closes 
               his eyes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               BUSTER'S OFFICE. DAY.

               He sits alone at his desk on the telephone, staring at the 
               Rocky Mountain Gazette spread in front of him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE NEWSPAPER'S FRONT PAGE

               In a prominent spot on the top is what is most likely a book-
               jacket photo of Paul. Above the picture is the following: 
               "HAVE YOU SEEN PAUL SHELDON?"

               BUSTER is on the phone with Marcia Sindell.

                                     BUSTER
                         No, Ms. Sindell, there's no point in 
                         coming up here now. Everything that 
                         can be done is... Yes, we're working 
                         closely with the state police, and 
                         the FBI has been informed. Right... 
                         Right... As soon as we know anything 
                         we'll let you know. No, it's no 
                         bother. Call anytime. Bye, Ms. 
                         Sindell.

               VIRGINIA enters, carrying some files.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Here's the list of all Sheldon's 
                         credit charges. Nothing after the 
                         Silver Creek.
                              (With a glance at his 
                              dour face, she 
                              indicates the photo)
                         Any calls?

                                     BUSTER
                         Just from his agent.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. His eyes flick up to her. An almost imperceptible 
               shake of the head.

               HOLD FOR A MOMENT, then--

               FACES. They are distorted, and they come into view but 
               briefly, then change into the next distorted face. All kinds-- 
               there is no order to them

               --young, Oriental, female, male, pretty, sad, black, not so 
               pretty, happy, white, old--what we HEAR is this:

               "...You've changed my life..."

               "...I'm your number one fan..."

               "...I'm a really big fan of yours..."

               "...I'm your biggest fan..."

               "...Don't ever stop writing those Misery books..."

               "...I've read all your books, but the Misery's... well..."

               "...I'm your number one fan..."

               "...You've given me such pleasure..."

               "...I feel like you're writing just for me..."

               And now, it gets kicked up in speed and all goes faster, 
               many times overlapping.

               "...I love you... I'm your number one fan... I'm your biggest 
               fan... We love you... number one... love you... biggest... 
               love you... number one... number one... you poor dear 
               thing..."

               This last was said by Annie, out of focus, and for a moment, 
               she stays that way--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROOM, AS IT SNAPS BACK INTO FOCUS--ANNIE is standing by 
               the bed. It is dusk.

               She wears a dark blue dress and a hat with a sprig of flowers. 
               Her eyes are bright and vivacious--the fact is, this is the 
               prettiest ANNIE WILKES has ever looked.

                                     ANNIE
                         What are you doing on the floor?
                              (crossing to the bed)
                         It's my fault. If I'd had a proper 
                         hospital bed, this never would have 
                         happened. Here, let me help you back 
                         in.
                              (She lifts him back 
                              into the bed, which 
                              causes considerable 
                              pain)
                         I know this hurts, but it'll only 
                         take a few seconds. There you go. 
                         Comfy?

                                     PAUL
                              (in pain)
                         Perfect.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're such a kidder. I have a big 
                         surprise for you. But first there's
                         something you must do.

                                     PAUL
                         I don't suppose I could have a little 
                         snack while I wait for the
                         surprise?

                                     ANNIE
                         I'll get you everything you want, 
                         but you must listen first. Sometimes 
                         my thinking is a little muddy, I 
                         accept that. It's why I couldn't 
                         remember all those things they were 
                         asking me on the witness stand in 
                         Denver.

               Now she turns, goes to the doorway, keeping on talking. She 
               is never out of sight.

                                     ANNIE
                         But this time I thought clearly. I 
                         asked God about you and God said "I 
                         delivered him unto you so that you 
                         may show him the way."

                                     PAUL
                         Show me the way?

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes.

               She exits and re-enters wheeling something toward his bed. 
               It's a charcoal barbecue, the kind you use in summer for 
               cooking hamburgers. She holds several items in her arms: a 
               box of Diamond Blue Tip wooden matches, a can of lighter 
               fluid. And most noticeably, Paul's manuscript.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE AND PAUL. He watches, mute, as she takes off the grill, 
               puts the manuscript into the barbecue itself where the 
               charcoal goes, spritzes it with lighter fluid. The grill is 
               close enough to the bed for him to reach out and drop a match.

                                     PAUL
                         When I mentioned a snack, I was 
                         thinking more along the lines of a
                         cheese and crackers kind of thing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, looking at him.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, this is no time for jokes. You 
                         must rid the world of this filth.

               She hands him the box of kitchen matches.

                                     PAUL
                         You want me to burn my book?

                                     ANNIE
                              (she nods)
                         Yes.

                                     PAUL
                         You want me to burn my book?

                                     ANNIE
                         I know this may be difficult for 
                         you, but it's for the best.

                                     PAUL
                         This isn't difficult, my agent's 
                         made dozens of copies. There's gonna 
                         be an auction on this, and every 
                         publishing house in New York is 
                         reading it now. So if you want me to 
                         burn it, fine. You're not ridding 
                         the world of anything.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, watching him.

                                     ANNIE
                              (quietly)
                         Then light the match, Paul.

                                     PAUL
                         No big deal.

                                     ANNIE
                         So you've indicated. Do it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MATCHES. PAUL'S HANDS are starting to tremble now. He 
               can't do it.

                                     ANNIE
                         I know this is the only copy, Paul. 
                         When you were twenty-four you wrote 
                         your first book and you didn't make 
                         a copy, because you didn't think 
                         anybody would take it seriously. But 
                         they did. And ever since you've never 
                         made any copies because you're 
                         superstitious--it's why you always 
                         come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. 
                         You told that story to Merv Griffin 
                         eleven years ago.

                                     PAUL
                         You know, Annie, this book never 
                         would have survived without you. 
                         When it gets to new York, there will 
                         be a big auction, and whatever it 
                         brings we can split.
                              (pause)
                         God knows you're entitled to it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. 
                         It's about decency and purity. It's 
                         about God's values.

                                     PAUL
                         You're right. You're right. I don't 
                         know what I was thinking. I'll tell 
                         you what. It doesn't have to be 
                         published. Nobody ever has to see 
                         it. I'll just keep it for myself. No 
                         one will ever have to know it exists.

                                     ANNIE
                         As long as it does exist, your mind 
                         won't ever be free. I think you should 
                         light the match, Paul.

               There is a long silence. PAUL doesn't move.

                                     ANNIE
                         Can't you see it's what God wants?

               She's holding the can of lighter fluid in her hand as she 
               speaks and absentmindedly flicks a few drops of the fluid on 
               the bed.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're so brilliant. I would think 
                         you'd certainly be able to see that.
                              (More drops fall on 
                              the bed)
                         We're put on this earth to help 
                         people, Paul. Like I'm trying to 
                         help you.

               PAUL watches as the fluid continues to drop on the bed.

                                     ANNIE
                         Please let me help you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. His hands shaking. Almost robot-like, he strikes one. 
               It flames.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're doing the right thing, Paul.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARBECUE, as Paul's hand appears, drops the match on the 
               fluid-soaked manuscript. For a moment--nothing--

               --and then, KABOOM, the goddamn thing practically explodes 
               and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring, dazed, and as the flames leap higher,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, suddenly scared and startled at the heat and the size 
               of the flames and the full baking heat and

                                     ANNIE
                              (crying out)
                         Goodness!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARBECUE. The sound is LOUDER as the flames leap up and 
               now charred bits of paper begin floating upward and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, watching, as more bits of paper rise.

                                     ANNIE
                         Goodness--Goodness--Oh, my gracious--

               And she starts trying to catch them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A PIECE OF BURNING PAPER in midair, floating against the 
               gauzy curtain, and for a moment it looks like the curtain 
               will catch fire and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, panicked, racing out of the room, going "Goodness, 
               heavens to Betsy"--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARBECUE, and what's left of the book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, and he cannot take his eyes off the disaster.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, hurrying back in, carrying a big bucket, slopping 
               water as she lifts the bucket.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LAST of the manuscript as the bucket of water is tossed 
               onto it--there's hissing and steam and as the steam clears 
               it all looks now like a log in a brackish pond.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, isn't that an oogy mess?

               As she starts to wheel the barbecue out, suddenly there is a 
               new and different sound as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, head turning toward the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE taking  a step toward the window, stopping for a moment. 
               The sound we're hearing is a motor. A HELICOPTER MOTOR. And 
               it's getting louder. Annie goes to the window now, looks 
               toward the sky as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A HELICOPTER flying along.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

               BUSTER and a PILOT are in the machine. Buster has a pair of 
               binoculars looped around his neck, a map rumpled in his lap.

                                     BUSTER
                              (pointing out)
                         That's the Steadman place up there.
                              (The pilot nods. Buster 
                              points again)
                         The only other place up here is the 
                         Wilkes farm.

               Another nod. The PILOT points down. BUSTER stares through 
               the binoculars.

               WHAT HE SEES: ANNIE'S JEEP parked in front of her house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

                                     BUSTER
                         That's no '65 Mustang. There's nothing 
                         else out this way--circle on back.

               As the pilot starts to change direction

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE at the window, watching, as the helicopter turns, starts 
               off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, listening as the MOTOR sound recedes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, staring out the window.

                                     ANNIE
                         I do believe the winters are getting 
                         shorter and shorter every year. People 
                         say it has something to do with the 
                         ozone layer. What do you think?

                                     PAUL
                         I don't know.

                                     ANNIE
                         Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's 
                         your Novril.
                              (she wheels the 
                              barbecue to the door; 
                              stops)
                         How does tuna casserole sound for 
                         dinner?

                                     PAUL
                         Great.

               She exits. PAUL takes the two Novril, stares at them, then 
               deliberately tucks them under his mattress.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               As PAUL is finishing the last of his tuna casserole. There 
               are two Novrils on his tray. We hear strains of TV GAME SHOW 
               THEME MUSIC. These sounds are not surprising. Paul has heard 
               them before.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               It is much smaller than Paul's and filled with religious 
               bric-a-brac, pictures of Paul Sheldon, and a TV on a portable 
               stand. Annie lies in bed, with an open bag of Cheetos resting 
               on her stomach and a big quart-sized plastic bottle of Coke 
               on the nightstand. As she munches away, she is heavily 
               engrossed in her favorite TV show, "The Love Connection." As 
               Chuck Woolery extracts the embarrassing details of a couple's 
               romantic interlude, we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Paul faintly hearing the sounds of the TV. He has now finished 
               eating. He takes the two Novril from under the mattress. He 
               then undoes the sheet, takes his fork and delicately pokes a 
               hole in the mattress, then stuffs all four pills back into 
               the hole.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               FARMHOUSE

               Coming up to dawn.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S DOOR slowly opening.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring at  the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               WHEELS, seen from underneath the bed, being rolled around 
               the foot of the bed. We realize PAUL is in a wheelchair with 
               ANNIE pushing him.

                                     ANNIE
                         See, isn't this nice?

                                     PAUL
                         Great. I've always wanted to visit 
                         the other side of the room.

                                     ANNIE
                         And look what I've got for you. An 
                         electric razor so you can shave 
                         yourself now.

                                     PAUL
                         If I knew this was gonna be the 
                         surprise, you could've gotten me to
                         burn all my books.

                                     ANNIE
                              (She hands him some 
                              Novril)
                         Now don't josh. This is a very big 
                         day for you, Paul. Here. You just 
                         sit tight, and I'll set everything 
                         up.

               ANNIE exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, quickly shoving the Novril into the mattress.

                                     PAUL
                         Set what up?

                                     ANNIE
                         That's the big surprise. Your new 
                         studio--after all, writers do need a 
                         place to work.

                                     PAUL
                         Work? You mean write? What in the 
                         world do you think I'd write?

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, but Paul!
                              (flushed)
                         I don't think, I know! Now that you've 
                         gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, 
                         you can go back to doing what you're 
                         great at--
                              (beat)
                         --you're going to write a new novel-- 
                         your greatest achievement ever--
                         Misery's Return.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. Stunned.

                              (after a beat)
                         Misery's Return?

                         I know you didn't mean it when you 
                         killed her, and now you'll make it 
                         right.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP. In an almost religious fervor.

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes. It will be a book in my honor. 
                         For saving your life and nursing you 
                         back to health. I'll be the first 
                         one to read it.
                              (beat)
                         Oh, Paul, you're going to make me 
                         the envy of the whole world...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL

                                     PAUL
                         You just expect me to whip something 
                         off, that it?

                                     ANNIE
                              (nods)
                         I expect nothing less than your 
                         masterpiece.

                                     PAUL
                         You do understand that this isn't 
                         the ordinary way books get written--
                         I mean, some people might actually 
                         consider this an oddball situation.

               She rolls him over to a table she has set up by the window.

                                     ANNIE
                         I have total confidence in your 
                         brilliance--besides, the view will
                         inspire you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW, as the wheelchair approaches it.

               The sky is innocent of clouds. There's a green forest climbing 
               the flank of the nearest mountain. A plot of open ground 
               between the house and the mountain. A neat red barn where 
               the livestock stay. A Jeep Cherokee, maybe five years old. A 
               Fisher plow. And no neighbors in sight. This is a desolate 
               place.

                                     ANNIE
                         You just inhale that. I'll be right 
                         back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring out the window.

                                     PAUL
                              (calling out)
                         I guess you don't get bothered by
                         neighbors much.

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't worry about that. You'll have 
                         total solitude so you can concentrate 
                         on your work.

                                     PAUL
                         Great.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE in the doorway, carrying reams of typing paper, pencils, 
               pens and sharpener.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, watching her--it's all kind of amazing. She hands him 
               a box of typing paper.

                                     ANNIE
                         I got you this expensive paper to 
                         type on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, looking at the paper. It's Corrasable Bond. An idea 
               hits him; he masks it as best he can.

                                     ANNIE
                              (putting the rest of 
                              the paper on the 
                              table)
                         And I got a great deal on this fifty-
                         pound clunker--on account of it's 
                         missing an "n." I told the saleslady 
                         "n" was one of the letters in my 
                         favorite writer's name.

                                     PAUL
                         It's two of the letters in my favorite 
                         nurse's name, Annie.

                                     ANNIE
                              (embarrassed, blushing)
                         You--fooler...!
                              (turns, grabs up pens, 
                              pencils, paper)
                         Did I do good?

                                     PAUL
                              (gesturing to the box 
                              of paper)
                         You did great, except there's just 
                         one little thing--I can't work with 
                         this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it 
                         smudges. Maybe you could go back 
                         into town and bring me some white, 
                         long-grained mimeo.

                                     ANNIE
                         But mine cost the most so I don't 
                         see how it could smudge.

                                     PAUL
                              (quickly taking a 
                              sheet of paper, making 
                              a pencil mark on it)
                         C'mere, I'll show you.

               As she approaches, he rubs his thumb over the pencil mark.

                                     ANNIE
                              (looking at it)
                         Well, it does smudge after all--isn't 
                         that fascinating?

                                     PAUL
                         I thought you'd be interested. I'd 
                         like you to be in on everything, 
                         Annie. Not just the finished book, 
                         but how it's written.

                                     ANNIE
                         Thank you for thinking of me.
                              (She can be so charming 
                              when she wants)
                         Anything else I can get while I'm in 
                         town? Any other crucial requirements 
                         that need satisfying? Would you like 
                         a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a 
                         handmade set of writing slippers?

                                     PAUL
                         No, just the paper will be fine.

                                     ANNIE
                              (suddenly very agitated)
                         Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, 
                         I'll bring back the whole store for 
                         you.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, what's the matter?

                                     ANNIE
                         What's the matter? I'll tell you 
                         what's the matter. I go out of my 
                         way for you. I do everything to try 
                         and make you happy. I feed you, I 
                         clean you, I dress you. And what 
                         thanks do I get? "You bought the 
                         wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on 
                         this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get 
                         your stupid paper, but you just better 
                         start showing me a little more 
                         appreciation around here, Mister 
                         Man.

               With that, she throws the ream of paper in PAUL'S LAP, causing 
               considerable pain.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOOR as she slams it shut, locks it, stomps off and

               THE WINDOW. Annie, in a parka, can be seen storming out in 
               the direction where her Cherokee was parked. She gets in and 
               drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He heaves a sigh, reaches out toward his tortured knees, 
               then drops his head. He sees something.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BOBBY PIN on the floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as he moves toward the bobby pin. Or tries to. It's 
               brutally hard for him. The chair moves half a foot. Stops. 
               Paul strains again. Another half foot. Another.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The BOBBY PIN. The wheelchair is beside it now. PAUL reaches 
               down for it. Can't make it. Tries again. Can't. He takes a 
               deep breath, forces himself to bend, ignoring the pain. The 
               bobby pin is in his hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, inserting the bobby pin into the keyhole, beginning to 
               jimmy the lock.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LOCK--it makes a SOUND--something has caught.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, excited, trying to force the bobby pin and he's doing 
               great--until it slips from his hands, falls to the floor 
               again.

                                     PAUL
                              (furious)
                         Shit...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BOBBY PIN. Paul reaches for it. The pain has him. He 
               reaches again, involuntarily cries out. But he grabs it, 
               clutches it tight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KEYHOLE. Paul is trying to jimmy the lock a second time.

               No luck.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. In wild frustration.

                                     PAUL
                         You've written how to do this--now 
                         do it!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KEYHOLE. There is a loud CLICKING sound.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DOOR as Paul turns the knob. The door opens a crack.

                                     PAUL
                              (amazed)
                         What do you know, it actually works.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, trying to get out of the room--but it's a bitch because 
               in order to get to the lock he had to move the wheelchair up 
               to the door and in order to get out, he's got to maneuver it 
               out of the way of the door and every turn of the chair's 
               wheels is an effort for him. He works at it and works at it, 
               but his energy is failing him. He's pale, perspiring. Finally 
               he succeeds, barely forces his way into the hall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, in the hallway outside. He looks around for a phone. 
               Doesn't see one. He wheels himself over to the front door, 
               tries it. It's locked from the outside.

                                     PAUL
                         What a surprise.

               He looks off into the living room, and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TELEPHONE

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, wheeling into the living room. Dark red predominates. 
               It's a musty room. Over the mantel, a photograph of a six-
               year-old ANNIE, with her mother and father in front of the 
               family car--a new 1952 Buick. These were happier times.

               The windows have bars on them.

               As PAUL begins to wheel as fast as he can toward the phone--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PHONE as PAUL at last grabs for it, gets it, punches the 
               "operator" button--

                                     PAUL
                         Operator...
                              (nothing)
                         ...OPERATOR...
                              (wildly frustrated)
                         ...Shit!

               He shakes the phone. It's terribly light. He picks it up, 
               turns it over--it's hollow, just a shell of a telephone. He 
               stares at it for a long moment, shaking his head, the 
               disappointment plain.

                                     PAUL
                         You crazy bitch...

               He puts the phone back on the table.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE GENERAL STORE. DAY.

               Annie exits the store, carrying new paper, hops into her 
               Cherokee and drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE STUDY, as PAUL enters. He looks around.

               It's stuffed with heavy, graceless furniture as well as lots 
               of coffee tables covered with knickknacks. As he, with effort, 
               wheels across it--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A shelf of BOOKS. PAUL SHELDON books. EVERY Paul Sheldon 
               book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, pausing, looking at her collection. The only book on 
               the shelf that isn't his is a large scrapbook. The title on 
               the back reads "My Life."

               He glances back at the shelf as he forces his wheelchair 
               across the study, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A SMALL TABLE with little ceramic doodads on top. The 
               wheelchair his it, one of the doodads topples--it's a penguin, 
               fragile looking, and as it's about to fall to the floor and 
               shatter--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, grabbing for it, catching it, putting it back where it 
               was. He continues his slow way across the room and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE HALLWAY.

               Out in the hallway, on his way toward the kitchen, PAUL 
               notices a door to his right. He wheels over and surprisingly 
               it opens. However, this is not a door to the outside of the  
               house, only a storage pantry. He looks around--nothing but 
               canned goods, potato chips, cereals and large plastic Coke 
               containers, etc. Just as he is about to close the door, he 
               notices an open cardboard box. He opens the flap and sees 
               all kinds of prescription drugs. Among them are a couple of 
               strips of Novril encapsulated in blisters. He grabs them and 
               stuffs them into his sweatpants. Now he closes the pantry 
               door and heads to the kitchen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN

               As PAUL approaches it. He starts to wheel his way in, but he 
               has trouble.

               He backs up slightly, wheels forward again--

               --but the door is too narrow for the chair to fit through. 
               He pounds his fists on the chair arm, staring as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BACK DOOR. It's at the far end of the kitchen leading to 
               the outside. It seems somehow less formidable than the front 
               door did. The windows around the kitchen are barred.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring at the kitchen door--

               --then without warning, he makes his move, starting to lower 
               himself out of the chair

               gently to the floor--

               --only it doesn't work that way. It's too awkward, he doesn't 
               have the strength to maneuver properly--

               --and his body tilts awkwardly out of the chair, slams hard 
               against the hard floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, crying out in pain as he lands. He lies there for a 
               moment. Little droplets of sweat are on his forehead now. He 
               is hurting.

               He closes his eyes, gathering strength--

               --and then slowly, very slowly, inch by inch, he moves his 
               body across the floor toward the kitchen door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN DOOR. It's still a long way away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, ignoring his pain, his awkwardness, making his body 
               move.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN DOOR. Closer now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, growing pale, but he won't stop, and now the door is 
               just ahead of him, and with his good arm he reaches out and 
               up and grabs the doorknob--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN DOOR. Locked solid.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP. The disappointment and anger is plain on his 
               face. His arm drops. He lies still for a moment, panting 
               from his effort. Then--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, and his eyes are wide for a moment. You can feel his 
               wild excitement, as we

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               Sitting on the counter: A SET OF CARVING KNIVES sticking out 
               of a slotted wooden block.

               They seem to be out of reach, but that doesn't stop him. He 
               starts to crawl over to the counter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROAD

               ANNIE is driving along in her Cherokee. She is heading home.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN

               Now at the counter, PAUL tries to pull himself up with his 
               one good arm, but even though he is able to chin himself up 
               to the top of the counter, he is still unable to reach the 
               knives. He makes a desperate attempt which sends him crashing 
               to the floor.

               As he starts to force his way up again--from outside there 
               comes a sound--the motor of a car.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE ANNIE'S

               ANNIE, driving up to the house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KITCHEN

               PAUL, throwing himself back to the floor, starting a wild 
               crawl back across the kitchen toward the wheelchair and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, getting out of her Jeep and

               KITCHEN

               PAUL, crawling, crawling and

               OUTSIDE ANNIE'S

               ANNIE, walking around to the back of the Jeep and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KITCHEN

               PAUL, scrambling wildly up into his wheelchair, starting to 
               get it turned and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE'S

               ANNIE, opening the back of the Jeep and lifting out several 
               rectangular boxes of paper and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, straightened out now, forcing the wheelchair to move, 
               and now we're into a race, a crazed life-and-death race and 
               the cuts go fast--

               --and ANNIE closes the door of the car--

               --and PAUL is suddenly stuck, there's no traction on the rug--

               -- ow ANNIE, purchases in hand, starts away from the car for 
               the house--

               --and now PAUL is finally moving toward the bedroom.

               --and ANNIE is moving swiftly toward the front door.

               -- he drops one of the packages of paper.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, still biting down, churning his arms with all the 
               strength he has left. PAUL'S ARMS, aching, start to turn to 
               rubber.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE'S FEET, walking quickly across the snow-covered area 
               in front of the house and

               THE BEDROOM DOOR as Paul gets through it, shuts it, and 
               attacks the bedroom lock with the bobby pin and

               THE FRONT DOOR, unlocking and

               ANNIE balancing the bundles under her chin as she jiggles 
               the key out of the front door lock and

                         Paul, I've got your paper.

               PAUL. He wheels to exactly where he was when she left him. 
               He at last allows himself a sigh of relief.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Just the kind you asked for.

               And as the door opens--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL--looking down. Paul's waistband--a half a dozen strips 
               of Novril ominously stick out.

               As the door swings open, he quickly covers the Novril with 
               this hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, in the doorway, a strange look on her face.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, you're dripping with 
                         perspiration, your color is very 
                         hectic--what have you been doing?

                                     PAUL
                         You know goddamn well what I've been 
                         doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE 
                         SUFFERING. I need my pills.

                                     ANNIE
                              (tenderly, as she 
                              starts toward him)
                         Poor dear... Let's get you back in 
                         bed and I'll get them for you.

                                     PAUL
                              (exploding--a real 
                              child's tantrum)
                         I want my pills NOW!

                                     ANNIE
                         It'll only take a second.

                                     PAUL
                         I want my pain to go 'way, Annie--

                              (She looks at him--
                              you can't tell if 
                              she's buying it or 
                              not)

               ANNIE. She stares a moment more, then turns, starts for the 
               door.

                                     ANNIE
                              (upset)
                         It just breaks my heart to see you
                         like this...

               CUT TO:

               PAUL watching, and the instant she is out the door in the 
               hallway, he stuffs the Novril into his pants.

                                     ANNIE (O.S.)
                              (coming closer)
                         I've done a lot of thinking on the 
                         drive...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, entering the room, the Novril in her hand. She is 
               genuinely contrite.

                         ...and I'm absolutely convinced that 
                         the main reason I've never been more 
                         popular is because of my temper. You
                         must be so mad at me. The truth now.

               She hands him the pills. And rolls him over to the bed.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, I don't  hold grudges. After 
                         all, who doesn't let off a little 
                         steam once in a while.

               PAUL putting the pills in his mouth, as she picks him up 
               from the chair and puts him gently down in bed.

                         My genius needs his rest before he
                         writes.

               She hands him a pad and pencil.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here, in case you think of any ideas.

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too 
                         much.

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. 
                         Think of me as your inspiration.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                              (beat)
                         ...my darling...

               On that she turns--for the first time, a coquettish look 
               comes to her face.

                                     ANNIE
                         Catch this--

                              kiss--it's grotesque)
                         --ummmm-wahhhh.

               PAUL, summoning up all his courage, as he mimes catching it 
               and forces a smile on. She waves, closes the door.

               HOLD ON PAUL. The smile dies. He reaches in and pulls the 
               two Novril capsules out of his mouth. Now--

               BUSTER AND PILOT flying along. Buster is all bundled up as 
               he stares out, using the binoculars...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SOMETHING SHINY reflecting the sun.

               HOLD AS IT ALMOST BLINDS US--we're looking at the part of 
               Paul's Mustang that was revealed by the snow when Buster 
               almost found the car.

                                     BUSTER
                              (to Pilot)
                         Walter, we could be skipping lunch 
                         today.

               CRASH SITE

               Paul's car being hoisted by chains from the ground and, as

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               THE AREA BY THE CAR--BUSTER is there and a bunch of STATE 
               POLICEMEN and various MEDIA PEOPLE are there--Buster stands 
               with the STATE POLICE CHIEF watching as the car is hoisted 
               via derrick; the sound of the powerful MOTOR lifting the car 
               is enormous and as the car keeps rising higher and higher 
               and PEOPLE take pictures and stare and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE STATE POLICE CHIEF is addressing maybe a dozen REPORTERS. 
               It's very cold. BUSTER stands slightly away from the group.

                         The presumption must now be that 
                         Paul Sheldon is dead. We know he 
                         somehow crawled out of his car. But 
                         we have been unable to locate his 
                         body in the vicinity of the crash. 
                         We also know if anyone had found 
                         him, they would have taken him to an 
                         area hospital. His body is undoubtedly 
                         out there buried somewhere in the 
                         snow. We'll find him after the first 
                         thaw--unless the animals have gotten 
                         to him first.
                              (beat)
                         I'll take questions.

               After the first sentence, a very cold and very unhappy BUSTER 
               leaves the gathering.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               crowbar.

               VIRGINIA moves to him now. They exchange a glance, start 
               walking together toward their car.

               THE CHIEF, surrounded--people are asking questions, raising 
               hands for attention, and as he answers them--

               car.

                         You don't think he's dead, do you?

                                     BUSTER
                         He might well be. But not the way 
                         they say. He didn't crawl out of 
                         that car by himself. You saw those 
                         dents on the door--someone pulled 
                         him out.

                         It was an old car--those dents could 
                         have been there forever.

                                     BUSTER
                         There's two kinds of people that 
                         drive around in old cars: the ones 
                         that can't afford new ones, and the 
                         ones who wouldn't give 'em up for 
                         anything in the world. That second
                         bunch don't drive around with twenty-
                         five-year-old dents.

               As they drive off...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               PAUL lies in bed listening to the strains of "The Love 
               Connection," coming from upstairs. As Chuck Woolery drones 
               on, Paul is intently involved in folding a piece of paper 
               from his pad. He is making a container of some sort. He 
               finishes, then reaches down and grabs the Novril capsules 
               that he has been stashing in the mattress.

               Carefully, he opens one and pours it into the palm of his 
               hand. First he smells it--no odor--then he takes a tiny bit 
               on a finger and tastes it--no taste. Then, he takes his paper 
               container and empties the contents of all the pills into it, 
               then places it under the mattress.

               Now, what to do with the empty capsules. He thinks for a 
               second, then--what the hell--he swallows them. He then places 
               the packet back in the mattress.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TYPEWRITER. DAY.

               The window is visible behind it. From this angle, it almost 
               seems to be staring at PAUL, broken "n" and all. PAUL tests 
               his wounded arm. He's able to raise it a few inches, but 
               that's it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE is visible heading for the barn, followed by MISERY, 
               the pig. For a moment, she stops, turns to look back.

               Now, as she turns again, moves quickly away--

               PAUL, staring at the blank page. He takes a deep breath, 
               glances outside, then back to the paper.

               PAUL, and now there's a brief light behind his eyes and 
               suddenly he types a burst, stares at what he's written.

               PAUL. He closes his eyes briefly, mutters something, kind of 
               nods, opens his eyes, grabs for another piece of paper, rolls 
               it in and starts mechanically to type.

               PAUL WORKING in his room. ANNIE  enters, the first pages of

                         I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, 
                         you'll have to do it over again.

                              (totally stunned)
                         What? What happened to "I'll treasure

                         it all out except for the part of 
                         naming that gravedigger after me. 
                         You can leave that in.

                         I really value your criticism, but 
                         maybe you're being a little hasty 
                         here.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, what you've written just isn't 
                         fair.

                                     PAUL
                         --not fair?

                                     ANNIE
                         That's right--when I was growing up 
                         in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in 
                         all the world was to go to the movies 
                         on Saturday afternoons for the chapter 
                         plays...

                                     PAUL
                              (it just comes out)
                         --cliff-hangers--

                                     ANNIE
                              (suddenly angry)
                         I know that, Mister Man--they also 
                         call them serials. I'm not stupid, 
                         you know.
                              (and she's a child 
                              again)
                         Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, 
                         and once it was a no-brakes chapter, 
                         the bad guys stuck him in a car on a 
                         mountain road and knocked him out 
                         and welded the doors shut and tore 
                         out the brakes and started him to 
                         his death and he woke up and tried 
                         to steer and tried to get out, but 
                         the car went off a cliff before he 
                         could escape and it crashed and burned 
                         and--I was so upset and excited and 
                         the next week you better believe I 
                         was first in line and they always 
                         start with the end of the last week 
                         and there was Rocket Man trying to 
                         get out, and here came the cliff and 
                         JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped 
                         free and all the kids cheered--
                              (standing up now)
                         --but I didn't cheer, I stood right 
                         up and started shouting, "This isn't 
                         what happened last week--have you 
                         all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED 
                         US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP. Still in her childhood reverie. Shouting:

                                     ANNIE
                         "HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE 
                         CAR!"

                                     PAUL
                         They always cheated like that in 
                         cliff--
                              (stops himself)
                         --chapter plays.

                                     ANNIE
                         But not you. Not with my Misery. 
                         Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary 
                         at the end of the last book, but his 
                         horse fell jumping that fence and 
                         Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs 
                         and lay there all night in the ditch 
                         so he never reached the doctor, so 
                         there couldn't have been any 
                         "experimental blood transfusion" 
                         that saved her life. Misery was buried 
                         in the ground at the end, Paul, so 
                         you'll have to start there.

               As she goes--

                                     PAUL
                         Look at this, I've got Lizzie Borden 
                         for an editor, here.

               PAUL slumps, staring barefully at the typewriter.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NIGHT.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NEXT MORNING.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. DAY.

               PAUL is at the table. He takes the Novril off his breakfast 
               tray, wheels over to the bed, and stuffs them into the 
               mattress. He hears FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall. He smoothly 
               wheels back to the table. A pause.

               ANNIE enters to remove the tray.

                                     ANNIE
                         What's the matter, Paul? You haven't 
                         written a word.

                                     PAUL
                         I can't write this anymore.

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't be silly. Of course you can.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm telling you, I can't.

                                     ANNIE
                         You can--you have the "gotta"--

                                     PAUL
                         The what?

                                     ANNIE
                         The "gotta." Remember, you talked 
                         about it in Playboy magazine. You 
                         said there's a million things you 
                         can't do in this world; you can't 
                         hit a curve ball, you can't fix a 
                         leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- 
                         but there's one thing you always 
                         have, and that's the power of the 
                         "gotta."

                                     PAUL
                         I said that?

                                     ANNIE
                         You said you can make it so they 
                         gotta turn the page. You know, "I 
                         'gotta' know will she live," "I
                         'gotta' know will he catch the 
                         killer." "I gotta see how this chapter 
                         ends." You said it. I don't usually 
                         buy that magazine. I only got it, 
                         'cause they were interviewing you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP. Blinking.

                                     PAUL
                              (quietly)
                         What about a bee...?

                                     ANNIE
                         What?

                                     PAUL
                         Nothing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KEYBOARD as the piece of paper slides in and the keys  
               start to move. Annie stands there for a moment, then quietly 
               backs out of the room.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE WINDOW. It's late afternoon.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               PAUL in the wheelchair watching as ANNIE finishes reading.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?

                                     ANNIE
                         You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian 
                         realized that the reason they'd buried 
                         Misery alive was because the bee 
                         sting had put her in that temporary 
                         coma--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, in a fervor.

                                     ANNIE
                         --and when Gravedigger Wilkes 
                         remembered how thirty years earlier, 
                         the same thing had happened to Lady 
                         Evelyn-Hyde--
                              (hands clasped)
                         --and then old Dr. Cleary deduced 
                         that Misery must be Lady Evelyn-Hyde's 
                         long-lost daughter because of the 
                         rarity of deadly bee-stings--my heart 
                         just leapt.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, watching her. It's as if he had nothing to do with 
               anything she's read as she goes on.

                                     ANNIE
                         I've known from the very first book 
                         that Misery had to be born of nobility 
                         and I was right!

                                     PAUL
                              (mumbling  to himself)
                         Yeah, yeah...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TWO OF THEM; she touches the pages as if they were gold, 
               rubbing gently with the tips of her fingers.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter 
                         when you finish? I can fill in the 
                         "n"s.
                              (Paul nods, and she's 
                              off again)
                         Will she be her old self, now that 
                         Ian has dug her out, or will she 
                         have amnesia...?

                                     PAUL
                         ...have to wait.

                                     ANNIE
                         Will she still love him with that 
                         special perfect love?

                                     PAUL
                         Have to wait.

                                     ANNIE
                              (plead ing)
                         Not even a hint?

               Paul shakes his head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, spinning around the room like a happy child.

                                     ANNIE
                         Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, 
                         it's so romantic--this whole house 
                         is going to be filled with romance. 
                         I'm going to put on my Liberace 
                         records--
                              (Stops, looks at Paul)
                         --you do like Liberace, don't you?

                                     PAUL
                              (quickly)
                         Whenever he played Radio City, who 
                         do you think was right there in the
                         front row?

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm going to play my records all day

                                     LONG
                         --to inspire you--he's my all-time 
                         favorite.

               And with that, she starts to leave.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie?

               She stops at the door.

                                     PAUL
                         Would you have dinner with me tonight?

               She can't speak.

                                     PAUL
                         To celebrate Misery's return. I 
                         couldn't have done it without you.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.

               ANNIE dashes excitedly out of the room. PAUL wheels over to 
               the bed, pulls the packet of Novril powder out from the 
               mattress and stuffs it in his pants. The sound of Liberace

               the door.

               BUSTER'S OFFICE. DUSK.

               VIRGINIA is on the phone.

                              (into phone)
                         No, he's not here. I don't know where 
                         he went. He never tells me anything 
                         anymore. He's probably out having an 
                         affair somewhere. Wait a minute. I 
                         think I hear him coming.

               BUSTER enters carrying a bagful of books.

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (to Buster)
                         It's Jim Taylor. He wants to know 
                         who you've been having an affair 
                         with.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. He puts the bag down, shoots Virginia a look and 
               grabs the phone. VIRGINIA looks in the bag.

                                     BUSTER
                         Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh-
                         huh... Jim, we've been over this. If 
                         you're gonna have benches in front 
                         of your store, people are gonna sit 
                         on them. I don't like him either, 
                         but I'm not going to come over there 
                         and tell him to move. Give my best 
                         to Denise. Bye.

                         Virginia, I'm flattered you think I 
                         got that much energy. I just figured 
                         if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at 
                         least I can find out what he wrote 
                         about.

                         What do you expect to find? A story 
                         about a guy who drove his car off a 
                         cliff in a snowstorm?

                         Now, you see, it's that kind of 
                         sarcasm that's given our marriage
                         real spice.

               STUDY. NIGHT.

               PAUL is sitting at a table that Annie has set up with her 
               best china and silverware. It is as romantic as Annie Wilkes 
               gets. ANNIE enters, carrying a basket of rolls. She sits and 
               serves Paul.

                                     ANNIE
                         I hope you like it.

                                     PAUL
                         It looks wonderful. And so do you.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh...

               They eat in awkward silence. Finally:

                                     PAUL
                         I've never had meatloaf this good,
                         what do you do to it?

                                     ANNIE
                         My secret is I only use fresh 
                         tomatoes, never canned. And to give 
                         it that little extra zip, I mix in
                         some Spam with the ground beef.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh.
                              (pause)
                         You can't get this in a restaurant 
                         in New York.

               After another pause:

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, I think we should have a toast.

                                     ANNIE
                         A toast?

                                     PAUL
                         Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some
                         more wine.

               Paul pours more of the Gallo wine, then raises his glass.

                                     ANNIE
                         To Misery.

                                     PAUL
                         Wait, let's do this right. Do you 
                         have any candles?

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll 
                         go look.

               She exits into the kitchen. PAUL quickly pulls the packet 
               filled with Novril powder from his pants. He empties it into 
               her glass of wine, stuffs the empty packet back into his 
               pants, talking the whole time:

                                     PAUL
                         Did you study decorating, or do you 
                         just have a flair?

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, you. I just picked things up 
                         over the years.

                                     PAUL
                         Well, it certainly says you.

                                     ANNIE
                         You really think so?

                                     PAUL
                         Absolutely. Listen, if you can't 
                         find any, it's okay. I just thought
                         it might be nice.

               ANNIE re-enters with a candle.

                                     ANNIE
                         Are you kidding? If anyone ever told 
                         me that one day I'd be having a 
                         candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon 
                         in my own house, I woulda checked 
                         both legs to see which one was being 
                         pulled. Will this do?

                                     PAUL
                         It's perfect.

               She places the candle on the table. With a slight tremor in 
               her hand, she lights the candle. PAUL raises his glass.

                                     PAUL
                         To Misery and Annie Wilkes, who 
                         brought her back to life.

               ANNIE raises her glass.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul, every time I think about 
                         it, I get goosebumps.

               They clink glasses.

               And with that, her emotions having gotten the best of her, 
               she knocks over the candle. In trying to right the situation, 
               she places her glass back down, and as she reaches for the 
               candle, she knocks over her glass, spilling the wine.

                                     ANNIE
                              (wiping up the spilled 
                              wine with her napkin)
                         Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so 
                         sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful 
                         toast. Will you ever forgive me? 
                         Here, let me pour another one.
                              (she does)
                         Can we pretend this never happened? 
                         To Misery?

                                     PAUL
                         To Misery.

               So they drink their wine.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The snow, although still present, has melted somewhat. And 
               starting now and continuing throughout is this: the sound of 
               typing.

               PAUL, the sling off, moving his injured arm. It's more mobile 
               than before. Testing his strength, he uses his arm to remove 
               the page and place it on the pile. He puts in another page 
               and continues to type.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Misery you've ever written.

                                     PAUL
                         I think you're right.

                         I think it's so wonderful that Misery 
                         would sacrifice her title to take up 
                         the cause of her people. That's true 
                         nobility.

               Paul hands her some new pages. As she exits,

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. DUSK.

               His lips move silently. He's not even aware of it as he nods 
               and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PAPER IN THE TYPEWRITER, line after line being written.

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               Paul's face at DAY, NIGHT, and DUSK in rapid succession, 
               ending with

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE'S FARMHOUSE. NIGHT.

               Lightning! Giant deep rolls of THUNDER as RAIN begins...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TYPEWRITER being lifted out of frame, then back in, then out 
               again.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               The pile of manuscript has doubled. Maybe two hundred pages.

               PAUL, with some effort, is pumping the typewriter up and 
               down. Finally, he places it back down and puts his arm back 
               in the sling.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, looking outside breifly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE RAIN. Worse. The SOUND hit s the roof of the house, hits 
               the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, lumbering in--she's never looked like this: She's 
               wearing her slippers and her pink quilted housecoat. Her 
               eyes are without life. Her hair, loose and straggly, hangs 
               around her face. Slowly, like a  robot, she goes to PAUL, 
               who looks silently up at her.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here's your pills.

               She drops them on the table.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as the pills hit his chest and bounce into his lap.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, what is it?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE

                                     ANNIE
                              (half turns away, 
                              turns back, gestures 
                              outside)
                         The rain... sometimes it gives me 
                         the blues.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP. And suddenly it's as if she's been turned 
               off, gone lifeless.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring at her. No sound but the rain.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, seen straight on. No light in her eyes.

                                     ANNIE
                         When you first came here, I only 
                         loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. 
                         But now I know I love the rest of 
                         him too. As much as Misery loves 
                         Ian.
                              (beat)
                         I know you don't love me--don't say 
                         you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, 
                         famous man of the world; and I'm...not 
                         a movie star type. You'll never know 
                         the fear of losing someone like you 
                         if you're someone like me.

                                     PAUL
                         Why would you lose me?

                                     ANNIE
                         The book is almost finished. Your 
                         legs are getting better. Soon you'll 
                         be able to walk. You'll be wanting
                         to leave.

                                     PAUL
                         Why would I want to leave? I like it
                         here.

                                     ANNIE
                         That's very kind of you, but I'll 
                         bet it's not altogether true.

                                     PAUL
                         It is.

               She slowly reaches into the pocket of her bathrobe and pulls 
               out a .38 Special.

                                     ANNIE
                         I have this gun, and sometimes I 
                         think about using it.

               She is absentmindedly clicking the empty gun.

                                     ANNIE
                         I better go now. I might put bullets 
                         in it.

               Robot-like, she crosses to the door and leaves. As she closes 
               and locks the door--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, stunned, listening, waiting--

               --here is the sound of the front door closing--

               --then footsteps on the outside walk--

               --the sound of a car door opening and slamming shut.

               Now comes the GUNNING of the motor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW as ANNIE drives by, hunched over the wheel. The 
               MOTOR sound grows fainter, faint...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER AND VIRGINIA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

               BUSTER AND VIRGINIA are lying in bed. Buster is reading yet 
               another Misery novel, Misery's Trial. Virginia is also 
               reading.

                                     BUSTER
                         "There is a justice higher than that 
                         of man. I will be judged by Him."

                                     VIRGINIA
                         What?

                                     BUSTER
                         They're hauling Misery into court.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         That's nice.

                                     BUSTER
                              (mutters under his 
                              breath)
                         "There is a justice higher than that 
                         of man--I will be judged by Him."

               ANNIE'S KITCHEN.

               The kitchen KNIVES on the counter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, now using both arms, forcing his body up toward them.

               This isn't easy, it was a bitch the first time he tried it, 
               but nothing's going to stop him now. He's leaning against 
               the cupboard, using it for balance--

               --his balance starts to go but he won't let it as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KNIVES, AS HIS HAND grabs the largest one, a fat-handled 
               sharp beauty and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, and you can sense the relief as he begins to lower 
               himself to the floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE STUDY

               PAUL, back in his wheelchair, knife in his lap, carefully 
               opening drawers of little tables, looking inside. He closes 
               them, moves on, unmindful of the rain. Now--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SHELF OF PAUL SHELDON BOOKS. As before--

               --except the "My Life" scrapbook is gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, glancing around--

               --and there it is, on a coffee table in the living room. 
               Also on the table are a roll of Scotch tape, a pair of 
               scissors, and a copy of Newsweek. Paul wheels toward the 
               table and the book, which is as big as a folio Shakespeare 
               play and as thick as a family Bible.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LIVING ROOM

               PAUL, opening the book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE FIRST PAGE OF THE BOOK, as Paul opens it. It's a newspaper 
               clipping as is almost all of what follows. A small article: 
               simply a birth announcement for Anne Marie Wilkes.

               PAUL turns the page. This headline reads: "Investment Banker 
               Carl Wilkes Dies in Freak Fall."

               "USC Nursing Student Dies in Freak Fall." That's the headline 
               on the next page.

               Now: "Miss Wilkes is Nursing School Honors Graduate."

               Paul turns the page.

               Manchester, New Hampshire, Union Leader: "Ernest Gonyar, 79, 
               Dies After Long Illness."

               Now that phrase seems to be what catches our eye--"after 
               long illness" is from the next article. "Long illness" from 
               the one after that. Then, on the next page, a variation: 
               "Short Illness."

               Now we're in Pennsylvania: "New Hospital Staff Announced."

               And here come those phrases again on page after page--"After 
               Long Illness." "After Long Illness."

               "After Long Illness."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, transfixed; he keeps on turning the pages--the states 
               keep changing, moving west. Pennsylvania to Minnesota, 
               Minnesota to North Dakota. And always the clippings reporting 
               deaths and deaths and--

               --and now we're in Colorado. "NEW HEAD MATERNITY NURSE NAMED." 
               And now the dead are young and helpless; babies. More and 
               more of them.

                                     PAUL
                              (stunned)
                         Holy shit.

               Then a headline which reads:

               "HEAD MATERNITY NURSE QUESTIONED ON INFANT DEATHS"

               Next page: "MISS WILKES RELEASED."

               Next page: "THREE MORE INFANTS DIE."

               Next page, at last: "DRAGON LADY ARRESTED."

               Then a photo: the front page of the Rocky Mountain Gazette. 
               Annie on the courthouse steps. "DRAGON LADY CLAIMS INNOCENCE," 
               under which there is a statement by Annie Wilkes.

               Paul turns quickly to the next page and a very large headline:

               "DRAGON LADY FOUND NOT GUILTY"

               PAUL just sits there, shaking his head in bewilderment.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BOOK, as Paul turns the LAST page.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, stunned and now we find out why, as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PAGE IN THE BOOK. It's an article from Newsweek magazine, 
               a picture of Paul's car being hauled up out of the snow. 
               Above it this caption: "Presumed Dead--Paul Sheldon."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. Slamming the book shut, putting it back on the coffee 
               table, then quickly turning his wheelchair as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, steering his wheelchair toward the front door. He tries 
               to position himself for a surprise attack of ANNIE, but he 
               can't find a way to get close enough. The wheelchair is too 
               cumbersome. He looks around and decides to head back to his 
               room. He is faced with the same problem there--so he struggles 
               into bed and, lying on his back, he rests the knife on his 
               chest and stares up at the ceiling.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL'S WINDOW, hours later. The rain has stopped.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL--trying to stay awake. After a few beats, he hears 
               something. It's the sound of a CAR PULLING UP.

               HEADLIGHTS can be seen flashing through the window. PAUL 
               grips the knife and hides it under the covers. The sound of 
               a CAR DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING, then FOOTSTEPS.

               As the FRONT DOOR OPENS, PAUL girds himself for attack. THE 
               FRONT DOOR CLOSES, then a couple of FOOTSTEPS. Then silence. 
               Then the FOOTSTEPS continue down the hall and up the stairs.

               After a beat, we hear the TELEVISION. Someone is explaining 
               how you can buy millions of dollars of prime real estate 
               with no money down.

               PAUL, allowing himself to relax, slips the knife under the 
               mattress. As the TV DRONES ON, Paul lies staring up at the 
               ceiling.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NIGHT.

               We hear a clap of THUNDER and once again the rain pours down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE UP: PAUL--eyes closed. There is another loud THUNDERCLAP 
               which causes Paul to stir and open his eyes.

               He turns his head and another CLAP OF THUNDER is heard, 
               LIGHTNING flashes and reveals ANNIE standing over his bed.

               Before he can react, she jabs a needle into his arm, pulls 
               it out and starts out of the room.

               PAUL tries to raise himself, but the power of the drug causes 
               him to collapse, unconscious.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ROOM. EARLY MORNING.

               It's stopped raining, PAUL lies asleep. Now, surprisingly, 
               we hear a VOICE we've never heard in the movie before--loud--
               for an instant we don't recognize the voice, then we do: 
               It's LIBERACE talking to his audience on a record going, 
               "Thank you, thank you, what a wonderful thing it is for me 
               to be back with you in Paris..." PAUL stirs and awakens to 
               discover that he is strapped to his bed. He can move his 
               arms, but that's it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, standing in the room, and she looks very together; 
               her eyes are bright. Too bright. Way too bright.

               She comes to the foot of his bed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, groggy from being drugged, tries to clear the cobwebs.

                                     ANNIE
                              (in a soft voice)
                         Paul, I know you've been out.

                                     PAUL
                         What?

                                     ANNIE
                         You've been out of your room.

                                     PAUL
                         No, I haven't.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, my little ceramic penguin in 
                         the study always faces due south.

                                     PAUL
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

               PAUL looks up at her--he is totally honest and sincere. As 
               he talks, his hand surreptitiously begins moving toward the 
               mattress edge.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, as she brings the fat-hand led knife out of her skirt 
               pocket.

                                     ANNIE
                         Is this what you're looking for? I 
                         know you've been out twice, Paul. At 
                         first, I couldn't figure out how you 
                         did it, but last night I found your 
                         key.
                              (She holds up the 
                              bobby pin)
                         I know I left  my scrapbook out, and 
                         I can imagine what you might be 
                         thinking of me. But you see, Paul, 
                         it's all okay.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, as she walks slowly back to the foot of the bed.

               And now a THUMP comes from the foot of the bed. Something is 
               out of sight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring at her; waiting.

                                     ANNIE
                         Last night it came so clear. I realize 
                         you just need more time. Eventually, 
                         you'll come to accept the idea of 
                         being here. Paul, do you know about 
                         the early days at the Kimberly Diamond 
                         Mine? Do you know what they did to 
                         the native workers who stole diamonds? 
                         Don't worry, they didn't kill them. 
                         That would be like junking a Mercedes 
                         just because it had a broken spring--
                         no, if they caught them they had to 
                         make sure they could go on working, 
                         but they also had to make sure they 
                         could never run away. The operation 
                         was called hobbling.

               And with that, she reaches down out of sight and comes up 
               holding a 16-inch piece of 4 x 4 wood.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, whatever you're thinking about, 
                         don't do it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. She wedges the 4 x 4 firmly between his legs, just 
               above the ankles, secures it and adjusts his feet.

                                     ANNIE
                         Now don't fuss, Paul.

                                     PAUL
                         Why would I run away? I'm a writer, 
                         Annie--it's all I am--and I've never 
                         written this well--even you said 
                         that this is my best, didn't you?

               ANNIE picks up a sledgehammer.

                                     PAUL
                         Didn't you? Why would I leave a place 
                         where I'm doing my best work? It 
                         doesn't make any sense.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, positioning herself to the side of his right ankle.

                                     ANNIE
                         Shh, darling, trust me--
                              (taking aim at his 
                              ankle)
                         It's for the best.

               She takes the sledgehammer back.

                                     PAUL
                         Annie, for God's sake, please.

               As ANNIE swings, the sledgehammer makes contact with the 
               ankle. It breaks with a sharp CRACK.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP, shrieking.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, moving to the other side of the bed.

                                     ANNIE
                         Almost done, just one more.

               And as she breaks the other ankle, PAUL shrieks even louder.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE: CLOSE UP.

                                     ANNIE
                         God, I love you...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S FACE. He is beyond agony.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               For a long moment, nothing.

               Then... a FAINT SOUND. After a moment, it begins to become 
               more intrusive and we can tell what it is: a car horn HONKING.

               FADE IN ON:

               SILVER CREEK and ANNIE in her Cherokee, HONKING for another 
               car to get a move on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A HAND AND A COIN MOVING ACROSS IT, from finger to finger.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               BUSTER, sitting by the front window of his office, reading 
               The Rocky Mountain Gazette.

               He watches idly as ANNIE yells out the window to the car in 
               front of her. THE DRIVER of the car yells back. Annie yells 
               louder. The Driver guns off, and Annie pulls into the parking 
               space next to the General Store.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, getting out, shaking a fist at the other car, calling 
               out, "You poop!" She enters the store.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, staring straight ahead. Something is gnawing at him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VIRGINIA, in his office, tidying the desk. BUSTER enters, 
               looks angry.

                                     BUSTER
                         Just leave it, all right?

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Oh, I like that tone.

                                     BUSTER
                         How many times do I have to tell you--
                         I have a system here.
                              (rooting through a 
                              pile of papers)
                         Where the hell is that thing?

                                     VIRGINIA
                         What thing?

                                     BUSTER
                         That thing.
                              (finding what he's 
                              looking for, a 3 x 5 
                              card)
                         Here it is. Right where it's supposed 
                         to be.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         What is it?

                                     BUSTER
                         I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         It's good you found it.

                                     BUSTER
                         There's that spice again.

               As BUSTER leaves, VIRGINIA goes back to tidying the desk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               trial.

               A HEADLINE which reads, "DRAGON LADY CLAIMS INNOCENCE."

               Under a PICTURE OF ANNIE on the courthouse steps, we see a 
               CAPTION: "Wilkes told reporters on the courthouse steps, 
               'There is a higher justice than that of man; I will be judged 
               by Him.'"

               ANNIE, carrying a bag of feed, followed by MISERY, the sow,

                         Hi, Punkin.

                         Give us a smile?

                              finger. She laughs)
                         Such a kidder.

               PAUL, lifting the typewriter and repeatedly raising it over 
               his head, this time without any difficulty.

               THE GENERAL STORE IN SILVER CREEK. EARLY AFTERNOON.

               BUSTER enters. The place is empty. It's one of those wonderful 
               spots that stocks pretty much everything in what seems like 
               complete disarray. Buster goes to the coffee urn behind the 
               counter, helps himself. He speaks to the guy who sits behind 
               the counter nearby; these two have known each other forever.

                         Do you have any of those new Paul

                         We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three 
                         days.

                         You wouldn't happen to remember if 
                         Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?

                         Are you kidding? Every time that

                         set aside the first copy.

               BUSTER opens the cash register, drops his coffee money inside, 
               closes the register.

                         Has she been buying any odd things 
                         lately?

                         that.

               ANNIE, entering Paul's room. He lies back in the wheelchair, 
               eyes closed. Liberace music playing in the background. From 
               the start, PAUL'S TONE is different--strong, he's in control.

                         Paul, don't you think it's time for 
                         you to start writing again? It's 
                         been over a week.

                         I don't know, it's weird, but a couple 
                         of broken bones hasn't done a lot 
                         for my creative juices. Get the fuck 
                         out of here.

               ANNIE, busily making cocoa.

               BUSTER IN HIS CAR. He stops at a mailbox. The name on the 
               box is WILKES. Buster turns his car slowly into the driveway 
               by the mailbox.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He yawns, opens his eyes briefly. Closes them. In the 
               distance now, growing more and more visible is Buster's car--

               --and now PAUL'S EYES go open wide, and he's staring out the 
               window at the car as it keeps on coming, closer, closer and

               BUSTER, looking around. He's driving very slowly, carefully.

               PAUL. Fixating on the window and now it's all going to be 
               all right, everything's going to be all right--

               --and then ANNIE is on him, hypodermic needle in hand, jabbing 
               it into his arm. He desperately tries to fight her off, but 
               the drug starts to take hold. He tries to grab her by the 
               neck, but she fights him off as she wheels him out of the 
               room, down the hall and towards the cellar door.

                         I don't think I'll ever understand 
                         you. I cook your meals, I tend to 
                         you practically twenty-four hours a 
                         day, and you continue to fight me. 
                         When are we going to develop a sense 
                         of trust?

               ANNIE opens the cellar door. PAUL is all but limp by now. As 
               she picks him up and starts to carry him down the steps--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE placing Paul on the cellar floor and heading up the 
               stairs. PAUL is out.

               BUSTER heading up the steps to the front door.

               ANNIE stashing the wheelchair in the hall closet. She crosses 
               to the front door, opens it, revealing BUSTER.

                         Massachusetts, forty-two years ago, 
                         the only child of Franklin and Helene 
                         Sheldon, mediocre student, majored

                              (cutting in)
                         Excuse me, that's not exactly the 
                         kind of information I was after. You

                         some time now, and...

                         I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his 
                         number-one fan...I've got all his 
                         books, every sentence he ever put 
                         down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon 
                         collection...

                              embarrassed)
                         ...here I am, prattling on and my 
                         manners have just flown away. I 
                         haven't invited you in. Please.

                         Thank you.

               ANNIE lets BUSTER in, closes the door. They linger in front 
               of Paul's door. Buster idly checks out the hallway.

                                     ANNIE
                         'Course you must know about that 
                         horrible accident.

               BUSTER nods and wanders into the living room. ANNIE follows. 
               He crosses into the study and checks out a bookcase that 
               contains the complete works of Paul Sheldon. One shelf below 
               contains Annie's infamous scrapbook.

                                     ANNIE
                         Almost killed me, too. I prayed when 
                         I heard the news. I got down on my 
                         knees and begged for it not to be 
                         true.

               CUT TO:

               ANNIE. She's so moved. Buster wanders into the kitchen.

                         You're going to laugh at what I'm 
                         about to say, but go ahead, I don't 
                         care...
                              (beat)
                         ...when I was praying, God told me 
                         to get ready.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER, watching her. This isn't at all what he expected.

                                     BUSTER
                         Get ready for what?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, trying to fight the drug; just his eyes flutter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE and BUSTER heading back down the hallway toward Paul's 
               room.

                                     ANNIE
                         To try and be his replacement--he 
                         gave so much pleasure to so many 
                         people and there's a shortage of 
                         pleasure on this planet these days, 
                         in case you hadn't noticed.

               BUSTER enters Paul's room. ANNIE follows.

                                     ANNIE
                         God told me, since I was his number-
                         one fan, that I should make up new 
                         stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. 
                         So, went to town. And I bought a 
                         typewriter. And paper to type on. 
                         The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And 
                         I turned the guest bedroom into a 
                         writing studio. Would you like to 
                         see it?

                                     BUSTER
                         Sure.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's right this way.

               BUSTER takes a look in the bathroom. ANNIE waits for him.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's right here. I knew how he wrote, 
                         the kinds of words he used, the 
                         wonderful stories he told--
                              (moved)
                         --I've spent the last four weeks 
                         trying to write like Paul Sheldon.
                              (sad shake of the 
                              head)
                         But I can't do it right. I try and I 
                         try and I know all the words--
                              (eyes closed in despair)
                         --but it's just not the same.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. He just stands there, watches her.

                                     BUSTER
                         Well...
                              (long pause)
                         ...maybe it takes time to get the 
                         hang of it.

                                     ANNIE
                              (holding up pages 
                              from the manuscript)
                         I could give you a couple of hundred 
                         pages of mine, and you could tell me 
                         what you think.

                                     BUSTER
                         I'm not much of a critic.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, I just thought--oh, look at 
                         me. You'd think I'd never had a house 
                         guest before. Would you like something 
                         to drink?

                                     BUSTER
                         Sure.

                                     ANNIE
                         How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?

                                     BUSTER
                         Sounds good.

               As she exits into the kitchen.

                                     ANNIE
                         There's some already made.

               BUSTER lingers in Paul's room for a beat, then goes into the 
               hallway.

                                     BUSTER
                         Must get lonely, living out here all 
                         by yourself.

                                     ANNIE
                         I always say if you can't enjoy your 
                         own company, you're not fit company 
                         for anyone else.

                                     BUSTER
                         You got a point there...

               As Buster moves up the stairs--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, still fighting the drug. His arm twitches almost 
               involuntarily, grazing the barbecue.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER opening the door to Annie's room. He looks around and 
               just as he is about to turn to leave--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, standing right in front of him.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here you are.

               BUSTER heads down the stairs, ANNIE follows.

                                     BUSTER
                         Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want 
                         to take up any more of your time. I 
                         best be going.

                                     ANNIE
                         But you didn't even taste your cocoa.

               They cross to the front door.

                                     BUSTER
                         I'm sure it's wonderful, but really 
                         should be getting back.

               BUSTER opens the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL stirring.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER and ANNIE at the door.

                                     BUSTER
                         If you don't mind, perhaps I could 
                         pay you another visit sometime.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'd be delighted. Now that you know 
                         the way...

               With that, she closes the door. We stay with BUSTER. He stands 
               on the front porch for a beat, thinking, then starts heading 
               down the porch steps. Just as he reaches about halfway down, 
               we HEAR A LOUD CRASH coming from inside the house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL--he has managed to partially fight his way through the 
               drug, and in waking has accidentally knocked over the 
               barbecue. He fights to clear the cobwebs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     BUSTER
                         Miz Wilkes, are you all right?

               There is no answer. He quietly moves into the house.

                                     BUSTER
                         Miz Wilkes?

               Again, no answer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, still fighting to gain complete consciousness.

                                     PAUL
                              (weakly)
                         Here. I'm down here. Down here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BUSTER. Hearing Paul's muffled call for help, he tracks the 
               sound to the cellar door. As PAUL continues to call out, 
               Buster looks around, sees no one, and opens the cellar door. 
               The shaft of light from the open door pours down on Paul, 
               who is still lying on the floor.

                                     BUSTER
                         Mr. Sheldon?

               But before Paul can answer, there's the sound of a LOUD 
               EXPLOSION. Seemingly from nowhere a hole is ripped through 
               Buster's chest, knocking him out of frame, revealing Annie, 
               smoking shotgun in hand, standing at the top of the cellar 
               steps.

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't feel bad, Paul. It had to 
                         happen. I've been waiting for this 
                         sign.

               ANNIE walks toward BUSTER'S BODY and very casually takes his 
               gun out of its holster.

                                     ANNIE
                         I've known for some time why I was 
                         chosen to save you. You and I were 
                         meant to be together forever. But 
                         now our time in this world must end. 
                         But don't worry, Paul. I've already 
                         prepared for what must be done. I 
                         put two bullets in my gun, one for 
                         you and one for me. Oh, darling, it 
                         will be so beautiful.

               With that, ANNIE turns and exits the cellar.

               Paul's mind races desperately. He looks at the barbecue again. 
               Next to it is a messy table with a dozen jars and cans on 
               it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TABLE. One of the cans is LIGHTER FLUID.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. He stares at it for a moment. An idea hits him--

               --now, PAUL struggles and crawls over to the table. He grabs 
               the lighter fluid in his hands, jams it into the rear of his 
               pants and scrambles back to where ANNIE left him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE returning with her .38 Special and a hypodermic needle. 
               She stops at the top of the stairs.

                                     ANNIE
                         Now don't be afraid. I love you.

               She starts toward him.

                                     PAUL
                         I know you do. I love you too, Annie.
                              (this stops her)
                         And you're right. We are meant to be 
                         together. And I know we must die. 
                         But it must be so that Misery can 
                         live. We have the power to give Misery 
                         eternal life. We must finish the 
                         book.

                                     ANNIE
                         But the time is now. Soon others 
                         will come.

                                     PAUL
                         It's almost done. By dawn we'll be 
                         able to give Misery back to the world.

               ANNIE stares at Paul. She could go either way on this. Then, 
               without a word, she turns and goes back up the stairs.

                                     ANNIE
                         Here, Paul. I'll fix you something 
                         to eat.

               She exits. PAUL hesitates for a moment, then realizes he has 
               no choice. He starts dragging himself over BUSTER and up the 
               stairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

               PAUL working. Typing like a madman, totally concentrated on 
               the white paper. His lips move but he's not even aware of 
               it.

               ANNIE enters quietly, holding a few pages.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.

                                     PAUL
                         Three more chapters to go.

               She looks at him now, enthralled.

                                     ANNIE
                         The stranger staying at the Inn, is 
                         he someone from Misery's past?

                                     PAUL
                         Maybe.

                                     ANNIE
                         This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, 
                         her first love, right?

                                     PAUL
                         Maybe. Are you ready for the next 
                         chapter?

               He taunts her with it.

                                     ANNIE
                              (brimming with 
                              enthusiasm)
                         Oh you!

               She takes the pages and goes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. LATER.

               PAUL types a moment then rips out the page and starts over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, putting the coffee down for him, putting the pages 
               back on the main pile.

                                     ANNIE
                              (more excited now 
                              than the last time)
                         It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what 
                         does that do to her love for Ian?--
                              (thinks)
                         --of course, if she hadn't thought 
                         Windthorne was murdered she never 
                         would have fallen in love with Ian 
                         in the first place.
                              (Paul glares at her, 
                              she turns to the 
                              door)
                         Sorry, it's just that this is so 
                         wonderful.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm glad you like it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, this will be our legacy.

                                     PAUL
                         It will.

               He hands her a few more pages, she starts reading as she 
               exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM. MUCH LATER.

               PAUL rubs his eyes. For a moment, he sags, but he fights it. 
               He puts a clean page into the typewriter.

               ANNIE bursts in.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind 
                         up with Ian or Windthorne? You have 
                         to tell me.

                                     PAUL
                         You'll know very soon. I'm starting 
                         the last chapter. And when I finish, 
                         I want everything to be perfect. 
                         I'll require three things.

                                     ANNIE
                         What things?

                                     PAUL
                         You don't know?

                                     ANNIE
                              (smiling)
                         I was fooling, silly.
                              (ticking them off)
                         You need a cigarette, because you 
                         used to smoke but you quit except 
                         when you finish a book, and you just 
                         have one, and the match is to light 
                         it. And you need one glass of 
                         champagne.
                              (thinks)
                         Dome Pear-igg-non.

                                     PAUL
                         Dome Pear-igg-non it is.

               AS ANNIE exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WINDOW

               The first light of morning is starting to break through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, stretching. He makes sure everything is set.

                                     PAUL
                              (calling out)
                         Annie! Annie!

               With that, she enters.

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes, Paul.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm almost done.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian 
                         and Windthorne dueling for the right 
                         to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, 
                         don't me. It's Windthorne, right?

                                     PAUL
                         You'll know everything in a minute. 
                         Get the champagne.

                                     ANNIE
                              (dying from the 
                              suspense)
                         Ahh!!!

               She exits; PAUL adjusts the manuscript on the table and then 
               types the last line.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE IN THE KITCHEN. She takes the bottle of Dom Perignon 
               out of the icebox, places it on a tray with two glasses--
               opens a drawer--takes out the gun--places it in her pocket--
               then takes out the hypodermic needle and places it on the 
               tray.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL'S ROOM

               ANNIE enters with the tray. She sets it down on the table.

                                     ANNIE
                         Did I do good?

                                     PAUL
                         You did perfect. Except for one thing. 
                         This time we need two glasses.

               He takes the last page out of the typewriter.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh, Paul.

               As soon as she exits, PAUL drops the manuscript to the floor, 
               pulls the lighter fluid from his pants, and starts dousing 
               the manuscript with lighter fluid. He grabs the last chapter 
               and twists the last few pages together torch style. He douses 
               it with the fluid and holds the match out of sight.

               He smiles as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE entering with the second glass...

                                     PAUL
                         It's all right here, Annie. Remember 
                         how for all those years no one ever 
                         knew who Misery's real father was, 
                         or if they'd ever be reunited? It's 
                         all right here. Will Misery finally 
                         lead her countrymen to freedom? Does 
                         she finally marry Ian or will it be 
                         Windthorne? It's all right here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MATCH, as he strikes it and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE screaming--

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, you can't.

               And as her hands fly out beseechingly--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE--it falls to the floor, explodes like a 
               torpedo, shards of glass all over, curds of foam everywhere--

                                     PAUL
                         Why not? I learned it from you...

               And on that--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LAST CHAPTER as Paul brings the match close to it and it 
               bursts into flame. And Paul, holding it like the torch it 
               is. Annie starts moving forward now.

                                     ANNIE
                         No, no, NOT MISERY--NOT MY MISERY...!

               He drops the last chapter into the soaked manuscript and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MANUSCRIPT, as KABOOM!, it bursts into flame and--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, transfixed by the sight for a moment,

               --and then she charges.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE FIRE as ANNIE rushes to the book, stoops down, grabs it 
               with both hands, brings the burning mass up to her body, 
               both arms across it, trying to smother the flames--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, grabbing the typewriter, raising it high above his 
               head, then throwing it down on her with all his power and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TYPEWRITER, crashing into the back of her head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, screaming, driven to the floor by the blow, the book 
               beneath her, and the flames fly up, her sweater is starting 
               to burn and she's covered with shards of glass from the 
               shattered bottle of champagne and some of the manuscript is 
               hissing from the liquid, but she is able to struggle to her 
               knees--

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm going to kill you, you lying 
                         cocksucker...

               As she struggles to her feet, she pulls out the gun and shoots 
               at Paul, hitting him in the shoulder. Just as she's about to 
               shoot again, Paul quickly wheels the chair up to her, throws 
               himself out of the chair, and tackles her. The gun flies out 
               of her hand and lands in the hallway, going off as it lands. 
               They wrestle on the floor.

               Flames still around them, PAUL gets on top of her, grabs 
               some burning pages, stuffs them into her mouth, shouting --

                                     PAUL
                         Here. Here. You want it? You want 
                         it? You can eat it--eat it--eat it 
                         till you fucking CHOKE--you sick, 
                         twisted fuck.

               And as he forces more paper into her mouth--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, and she's hideous--blistered, her hands claw at her 
               throat. She makes horrible sounds, spitting the charred chunks 
               of manuscript out of her mouth. Shards of glass are in her 
               hair. Now a shriek and a tremendous jerk of her body and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, falling away --

               ANNIE, still making the sounds as she gets to her feet, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, trying to crawl away after her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE--heading for the door, she takes a step away from Paul, 
               then another, then

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, suddenly kicking out with his shattered leg, screaming 
               in pain as it crashes into her ankle and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, trying to keep her balance, not doing well, her arms 
               windmilling as she fights for balance one last moment, fights 
               and loses, and now, as she topples over--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TYPEWRITER as she falls and her head slams into it, 
               collides with the sharp metal and a great wound opens in her 
               head. There is one final cry. Blood pours. It's over. All 
               over. We are looking at a dead body.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, exhausted, panting, lying there, trying to gather his 
               energy. He starts to crawl for the door. Just as he reaches 
               the doorjamb, an arm grabs his leg, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, shrieking, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, pulling herself up his body and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, trying to buck her off, but he can't and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, the stronger, relentless, moving up on him, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, his grip broken as he turns and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, all-powerful, looming over him and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, hitting up at her and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, swelling, and the blood pours down and if she feels 
               his blows she doesn't show it and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, whatever energy he has left he uses now, trying to 
               twist and strike and as his body moves--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               METAL BASED FLOOR LAMP and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, grabbing the thing, suddenly bringing it across his 
               body, clobbering Annie in the face and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, startled by the power of the blow and for a moment 
               she is stopped and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, as with everything he has left, he crunches her forehead 
               with the sharp heavy metal base, just creams her as the air 
               is forced out of her--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE. Her eyes roll up into her head. For a moment all we 
               see are the whites--

               --then she collapses on PAUL, a motionless mountain of slack 
               flesh.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, scrambling free, pushing her off him, crawling for the 
               door--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               --outside the door, as PAUL crawls into view, makes it to 
               the corridor, reaches back, closes the door, locks it.

               Safe, he collapses, exhausted against the wall opposite the 
               door.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAUL. HOURS LATER. It is dawn. He is awakened by a loud 
               smashing at the front door. After a couple of heart-stopping 
               pounds,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE FRONT DOOR smashes open, revealing two cops with guns 
               drawn.

               THE POLICEMEN, hurrying to PAUL. The YOUNGER COP kneels beside 
               Paul.

                                     YOUNGER COP
                         It's the writer--the dead one--

                                     PAUL
                              (trying to keep himself 
                              together)
                         --right! I'm the dead one--

                                     OLDER COP
                         Where's Sheriff McCain?

                                     PAUL
                         He's in the cellar. She killed him.

                                     OLDER COP
                         Annie Wilkes?

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah. She's in there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The OLDER COP, taking the key to the room, unlocks the door, 
               throws it open, and as he steps inside--

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE BEDROOM

               The OLDER COP has his gun ready to fire, but even with it 
               tight in his hand, he's edgy as hell.

               He looks around--

               --glass and bloodstains on the floor. The charred remains of 
               a manuscript.

               He kneels quickly, glances under the bed--nothing.

               He looks at the window--wide open.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL and the YOUNGER COP. Pause. The OLDER COP is in the 
               doorway now.

                                     OLDER COP
                         Mr. Sheldon? There's no one in there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP. In shock.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PALM COURT, PLAZA HOTEL

               This legend appears: ONE YEAR LATER

               MARCIA SINDELL is seated at a table. PAUL enters, walking 
               briskly, and he's never looked this good before. He's gained 
               his weight back, his color is normal again. He appears to 
               be, for the first time in the movie, a jaunty, happy figure.

                                     PAUL
                         Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball 
                         game went into overtime. If anybody 
                         ever told me I'd have a daughter 
                         who'd get a triple double, I'd...

                                     SINDELL
                         Did they win?

                                     PAUL
                         Yeah. They're in the semis.

                                     SINDELL
                         Here it is.
                              (big moment)
                         Very first copy.

               And she hands him a wrapped package. PAUL sits, begins 
               unwrapping it. It's a book. A new one by Paul Sheldon. The 
               Higher Education of J. Phillip Stone. Paul turns it over 
               gently in his hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SINDELL

                                     SINDELL
                         The word I'm getting is the Times 
                         review is gonna be a love letter.

                                     PAUL
                         That'd be a first.

                                     SINDELL
                         And my contacts at Time and Newsweek 
                         tell me they're both raves. And don't 
                         laugh--for the first time, I think 
                         you've got a shot at some prizes.

                                     PAUL
                              (flatly)
                         Great.

                                     SINDELL
                         I thought you'd be thrilled. You're 
                         being taken seriously.

                                     PAUL
                         I'm delighted the critics are liking 
                         it, and I hope the people like it, 
                         too. But it's not why I wrote the 
                         book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL: CLOSE UP. There is a genuine sense of peace about him. 
               He has been through the fire and survived.

                                     PAUL
                         I like it. Remember how you once 
                         said I live my whole life as if I'm 
                         in danger of being found out? Well, 
                         I believe I've managed to get that 
                         guy down on paper.
                              (He touches the book. 
                              Beat.)
                         Don't think I'm completely nuts, but 
                         in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole 
                         experience, helped me.

                                     SINDELL
                         Paul, since you brought her up, I 
                         have to ask you this, or I'd be 
                         drummed out of the agents' union--
                         what about a non-fiction book? The 
                         truth about what went on in that 
                         house.

                                     PAUL
                         Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you 
                         better, I'd think you were suggesting 
                         I dredge up the worst horror of my 
                         life just so we could make a few 
                         bucks.

                                     SINDELL
                         Now you've hurt me, Paul.

               As Paul glances around...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, looking past MARCIA.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DESSERT TROLLEY, some distance away, being pushed by a 
               waitress. It is ANNIE.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND SINDELL

                                     SINDELL
                         I thought you were over it.

                                     PAUL
                         I am. Well, maybe not completely--

               He glances toward the trolley.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DESSERT TROLLEY, moving inexorably closer to PAUL. ANNIE 
               reaches down and pulls out a very sharp knife.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND SINDELL

                                     PAUL
                         I don't know if you can ever be 
                         totally over something like that--I 
                         just don't think about it as much 
                         anymore, and when I do, it's not so 
                         terrifying.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE, with the knife raised.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL, staring up at ANNIE.

                                     PAUL
                         I mean, once they found her body, my 
                         nightmares stopped.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL AND ANNIE--only it isn't Annie, just a WAITRESS. She 
               stands by the trolley, the knife in her hand, ready to slice 
               whatever anyone wants.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Would you care for anything?

                                     PAUL
                              (smiles)
                         Cut me something sinful...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PAUL. The smile holds. In the background now, soft music:

EXT.  NIGHT - HOLLYWOOD HILLS, LOS ANGELES
    
Darkness. Distant sounds of freeway traffic. Then the closer
sound of a car - its headlights illumine an oleander bush and
the limbs of an Eucalyptus tree. Then the headlights turn - a
street sign is suddenly brightly lit. The words on the sign
read... "Mulholland Drive." The car moves under the sign as
it turns and the words fall once again into darkness.

EXT. NIGHT - MULHOLLAND DRIVE
    
Gliding we follow the car - an older black Cadillac limousine
- as it winds its way up Mulholland Drive through the
darkness of the Hollywood Hills. There is no one else on the
road. As we drift closer to the car...

INT. BLACK CADILLAC LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
    
Two men in dark suits are sitting in the front seat. A
beautiful, younger, dark-haired woman sits in back. She sits
close up against the door and stares out into the darkness.
She seems to be thinking about something. Suddenly she turns
and looks ahead. The car is slowing and moving off to the
side of the road.
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		What are you doing? You don't stop
		here ...
    
The car stops - half on, half off the road at a dark, blind
curve. Both men turn to the woman.
    
				DRIVER
		Get out of the car.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT.  FURTHER UP MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT
    
Two cars - a convertible and a late model sedan are drag
racing toward the blind curve blocking the view of the
Cadillac limousine. The cars are filled with crazed
teenagers. Two girls are standing up through the sunroof of
the sedan screaming as their hair is whipped straight back.
    

    
The cars are travelling so fast that they seem to almost
float as they fly with psychotic speed down both lanes of
Mulholland Drive.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. EXT. - CADILLAC LIMOUSINE
    
The driver, still in his seat, has a pistol with a silencer
attached pointing at the woman. The other man is getting out
of the car. The woman is clutching the seat and the door
handle as if trying to anchor herself. She is visibly afraid.
The man who got out of the car tries the woman's door, but it
is locked. He smiles as he reaches in through the front door
and unlocks her door. He opens her door. As he reaches for
her, the woman's face becomes flooded with light. Her eyes
dart to the front windshield. The driver, flooded with light,
turns just as the late model sedan slams into the Cadillac
limousine. There is an explosion of metal and glass amidst
thunderous tearing sounds as the two cars become one in
death. The convertible screams past with hardly a notice.
The driver of the limousine dies instantly as his body is
jettisoned through the windshield. The other man is torn as
the cars screech over him. The woman is brutally thrown into
the back of the front seats as a cloud of dust and flying
rocks engulfs her. The disastrous moving sculpture of the two
cars wants to climb up the hill, then stops and slides back
toward the road The Cadillac tips onto its side. Then all is
silent. A fire erupts in the sedan and as the dust clears we
see the woman appear, then crawl out of the Cadillac to the
road. Her face is vacant. There is a bleeding cut just above
her forehead. She stands for a moment clutching her purse -
lost , then begins to walk as if in a trance across
Mulholland down through the bushes and into darkness.

							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - LATER - NIGHT
    
The woman slides down a hill through tangles of hostile
desert plants. Sirens can be heard in the distance. She
crosses through some trees and is suddenly confronted by a
coyote which snarls and leaps at her. She screams and strikes
out with her purse in self defense. The coyote backs away -
snarling. The woman then loses control and runs at the coyote
and it races off. She falls to the ground. We can hear the
thunder of her heartbeat as the sirens grow louder. She gets
up and stumbles through the trees. When she clears them she
is standing overlooking all of Los Angeles glowing down
below. She clumsily starts down toward it.
   
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
    
The woman slides down a dusty hill and finds herself at
Franklin Avenue. A car races by and its headlights flare on
her face. Her expression shows fear and panic. She doesn't
know where she is or where to go. She runs frantically across
the street. She moves quickly to a sidewalk which takes her
into a residential area.
    
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
    
The woman crosses Sunset Boulevard. Coming up Sunset in the
distance is a police car with its sirens and lights going.
She hurries into the darkness of another residential area. A
car turns onto the street and comes toward her. She
instinctively moves behind a tree until it passes.
  
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
    
As if being hunted in a foreign land the woman moves
desperately down another residential street. A drunken couple
round the corner up ahead and start up the sidewalk toward
her. She runs off the sidewalk and into the bushes in front
of an apartment building. The couple passes by without
noticing her. Feeling safe in these bushes her exhaustion
overtakes her and she lays her head down to sleep.
   
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT.  MULHOLLAND DRIVE   - NIGHT
    
Police, paramedics surround the wreckage. Two detectives,
HARRY MCKNIGHT and NEAL DOMGAARD (both mid 40's to 50), stare
at the remains of the two cars glowing white hot under the
crime scene lights. A coroner's van pulls out just after an
ambulance. The ambulance's siren begins to wail as it speeds
off. The coroner's van cruises slowly. Detective Harry
McKnight and Detective Neal Domgaard continue staring. They
do not look at each other. They are each motionless for a
long moment.
  
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		You feel it?
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Yeah.
    
They continue to stare.
    
 
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along
		the shoulder ... man up the road said he
		saw two cars drag racin'...then you got
		that blind corner.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		The boys found this on the floor in back
		of the Caddy.
    
Neal holds up a plastic bag holding a pearl earring.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Yeah, they showed me
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Could be unrelated.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Could be...any of those dead kids wearin'
		pearl earrings?
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		That's what I'm thinkin'.
    
Detective Harry McKnight turns and crosses Mulholland. His
eyes move over each blade of grass at the shoulder - each
desert bush just beyond. He slowly raises his gaze to the
shining lights of Hollywood laying far below like a galaxy.
He looks out and wonders.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - EARLY DAWN
    
The clang of a metal gate wakes the woman. It is just getting
light and she sees an older red-headed woman carrying a
suitcase to the curb where a cab stands waiting with its
trunk open. The cab driver appears with two suitcases which
he sets down next to the car. The red-headed woman and the
cab driver both go back through the iron gate. The woman in
the bushes pulls herself to the gate where she can peer into
the courtyard of this apartment building. She sees the red-
headed woman and the cab driver go into an apartment and come
back out with more luggage.

    
They leave the apartment door open. When the red-headed woman
and the cab driver reach the cab they both begin loading the
bags into the trunk and backseat. Their backs are to the
woman in the bushes who takes this opportunity to go quickly
into the courtyard and through the open apartment door.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. APARTMENT - EARLY DAWN
    
The woman comes into a living room where a single trunk
remains. She goes further into the apartment and crouches
down in a back corner of the kitchen. She listens as
footsteps come across the courtyard. She hears the red-headed
woman and the cab driver get the trunk. She hears them set it
down once they have it in the courtyard. She hears the steps
of the red-headed woman come back inside the apartment. She
hears the footsteps go all around the apartment and then she
hears the footsteps come toward the kitchen. Remaining
frozen, the dark-haired woman's eyes look up as the red-
headed woman walks right past her, grabs a set of keys off
the kitchen counter, then leaves the apartment. The woman can
hear the door being locked. She lets go, slides to the
kitchen floor, and passes out.

INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT , HOLLYWOOD - MORNING
    
Two well-dressed men HERB and DAN (mid 30's) are sitting at a
table drinking coffee. Herb has finished eating his
breakfast, but Dan hasn't touched his bacon and eggs - he
appears too nervous to eat. A blonde waitress with a
nameplate saying "DIANE" lays the check on their table
smiles, then walks off.
    
				HERB
		Why did you want to go to breakfast if
		you're not hungry?

				DAN
		I just wanted to come here.

				HERB
		To Denny's? I wasn't going to say
		anything, but why Denny's?
    
				DAN
		This Denny's.
    
				HERB
		Okay. Why this Denny's?
    
    
				DAN
		It's kind of embarrassing but,
    
				HERB
		Go ahead.
    
				DAN
		I had a dream about this place.
    
				HERB
		Oh boy.
    
				DAN
		You see what I mean...
    
				HERB
		Okay, so you had a dream about this
		place. Tell me.
    
				DAN
		Well ... it's the second one I've had, but
		they were both the same......they start
		out that I'm in here but it's not day or
		night. It's kinda half night, but it
		looks just like this except for the
		light, but I'm scared like I can't tell
		ya. Of all people you're standing right
		over there by that counter. You're in
		both dreams and you're scared. I get
		even more frightened when I see how
		afraid you are and then I realize what it
		is - there's a man...in back of this
		place. He's the one ... he's the one
		that's doing it. I can see him through
		the wall. I can see his face and I hope
		I never see that face ever outside a
		dream.
    
Herb stares at Dan to see if he will continue. Dan looks
around nervously, then stares at his uneaten food.
    
				DAN (cont'd)
		That's it.
    
				HERB
		So, you came to see if he's out there?

				DAN
		To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
    
				HERB
		Right then.

    
Herb gets up, picks up the bill and goes to the cashier to
pay. Dan just sits.
    
As Herb is paying the bill he looks over at Dan just as Dan
is turning to look at him. From Dan's point of view Herb is
standing in exactly the same spot as he stood in the dream.
Herb gets a strange feeling, turns back and finishes up with
the cashier. He motions for Dan to follow him. Dan rises
reluctantly and he and Herb make their way outside.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. DENNY'S
    
Now Herb waits for Dan to lead the way.
    
				DAN
		Around here.
    
Dan takes Herb across the front of Denny's to a narrow
sidewalk that leads down the side toward the back.
    
They begin walking down the narrow sidewalk - past a
payphone. Dan begins to sweat the nearer he gets to the rear
corner of the building. Red bricks glide by slowly.
    
CLOSER ON DAN
    
Beads of sweat cover his face. He finds it difficult to
breathe. Herb is just behind him unable to see the fear
overtaking his friend, but Herb can feel something himself.
    
The red bricks moving by now are coming to an end - the
corner is coming closer - the corner is now very close.
    
Suddenly a man - a face ... a face dark and bum-like- moves
quickly out from behind the corner and stops - freezes -
staring into Dan's eyes.
    
Dan lurches back. All his breath is suddenly gone. He falls
back into Herb who tries to catch him as he's falling. Dan
hits the ground unable to breathe - his eyes wide with
horror.
    
Herb looks up - the man is gone. He looks down to Dan.
    
				HERB
		Dan! ... Dan! You all right? ... Dan!
    
He kneels down and studies his friend. He feels for a pulse
in the neck. He listens for breathing. His friend is dead.
    

    
				HERB (cont'd)
		My God!

A blonde girl walking with an old woman approaches us. As the
blonde's face fills the screen we move with her and stay with
her as she goes. Her face is bright and her eyes move here
and there taking in everything. She can hardly believe she's
in Los Angeles - the City of Dreams. She and the old woman
pass under a sign which reads "WELCOME TO LOS ANGELES."
The girl smiles and looks around excited by every detail.

The girl and the old lady exit the terminal with their bags.
An older gentleman has joined the old lady. They stop at the
taxicab stand. The old lady takes the blonde girl's hand.
    
				OLD LADY
		It's time to say goodbye, Betty. It's
		been so nice travelling with you.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you, Irene. I was so excited and
		nervous. It was sure great to have you
		to talk to.
    
				IRENE
		Now, remember I'll be watching for you on
		the big screen.
    
				BETTY
			(smiling)
		Okay Irene. Won't that be the day.

				IRENE
		The best of luck to you, Betty. Take
		care of yourself and be careful.

    
				BETTY
		Okay I will. Thanks again.
    
Betty and Irene give each other a hug. The old gentleman nods
to Betty and takes Irene off. Betty smiles after them.
Suddenly someone is grabbing her bags. She turns abruptly to
find she is next in line and her cab is waiting. She turns
once more and waves at Irene as her bags are loaded into the
trunk of the cab.
    
				CAB DRIVER
		Where to?
    
				BETTY
			(smiling excitedly)
		1612 Havenhurst.
    
				CAB DRIVER
		Got it!
    
They get into the cab and close their doors. The cab pulls
away.

EXT. STREETS - LOS ANGELES - DAY
    
Betty goes from the right side of the cab to the left side of
the cab looking at every building, tree and sign. Each street
sign seems to be magical to her and she says the names to
herself as they pass by. She sees La Tijera, La Cienega,
Venice Boulevard, Pico Boulevard, Olympic Boulevard, Wilshire
Boulevard, etc., etc. until they reach Fountain and turn
right. Betty's heart is pounding when she sees Havenhurst
and the cab turns left. In the middle of the block on the
right the cab pulls over and stops. Betty sees her new
home ... an ancient, gorgeous courtyard apartment building,
built during the golden age of cinema.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. 1612 HAVENHURST
    
The cab driver puts Betty's bags down on the sidewalk next to
her. She can barely stop looking at the building long enough
to pay the cab driver who then goes off and drives away.
Betty picks up her bags and enters, as if in a dream, through
an ornate iron gate to a courtyard with a beautiful working
fountain at its center. A sign on a door to her right reads
Manager and she rings the bell.

    
An older, once very beautiful, woman wearing heavy make-up
and smoking a cigarette in a silver holder opens the door.
An unbelievable raspy voice comes out through the dark screen
of the still closed screen door.
    
				MANAGER
		Hi there...ten bucks says you're Betty.

				BETTY
		I am, Mrs. Lanois. It is Mrs. Lanois
		isn't it?
    
				MRS. LANOIS
		In all my living glory, baby.
    
				BETTY
		Pleased to meet you.
    
				MRS. LANOIS
		You can call me Coco ... everybody does.
		Stay there, I'll get the key.
    
				BETTY
		Okay, Coco.
    
Coco returns with the key and opens the screen door inhaling
a huge drag off her cigarette. She starts off into the
courtyard and Betty picks up her bags and follows. As Coco
speaks smoke comes out of her with every word.
    
				COCO
		I guess it was your grandfather, was
		it ... he called me to check in, said you
		were on your way and for you to call when
		you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
    
				BETTY
		Yes, he is. He raises corn.
    
				COCO
		Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood
		these days too.
    
				BETTY
		Well, I ...
    
				COCO
		You don't have to tell me. It's written
		all over that pretty face of yours.. You
		came here to be an actress. I just hope
		you'll remember there's never been a
		great poem called "tits and ass."
    
    
				BETTY
		I...
    
				COCO
		You probably don't remember her, but
		Louise Bonner lives right over there in
		number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs
		a damn good acting class.
    
				BETTY
		Have many famous actors and actresses
		lived here? I was meaning to ask you
		that.
    
				COCO
		Honey, all the great ones came through
		here at one time or another.
    
A haunting music begins to swell.
    
				COCO (cont'd)
    
		People say in the springtime when the
		wind blows the smell of the jasmine you
		can still feel the presence of everyone
		of them.
    
				BETTY
		I guess I've come to quite a place.
    
				COCO
		Sweetheart, you don't know the half of
		it.
    
The music fades.
    
Coco looks down suddenly. On the cobblestone courtyard in
front of her she sees a fresh product of waste from a dog.
She angrily turns up to an apartment on the second level.
    
				COCO (cont'd)
			(yelling up)
		WILKINS! ... (no answer) ... THAT DOG CRAPS
		ONCE MORE OUT HERE AND I'LL BAKE HIS
		BUTT FOR BREAKFAST!!
    
Coco turns back to Betty.
    
				COCO (cont'd)
		You don't have pets do you?

    
				BETTY
		No, I don't.
    
				COCO
		That's good. They're allowed, but I
		don't like 'em...for obvious reasons.
		One man used to live here that had a
		prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't
		believe what that kangaroo did to this

The dirty and torn black cocktail dress of the dark-haired
woman along with her shoes, purse and undergarments are in a

where the dark-haired woman can be seen showering through
rippled glass. There's the sound of a door opening. We see a

We can hear the dark-haired woman's frightened breathing as
she waits frozen listening.

		I told ya.
    
				BETTY
		Wow!

		Now I guess you and your Aunt have an

		Everybody in this building's pretty much
		okay with me or they wouldn't be here.
		If you want, later I'll introduce you
		around. No hard feelings if you don't,
		and don't forget the rooftop garden.
		It's just up the stairs we passed. It's

		Hollywood sign from there.
    
				BETTY
		Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.

				COCO
		You got it! See you later honey.
    
Coco leaves and closes the door behind her. Betty begins to
explore the apartment.- After walking a circle in the living
room she passes through the kitchen. She moves down a
hallway looking at paintings and posters. She goes into the
bedroom. She smiles when she sees the bed which has a huge
ornately carved head and foot board. She notices the soiled
dress on the floor and she frowns as she looks closer. She
stands back up, shrugs and goes into the bathroom which has
all the original thirties fixtures damndest floor to ceiling
tiles. As she goes toward the sink she smiles to herself in
the mirror above it. Suddenly something catches her eye and
she opens the shower stall. There before her is the naked,
beautiful dark-haired woman.
    
				BETTY
		Oh my!
    
She quickly closes the shower door.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		I'm sorry. My Aunt ... Ruth didn't tell

		That's okay.

		I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm

There's a silence.
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		There was an accident. I came here.

				BETTY
		I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm
		sorry.   Are you all right?

    
There is another silence.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What happened?
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		A car ... a car accident.
    
				BETTY
		Are you okay?
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		I think so. I was just taking a shower.
    
				BETTY
		Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get

Betty goes to the bathroom door and is closing it when she
stops and looks back in.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What's your name?
    
We see a close-up of the dark-haired woman. We see her eyes
widen with a kind of fear. She's frantically thinking -
searching her mind for an answer.

		She sure is. She's letting me stay here
		while she's working on a movie that's
		being made in Canada, but I guess you
		know that.  I couldn't afford a place
		like this in a million years. Unless of
		course I'm discovered and become a movie
		star. Of course, I'd rather be known as
		a great actress than a movie star, but
		sometimes people end up being both and
		that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I

Rita motions to her head above her forehead. Betty looks
through her hair and finds her wound which has stopped
bleeding but is surrounded by a very large blue black
bruising.

		We should get a doctor.
    
				RITA
		No.
    
				BETTY
		But, this could be serious.

				RITA
		No...I need to sleep.
    
				BETTY
		If you have a concussion you shouldn't

		It will be okay if I sleep. I need to

				BETTY
		All right, but...I'm going to check on

Rita lies down and is instantly asleep. Betty leans over her

denim shirt open, T-shirt underneath, black denim jeans and
motorcycle boots. His black belt has silver studs. He's
smoking a cigarette and is laughing at something the man at
the desk has said. His laugh is easy and his grin is
infectious.
    
The man at the desk, Ed, wears a clean, crisp black suit,
like a business man's but unlike a business man his blonde
hair is long enough to go over his shoulders.
    
				JOE
		So man, that's unheard of ... an accident
		like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
    
				ED
		Unreal ... so, you're looking good.
		Whatcha doin' these days?
    
				JOE
		Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff
		for this guy.
    
				ED
		Making ends meet, huh.
    
				JOE
		Hardly.
    
				ED
		Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
    
				JOE
		Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope
		you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
    
				ED
		It was just a thing. The story made you
		laugh.
    
				JOE
		Yeah, that's a funny story.
    
Looking like he's rubbing the small of his back Joe moves
over to Ed at his desk. Joe looks down to the surface of the
desk - to a small worn black book.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		So, there it is ... Ed's famous black book.

    
				ED
		Yeah, the history of the world in phone
		numbers.
    
Joe's hand still at the small of his back moves into view
holding a silenced pistol and in one swift move reaches out
and fires a hole through Ed's temple - blowing Ed's brains
out across the desk, carpet and wall. Ed's head bangs down
on the desk, then is still save the leaking of blood from the
wounds. Joe flips his finished cigarette out the open window
behind Ed's desk, wipes the gun clean with a handkerchief and
places the cleaned gun in Ed's right hand. He places Ed's
right forefinger gently onto the trigger. As he puts the
finger on the trigger he presses a little too hard and the
gun goes off. The bullet shoots out and penetrates the cheap
wall at the far end of Ed's office. Joe hears a muffled
scream.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
			(disgusted with himself)
		Oh...man!
    
With a sense of "just more stuff I got to do" Joe moves
slowly and begrudgingly out of Ed's office, checks the
corridor and goes toward the screaming which still persists.
He opens up the office door next to Ed's and finds a heavy
set woman screaming bloody murder as she is grabbing her
buttock and lower back. He sighs and walks over to her and
cups his hand tightly around her mouth to squelch the
screaming. Wide-eyed, she tries to fight him off and he
begins dragging her out of her office. Joe's foot catches on
a computer cable clumsily taped across the floor and he falls
backwards bringing the heavy woman down with a bone-crushing
blow on top of him. The woman begins beating his face with
her meaty fists. Joe snaps her head back, instantly stilling
her violent activity. He wrestles the stunned heavyweight
back to her feet and out her door. He pushes and pulls her
into Ed's office. Just before they enter, Joe notices a man
with a vacuum cleaner watching him from the far end of the
corridor. He stops and calls to the man.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		Hey man. She's hurt bad. Get down here
		and use the phone. Help me out. You
		gotta call the hospital.
    
The man hesitates...not sure if this jives with what he's
seeing.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		I mean it! Get down here quick! She's
		hurt and I can't do everything myself,
		man.

    
Joe pushes the woman inside Ed's office, throws a glance back
down the corridor and sees the man is on his way to him,
pushing his industrial vacuum and trailing a 200 ft. long
thick black cord as he goes. Joe goes in to Ed's office
with the woman. He throws her down on the floor in line
between Ed's desk and the bullet hole in the wall. She
starts screaming immediately and struggles to get up. Joe
grabs the pistol from Ed's dead hand and lifts it to fire,
but the woman has turned around and is almost standing.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		No, no, no. You gotta be turned around.
    
He goes to her, slaps her hard in the face and spins her
around. Before she can turn again Joe races back to place
himself in the proper line at Ed's desk and quickly fires two
silenced shots into the back of her head. The man with the
vacuum enters. His eyes begin to widen in reaction to the
scene. Just then Joe fires a bullet into the man's chest.
The man inadvertently flicks on the vacuum cleaner as his
hands rush up to the wound. As the vacuum cleaner whines Joe
rushes to the man before the man falls back out into the
corridor. He pulls him into the room - the man moaning and
clutching his chest, starting to collapse. Joe releases him
and the man goes down. The vacuum cleaner seems to be
screeching now in the threshold. Joe fires the last bullet
into the heavy duty vacuum cleaner. The bullet shorts out
the internal wiring of the vacuum. That in turn blows the
building's circuit breaker and all the lights go out.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
			(disgusted with himself)
		Oh ... man!
    
Now he hears voices - voices moving into the corridor.
    
				VOICES
		What the hell .... what happened? What's
		this cord doing here? It's the vacuum.
		It's the vacuum what did it.
    
Joe cleans the pistol once again and places it back in
Eddie's hand - Eddie's finger on the trigger. Joe picks up
the black book - turns and makes his escape by going out the
office window and quickly descending the rusty fire escape.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CENTURY CITY BUILDING - DAY
    
We see three men sitting at a conference table RAYMOND(RAY)
HOTT -president of production, wearing a crisp blue
suit,VINCENT DARBY -senior vice-president, wearing a crisp
green suit and ROBERT SMITH -talent manager, wearing a crisp
brown suit. Ray and Mr. Darby sit at the head of the table
and Robert Smith sits along the side. A younger man -ADAM
KESHER enters and sits down, with an arrogant nonchalance,
next to Robert Smith. Adam is dressed in a frumpy old
fashioned plaid shirt, worn jacket, dark blue cotton slacks,
and a pair of old brown wing tips. As he sits he is holding
and twirling a vintage "7-iron" golf club.
    
				ADAM
		So what's the problem?
    
				RAY
		There is no problem.
    
				ADAM
		So why did you idiots bring me
		here? ... I'm in the middle of making a
		picture.
    
Silence for a moment. A man enters through a rear door and
whispers something to Mr. Darby and shows him something on a
piece of paper. Mr. Darby studies the piece of paper.
    
				MR. DARBY
			(to man who entered)
		What was it last time?
    
The man who entered points to something on the paper.
    
				MR. DARBY (cont'd)
		Okay, let's try the next one.
    
The man nods and leaves.
    
				RAY
		He isn't gonna like it.
    
				MR. DARBY
		We'll see.
    
				ADAM
		Hello ... who're we talkin' about here?
    
Robert Smith shuffles nervously in his chair next to Adam.

    
				ROBERT SMITH
		You see Adam... there are some suggestions
		which are to be brought forward ... and I
		know you said you would entertain
		suggestions and that's all anybody here
		is asking you to do.
    
				ADAM
		What're you talking about?

		An open mind ... You're in the process of

EXT. CENTURY CITY - DAY
    
Before us is a huge modern office building of glass and
steel. Two men in dark suits have exited a large limousine
and are walking up into the building. We drift up the facade,
higher and higher moving in toward the top of the building.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
    
The men exit an elevator and move through a lobby where a
plaque beneath an enormous bronze sculpture reads "Ryan
Entertainment". Gliding we travel behind the two men down a
wide, carpeted hallway with blonde wood and glass on each
side. They enter through two large blonde wooden doors to the
conference room.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
    
The men in dark suits go in as if they owned the place. Ray,
Mr. Darby and Robert Smith stand immediately. Adam remains
seated. Mr. Darby is the only one near enough to attempt a
hand shake, but when he offers his hand it is not taken. The
men in dark suits sit down without wasting a movement and
without acknowledging anyone. One of the men in a dark suit
opens a briefcase. Ray has been trying to make
introductions.
    
				RAY
		Ah... the Castigliane brothers. Let me
		introduce you around ... please ... sit down.
		(after they've already seated
		themselves) ... this is Mr. Darby whom you
		know and this is the director Adam
		Kesher and his manager Robert Smith
    
The Castigliane brothers do not acknowledge any of this,
however, during the introductions the one with the briefcase
removes a photo of a girl and sets it in front of Ray.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Ah... she's very pretty.
    
We see the photo of the girl - of a nice looking blonde -
someone we've never seen before. Adam looks like he doesn't
know what's going on and he's getting upset about not
knowing. His manager, Robert Smith, is beginning to see the
makings of a confrontation - he's starting to panic.
    
				MR. DARBY
			(referring to Castigliane
			brothers)
		May I offer you gentlemen anything?
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Espresso.

				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		Nothing. 
    
				ADAM
		Uh  what's the photo for?
    
				MR. DARBY
			(picking up phone and speaking)
		One espresso ... no, that's it.
			(sets phone down - addresses
			Castigliane brothers)
		I think you're going to enjoy your
		espresso this time... I've been doing
		quite a bit of research knowing how hard
		you are to please... this one comes highly
		recommended.
    
				ADAM
		What's the photo for?
    
				RAY
			(to Adam)
		A recommendation... a recommendation to
		you Adam.
    
				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		Not a recommendation.
    
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		This is the girl.
    
				ADAM
		What girl? For what? What is this Ray?
    
Ray, still standing with a forced smile, turns to the
Castigliane brothers.
    
				RAY
		We'd be happy to put her in the pile for
		considerations ... you'd be pleased to know
		there's quite a lot of interest in this
		role.
    
				ADAM
		Interest?! There's six of the top
		actresses that want this thing.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		This is the girl.
    
				ADAM
		Ray...you better take care of this.
    
				ROBERT SMITH
		Hold on ... hold on, Adam.
    
				ADAM
		Hold on!!!!!!!! There's no way, there's
		no way!!!
    
Luigi Castigliane's espresso is brought in by the man who had
been in earlier. The man sets the espresso down in front of
Luigi and takes a step back. The room becomes silent -
watching the Espresso Man and Luigi. Without looking up Luigi
speaks softly.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Napkin.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN
			(leading forward to hear)
		Pardon?
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Napkin.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN
		Of course. Excuse me.
    
The Espresso Man leaves the room. Luigi looks at the
espresso. Vincenzo stares at Adam.
    
Adam is doing his best to stare down Vincenzo. The Espresso
man returns with a cloth napkin and lays it down next to the
espresso.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN (cont'd)
		Will that be all, Sir?
    
Luigi doesn't answer and after a moment of standing very
still waiting, the Espresso Man turns and leaves the room.
    
Adam is stared down by Vincenzo and averts his eyes to the
espresso cup. He looks around at Ray and Mr. Darby - seeing
them stare at the espresso cup.
    
Vincenzo keeps staring at Adam.
    
Luigi picks up the napkin and holds it in his left hand.
With his right hand he lifts the espresso cup and places it
above the napkin. He brings the cup and napkin to his mouth.
He takes a sip of espresso. A small fleeting expression forms
on Luigi's impassive face as if for one millisecond he is
going to vomit. His mouth opens and he allows the espresso
to fall and dribble onto the napkin. He pushes any remaining
espresso in his mouth out with his tongue. He holds it in
that position for a moment.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Is shit!
    
Luigi Castigliane stands up.
    
				RAY
		I'm sorry. That was a highly
		recommended...
    
				MR. DARBY
		That's considered one of the finest
		espressos in the world , Sir.
    
Luigi just stands there. A small thread on his left suit
jacket pocket catches his attention and he smooths it back
into the fabric. Vincenzo closes his briefcase, takes out a
hankerchief and cleans his nose - then stands, placing the
handkerchief back in his pocket.
    
				ADAM
		Wait a minute!! What's going on here?
    
Vincenzo just stares toward Adam as if he's not even there.
    
				ADAM
		There's no way that girl is in my movie!
    
Silence.

    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		That is the girl.
    
The Castigliane brothers begin to leave. Adam stands up
trembling with anger.
    
				ADAM
		Hey!!!!! That girl is not in my film!!!
    
				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		It is no longer your film.
    
Adam turns white and stands very still as this sinks in. The
Castigliane brothers leave. As the big blonde wood doors
close behind them Adam starts to boil.
    
				ADAM
			(screaming)
		You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
    
				RAY
		I'll speak to someone.
    
				ADAM
			(turning to his manager)
		And you'd better speak to someone
		too ... or find yourself another client!!
		This smells like a set-up to me!
			(back to Ray)
		And by the way, Ray, I don't know who
		these guys are kidding, but every foot of
		film I've shot is in a vault at the lab
		that only I can access. No one's getting
		that film!!
    
				ROBERT SMITH
		This is a catastrophe...
			(turning toward Ray)
		you told me they might insist on a girl,
		that's all.
    
				ADAM
		Why didn't you tell me, Robert? That's
		what I mean ... you set me up! I woulda
		never come here.
			(standing)
		I'm leaving. I'm a director you don't
		want to lose ... you guys better fix this!!
    
Adam storms out of the room.

		Well...I didn't know that was going to

Adam exits the building carrying his 7-iron. An attendant
takes his valet parking ticket. While Adam, still fuming,
waits for his car he notices the big limo standing off to one
side. He stares at the car and the huge limo driver leaning
up against the front driver's side door.
    
Adam's car arrives - a late model Porsche. Before Adam gets
into his car he addresses the attendant.
    
				ADAM
		Did the Castigliane brothers get out of
		that limo?
    
				ATTENDANT
		They two guys in dark suits?
    
Adam nods and walks over to the limo. The limo driver eyes
him and his 7-iron suspiciously.
    
				ADAM
		Castigliane brothers?
    
				LIMO DRIVER
		Beat it!
    
				ADAM
		O.K.
    
Adam raises his 7-iron and smashes out the limo's windshield.
He whacks two big dents in the hood, then smashes out a
headlight. The limo driver starts towards him. Adam laughs,
runs to his car and takes off.

INT. AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - LATER DAY
    
Betty is stretched out on the big leather couch in the living
room. A half eaten sandwich and chips are on a plate on the
coffee table next to her. She is talking on the phone.

    
				BETTY
		No Grandpa, you wouldn't believe it.
		It's more beautiful than I ever
		dreamed ... no she left me a lot of food.
		The refrigerator's full ... Aunt Ruthie
		said she'd call me when she got
		settled... it was real smooth. I sat next
		to a lady who gave up her first class
		seat to a boy with a broken leg. She was
		so nice to me. She invited me to her
		house sometime. It's in Bel Air which is
		a place where people have a lot of
		money... I will. Everybody's telling me
		to be careful, but I sure love it here
		Grandpa. Thank you for helping me get
		here ... yeah, it's long distance. I love
		you. Say hello to Grams. Give her a big
		kiss for me. Okay, I love you
		Grandpa ... bye.
    
Betty hangs up the phone, takes a big bite of her sandwich
and lays flat out on the couch, chewing and smiling up at the
ceiling. She suddenly remembers Rita and her promise to look
in on her. She gets off the couch and goes into the bedroom.

INT. - EXT. APARTMENT - DAY
    
Betty rinses her dishes in the kitchen sink and pours herself
a cup of coffee. She takes the coffee outside to the
courtyard - to a white metal table just outside her doorway.
She sits down and stretches in the warm afternoon sun.
Across the way she can hear a blues saxophonist practicing in
one of the apartments. She drinks her coffee and listens to
the music.
    
Some birds fly by overhead. She takes another sip of coffee.
The blues music which was mellow and slow is now building in
tempo and volume. The phone inside rings. Betty takes her
coffee back into the living room, shutting the door behind
her. She crosses to the leather couch and picks up the
phone.
    
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Hello ... Aunt Ruth!! I can't tell you how
		happy I am. Your place is so fantastic!
		Yes ... Coco...what a character. I really
		like her... that's too bad...waiting in an
		airport must not be too fun. What's a
		mosquito plane? ... Oh I get it. How long
		does that take from Montreal? ... Well,
		you'll sleep good tonight ... Hudson Bay
		sounds beautiful ...oh well, I hope you
		packed your coat. (laughs). You mean

		mention it but he'll fax the dialogue to
		Coco? Suddenly I'm so nervous ... okay
		Aunt Ruth... I'll try. I'll study those
		lines until I know them inside out.
		Yes, either right here on this fabulous
		leather couch or I'll take them with a
		coffee in the courtyard like a regular
		movie star. (laughs). Oh! I got a real
		shock to find your friend Rita here. She
		was in the shower and I opened the
		door ... Rita ... what do you mean? She was
		in an accident ... your friend Rita. No,
		Coco unlocked the door. No, she didn't
		see her. She's sleeping. No... she's
		very nice. I'm sure there's some
		explanation, Aunt Ruth... I don't think we
		have to do that. Please don't worry.
		I'll take care of it. No, I'll let you

		from Coco.
		No, please don't worry... thank you so
		much for letting me stay here. You've
		made me so happy... thank you, thank you.
		Please don't worry... Aunt Ruth we don't
		need the police. I'll call you when you
		get to Hudson Bay. Please...
		please ... Goodbye Aunt Ruth.
    
Betty slowly and quietly hangs up the phone. She sits for a
moment listening. Silently she stands and moves toward the
bedroom. As she approaches the bedroom door she stops at
something she sees. Rita is sitting on the edge of the bed
crying quietly. Betty goes into the bedroom. Rita looks up
at her with desperation.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		You're awake... I think I misunderstood
		you. I thought you knew my Aunt and
		that's why you were here. I just talked
		to my Aunt on the phone and she wants me

Rita starts crying harder, bows down, covering her face with
her hands.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Rita?

		I'm... sorry. I ...

Betty's heart softens.

		I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke
		up... I thought sleep would do it ...
    
Betty kneels down in front of her.
    
				BETTY
		What's wrong?
    
				RITA

		I don't know who I am.
    
				BETTY
		What do you mean? You're Rita.
    
				RITA
			(crying)
		I'm not. I don't know what my name is.
		I don't know who I am!!
    
Betty looks down at the purse next to Rita's dress. She picks
it up and hands it to Rita.
    
				BETTY
		This is your purse. Your name must be in
		your purse.
    
Rita takes the purse with sudden trepidation. She hesitates.
Something is worrying her. She looks at Betty for help.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		You want to know don't you?
    
				RITA
		I ... yes, but ... I ...

    
				BETTY
		Open it!
    
Rita slowly unzips the purse. The pressure of its contents
force the mouth of the purse to widen as the zipper opens and
then there is suddenly revealed what will later be known to
be $125,000.00 cash in hundred dollar bills.
    
Both Rita and Betty almost stop breathing. They look at each
other, then back to the money.
    
Rita takes the massive wad of bills out of the purse and sets
it on the bed. She reaches back inside and comes up with the
only other remaining item in the purse ... A BLUE KEY. Betty
sees Rita's expression change to a kind of horror.
(note: This blue key is made of very fine heavy metal and
does not look like a door key.)

Ray crosses a carpeted closed area. He mounts a flight of
stairs. At the top of the stairs there's a plain blonde wood
door. Ray punches in a code on a security panel next to it.
The door opens automatically. Ray passes through and goes
down a narrow hall. At the end of the hall there is a small
elevator. Again Ray punches in a code. The elevator opens and
Ray goes in. The elevator door closes, but the elevator does
not move. Ray waits. Finally, a woman's voice comes through a
speaker.
    
				WOMAN'S VOICE
		Who is it please?

The elevator begins to move up. When it stops, the door opens

beautiful Italian woman sits behind a large, blonde, modern,
built-in desk.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
			(very quietly)
		You may go right in, Ray.
    
Ray crosses to a blonde wood double door and waits. The
receptionist pushes a button behind her desk - chimes sound
as the double doors open to an enormous office with no
windows. Heavy rich brown curtains line the walls.
    
    
Ray enters and the doors close behind him. Ray takes a few
steps forward, then stops. There is a solid glass wall that
we now notice running the width of the office. Cut into the
glass wall is a small speaker microphone apparatus. Beyond
the glass off in the center of the room is a man sitting in a
very plain, blonde, wood, modern, yet not motorized,
wheelchair. The man is paralyzed except for his right hand
and head. His head appears small in relation to the size of
his body. His suit is immaculate and one of the finest we've
ever seen. His manservant stands in the shadows behind him.
    
				RAY
		Good afternoon Mr. Roque. (pronounced
		Rowk).
    
Mr. Roque stares at Ray silently.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Do you want him replaced?
    
Mr. Roque continues to stare.
    
				RAY
		I know they said...
    
				MR. ROQUE
		Then?
    
				RAY
		Then... I guess it's so .... alright, but
		that means we should ...
    
				MR. ROQUE
		Yes?
    
				RAY
		Shut everything down ... Is that something
		that...do you want us to shut everything
		down?
    
Silence. Ray doesn't know what to do. He struggles to
interpret Mr. Roque's silence. He waits. Mr. Roque does
nothing but stare.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Then we'll shut everything down.
    
Silence.
    
Ray turns. The doors open as he approaches them and he

				BILLY
		Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.

		No, no, no, I told you. They're fine.

Mr. Roque, in his wheelchair is still in the center of the
huge softly lit, windowless office. His manservant standing
silently behind him. The small built-in wheelchair phone
rings. Mr. Roque pushes a button on a small intricate remote
device he holds in his right hand. A slender streamlined
microphone rises from the arm of the chair.
    
				MR. ROQUE
		Yes?
    
He listens through a high-tech earplant which we now see.

thumb are stretched tapered high gloss red fingernails which
slightly curve downward. The forefinger of the hand presses
a button on the phone. A small tone sounds - followed by a

We pull back from Rita's face until we see that Betty and

BEVERLY HILLS CITY STREETS - DAY
    
A car - a late model generic sedan is moving toward us. Two
men dressed in suits and wearing dark glasses are driving
slowly. As they go each man is scanning sidewalks,
buildings, passing cars as if hunting for someone. They pass
by us and as we turn we leave them and pick-up Adam driving
in the opposite direction in the other lane. We stay with
Adam.
    
Adam drives his Porsche up a palm lined street.

    
				ADAM
		Office...
    
The voice activated phone connects the line to Adam's office.
A secretary answers.

The girls are still sitting on the leather couch as before,

Betty's question hangs in the air. Slowly we move close to
Rita who is on the verge of remembering something.

    
Suddenly -

EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - BEL AIR
    
Adam pulls into his driveway, but is blocked from entering
the garage by a poolman's truck. He gets out of the car and
looks at the truck - sees the insignia on the door which is a
blue square with the word "Gene" above and the word "Clean"
below. Adam hears steps behind him and turns. A JAPANESE
GARDENER is coming toward him smiling and bowing.
    
				JAPANESE GARDENER
		Ah, Mister ... you remember me. I am Taka.
		your gardener. For long time I not see

Taka reaches out his hand and Adam shakes it.

		Hello Taka. It's 'cause I'm never home

			(calling out)
		Lorraine...
			(then louder)
		Lorraine ... you home?
    
He hears a noise, something falling. He walks in the
direction of the noise. It leads him to his bedroom. His
expression darkens as he approaches the closed door. He
hears voices as he throws the door open.
    
LORRAINE and the poolman GENE are in bed.

		Now, you've done it!
    
				GENE
		Just forget you ever saw it. It's better

Adam stands stunned for a moment. Then finds himself walking
over to the dresser and opening the top drawer. He removes a
large case.

Adam starts walking out of the bedroom with the case.

INT. ADAM'S KITCHEN - DAY
    
Adam leaves the kitchen and goes out into the garage. He
turns on the light and looks around. He spots some paint
cans on a shelf and grabs one and goes back into the kitchen.
He can hear Lorraine calling his name. She seems to be
coming closer. He sets the jewelry case and the paint can on
the floor, kneels down and opens the paint can with his car
key. Just as Lorraine enters the kitchen, he opens the
jewelry box and empties the 3/4 full gallon can of Hot Pink
paint into her jewelry case.
    
				LORRAINE
		WHAT.. ARE ... YOU ... DOING!!!???
    
He puts his hands into the paint and jewels and smushes them
about. Lorraine rushes toward him.
    
				LORRAINE (cont'd)
		STOP IT!!!
    
Lorraine grabs hold of him. Starts pulling his hair,
slapping his face. She tears his jacket. Adam stands all at
once and with his wet Hot Pink hands he pushes Lorraine and
slams her into the kitchen counter just as Gene the poolman
enters. Gene grabs ahold of Adam, cocks back and slams his
huge suntanned fist into Adam's face.
    
				GENE
		That's not a way to treat your wife,
		buddy. I don't care what she's done.
    
Adam gets up off the floor bleeding from the nose and tries
to hit Gene. Gene blocks his punch and slams Adam again,
knocking him down to the kitchen floor where he lands and
spills the jewelry case. Adam, now covered with paint, is
picked up by Gene and thrown out toward the front door.
    
				LORRAINE
		Throw him out!
    
Lorraine opens the front door while Gene picks Adam up, moves
him across the carpet and heaves him out onto the front lawn.
Lorraine slams the door behind him.
    
Adam picks himself up, severely dazed and bleeding pretty
badly, he heads for his car.

    
Taka stops gardening and smiles and bows at Adam as he gets

They look around the room... There's a hatbox in the closet
above the clothes rack. Betty brings it down, takes out the
hat, and Rita puts the purse inside. Betty puts the hat over

excitement about life lifts Rita's spirits.
    
Coming toward them on the sidewalk are two people - a middle-
aged woman and a young boy around 10 years old. The boy is
very thin and something is wrong with him as he is walking
awkwardly on crutches. As the two groups pass each other on
the sidewalk Betty is struck deeply by the boy's brilliant,
luminous blue eyes which are at once innocent and filled with
wisdom.

    
After they pass each other Betty turns back and sees the boy

PAYPHONE ON RED BRICK WALL - DAY
    
We see the red brick building. It is Denny's. Betty and
Rita are walking to the payphone. Betty digs out some change
from her purse. She picks up the receiver, drops in a
quarter and dials the "0" for Operator. An Operator answers.

		Hollywood Police Department please.
    
				OPERATOR
		Is this an emergency?
    
				BETTY
		No, no, I just want the number.

		No. I can't.

Betty hangs up. She turns to Rita smiling like a girl who's
done something bad and gotten away with it.

		There was an accident. He wouldn't tell

The same waitress - Diane, comes up to the girl's table and
freshens up their coffee. Betty looks up and smiles, sees
Diane's nameplate.

		No. Just the coffee.
    
				BETTY
		We'll take our check.
    
Diane searches through her many checks to find Betty and
Rita's.
    
The manager of Denny's, standing with a woman in a blue
dress, calls Diane's name. Diane turns and looks to the
manager and the woman. A fleeting fear goes through her
eyes. She surreptitiously reaches in her pocket and takes
out a Mont Blanc fountain pen which she puts under Betty's
check as she places it on their table. She does this very
quickly but Betty notices this and Diane notices Betty
noticing. Diane walks quickly over to the manager and the
woman in the blue dress. Betty turns and watches a heated
conversation that she can't hear, but she sees the woman in
the blue dress searching her purse and shrugging and then
leaving.

    
The manager says something to Diane and Diane turns her
pockets inside out and pats herself down in front of the
manager showing him her innocence. He waves her off and she
goes behind the counter to retrieve an order of food. Betty
stops watching and turns her attention to Rita, who is tense
and lost in a thought.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What is it Rita?
    
				RITA
			(without moving a muscle)
		Shhhh.
    
At that moment Diane the waitress reappears at their table.
Diane looks Betty in the eye and while looking at Betty her
left hand slides the Mont Blanc out from under the check and
back into her pocket.
    
				DIANE
		Thank you. Come in again.
    
Betty holds her gaze.
    
				BETTY
		You're welcome. We will.
    
Relieved Diane leaves and goes about her business. Betty
looks over at Rita waiting for her to tell her something.
Rita slowly turns and focuses on Betty.

Selwyn followed by an address and phone number. It is the

Betty reads the number off and Rita pushes the corresponding
buttons. Each tone seems to be louder than the last. The
ringing seems deafening. There's a click and the phone is
answered - by a machine. A woman's voice is heard - loudly.
    
				WOMAN'S VOICE
			(coming from answering machine)
		Hi ... this is me. Leave me a message.
    
Betty now has her ear pressed up against the phone also -
straining to hear everything. The machine starts recording.
Betty hangs up the phone immediately.
    
				RITA
		It's not my voice ... but I know her.

Taka is bowing and smiling and nodding to someone we don't
see.
    
TAKA'S POV - A man, KENNY, in a sharp black suit is walking
down the driveway past Gene the Poolman's truck to the front
door of Adam's house. Parked at the street is a big limo
with Vincenzo and Luigi Castigliane sitting in the back.
    
Kenny knocks on Adam's front door. Lorraine answers.
Lorraine's hands are covered with pink paint. Pink paint is
on her face and clothes.
    
				KENNY
		Adam Kesher...he...
    
				LORRAINE
		Yeah, right ... get lost!
    
She slams the door, but Kenny's foot stops it and pushes it
back with a force that shakes the wall as the door slams open
once again. Kenny enters the house.
    
				KENNY
		This is Adam Kesher's house. Where...
    
				LORRAINE
		Like hell it is! Get out ... NOW!!!
    
Gene comes out of the kitchen fast, his hands covered with
pink paint.
    
				GENE
		I guess you don't understand English.
		She asked to leave. Here's the door.
    
Gene grabs hold of Kenny and starts to push him out the door.
Kenny rabbit punches Gene in the nose with lightning speed -
his fist like a sledgehammer. Gene goes down. Lorraine
shrieks and leaps on Kenny. Her long fingernails going for
his eyes. Kenny slaps Lorraine hard. The shriek stops
instantly and she falls out cold on the carpet. Gene is back
up and going for Kenny. Kenny gets three punches in on Gene's
head before Gene hits the ground unconscious. Kenny rubs some
pink paint off his hands and tries to get a pink stain off
his jacket. He begins walking around the house calling out
for Adam. He sees nothing and hears nothing. He goes back to
the front door and sees Adam's golf clubs sitting there.
Kenny begins snapping the shaft of each club. As he snaps
each club we see Lorraine and Gene remain out cold on the
floor.

    
And in the kitchen we see that the tap is on and the sink
water is now overflowing from the sink and jewelry box -

		Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea

		Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the

		Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.

Adam, in his Porsche, makes his way up the canyon.
    
INT. PORSCHE
    
Adam feeling like a fool drives up the dark, winding canyon
road. As he nears the top of the canyon the residential area
gives way to desert brush. The road winds steeply up to a
dark dead end where an old barn and stable sit. Adam parks in
a little dirt lot and walk up past the barn to the corral.
His eyes grow accustomed to the dark and he.looks about. No
one is around. There's only a light wind and a few twinkling
stars in the sky above. Suddenly some bare bulbs hanging from
the corral gate flare up. Adam hears a noise in the
brightness and turns. There walking toward him into the light
is the Cowboy - dressed in clean blue denim jeans, well-oiled
unscuffed, beautifully engraved cowboy boots, a red
embroidered ivory buttoned cowboy shirt complete with string
tie. Atop the Cowboy's head is a 10 X white Stetson. The
Cowboy is smiling warmly as he approaches. He stops in front
of Adam and begins to speak with a true, slow Western drawl.
    
				COWBOY
		Howdy!
    
				ADAM
		Howdy to you.

    
				COWBOY
		Beautiful night.
    
				ADAM
		Yeah.
    
				COWBOY
		Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the
		way up to see me from that Beverly Hills
		Hotel.

				ADAM
		No problem. What's on your mind?
    
				COWBOY
		Well now, here's a man who wants to get
		right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it
		are ya?
    
				ADAM
		Whatever.
    
				COWBOY
		A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes
		some ways toward how a man's life will
		be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
    
				ADAM
		Sure.
    
				COWBOY
		Now... did you answer cause you thought
		that's what I wanted to hear or did you
		think about what I said and answer cause
		you truly believe that to be right?
    
				ADAM
		I agree with what you said...truly.
    
				COWBOY
		What did I say?
    
				ADAM
		That a man's attitude determines to a
		large extent how his life will be.
    
				COWBOY
		So since you agree I guess you could be a
		person who does not care about the good
		life.
    
				ADAM
		How's that?

    
				COWBOY
		Well, just stop for a little second and
		think about it. Will ya do that for me?
    
				ADAM
		Okay, I'm thinking.
    
				COWBOY
		No. You're too busy being a smart aleck
		to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think
		and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya
		do that for me?
    
				ADAM
		Look ... where's this going? What do you
		want me to do?
    
				COWBOY
		There's sometimes a buggy. How many
		drivers does a buggy have?
    
				ADAM
		One.
    
				COWBOY
		So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy
		and you fix your attitude and you can
		ride along with me.
    
				ADAM
		Okay.
    
				COWBOY
		Now I know a few things. I know you have
		had a rough day. You're probably thinkin'
		I don't know the half of it, but in
		actual fact I know every part of it. The
		business of gittin' thrown off your
		movie, the heartache of seeing your wife
		with another man... losin' access to that
		precious film vault...
    
Adam suddenly looks stunned, unsure.
    
				COWBOY (cont'd)
		... realizin' you don't have hardly a
		nickel to your name and then add on to
		that the sickenin' feeling some men are
		gonna catch you and hurt you bad for
		bustin' their vehicle. Some days are like
		that. They are rough, but what will
		tomorrow bring? Will it be better than
		today? The same ... or worse?
		A lot of that is up to us individually.
		Up to us and our attitude. When the
		Castigliane brothers said "This is no
		longer your film," they meant it, but
		they didn't mean you were not going to
		direct it. I want you to go back to work
		tomorrow. You were re-casting the lead
		actress anyway ... audition many girls for
		the part. When you see the girl that was
		shown to you earlier today, you will say
		" This is the girl." The rest of the
		cast can stay- that is up to you, but
		that lead girl is not up to you. Now,
		you will see me one more time if you do
		good. You will see me two more times if
		you do bad. Good night.
    
The Cowboy turns and walks until he is engulfed in darkness.
Through the darkness Adam hears the sound of a car door
opening and closing, then another opening and closing and
then the sound of the car driving away. Adam walks up in the
direction the Cowboy took, but he sees no sign of a car nor
any dust nor any road. He goes back down past the barn and
stables to his car. There standing by his Porsche is the
Cowboy.
    
				COWBOY (cont'd)
		You thinkin' this'll work out, cause I
		was thinkin' it just might.
    
				ADAM
		It will work out.
    
				COWBOY
		Good then, but, just in case, that bank's
		gonna stay closed a bit longer. You
		understand that?
    
				ADAM
		I understand.
    
				COWBOY
		You're an understandin' fella.
    
				ADAM
		So, this is the last time I see you then
		unless I do bad?
    
				COWBOY
		No, this one doesn't count. It's part of
		the original one. So then ... until we meet
		again.
    
				ADAM
		Okay.
    
Adam gets in his car and drives off leaving the Cowboy
smiling behind him.

		that.
    
				BETTY
		Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.

    
				COCO
		Get going. You don't want to be late.
    
				BETTY
		Right. See ya.
    
				COCO
		Good luck, honey!
    
Betty takes off through the iron gates and Coco smiles as she
watches her go.

Betty is wide-eyed and filled with awe at something she is
seeing.

EXT. - PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - MAIN ENTRANCE GATE - DAY
    
The cab pulls up to the gate. Betty pays the driver and gets
out. She-stands for a moment staring at a dream.
    
She walks through the gate and as she goes is stopped by a
PARAMOUNT GUARD.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		And where do we think we're going, Miss?
    
Betty stops and turns.
    
				BETTY
		To my audition.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		And who are we auditioning for today?
    
				BETTY
		Wally Brown.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		And do we know which of the fifty-seven
		buildings Wally Brown is in?
    
				BETTY
			(smiling)
		No, we don't.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		Well, now we've got to figure that out
		first don't we?
    
				BETTY
		Yes, Sir.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive
		Building on the second floor. We want to
		go in and turn right at the first street.
		Then we want to walk three blocks down
		past Stage 17 to the white Executive
		Building. Once we're on the second floor
		the receptionist will take us from there.
		Now do we have name?
    
				BETTY
		Betty Elms.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		Let's see if we have a pass for Betty
		Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good
		luck Miss. Elms.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you... thank you very much.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT.   EXECUTIVE BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR - DAY
    
Betty finishes climbing some stairs and crosses to the
receptionist. She hands over her pass. The receptionist
looks at it, hands it back to Betty and points down the hall
to her left.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
		Number 43, on the left.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you.
    
Betty walks down the long corridor past several offices. The
door to office 43 is open when she arrives and she enters a
large sitting room with a receptionist at a desk off to one
side.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
		May I help you?

    
				BETTY
		My name is Betty Elms. I'm here to
		audition for... Mr. Brown
    
				RECEPTIONIST
		Good. Perfect timing. Have a seat and
		I'll get Mr. Brown.
    
The receptionist stands, walks to a door, knocks twice, then
enters.
    
She closes the door behind her and Betty is alone in the
sitting room. She sits on a couch and looks at the old
movie posters covering all four walls.
    
In a moment the same door opens again and an elderly,
distinguished looking gentleman WALLY BROWN comes out
smiling. Betty stands up immediately.
    
				WALLY
		Betty Elms?
    
				BETTY
		Yes.
    
				WALLY
		I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear
		friend of mine so it's particularly nice
		to meet you.
    
				BETTY
		Very pleased to meet you.

				WALLY
		Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
    
As they walk into Wally's office...
    
				WALLY (cont'd)
		I took the liberty of inviting an extra
		person to see your audition. She saw
		your resume picture and was very
		interested in meeting you.
    
Inside Wally's office several people rise out of chairs when
Wally enters with Betty.
    
				WALLY (cont'd)
		Betty Elms this is Jack Taft, my
		assistant, Jimmy Katz who we've already
		cast for the part of "Chuck". He'll be
		doing the scene with you.
		This is Julie Chadwick and Bob Brooker,
		the director, and our surprise guest is
		Sarah James. We couldn't afford her to
		cast our picture, but as casting agents
		go she's the best.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Why thank you, Wally. Hello Betty.
    
She and Betty shake hands.
    
				BETTY
		Pleased to meet you.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		This is Nicki, my assistant.
    
Nicki, a very stylish, thin girl with black cat-eyed glasses
nods coolly to Betty.
    
				WALLY
		And this is Martha, Martha Johnson, who
		you met out front.
    
Betty nervously smiles to the room.
    
				BETTY
		Hi.
    
				WALLY
		Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like
		a water or a coffee before we begin?
    
Betty's hands are beginning to sweat.
    
				BETTY
		No, no, I'm fine.
    
				WALLY
		Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty
		why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play
		the scene. Is there anything you'd like
		to say Bob... something to Betty before
		they begin?
    
Betty stops on her way across to Jimmy and looks to Bob the
director.
    
				BOB
		No ... it's not a contest, see, the two of
		them with themselves, so don't play it
		for real until it gets real.

    
Betty doesn't know what to say. She catches Sarah's
assistant, Nicki, rolling her eyes.
    
				BETTY
		Okay.
    
Betty continues walking toward Jimmy who opens his arms to
her as she approaches. He's old enough to be her father.
    
				JIMMY
		Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
    
				BETTY
		What?
    
				JIMMY
		I want to play this one close, Bob. Like
		it was with that girl, what's her name,
		with the black hair. That felt good.
		Whaddya think?
    
Betty looks from Jimmy to Bob.
    
				BOB
		That'd be good, Jimmy. Just don't rush
		that line again. I told you... the line
		where you say, "Before what?"
    
				JIMMY
		I was playin' off 'em. They say,
		"They'll arrest you"... and stuff like
		that.. "put you in jail"... they say it
		like that. They all say it the same way,
		so I react like that.
    
Jimmy turns to Betty.
    
				JIMMY (cont'd)
		Look ... what's your name?
    
				BETTY
		Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I
		don't rush it. We play it close, just
		like in the movies.
    
Jimmy reaches out and puts his arm around Betty and brings
her in against his pot belly.
    
				JIMMY (cont'd)
		Dad's best friend goes to work.

    
Jimmy smiles as he brings Betty a little closer. She is
trying to concentrate through the nervousness and Jimmy's
breath. There is a silence as Jimmy looks her in the eyes.
Everyone in the room is looking Betty in the eyes.
    
				WALLY
		Bob?
    
				BOB
		And ... ACTION!
    
Betty and Jimmy start the scene. It is very difficult for
Betty as Jimmy has her in an absurd clench now.
    
				BETTY
		You're still here?
    
				JIMMY
		I came back. I thought that's what you
		wanted.
    
Jimmy plays this with a big lecherous smile. He gives the
last part of the line across her cheek up to her ear.
    
				BETTY
		Nobody wants you here.
    
Betty uses the anger of this line to push herself away from
Jimmy. Jimmy reaches out and grabs her wrist.
    
				JIMMY
		Really?
    
Betty pulls her hand away and stands her ground.
    
				BETTY
		My parents are right upstairs! They
		think you've left.
    
Jimmy smiles broadly and moves again toward Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		So ... surprise!
    
Betty pushes him back.
    
				BETTY
		I can call them... I can call my dad.
    
				JIMMY
		But you won't.

    
He grabs Betty by the wrist again and pulls her in to him.
He puts his hand on her waist and it accidently slips and
keeps going down her hips. He jerks his hand back. Betty
looks down and sees Jimmy's hand hovering above her thigh.
Betty takes her hand and gently presses down on Jimmy's hand.
She slowly looks up with the most seductive smile. Jimmy
lets his hand rest more firmly on her thigh, and squeezes her
thigh as he sees her smile. With his other hand Jimmy gently
pulls her closer. Something has started coming over Betty
and she catches the drift of this scene in a different way.
She's surprising herself.
    
				BETTY
			(almost a hot whisper)
		You're playing a dangerous game here. if
		you're trying to blackmail me... it's not
		going to work.
    
Jimmy now surprises himself. He becomes almost tender and
genuinely worked up from the heat coming off Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		You know what I want...it's not that
		difficult.
    
Where the scene should turn to anger from Betty it can't now
and Betty plays it as she feels it. She stays in very close
to Jimmy - looking him right in the eyes.
    
				BETTY
			(whispering desperately -
			slowly)
		Get out... Get out before I call my dad.
		He trusts you... you're his best friend.
			(her arms go around him)
		This will be the end of everything.
    
Jimmy gets lost. He doesn't know where he is anymore. He
can only see Betty's eyes.
    
				JIMMY
		What about you? What will your dad think
		about you?
    
Betty still playing it in a dreamy whisper... lost in heat.
    
				BETTY
		Stop... just stop! That's what you said
		from the beginning. If I tell what
		happened... they'll arrest you and put
		you in jail, so get out of here before...
    
				JIMMY
			(caught by her transfixing,
			sultry eyes, and almost
			breathless ... he finds himself
			taking an extra long pause)
		Before what?
    
As scripted Betty pretends to pull the knife from behind her
back, but wraps the knife around behind Jimmy and pulls him
into a kiss.
    
				BETTY
			(as she kisses him - whispers)
		Before I kill you.
    
Jimmy panics and pushes Betty away with his hands on her
shoulders as if forcing himself to come out of a trance. He
finally is able to say his line.
    
				JIMMY
		Then they'd put you in jail.
    
As scripted Betty is supposed to cry now and it is very easy
for her to do this because she's ashamed at how the sex of
the scene took her over. Tears begin running down her
cheeks. She backs away.
    
				BETTY
		I hate you... I hate us both!
    
She pretends to drop the knife. The scene ends.
    
Everyone in the room has become mesmerized by Betty, but they
soon drift back to reality and begin applauding the
performance. Sarah turns to Nicki.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		I'm going to take her over there.
    
				NICKI
		Big time!
    
				WALLY
			(to everyone)
		Wow!
    
Betty wipes her eyes and turns smiling - still shocked at
herself.
    
				BETTY
		Well, there it was.

    
				JIMMY
		There it was it was! Baby, you got a
		way!
    
				WALLY
		Bob?
    
				BOB
		Very good. Really. I mean it was forced
		maybe but still humanistic. Yeah, very
		good, really.
    
				WALLY
		Well, thank you Betty, and I mean that.
		That was very impressive. You've done
		your Aunt proud and I'm going to tell her
		the first chance I get. We'll speak again
		soon I'm sure, and thank you so much for
		coming in.
    
				BETTY
		Well, thank you.
    
Betty doesn't quite know what to do. She moves to the center
of the room and just stands. Remnants of the scene still
staying with her.
    
Sarah stands and Nicki stands just after.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Thank you, Wally. I'm sure you all have a
		lot to talk about. We'll walk Betty out.
    
				WALLY
		Well, yes indeed. Our pleasure, Sarah,
		and don't you be a stranger. We'd love to
		see you around here again real soon.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Well come along, Betty.
    
Sarah takes Betty's hand and they go to the door. Betty turns
back once more and smiles.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you again, Mr. Brown. It was nice
		meeting all of you.
    
Everyone nods and waves and Betty is taken out by Sarah and
Nicki.

INT.- CORRIDOR EXECUTIVE BUILDING - DAY
    
The three of them walk down the corridor.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Oh God, that was awful!
    
Betty's head spins to Sarah. A look of shock and let down on
her face.
    
				SARAH JAMES (cont'd)
		Oh, not you Betty. You were stellar and
		I mean that, but poor Wally. He'll never
		get that picture made. Wally's days were
		up twenty -years ago.
    
				NICKI
			(sickening little laugh)
		How about that Jimmy Katz?
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Oh god! Jimmy Katz never had a day.
		Jimmy Katz never had a minute. Poor
		Wally.
    
Betty finds herself getting a little upset.
    
				BETTY
		They seem very nice to me, and
		Wally... Mr. Brown is a very close friend
		of my Aunt's, so. . .
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Settle down, Betty. Don't get me wrong.
		I love Wally. I ought to. I was married
		to him for ten years.
    
Betty does another shocked head turn.
    
				SARAH JAMES (cont'd)
		And I love actors, all actors, Jimmy Katz
		included. We just get a little catty
		sometimes. Now we want to take you across
		the way and introduce you to a director
		who's a head above the rest. He's got a
		project that you would kill!
    
At the word 'kill' Betty turns to her once again with a
questioning look.

    
				SARAH JAMES (cont'd)
		... Knock it right out of the park.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. - RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

We see what looks like a recording studio right out of the
1960's. We're looking through a plate of glass. A blonde
girl is standing at a vintage microphone. Behind her are
three back-up male vocalists dressed in three tone, shiny
60's suits. We hear strings soar up and the blonde girl
begins to sing SIXTEEN REASONS by Connie Stevens. The male
vocalists backing her up flawlessly.

We move back and realize we are on a movie set inside a sound
stage. A screen test is being shot of the girl and as we
continue moving back we see the director Adam Kesher
surrounded by his crew. Behind them there are many people
standing, eating, watching, working. The stage is full and
bustling. The song plays loudly over. Sarah and Nicki bring
Betty into this scene through a giant stage door. A guard
mimes for them to be quiet as they approach the set. The
song continues to play over.

As Sarah leads Betty up close Adam turns and his eyes fall on
the beautiful face of Betty Elms. Sensing something Betty
turns and sees Adam. They each seem to feel the thrill of
the thunderbolt, but each embarrassed to stare longer than
they already have turn back and watch the girl finish the
song.

				ADAM
			(calling out through an
			electronic megaphone)
		Cut it!
    
He gets out of his chair and walks into the set - up to the
blonde girl. He shakes her hand.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		Thank you very much, Carol. It was really
		great of you to come in. I know how busy
		you are.
    
				CAROL
		Oh, man, are you kidding? I love this
		script! Where do I sign?

    
				ADAM
		Look... I love you, but there's no way
		they're gonna let me cast this thing
		until I've seen everyone. I'll let you
		know as soon as I can.
    
				CAROL
		I know you will ... cause my manager's
		gonna bug you day and night ... me too.
    
				ADAM
		It'll be my pleasure. Now, get out of
		here.
    
				CAROL
		Oh, you're just so cruel... don't forget
		me. I'm the girl that's going to play
		this part.
    
				ADAM
			(lightly pinching her cheek)
		See ya later.
    
Adam turns and goes back out of the set onto the stage floor.
He looks around. He sees Betty being introduced by Sarah to
some of the studio executives. He goes over to his Assistant
Director and looks down at the man's notepad.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		Who's next, Hank?
    
				HANK
		Camilla Rhodes.
    
Adam wonders - worries.
    
				ADAM
		Is she ready?
    
				HANK
		All ready.
    
				ADAM
		Bring her out.
    
Hank speaks into his walkie-talkie headset. The sound of his
voice can be heard in several locations throughout the stage.
    
				HANK
			(through walkie-talkie)
		Camilla Rhodes next!

    
Adam looks up - a beautiful blonde steps into the set in
front of the microphone. IT IS THE GIRL! The back-up
singers step in behind her.
    
Adam nods to Hank.
    
				HANK (cont'd)
		Turn over!
    
The cameraman calls out, "Speed".
    
				ADAM
			(through megaphone)
		Playback!
    
Countdown before the music begins.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		ACTION!
    
The strings soar up and Camilla Rhodes begins to sing.
    
On the set Betty hears the song again and turns and watches.
Once again her eyes find Adam as his eyes are finding hers.
This time Adam turns away. He watches Camilla for a moment.
She is passable, but not spectacular. Adam reaches out and
pulls Hank over to him.
    
				HANK
		Yeah?
    
Adam pauses.
    
				ADAM
		Get Jason over here.
    
Hank gets on his walkie-talkie.
    
				HANK
		Cindy ... Adam wants to see Jason.
    
Adam continues to watch Camilla Rhodes sing. JASON GOLDWYN,
a tall sixty year old silver-haired man, comes through the
crowd and stops at Adam's side. He looks down at Adam, but
Adam continues watching Camilla Rhodes. Jason follows Adam's
gaze and he watches Camilla sing then turns back to Adam.
Adam slowly looks up right into Jason's eyes - wondering how
much Jason knows, but Jason's face doesn't give away a thing.
    
				JASON
		Did you want to tell me something, Adam?

    
				ADAM
		This is the girl!
    
At that moment Ray, having overheard, comes to Jason's side.
He smiles at Adam.
    
				RAY
		Excellent choice, Adam.
    
Adam is sick with himself.
    
Across the room Betty panics when she looks at her watch.
    
				BETTY
		Oh ... oh...I have to be somewhere. I
		promised a friend.
    
She quickly shakes Sarah's and Nicki's hands saying, "I'm
sorry, I'm sorry" and runs off like Cinderella.
    
Adam turns and sees her running off out of his world.
    
Chris Isaak's song "Except The New Girl" segues in over
Connie Stevens and plays as Adam, Sarah and Nicki watch Betty
disappear out the sound stage door.
    
							CUT TO:

COURTYARD - 1612 HAVENHURST DAY
    
Chris Isaak song segues to the sounds of a blues saxophone.
    
Betty and Rita come out of Aunt Ruth's apartment. Betty is
laughing, pulling on Rita.
    
				BETTY
		C'mom. There's nothing to be afraid of.
    
Across the courtyard CORNELL DUMONT, a strikingly handsome
young black musician, is on his balcony playing the
saxophone. He stops playing when he sees the girls. He
stands and looks as if recognizing someone.

    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		Hey!

    
Betty and Rita stop and look up, shielding their eyes from
the sun.
    
				CORNELL DUMONT (cont'd)
		Hey, how's Sol?
    
				BETTY
		Sol?
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		No ... not you...
			(to Rita)
		I'm sorry... I forget your name.
    
				RITA
			(almost inaudible)
		Rita.
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		Yeah. Well, I haven't seen Sol lately.
		Tell him to come by the club.
    
Rita nods ... biting her lip. Cornell smiles and picks up his
sax.
    
				BETTY
		And what's your name?
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
			(big smile)
		Cornell Dumont.
    
He begins to blow some sweet jazz that flows smooth as syrup.
    
				BETTY
			(whispering)
		Ask him who Sol is ...
    
Rita hurriedly starts for the gate.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Maybe he could help...
    
Betty follows Rita through the gate to the waiting cab. They
get in and the cab pulls away.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. CAB - DAY
    
Betty reaches and gently grabs Rita's shoulder. She speaks
firmly but quietly so the cab driver won't hear.

    
				BETTY
		Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
    
				RITA
			(whispering back)
		But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of
		Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why
		we shouldn't go see about Diane
		Selwyn... it's better not to get in
		trouble.
    
				BETTY
		You're not going to get in trouble.
		You're going to find out who you are.
		Finding out who you are gets you out of
		trouble.
    
Rita thinks about this silently then begins to worry and
doubt all over again.
    
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
INT. CAB - LATER
    
Betty holds the slip of paper with the address in her hand.
She turns back and forth watching the buildings on both sides
of the street.
    
				BETTY
		It should be around here...
    
Rita watches out of the window pensively as the cab moves up
Sierra Bonita. They near a modern apartment compound of
bungalows and duplexes almost hidden in the trees and
vegetation. A smooth stucco wall surrounds the complex.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
			(points)
		That's it ... 2590.
			(nudging Rita)
		Does it look familiar?
    
Rita shakes her head..no. Rita is looking at a black car
parked down the street facing 2590. She discerns two men
sitting in the front.
    
				RITA
		Don't stop!
    
				BETTY
		What is it? What do you see?!
    
				RITA
			(quietly - frantic)
		Those men in front, in the car.
    
				BETTY
		Do you know them?!
    
				RITA
		No... but...
    
				BETTY
			(to driver)
		Keep going. Go around to the back.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. SIERRA BONITA APARTMENT - BACK ALLEY - DAY
    
Betty gets Rita out of the cab and pays the driver, who then
drives away. The girls go through a rear gate and enter the
complex walking along a curving concrete walk. This leads
them to an intersection where a registry is printed on a
rough hewn wooden plaque. They scan the list.
    
				BETTY
		Selwyn ... number 12.
    
They both look around the various doors near them. Betty
spots a sign which says, behind an arrow, bungalows #10
through #20.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		It's this way.
    
They set off down another sidewalk toward Bungalow #12. As
they near it and actually can see it just ahead they pass a
chainlink service gate to the alley. Standing in the alley is
a man in a dark suit wearing sunglasses.
    
Both girls dive for the bushes.
    
The man in the black suit turns reacting to the noise and
motion. Both girls are trying to catch their breath and stay
as still and quiet as possible.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
			(panting whisper)
		Now, you've got me scared.
    
Peering through the bushes they see the man still looking in
their direction. Suddenly he turns and smiles at something
to his left.
    

He hurries off, but soon returns carrying two heavy
suitcases, followed by an older woman in a yellow dress.
Both Betty and Rita crawl further forward. They see the limo
and realize that the man they were afraid of is an ordinary
limousine driver just going about his work. The girls stand
up, relieved and a little embarrassed.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		See, I told you there was nothing to be
		afraid of!
    
They go up to Bungalow #12 and stand for a moment facing the
front door.
    
				RITA
		Oh no ... don't.
    
Betty doesn't listen to Rita. She knocks strongly on the
door. They stand waiting. There's no answer so Betty knocks
again harder. They wait.
    
				RITA (cont'd)
		No one's ...
    
Suddenly the door opens. An attractive MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
stands before them.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		Yes?
    
				BETTY
		Diane?
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		Number 17.
    
				BETTY
		But it said #12.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		I switched apartments with her. She's in
		#17. Just walk down that way. It's just
		to the right.
    
The woman seems to be looking now at Rita.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
		It's kind of hidden by the foliage.
    
Betty and Rita start to leave.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
		She hasn't been around for a few days ...

    
				BETTY
		Well ... we'll leave her a note.

		Oh ... go ahead. I've got to get that.
    
The woman hurries back inside and closes the door. Betty and
Rita quickly move up the walkway toward Bungalow #17.
    
				BETTY
		I guess you're not Diane.
    
Rita, still fighting her fear doesn't answer.
    
They reach Bungalow #17. It's set back beneath tall bushes
and an old Eucalyptus tree. The front door is in deep shadow.
Without even looking at Rita Betty knocks quickly. There's no
answer. She knocks again.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Still not home I guess.
    
The girls drift off to the side of the bungalow. Betty tries
to see in the windows. She tries a window and to her surprise
it opens.
    
				RITA
		I don't think...
    
				BETTY
			(looking around for anyone
			watching)
		C'mon help me in. I'll open the front
		door.
    
				RITA
		No.
    
Betty jumps up and catches her knees on the siding, her head
through the open window.
    
				BETTY
		PUSH!!!

    
Rita reluctantly pushes and Betty is in. As she closes the
window ...
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Meet you at the door.
    
Rita walks around to the front door and gets there just as
Betty opens it. Betty has her hand over her mouth and nose.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		I don't know if you want to come in here
		or not. There's some kind of horrible
		smell like... something...
    
Rita is compelled to go in and as the door clicks shut she
reacts to the smell.

Betty begins to go through the bungalow and Rita follows.
All the blinds are closed and the curtains drawn. They move
slowly, looking around at everything as they go. Betty looks
to Rita to see if any of this is something she remembers.
Rita looks as though she's walking in a trance. Through the
half light they move deeper into the bungalow to a corridor.

Betty and Rita are moving down the corridor. They pass a
small room and look in at a couch, wardrobe and make-up
table. They move on down the corridor to a door which is
almost closed. Betty touches the door and it seems to swing
open on its own. They enter the room and stop cold. A scream
starts to build inside Rita. Before them is a dead woman
lying on a bed. Great chunks of mattress are standing upright
having been ripped and torn by shotgun blasts. A dried sea of
blood surrounds the bloated, gray body of the woman. The
scream comes out of Rita as a force propelling her to look
closer. Betty lunges after Rita, her eyes also not able to
leave the sight. She covers Rita's mouth with her hand and
brings her close. The scream is stifled by Betty's hand.
    
In the silence that follows, knocking can be heard. Betty
freezes and keeps Rita quiet with her hand still placed over
her mouth, but she can't stop Rita's violent shaking nor the
horror in her eyes.

The Middle-Aged Woman backs away from the front door, looking
around at bungalow #17. She's not sure if she has heard
something or not. She wonders, then turns and goes back to
her bungalow.
    
Just as she has disappeared the door to Bungalow #17 flies
open and Rita, followed closely behind by Betty, runs with a
look of horror directly toward us until her tortured face
fills the screen.

Sounds, music churning continues.
    
Great sobs, almost hysterical, wrack Rita's body as she bends
over the sink, scissoring into her long, dark hair with a
frenzy. There is a loud sound of the scissors cutting deep
through many strands of hair. Betty's is rushing to her -
her hands reach tenderly, but firmly for Rita's hand holding
the scissors. She keeps her from cutting and moves closer,
whispering in Rita's ear. Rita can't stop crying, but lets
Betty hold her. Music changes ...
    
				BETTY
		Rita... I know what you're doing.
    
				RITA
			(through uncontrollable sobs)
		What ... I..HAVE... to do.
    
				BETTY
		I know what you have to do, but let me do

Rita turns and looks up at Betty, her eyes red with crying.
Betty pulls her up facing her. Rita lets Betty take the
scissors. They look into each other's eyes. Betty gently
strokes Rita's cheek, wiping away some tears.

Panning slowly across we see on the bathroom counter various

moving up to an empty mirror and eerie music builds. The
reflection of the new Rita moves into the mirror. She has
short, beautiful blonde hair, blonde eyebrows and no make-up.
Betty's reflection comes in beside Rita's. They stare at the

Wilkins still in his pajamas, bathrobe and slippers from

Jack Russell Terrier wakes and stands at the sound of the
phone ringing on a side table next to Wilkins. Wilkins comes
out of a deep thought and picks up the receiver as he runs
his hand through strange, matted tufts of dirty blonde hair.

Betty is sitting on the bed opposite. Rita opens the hatbox
and removes her purse. She opens the purse and takes out the
money. She sits down on the bed and while staring at the
money she thinks of what to say.
    
				RITA
		You've been so good to me ... now we know

Darkness. Distant sounds of freeway traffic. Then the closer
sound of a car - its headlights illumine an oleander bush and
the limbs of an Eucalyptus tree. Then the headlights turn - a
street sign is suddenly brightly lit. The words on the sign
read... "Mulholland Drive." The car moves under the sign as
it turns and the words fall once again into darkness.

Two men in dark suits are sitting in the front seat. A
beautiful, younger, dark-haired woman sits in back. She sits
close up against the door and stares out into the darkness.
She seems to be thinking about something. Suddenly she turns
and looks ahead. The car is slowing and moving off to the
side of the road.
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN

Two cars - a convertible and a late model sedan are drag
racing toward the blind curve blocking the view of the
Cadillac limousine. The cars are filled with crazed
teenagers. Two girls are standing up through the sunroof of
the sedan screaming as their hair is whipped straight back.
    

    
The cars are travelling so fast that they seem to almost
float as they fly with psychotic speed down both lanes of
Mulholland Drive.

The driver, still in his seat, has a pistol with a silencer
attached pointing at the woman. The other man is getting out
of the car. The woman is clutching the seat and the door
handle as if trying to anchor herself. She is visibly afraid.
The man who got out of the car tries the woman's door, but it
is locked. He smiles as he reaches in through the front door
and unlocks her door. He opens her door. As he reaches for
her, the woman's face becomes flooded with light. Her eyes
dart to the front windshield. The driver, flooded with light,
turns just as the late model sedan slams into the Cadillac
limousine. There is an explosion of metal and glass amidst
thunderous tearing sounds as the two cars become one in
death. The convertible screams past with hardly a notice.
The driver of the limousine dies instantly as his body is
jettisoned through the windshield. The other man is torn as
the cars screech over him. The woman is brutally thrown into
the back of the front seats as a cloud of dust and flying
rocks engulfs her. The disastrous moving sculpture of the two
cars wants to climb up the hill, then stops and slides back
toward the road The Cadillac tips onto its side. Then all is
silent. A fire erupts in the sedan and as the dust clears we
see the woman appear, then crawl out of the Cadillac to the
road. Her face is vacant. There is a bleeding cut just above
her forehead. She stands for a moment clutching her purse -
lost , then begins to walk as if in a trance across
Mulholland down through the bushes and into darkness.

The woman slides down a hill through tangles of hostile
desert plants. Sirens can be heard in the distance. She
crosses through some trees and is suddenly confronted by a
coyote which snarls and leaps at her. She screams and strikes
out with her purse in self defense. The coyote backs away -
snarling. The woman then loses control and runs at the coyote
and it races off. She falls to the ground. We can hear the
thunder of her heartbeat as the sirens grow louder. She gets
up and stumbles through the trees. When she clears them she
is standing overlooking all of Los Angeles glowing down
below. She clumsily starts down toward it.

Police, paramedics surround the wreckage. Two detectives,

crime scene lights. A coroner's van pulls out just after an
ambulance. The ambulance's siren begins to wail as it speeds
off. The coroner's van cruises slowly. Detective Harry
McKnight and Detective Neal Domgaard continue staring. They
do not look at each other. They are each motionless for a

Detective Harry McKnight turns and crosses Mulholland. His
eyes move over each blade of grass at the shoulder - each
desert bush just beyond. He slowly raises his gaze to the
shining lights of Hollywood laying far below like a galaxy.
He looks out and wonders.

The clang of a metal gate wakes the woman. It is just getting

he sets down next to the car. The red-headed woman and the

back out with more luggage.

    
They leave the apartment door open. When the red-headed woman

down once they have it in the courtyard. She hears the steps
of the red-headed woman come back inside the apartment. She
hears the footsteps go all around the apartment and then she
hears the footsteps come toward the kitchen. Remaining
frozen, the dark-haired woman's eyes look up as the red-

Herb gets up, picks up the bill and goes to the cashier to

As Herb is paying the bill he looks over at Dan just as Dan
is turning to look at him. From Dan's point of view Herb is
standing in exactly the same spot as he stood in the dream.

They begin walking down the narrow sidewalk - past a

corner of the building. Red bricks glide by slowly.

Beads of sweat cover his face. He finds it difficult to
breathe. Herb is just behind him unable to see the fear
overtaking his friend, but Herb can feel something himself.
    
The red bricks moving by now are coming to an end - the
corner is coming closer - the corner is now very close.
    
Suddenly a man - a face ... a face dark and bum-like- moves
quickly out from behind the corner and stops - freezes -
staring into Dan's eyes.
    
Dan lurches back. All his breath is suddenly gone. He falls
back into Herb who tries to catch him as he's falling. Dan
hits the ground unable to breathe - his eyes wide with
horror.
    
Herb looks up - the man is gone. He looks down to Dan.

He kneels down and studies his friend. He feels for a pulse

speaks smoke comes out of her with every word.
    
				COCO
		I guess it was your grandfather, was
		it ... he called me to check in, said you
		were on your way and for you to call when
		you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
    
				BETTY
		Yes, he is. He raises corn.
    
				COCO
		Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood
		these days too.
    
				BETTY
		Well, I ...
    
				COCO
		You don't have to tell me. It's written
		all over that pretty face of yours.. You
		came here to be an actress. I just hope
		you'll remember there's never been a
		great poem called "tits and ass."
    
    
				BETTY
		I...
    
				COCO
		You probably don't remember her, but
		Louise Bonner lives right over there in
		number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs
		a damn good acting class.
    
				BETTY
		Have many famous actors and actresses
		lived here? I was meaning to ask you
		that.
    
				COCO
		Honey, all the great ones came through
		here at one time or another.
    
A haunting music begins to swell.
    
				COCO (cont'd)
    
		People say in the springtime when the
		wind blows the smell of the jasmine you
		can still feel the presence of everyone
		of them.
    
				BETTY
		I guess I've come to quite a place.
    
				COCO
		Sweetheart, you don't know the half of
		it.
    
The music fades.
    
Coco looks down suddenly. On the cobblestone courtyard in
front of her she sees a fresh product of waste from a dog.
She angrily turns up to an apartment on the second level.
    
				COCO (cont'd)
			(yelling up)
		WILKINS! ... (no answer) ... THAT DOG CRAPS
		ONCE MORE OUT HERE AND I'LL BAKE HIS
		BUTT FOR BREAKFAST!!
    
Coco turns back to Betty.
    
				COCO (cont'd)
		You don't have pets do you?

    
				BETTY
		No, I don't.
    
				COCO
		That's good. They're allowed, but I
		don't like 'em...for obvious reasons.
		One man used to live here that had a
		prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't
		believe what that kangaroo did to this
		courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's
		apartment ... it's a good one.
    
				BETTY
		I can hardly wait, Coco.

INT. APARTMENT - BEDROOM
    
The dirty and torn black cocktail dress of the dark-haired
woman along with her shoes, purse and undergarments are in a
pile in the bedroom. We drift off them toward the bathroom
where the dark-haired woman can be seen showering through
rippled glass. There's the sound of a door opening. We see a
movement through the glass and the shower goes off instantly.
We can hear the dark-haired woman's frightened breathing as
she waits frozen listening.

Betty enters, thrilled with what she sees. The apartment is
filled with movie memorabilia, deco furniture, oriental rugs,
brass floor lamps and a massive tiled fireplace. She sets her
bags down and stares.
    
				BETTY
		It's unbelievable!
    
				COCO
		I told ya.
    
				BETTY
		Wow!
    
				COCO
		Now I guess you and your Aunt have an
		understanding. So here's the key and you
		need anything, just give a holler.
			(Coco hands Betty the key)
		Everybody in this building's pretty much
		okay with me or they wouldn't be here.
		If you want, later I'll introduce you
		around. No hard feelings if you don't,
		and don't forget the rooftop garden.
		It's just up the stairs we passed. It's
		open to all the tenants. You can see the
		Hollywood sign from there.
    
				BETTY
		Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.

				COCO
		You got it! See you later honey.
    
Coco leaves and closes the door behind her. Betty begins to
explore the apartment.- After walking a circle in the living
room she passes through the kitchen. She moves down a
hallway looking at paintings and posters. She goes into the
bedroom. She smiles when she sees the bed which has a huge
ornately carved head and foot board. She notices the soiled
dress on the floor and she frowns as she looks closer. She
stands back up, shrugs and goes into the bathroom which has
all the original thirties fixtures damndest floor to ceiling
tiles. As she goes toward the sink she smiles to herself in
the mirror above it. Suddenly something catches her eye and
she opens the shower stall. There before her is the naked,
beautiful dark-haired woman.
    
				BETTY
		Oh my!
    
She quickly closes the shower door.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		I'm sorry. My Aunt ... Ruth didn't tell
		me someone was going to be here. I'm so
		sorry.
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		That's okay.
    
				BETTY
		I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm
		sure she told you I was coming.
    
There's a silence.
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		There was an accident. I came here.

				BETTY
		I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm
		sorry.   Are you all right?

    
There is another silence.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What happened?
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		A car ... a car accident.
    
				BETTY
		Are you okay?
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		I think so. I was just taking a shower.
    
				BETTY
		Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get
		back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
    
Betty goes to the bathroom door and is closing it when she
stops and looks back in.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What's your name?
    
We see a close-up of the dark-haired woman. We see her eyes
widen with a kind of fear. She's frantically thinking -
searching her mind for an answer.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		I'm sorry. I'll get out of here and we
		can talk later.

		My name is Rita.
    
				BETTY
		Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
    
				RITA
		No ..........I.

				BETTY
		I...I mean......I...it's none of my

				RITA
		She has pretty red hair... she is very
		kind I think.
    
				BETTY
		She sure is. She's letting me stay here
		while she's working on a movie that's
		being made in Canada, but I guess you
		know that.  I couldn't afford a place
		like this in a million years. Unless of
		course I'm discovered and become a movie
		star. Of course, I'd rather be known as
		a great actress than a movie star, but
		sometimes people end up being both and
		that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I
		came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so
		excited to be here..I mean I just came
		here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream

				RITA
		I think I've been hurt.
    
				BETTY
		Oh...
    
Betty goes to Rita.

Betty sits Rita on the bed. She leans down and looks at her
head and face.
    
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Where were you hurt?
    
Rita motions to her head above her forehead. Betty looks
through her hair and finds her wound which has stopped
bleeding but is surrounded by a very large blue black
bruising.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		We should get a doctor.
    
				RITA
		No.
    
				BETTY
		But, this could be serious.

				RITA
		No...I need to sleep.
    
				BETTY
		If you have a concussion you shouldn't
		sleep.
    
				RITA
		It will be okay if I sleep. I need to
		lie down and sleep.

				BETTY
		All right, but...I'm going to check on
		you.
    
Rita lies down and is instantly asleep. Betty leans over her
and listens to her breathing. She gets a blanket and drapes
it over the beautiful sleeping Rita, then leaves the room.

EXT. - DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - LOW RENT OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
    
The street level of the office building is filthy and houses
stores selling racks of cheap toys. Up above we see office
windows and a big sign saying "Office Space For Rent" along
with a telephone number to call. We drift in toward one of
the windows on the sixth floor.
    
							CUT TO:

INT. OFFICE ON SIXTH FLOOR
    
Two men are in the room, JOE and ED. Joe leans up against a
rack of filing cabinets. He is in his late twenties. He
looks like a run down, heavy metal rocker - wears a blue
denim shirt open, T-shirt underneath, black denim jeans and
motorcycle boots. His black belt has silver studs. He's
smoking a cigarette and is laughing at something the man at
the desk has said. His laugh is easy and his grin is
infectious.
    
The man at the desk, Ed, wears a clean, crisp black suit,
like a business man's but unlike a business man his blonde
hair is long enough to go over his shoulders.
    
				JOE
		So man, that's unheard of ... an accident
		like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
    
				ED
		Unreal ... so, you're looking good.
		Whatcha doin' these days?
    
				JOE
		Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff
		for this guy.
    
				ED
		Making ends meet, huh.
    
				JOE
		Hardly.
    
				ED
		Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
    
				JOE
		Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope
		you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
    
				ED
		It was just a thing. The story made you
		laugh.
    
				JOE
		Yeah, that's a funny story.
    
Looking like he's rubbing the small of his back Joe moves
over to Ed at his desk. Joe looks down to the surface of the
desk - to a small worn black book.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		So, there it is ... Ed's famous black book.

    
				ED
		Yeah, the history of the world in phone
		numbers.
    
Joe's hand still at the small of his back moves into view
holding a silenced pistol and in one swift move reaches out
and fires a hole through Ed's temple - blowing Ed's brains
out across the desk, carpet and wall. Ed's head bangs down
on the desk, then is still save the leaking of blood from the
wounds. Joe flips his finished cigarette out the open window
behind Ed's desk, wipes the gun clean with a handkerchief and
places the cleaned gun in Ed's right hand. He places Ed's
right forefinger gently onto the trigger. As he puts the
finger on the trigger he presses a little too hard and the
gun goes off. The bullet shoots out and penetrates the cheap
wall at the far end of Ed's office. Joe hears a muffled
scream.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
			(disgusted with himself)
		Oh...man!
    
With a sense of "just more stuff I got to do" Joe moves
slowly and begrudgingly out of Ed's office, checks the
corridor and goes toward the screaming which still persists.
He opens up the office door next to Ed's and finds a heavy
set woman screaming bloody murder as she is grabbing her
buttock and lower back. He sighs and walks over to her and
cups his hand tightly around her mouth to squelch the
screaming. Wide-eyed, she tries to fight him off and he
begins dragging her out of her office. Joe's foot catches on
a computer cable clumsily taped across the floor and he falls
backwards bringing the heavy woman down with a bone-crushing
blow on top of him. The woman begins beating his face with
her meaty fists. Joe snaps her head back, instantly stilling
her violent activity. He wrestles the stunned heavyweight
back to her feet and out her door. He pushes and pulls her
into Ed's office. Just before they enter, Joe notices a man
with a vacuum cleaner watching him from the far end of the
corridor. He stops and calls to the man.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		Hey man. She's hurt bad. Get down here
		and use the phone. Help me out. You
		gotta call the hospital.
    
The man hesitates...not sure if this jives with what he's
seeing.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		I mean it! Get down here quick! She's
		hurt and I can't do everything myself,
		man.

    
Joe pushes the woman inside Ed's office, throws a glance back
down the corridor and sees the man is on his way to him,
pushing his industrial vacuum and trailing a 200 ft. long
thick black cord as he goes. Joe goes in to Ed's office
with the woman. He throws her down on the floor in line
between Ed's desk and the bullet hole in the wall. She
starts screaming immediately and struggles to get up. Joe
grabs the pistol from Ed's dead hand and lifts it to fire,
but the woman has turned around and is almost standing.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		No, no, no. You gotta be turned around.
    
He goes to her, slaps her hard in the face and spins her
around. Before she can turn again Joe races back to place
himself in the proper line at Ed's desk and quickly fires two
silenced shots into the back of her head. The man with the
vacuum enters. His eyes begin to widen in reaction to the
scene. Just then Joe fires a bullet into the man's chest.
The man inadvertently flicks on the vacuum cleaner as his
hands rush up to the wound. As the vacuum cleaner whines Joe
rushes to the man before the man falls back out into the
corridor. He pulls him into the room - the man moaning and
clutching his chest, starting to collapse. Joe releases him
and the man goes down. The vacuum cleaner seems to be
screeching now in the threshold. Joe fires the last bullet
into the heavy duty vacuum cleaner. The bullet shorts out
the internal wiring of the vacuum. That in turn blows the
building's circuit breaker and all the lights go out.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
			(disgusted with himself)
		Oh ... man!
    
Now he hears voices - voices moving into the corridor.
    
				VOICES
		What the hell .... what happened? What's
		this cord doing here? It's the vacuum.
		It's the vacuum what did it.
    
Joe cleans the pistol once again and places it back in
Eddie's hand - Eddie's finger on the trigger. Joe picks up
the black book - turns and makes his escape by going out the
office window and quickly descending the rusty fire escape.

HOTT -president of production, wearing a crisp blue

green suit and ROBERT SMITH -talent manager, wearing a crisp
brown suit. Ray and Mr. Darby sit at the head of the table
and Robert Smith sits along the side. A younger man -ADAM
KESHER enters and sits down, with an arrogant nonchalance,
next to Robert Smith. Adam is dressed in a frumpy old
fashioned plaid shirt, worn jacket, dark blue cotton slacks,
and a pair of old brown wing tips. As he sits he is holding
and twirling a vintage "7-iron" golf club.
    
				ADAM
		So what's the problem?
    
				RAY
		There is no problem.
    
				ADAM
		So why did you idiots bring me

Silence for a moment. A man enters through a rear door and
whispers something to Mr. Darby and shows him something on a
piece of paper. Mr. Darby studies the piece of paper.
    
				MR. DARBY

		What was it last time?
    
The man who entered points to something on the paper.

Robert Smith shuffles nervously in his chair next to Adam.

		You see Adam... there are some suggestions

		know you said you would entertain
		suggestions and that's all anybody here

The men in dark suits go in as if they owned the place. Ray,
Mr. Darby and Robert Smith stand immediately. Adam remains
seated. Mr. Darby is the only one near enough to attempt a
hand shake, but when he offers his hand it is not taken. The
men in dark suits sit down without wasting a movement and
without acknowledging anyone. One of the men in a dark suit
opens a briefcase. Ray has been trying to make
introductions.
    
				RAY
		Ah... the Castigliane brothers. Let me
		introduce you around ... please ... sit down.
		(after they've already seated
		themselves) ... this is Mr. Darby whom you
		know and this is the director Adam
		Kesher and his manager Robert Smith
    
The Castigliane brothers do not acknowledge any of this,
however, during the introductions the one with the briefcase
removes a photo of a girl and sets it in front of Ray.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Ah... she's very pretty.
    
We see the photo of the girl - of a nice looking blonde -
someone we've never seen before. Adam looks like he doesn't
know what's going on and he's getting upset about not
knowing. His manager, Robert Smith, is beginning to see the
makings of a confrontation - he's starting to panic.
    
				MR. DARBY
			(referring to Castigliane
			brothers)
		May I offer you gentlemen anything?
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Espresso.

				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		Nothing. 
    
				ADAM
		Uh  what's the photo for?
    
				MR. DARBY
			(picking up phone and speaking)
		One espresso ... no, that's it.
			(sets phone down - addresses
			Castigliane brothers)
		I think you're going to enjoy your
		espresso this time... I've been doing
		quite a bit of research knowing how hard
		you are to please... this one comes highly

				ADAM
		What's the photo for?
    
				RAY
			(to Adam)
		A recommendation... a recommendation to

				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		Not a recommendation.
    
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		This is the girl.
    
				ADAM
		What girl? For what? What is this Ray?
    
Ray, still standing with a forced smile, turns to the
Castigliane brothers.
    
				RAY
		We'd be happy to put her in the pile for
		considerations ... you'd be pleased to know
		there's quite a lot of interest in this
		role.
    
				ADAM
		Interest?! There's six of the top
		actresses that want this thing.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		This is the girl.
    
				ADAM
		Ray...you better take care of this.
    
				ROBERT SMITH
		Hold on ... hold on, Adam.
    
				ADAM
		Hold on!!!!!!!! There's no way, there's
		no way!!!
    
Luigi Castigliane's espresso is brought in by the man who had
been in earlier. The man sets the espresso down in front of
Luigi and takes a step back. The room becomes silent -
watching the Espresso Man and Luigi. Without looking up Luigi
speaks softly.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Napkin.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN
			(leading forward to hear)
		Pardon?
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Napkin.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN
		Of course. Excuse me.
    
The Espresso Man leaves the room. Luigi looks at the
espresso. Vincenzo stares at Adam.
    
Adam is doing his best to stare down Vincenzo. The Espresso
man returns with a cloth napkin and lays it down next to the
espresso.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN (cont'd)
		Will that be all, Sir?
    
Luigi doesn't answer and after a moment of standing very
still waiting, the Espresso Man turns and leaves the room.
    
Adam is stared down by Vincenzo and averts his eyes to the
espresso cup. He looks around at Ray and Mr. Darby - seeing
them stare at the espresso cup.
    
Vincenzo keeps staring at Adam.
    
Luigi picks up the napkin and holds it in his left hand.
With his right hand he lifts the espresso cup and places it
above the napkin. He brings the cup and napkin to his mouth.
He takes a sip of espresso. A small fleeting expression forms
on Luigi's impassive face as if for one millisecond he is
going to vomit. His mouth opens and he allows the espresso
to fall and dribble onto the napkin. He pushes any remaining
espresso in his mouth out with his tongue. He holds it in
that position for a moment.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Is shit!
    
Luigi Castigliane stands up.
    
				RAY
		I'm sorry. That was a highly
		recommended...
    
				MR. DARBY
		That's considered one of the finest
		espressos in the world , Sir.
    
Luigi just stands there. A small thread on his left suit
jacket pocket catches his attention and he smooths it back
into the fabric. Vincenzo closes his briefcase, takes out a
hankerchief and cleans his nose - then stands, placing the
handkerchief back in his pocket.
    
				ADAM
		Wait a minute!! What's going on here?
    
Vincenzo just stares toward Adam as if he's not even there.
    
				ADAM
		There's no way that girl is in my movie!
    
Silence.

    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		That is the girl.
    
The Castigliane brothers begin to leave. Adam stands up
trembling with anger.
    
				ADAM
		Hey!!!!! That girl is not in my film!!!
    
				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		It is no longer your film.
    
Adam turns white and stands very still as this sinks in. The
Castigliane brothers leave. As the big blonde wood doors
close behind them Adam starts to boil.
    
				ADAM
			(screaming)
		You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
    
				RAY
		I'll speak to someone.
    
				ADAM
			(turning to his manager)
		And you'd better speak to someone
		too ... or find yourself another client!!
		This smells like a set-up to me!
			(back to Ray)
		And by the way, Ray, I don't know who
		these guys are kidding, but every foot of
		film I've shot is in a vault at the lab
		that only I can access. No one's getting
		that film!!
    
				ROBERT SMITH
		This is a catastrophe...
			(turning toward Ray)
		you told me they might insist on a girl,
		that's all.
    
				ADAM
		Why didn't you tell me, Robert? That's
		what I mean ... you set me up! I woulda
		never come here.
			(standing)
		I'm leaving. I'm a director you don't
		want to lose ... you guys better fix this!!
    
Adam storms out of the room.

Adam exits the building carrying his 7-iron. An attendant
takes his valet parking ticket. While Adam, still fuming,
waits for his car he notices the big limo standing off to one
side. He stares at the car and the huge limo driver leaning
up against the front driver's side door.
    
Adam's car arrives - a late model Porsche. Before Adam gets
into his car he addresses the attendant.
    
				ADAM
		Did the Castigliane brothers get out of

		O.K.
    
Adam raises his 7-iron and smashes out the limo's windshield.
He whacks two big dents in the hood, then smashes out a

Betty hangs up the phone, takes a big bite of her sandwich
and lays flat out on the couch, chewing and smiling up at the
ceiling. She suddenly remembers Rita and her promise to look
in on her. She gets off the couch and goes into the bedroom.

INT. - EXT. APARTMENT - DAY
    
Betty rinses her dishes in the kitchen sink and pours herself
a cup of coffee. She takes the coffee outside to the
courtyard - to a white metal table just outside her doorway.
She sits down and stretches in the warm afternoon sun.
Across the way she can hear a blues saxophonist practicing in
one of the apartments. She drinks her coffee and listens to
the music.
    
Some birds fly by overhead. She takes another sip of coffee.
The blues music which was mellow and slow is now building in
tempo and volume. The phone inside rings. Betty takes her
coffee back into the living room, shutting the door behind
her. She crosses to the leather couch and picks up the
phone.
    
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Hello ... Aunt Ruth!! I can't tell you how
		happy I am. Your place is so fantastic!
		Yes ... Coco...what a character. I really
		like her... that's too bad...waiting in an
		airport must not be too fun. What's a
		mosquito plane? ... Oh I get it. How long
		does that take from Montreal? ... Well,
		you'll sleep good tonight ... Hudson Bay
		sounds beautiful ...oh well, I hope you
		packed your coat. (laughs). You mean
		the audition...Wally Brown... she didn't
		mention it but he'll fax the dialogue to
		Coco? Suddenly I'm so nervous ... okay
		Aunt Ruth... I'll try. I'll study those
		lines until I know them inside out.
		Yes, either right here on this fabulous
		leather couch or I'll take them with a
		coffee in the courtyard like a regular
		movie star. (laughs). Oh! I got a real
		shock to find your friend Rita here. She
		was in the shower and I opened the
		door ... Rita ... what do you mean? She was
		in an accident ... your friend Rita. No,
		Coco unlocked the door. No, she didn't
		see her. She's sleeping. No... she's
		very nice. I'm sure there's some
		explanation, Aunt Ruth... I don't think we
		have to do that. Please don't worry.
		I'll take care of it. No, I'll let you
		know. Where can I ... okay I'll get it
		from Coco.
		No, please don't worry... thank you so
		much for letting me stay here. You've
		made me so happy... thank you, thank you.
		Please don't worry... Aunt Ruth we don't
		need the police. I'll call you when you
		get to Hudson Bay. Please...
		please ... Goodbye Aunt Ruth.
    
Betty slowly and quietly hangs up the phone. She sits for a
moment listening. Silently she stands and moves toward the
bedroom. As she approaches the bedroom door she stops at
something she sees. Rita is sitting on the edge of the bed
crying quietly. Betty goes into the bedroom. Rita looks up
at her with desperation.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		You're awake... I think I misunderstood
		you. I thought you knew my Aunt and
		that's why you were here. I just talked
		to my Aunt on the phone and she wants me
		to call the police.

    
Rita starts crying harder, bows down, covering her face with
her hands.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Rita?
    
				RITA
			(crying harder)
		I'm... sorry. I ...

Betty's heart softens.
    
				BETTY
		What is it Rita?
    
				RITA
			(still sobbing)
		I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke
		up... I thought sleep would do it ...
    
Betty kneels down in front of her.
    
				BETTY
		What's wrong?
    
				RITA
			(crying)
		I don't know who I am.
    
				BETTY
		What do you mean? You're Rita.
    
				RITA
			(crying)
		I'm not. I don't know what my name is.
		I don't know who I am!!
    
Betty looks down at the purse next to Rita's dress. She picks
it up and hands it to Rita.
    
				BETTY
		This is your purse. Your name must be in
		your purse.
    
Rita takes the purse with sudden trepidation. She hesitates.
Something is worrying her. She looks at Betty for help.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		You want to know don't you?
    
				RITA
		I ... yes, but ... I ...

    
				BETTY
		Open it!
    
Rita slowly unzips the purse. The pressure of its contents
force the mouth of the purse to widen as the zipper opens and
then there is suddenly revealed what will later be known to
be $125,000.00 cash in hundred dollar bills.
    
Both Rita and Betty almost stop breathing. They look at each
other, then back to the money.
    
Rita takes the massive wad of bills out of the purse and sets
it on the bed. She reaches back inside and comes up with the
only other remaining item in the purse ... A BLUE KEY. Betty
sees Rita's expression change to a kind of horror.
(note: This blue key is made of very fine heavy metal and
does not look like a door key.)

INTERIOR - OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
    
Ray crosses a carpeted closed area. He mounts a flight of
stairs. At the top of the stairs there's a plain blonde wood
door. Ray punches in a code on a security panel next to it.
The door opens automatically. Ray passes through and goes
down a narrow hall. At the end of the hall there is a small
elevator. Again Ray punches in a code. The elevator opens and
Ray goes in. The elevator door closes, but the elevator does
not move. Ray waits. Finally, a woman's voice comes through a
speaker.
    
				WOMAN'S VOICE
		Who is it please?
    
				RAY
		Raymond Harris ... 20743.
    
The elevator begins to move up. When it stops, the door opens
and Ray walks into a windowless reception area where a
beautiful Italian woman sits behind a large, blonde, modern,
built-in desk.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
			(very quietly)
		You may go right in, Ray.
    
Ray crosses to a blonde wood double door and waits. The
receptionist pushes a button behind her desk - chimes sound
as the double doors open to an enormous office with no
windows. Heavy rich brown curtains line the walls.
    
    
Ray enters and the doors close behind him. Ray takes a few
steps forward, then stops. There is a solid glass wall that
we now notice running the width of the office. Cut into the
glass wall is a small speaker microphone apparatus. Beyond
the glass off in the center of the room is a man sitting in a
very plain, blonde, wood, modern, yet not motorized,
wheelchair. The man is paralyzed except for his right hand
and head. His head appears small in relation to the size of
his body. His suit is immaculate and one of the finest we've
ever seen. His manservant stands in the shadows behind him.
    
				RAY
		Good afternoon Mr. Roque. (pronounced
		Rowk).
    
Mr. Roque stares at Ray silently.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Do you want him replaced?
    
Mr. Roque continues to stare.
    
				RAY
		I know they said...
    
				MR. ROQUE
		Then?
    
				RAY
		Then... I guess it's so .... alright, but
		that means we should ...
    
				MR. ROQUE
		Yes?
    
				RAY
		Shut everything down ... Is that something
		that...do you want us to shut everything
		down?
    
Silence. Ray doesn't know what to do. He struggles to
interpret Mr. Roque's silence. He waits. Mr. Roque does
nothing but stare.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Then we'll shut everything down.
    
Silence.
    
Ray turns. The doors open as he approaches them and he
leaves the room. The doors close.

		No, no, no, I told you. They're fine.

He can hear Lorraine calling his name. She seems to be
coming closer. He sets the jewelry case and the paint can on

jewelry box and empties the 3/4 full gallon can of Hot Pink
paint into her jewelry case.

Lorraine grabs hold of him. Starts pulling his hair,
slapping his face. She tears his jacket. Adam stands all at

slams her into the kitchen counter just as Gene the poolman
enters. Gene grabs ahold of Adam, cocks back and slams his
huge suntanned fist into Adam's face.

		That's not a way to treat your wife,

Coming toward them on the sidewalk are two people - a middle-
aged woman and a young boy around 10 years old. The boy is
very thin and something is wrong with him as he is walking
awkwardly on crutches. As the two groups pass each other on
the sidewalk Betty is struck deeply by the boy's brilliant,
luminous blue eyes which are at once innocent and filled with
wisdom.

    
After they pass each other Betty turns back and sees the boy
and the woman enter 1612 Havenhurst. Betty and Rita continue
up the street.

frightened.

PAYPHONE ON RED BRICK WALL - DAY
    
We see the red brick building. It is Denny's. Betty and
Rita are walking to the payphone. Betty digs out some change
from her purse. She picks up the receiver, drops in a
quarter and dials the "0" for Operator. An Operator answers.
    
				BETTY
		Hollywood Police Department please.
    
				OPERATOR
		Is this an emergency?
    
				BETTY
		No, no, I just want the number.
    
				OPERATOR
		Hold for the number.
    
Betty gets the number for the Hollywood Police Station, re-
deposits the quarter and dials.
    
				VOICE
		Hollywood Police Department
    
				BETTY
		I'm inquiring about an accident that
		happened last night on Mulholland Drive.
    
				VOICE
		Hold please. I'll connect you to

Betty holds.
    
				SERGEANT BAXTER
		Traffic. Sergeant Baxter speaking.

    
				BETTY
		Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a
		sound last night that sounded like a car
		crash and I want to know if there was an
		accident on Mulholland Drive.
    
				SERGEANT BAXTER
		Yes, there was.
    
				BETTY
		Can you tell me what happened?
    
				SERGEANT BAXTER
		No. I can't.
    
				BETTY
		Was anyone hurt?
    
				SERGEANT BAXTER
		May I have your name please?
    
Betty hangs up. She turns to Rita smiling like a girl who's
done something bad and gotten away with it.
    
				BETTY
		There was an accident. He wouldn't tell
		me anything else, but that was your
		accident Rita. I just know it was.
		Maybe there's something about it in the
		papers. Come on I'll buy you a cup of
		coffee and we can see.
    
Betty and Rita enter Denny's.

INT.- DENNY'S - DAY
    
Rita and Betty are seated next to the table where Dan and
Herb sat earlier in the day. They both have a cup of coffee
in front of them. Betty has a newspaper open and she is
scanning the last pages.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Maybe it happened so late it's not going
		to be in today's paper.
    
				RITA
		There's nothing?
    
				BETTY
		Not that I can see.

    
The same waitress - Diane, comes up to the girl's table and
freshens up their coffee. Betty looks up and smiles, sees
Diane's nameplate.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Thank you ... Diane.
    
Rita shoots a look from Betty to Diane to the nameplate.

Diane finishes pouring Rita's cup and smiles at Betty.
    
				DIANE
		You're welcome. Will that be all? You
		want your check?
    
				BETTY
		Just the coffee. Rita, you want
		something?
    
				RITA
			(still staring at the nameplate
			- thinking)
		No. Just the coffee.
    
				BETTY
		We'll take our check.
    
Diane searches through her many checks to find Betty and
Rita's.
    
The manager of Denny's, standing with a woman in a blue
dress, calls Diane's name. Diane turns and looks to the
manager and the woman. A fleeting fear goes through her
eyes. She surreptitiously reaches in her pocket and takes
out a Mont Blanc fountain pen which she puts under Betty's
check as she places it on their table. She does this very
quickly but Betty notices this and Diane notices Betty
noticing. Diane walks quickly over to the manager and the
woman in the blue dress. Betty turns and watches a heated
conversation that she can't hear, but she sees the woman in
the blue dress searching her purse and shrugging and then
leaving.

    
The manager says something to Diane and Diane turns her
pockets inside out and pats herself down in front of the
manager showing him her innocence. He waves her off and she
goes behind the counter to retrieve an order of food. Betty
stops watching and turns her attention to Rita, who is tense
and lost in a thought.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What is it Rita?
    
				RITA
			(without moving a muscle)
		Shhhh.
    
At that moment Diane the waitress reappears at their table.
Diane looks Betty in the eye and while looking at Betty her
left hand slides the Mont Blanc out from under the check and
back into her pocket.
    
				DIANE
		Thank you. Come in again.
    
Betty holds her gaze.
    
				BETTY
		You're welcome. We will.
    
Relieved Diane leaves and goes about her business. Betty
looks over at Rita waiting for her to tell her something.
Rita slowly turns and focuses on Betty.
    
				RITA
		I remember something... I remember
		something!

Betty and Rita are walking back to the apartment. We see
them from a distance. They are talking and gesturing in an
excited and animated way. Just after they enter through the
iron gates of 1612 Havenhurst and are out of sight we notice
a car moving slowly up Havenhurst toward us. We notice two
men in the front seat who seem to be looking around for
something.

AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
    
Betty and Rita are sitting next to each other on the leather
couch. Betty is rifling through the phone book. She finds
the listings for Selwyn. Her finger drifts down and finds D.
Selwyn followed by an address and phone number. It is the
only Selwyn with a D. first name. She hands the phone to
Rita.
    
				BETTY
		Strange to be calling yourself.
    
				RITA
		Maybe it's not me.
    
				BETTY
		Call the number.
    
Betty reads the number off and Rita pushes the corresponding
buttons. Each tone seems to be louder than the last. The
ringing seems deafening. There's a click and the phone is
answered - by a machine. A woman's voice is heard - loudly.
    
				WOMAN'S VOICE
			(coming from answering machine)
		Hi ... this is me. Leave me a message.
    
Betty now has her ear pressed up against the phone also -
straining to hear everything. The machine starts recording.
Betty hangs up the phone immediately.
    
				RITA
		It's not my voice ... but I know her.
    
				BETTY
		Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn.
		Maybe that's your roommate or if it is

TAKA'S POV - A man, KENNY, in a sharp black suit is walking
down the driveway past Gene the Poolman's truck to the front
door of Adam's house. Parked at the street is a big limo
with Vincenzo and Luigi Castigliane sitting in the back.
    
Kenny knocks on Adam's front door. Lorraine answers.
Lorraine's hands are covered with pink paint. Pink paint is
on her face and clothes.
    
				KENNY
		Adam Kesher...he...
    
				LORRAINE
		Yeah, right ... get lost!
    
She slams the door, but Kenny's foot stops it and pushes it
back with a force that shakes the wall as the door slams open
once again. Kenny enters the house.
    
				KENNY
		This is Adam Kesher's house. Where...
    
				LORRAINE
		Like hell it is! Get out ... NOW!!!
    
Gene comes out of the kitchen fast, his hands covered with
pink paint.
    
				GENE
		I guess you don't understand English.
		She asked to leave. Here's the door.
    
Gene grabs hold of Kenny and starts to push him out the door.
Kenny rabbit punches Gene in the nose with lightning speed -
his fist like a sledgehammer. Gene goes down. Lorraine
shrieks and leaps on Kenny. Her long fingernails going for
his eyes. Kenny slaps Lorraine hard. The shriek stops
instantly and she falls out cold on the carpet. Gene is back
up and going for Kenny. Kenny gets three punches in on Gene's
head before Gene hits the ground unconscious. Kenny rubs some
pink paint off his hands and tries to get a pink stain off
his jacket. He begins walking around the house calling out
for Adam. He sees nothing and hears nothing. He goes back to
the front door and sees Adam's golf clubs sitting there.
Kenny begins snapping the shaft of each club. As he snaps
each club we see Lorraine and Gene remain out cold on the
floor.

    
And in the kitchen we see that the tap is on and the sink
water is now overflowing from the sink and jewelry box -
spilling out onto the kitchen floor. Finishing his work with
the vintage golf clubs - Kenny leaves.

				CYNTHIA
		Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the

Adam, in his Porsche, makes his way up the canyon.
    
INT. PORSCHE
    
Adam feeling like a fool drives up the dark, winding canyon
road. As he nears the top of the canyon the residential area
gives way to desert brush. The road winds steeply up to a
dark dead end where an old barn and stable sit. Adam parks in
a little dirt lot and walk up past the barn to the corral.
His eyes grow accustomed to the dark and he.looks about. No
one is around. There's only a light wind and a few twinkling
stars in the sky above. Suddenly some bare bulbs hanging from
the corral gate flare up. Adam hears a noise in the
brightness and turns. There walking toward him into the light
is the Cowboy - dressed in clean blue denim jeans, well-oiled
unscuffed, beautifully engraved cowboy boots, a red
embroidered ivory buttoned cowboy shirt complete with string
tie. Atop the Cowboy's head is a 10 X white Stetson. The
Cowboy is smiling warmly as he approaches. He stops in front
of Adam and begins to speak with a true, slow Western drawl.
    
				COWBOY

		Howdy to you.

		Beautiful night.

		Yeah.
    
				COWBOY
		Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the
		way up to see me from that Beverly Hills
		Hotel.

				ADAM
		No problem. What's on your mind?
    
				COWBOY
		Well now, here's a man who wants to get
		right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it
		are ya?
    
				ADAM
		Whatever.
    
				COWBOY
		A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes
		some ways toward how a man's life will
		be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
    
				ADAM
		Sure.
    
				COWBOY
		Now... did you answer cause you thought
		that's what I wanted to hear or did you
		think about what I said and answer cause
		you truly believe that to be right?
    
				ADAM
		I agree with what you said...truly.
    
				COWBOY
		What did I say?
    
				ADAM
		That a man's attitude determines to a
		large extent how his life will be.
    
				COWBOY
		So since you agree I guess you could be a
		person who does not care about the good
		life.
    
				ADAM
		How's that?

    
				COWBOY
		Well, just stop for a little second and
		think about it. Will ya do that for me?
    
				ADAM
		Okay, I'm thinking.
    
				COWBOY
		No. You're too busy being a smart aleck
		to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think
		and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya
		do that for me?
    
				ADAM
		Look ... where's this going? What do you
		want me to do?
    
				COWBOY
		There's sometimes a buggy. How many
		drivers does a buggy have?
    
				ADAM
		One.
    
				COWBOY
		So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy
		and you fix your attitude and you can
		ride along with me.
    
				ADAM
		Okay.
    
				COWBOY
		Now I know a few things. I know you have
		had a rough day. You're probably thinkin'
		I don't know the half of it, but in
		actual fact I know every part of it. The
		business of gittin' thrown off your
		movie, the heartache of seeing your wife
		with another man... losin' access to that
		precious film vault...
    
Adam suddenly looks stunned, unsure.
    
				COWBOY (cont'd)
		... realizin' you don't have hardly a
		nickel to your name and then add on to
		that the sickenin' feeling some men are
		gonna catch you and hurt you bad for
		bustin' their vehicle. Some days are like
		that. They are rough, but what will
		tomorrow bring? Will it be better than
		today? The same ... or worse?
		A lot of that is up to us individually.
		Up to us and our attitude. When the
		Castigliane brothers said "This is no
		longer your film," they meant it, but
		they didn't mean you were not going to
		direct it. I want you to go back to work
		tomorrow. You were re-casting the lead
		actress anyway ... audition many girls for
		the part. When you see the girl that was
		shown to you earlier today, you will say
		" This is the girl." The rest of the
		cast can stay- that is up to you, but
		that lead girl is not up to you. Now,
		you will see me one more time if you do
		good. You will see me two more times if
		you do bad. Good night.
    
The Cowboy turns and walks until he is engulfed in darkness.
Through the darkness Adam hears the sound of a car door
opening and closing, then another opening and closing and
then the sound of the car driving away. Adam walks up in the
direction the Cowboy took, but he sees no sign of a car nor
any dust nor any road. He goes back down past the barn and
stables to his car. There standing by his Porsche is the
Cowboy.
    
				COWBOY (cont'd)
		You thinkin' this'll work out, cause I
		was thinkin' it just might.
    
				ADAM
		It will work out.
    
				COWBOY
		Good then, but, just in case, that bank's
		gonna stay closed a bit longer. You
		understand that?
    
				ADAM
		I understand.
    
				COWBOY
		You're an understandin' fella.
    
				ADAM
		So, this is the last time I see you then
		unless I do bad?
    
				COWBOY
		No, this one doesn't count. It's part of
		the original one. So then ... until we meet
		again.
    
				ADAM
		Okay.
    
Adam gets in his car and drives off leaving the Cowboy
smiling behind him.

Betty drops the kitchen knife and both girls start laughing.

		Such a lame scene.

Betty and Rita are sitting on the leather couch having some
coffee. The front door to the apartment is open and sunlight
is pouring in through the screen door. Betty looks at her
watch.
    
				BETTY
		Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to
		fix a sandwich. You want one?
    
				RITA
		I'm all right.

		You've got to eat something. You're just

Betty goes into the kitchen. Suddenly there's a knock on the

Rita looks up ... panicked.

		Hi! Who are you?

		Uh...Betty!?
    
Betty comes out from the kitchen and sees the situation.

		She wants to know who's staying in her

				BETTY
			(slowly, deliberately)
		It's just for a night or two, until she

Betty lifts her eyes to Coco's. Direct, clear.

looks at it, hands it back to Betty and points down the hall
to her left.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
		Number 43, on the left.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you.
    
Betty walks down the long corridor past several offices. The
door to office 43 is open when she arrives and she enters a
large sitting room with a receptionist at a desk off to one
side.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
		May I help you?

    
				BETTY
		My name is Betty Elms. I'm here to
		audition for... Mr. Brown
    
				RECEPTIONIST
		Good. Perfect timing. Have a seat and
		I'll get Mr. Brown.
    
The receptionist stands, walks to a door, knocks twice, then
enters.
    
She closes the door behind her and Betty is alone in the
sitting room. She sits on a couch and looks at the old
movie posters covering all four walls.
    
In a moment the same door opens again and an elderly,
distinguished looking gentleman WALLY BROWN comes out
smiling. Betty stands up immediately.
    
				WALLY
		Betty Elms?
    
				BETTY
		Yes.
    
				WALLY
		I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear
		friend of mine so it's particularly nice
		to meet you.
    
				BETTY
		Very pleased to meet you.

				WALLY
		Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
    
As they walk into Wally's office...
    
				WALLY (cont'd)
		I took the liberty of inviting an extra
		person to see your audition. She saw
		your resume picture and was very
		interested in meeting you.
    
Inside Wally's office several people rise out of chairs when
Wally enters with Betty.
    
				WALLY (cont'd)
		Betty Elms this is Jack Taft, my
		assistant, Jimmy Katz who we've already
		cast for the part of "Chuck". He'll be
		doing the scene with you.
		This is Julie Chadwick and Bob Brooker,
		the director, and our surprise guest is
		Sarah James. We couldn't afford her to
		cast our picture, but as casting agents
		go she's the best.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Why thank you, Wally. Hello Betty.
    
She and Betty shake hands.
    
				BETTY
		Pleased to meet you.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		This is Nicki, my assistant.
    
Nicki, a very stylish, thin girl with black cat-eyed glasses
nods coolly to Betty.
    
				WALLY
		And this is Martha, Martha Johnson, who
		you met out front.
    
Betty nervously smiles to the room.
    
				BETTY
		Hi.
    
				WALLY
		Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like
		a water or a coffee before we begin?
    
Betty's hands are beginning to sweat.
    
				BETTY
		No, no, I'm fine.
    
				WALLY
		Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty
		why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play
		the scene. Is there anything you'd like
		to say Bob... something to Betty before
		they begin?
    
Betty stops on her way across to Jimmy and looks to Bob the
director.
    
				BOB
		No ... it's not a contest, see, the two of
		them with themselves, so don't play it
		for real until it gets real.

    
Betty doesn't know what to say. She catches Sarah's
assistant, Nicki, rolling her eyes.
    
				BETTY
		Okay.
    
Betty continues walking toward Jimmy who opens his arms to
her as she approaches. He's old enough to be her father.
    
				JIMMY
		Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
    
				BETTY
		What?
    
				JIMMY
		I want to play this one close, Bob. Like
		it was with that girl, what's her name,
		with the black hair. That felt good.
		Whaddya think?
    
Betty looks from Jimmy to Bob.
    
				BOB
		That'd be good, Jimmy. Just don't rush
		that line again. I told you... the line
		where you say, "Before what?"
    
				JIMMY
		I was playin' off 'em. They say,
		"They'll arrest you"... and stuff like
		that.. "put you in jail"... they say it
		like that. They all say it the same way,
		so I react like that.
    
Jimmy turns to Betty.
    
				JIMMY (cont'd)
		Look ... what's your name?
    
				BETTY
		Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I
		don't rush it. We play it close, just
		like in the movies.
    
Jimmy reaches out and puts his arm around Betty and brings
her in against his pot belly.
    
				JIMMY (cont'd)
		Dad's best friend goes to work.

    
Jimmy smiles as he brings Betty a little closer. She is
trying to concentrate through the nervousness and Jimmy's
breath. There is a silence as Jimmy looks her in the eyes.
Everyone in the room is looking Betty in the eyes.
    
				WALLY
		Bob?
    
				BOB
		And ... ACTION!
    
Betty and Jimmy start the scene. It is very difficult for
Betty as Jimmy has her in an absurd clench now.
    
				BETTY
		You're still here?
    
				JIMMY
		I came back. I thought that's what you
		wanted.
    
Jimmy plays this with a big lecherous smile. He gives the
last part of the line across her cheek up to her ear.
    
				BETTY
		Nobody wants you here.
    
Betty uses the anger of this line to push herself away from
Jimmy. Jimmy reaches out and grabs her wrist.
    
				JIMMY
		Really?
    
Betty pulls her hand away and stands her ground.
    
				BETTY
		My parents are right upstairs! They
		think you've left.
    
Jimmy smiles broadly and moves again toward Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		So ... surprise!
    
Betty pushes him back.
    
				BETTY
		I can call them... I can call my dad.
    
				JIMMY
		But you won't.

    
He grabs Betty by the wrist again and pulls her in to him.
He puts his hand on her waist and it accidently slips and
keeps going down her hips. He jerks his hand back. Betty
looks down and sees Jimmy's hand hovering above her thigh.
Betty takes her hand and gently presses down on Jimmy's hand.
She slowly looks up with the most seductive smile. Jimmy
lets his hand rest more firmly on her thigh, and squeezes her
thigh as he sees her smile. With his other hand Jimmy gently
pulls her closer. Something has started coming over Betty
and she catches the drift of this scene in a different way.
She's surprising herself.
    
				BETTY
			(almost a hot whisper)
		You're playing a dangerous game here. if
		you're trying to blackmail me... it's not
		going to work.
    
Jimmy now surprises himself. He becomes almost tender and
genuinely worked up from the heat coming off Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		You know what I want...it's not that
		difficult.
    
Where the scene should turn to anger from Betty it can't now
and Betty plays it as she feels it. She stays in very close
to Jimmy - looking him right in the eyes.
    
				BETTY
			(whispering desperately -
			slowly)
		Get out... Get out before I call my dad.
		He trusts you... you're his best friend.
			(her arms go around him)
		This will be the end of everything.
    
Jimmy gets lost. He doesn't know where he is anymore. He
can only see Betty's eyes.
    
				JIMMY
		What about you? What will your dad think
		about you?
    
Betty still playing it in a dreamy whisper... lost in heat.
    
				BETTY
		Stop... just stop! That's what you said
		from the beginning. If I tell what
		happened... they'll arrest you and put
		you in jail, so get out of here before...
    
				JIMMY
			(caught by her transfixing,
			sultry eyes, and almost
			breathless ... he finds himself
			taking an extra long pause)
		Before what?
    
As scripted Betty pretends to pull the knife from behind her
back, but wraps the knife around behind Jimmy and pulls him
into a kiss.
    
				BETTY
			(as she kisses him - whispers)
		Before I kill you.
    
Jimmy panics and pushes Betty away with his hands on her
shoulders as if forcing himself to come out of a trance. He
finally is able to say his line.
    
				JIMMY
		Then they'd put you in jail.
    
As scripted Betty is supposed to cry now and it is very easy
for her to do this because she's ashamed at how the sex of
the scene took her over. Tears begin running down her
cheeks. She backs away.
    
				BETTY
		I hate you... I hate us both!
    
She pretends to drop the knife. The scene ends.
    
Everyone in the room has become mesmerized by Betty, but they
soon drift back to reality and begin applauding the
performance. Sarah turns to Nicki.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		I'm going to take her over there.
    
				NICKI
		Big time!
    
				WALLY
			(to everyone)
		Wow!
    
Betty wipes her eyes and turns smiling - still shocked at
herself.
    
				BETTY
		Well, there it was.

    
				JIMMY
		There it was it was! Baby, you got a
		way!
    
				WALLY
		Bob?
    
				BOB
		Very good. Really. I mean it was forced
		maybe but still humanistic. Yeah, very
		good, really.
    
				WALLY
		Well, thank you Betty, and I mean that.
		That was very impressive. You've done
		your Aunt proud and I'm going to tell her
		the first chance I get. We'll speak again
		soon I'm sure, and thank you so much for
		coming in.
    
				BETTY
		Well, thank you.
    
Betty doesn't quite know what to do. She moves to the center
of the room and just stands. Remnants of the scene still
staying with her.
    
Sarah stands and Nicki stands just after.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Thank you, Wally. I'm sure you all have a
		lot to talk about. We'll walk Betty out.
    
				WALLY
		Well, yes indeed. Our pleasure, Sarah,
		and don't you be a stranger. We'd love to
		see you around here again real soon.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Well come along, Betty.
    
Sarah takes Betty's hand and they go to the door. Betty turns
back once more and smiles.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you again, Mr. Brown. It was nice
		meeting all of you.
    
Everyone nods and waves and Betty is taken out by Sarah and
Nicki.

INT. - RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

We see what looks like a recording studio right out of the
1960's. We're looking through a plate of glass. A blonde
girl is standing at a vintage microphone. Behind her are
three back-up male vocalists dressed in three tone, shiny
60's suits. We hear strings soar up and the blonde girl
begins to sing SIXTEEN REASONS by Connie Stevens. The male
vocalists backing her up flawlessly.

We move back and realize we are on a movie set inside a sound
stage. A screen test is being shot of the girl and as we
continue moving back we see the director Adam Kesher
surrounded by his crew. Behind them there are many people
standing, eating, watching, working. The stage is full and
bustling. The song plays loudly over. Sarah and Nicki bring
Betty into this scene through a giant stage door. A guard
mimes for them to be quiet as they approach the set. The
song continues to play over.

As Sarah leads Betty up close Adam turns and his eyes fall on
the beautiful face of Betty Elms. Sensing something Betty
turns and sees Adam. They each seem to feel the thrill of
the thunderbolt, but each embarrassed to stare longer than
they already have turn back and watch the girl finish the
song.

				ADAM
			(calling out through an
			electronic megaphone)
		Cut it!
    
He gets out of his chair and walks into the set - up to the
blonde girl. He shakes her hand.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		Thank you very much, Carol. It was really
		great of you to come in. I know how busy
		you are.
    
				CAROL
		Oh, man, are you kidding? I love this
		script! Where do I sign?

    
				ADAM
		Look... I love you, but there's no way
		they're gonna let me cast this thing
		until I've seen everyone. I'll let you
		know as soon as I can.
    
				CAROL
		I know you will ... cause my manager's
		gonna bug you day and night ... me too.
    
				ADAM
		It'll be my pleasure. Now, get out of
		here.
    
				CAROL
		Oh, you're just so cruel... don't forget
		me. I'm the girl that's going to play
		this part.
    
				ADAM
			(lightly pinching her cheek)
		See ya later.
    
Adam turns and goes back out of the set onto the stage floor.
He looks around. He sees Betty being introduced by Sarah to
some of the studio executives. He goes over to his Assistant
Director and looks down at the man's notepad.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		Who's next, Hank?
    
				HANK
		Camilla Rhodes.
    
Adam wonders - worries.
    
				ADAM
		Is she ready?
    
				HANK
		All ready.
    
				ADAM
		Bring her out.
    
Hank speaks into his walkie-talkie headset. The sound of his
voice can be heard in several locations throughout the stage.
    
				HANK
			(through walkie-talkie)
		Camilla Rhodes next!

    
Adam looks up - a beautiful blonde steps into the set in
front of the microphone. IT IS THE GIRL! The back-up
singers step in behind her.
    
Adam nods to Hank.
    
				HANK (cont'd)
		Turn over!
    
The cameraman calls out, "Speed".
    
				ADAM
			(through megaphone)
		Playback!
    
Countdown before the music begins.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		ACTION!
    
The strings soar up and Camilla Rhodes begins to sing.
    
On the set Betty hears the song again and turns and watches.
Once again her eyes find Adam as his eyes are finding hers.
This time Adam turns away. He watches Camilla for a moment.
She is passable, but not spectacular. Adam reaches out and
pulls Hank over to him.
    
				HANK
		Yeah?
    
Adam pauses.
    
				ADAM
		Get Jason over here.
    
Hank gets on his walkie-talkie.
    
				HANK
		Cindy ... Adam wants to see Jason.
    
Adam continues to watch Camilla Rhodes sing. JASON GOLDWYN,
a tall sixty year old silver-haired man, comes through the
crowd and stops at Adam's side. He looks down at Adam, but
Adam continues watching Camilla Rhodes. Jason follows Adam's
gaze and he watches Camilla sing then turns back to Adam.
Adam slowly looks up right into Jason's eyes - wondering how
much Jason knows, but Jason's face doesn't give away a thing.
    
				JASON
		Did you want to tell me something, Adam?

    
				ADAM
		This is the girl!
    
At that moment Ray, having overheard, comes to Jason's side.
He smiles at Adam.
    
				RAY
		Excellent choice, Adam.
    
Adam is sick with himself.
    
Across the room Betty panics when she looks at her watch.
    
				BETTY
		Oh ... oh...I have to be somewhere. I
		promised a friend.
    
She quickly shakes Sarah's and Nicki's hands saying, "I'm
sorry, I'm sorry" and runs off like Cinderella.
    
Adam turns and sees her running off out of his world.
    
Chris Isaak's song "Except The New Girl" segues in over
Connie Stevens and plays as Adam, Sarah and Nicki watch Betty
disappear out the sound stage door.

Chris Isaak song segues to the sounds of a blues saxophone.
    
Betty and Rita come out of Aunt Ruth's apartment. Betty is
laughing, pulling on Rita.
    
				BETTY
		C'mom. There's nothing to be afraid of.
    
Across the courtyard CORNELL DUMONT, a strikingly handsome
young black musician, is on his balcony playing the
saxophone. He stops playing when he sees the girls. He
stands and looks as if recognizing someone.

    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		Hey!

    
Betty and Rita stop and look up, shielding their eyes from
the sun.
    
				CORNELL DUMONT (cont'd)
		Hey, how's Sol?
    
				BETTY
		Sol?
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		No ... not you...
			(to Rita)
		I'm sorry... I forget your name.
    
				RITA
			(almost inaudible)
		Rita.
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		Yeah. Well, I haven't seen Sol lately.
		Tell him to come by the club.
    
Rita nods ... biting her lip. Cornell smiles and picks up his
sax.
    
				BETTY
		And what's your name?
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
			(big smile)
		Cornell Dumont.
    
He begins to blow some sweet jazz that flows smooth as syrup.
    
				BETTY
			(whispering)
		Ask him who Sol is ...
    
Rita hurriedly starts for the gate.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Maybe he could help...
    
Betty follows Rita through the gate to the waiting cab. They
get in and the cab pulls away.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. CAB - DAY
    
Betty reaches and gently grabs Rita's shoulder. She speaks
firmly but quietly so the cab driver won't hear.

    
				BETTY
		Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
    
				RITA
			(whispering back)
		But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of
		Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why
		we shouldn't go see about Diane
		Selwyn... it's better not to get in
		trouble.
    
				BETTY
		You're not going to get in trouble.
		You're going to find out who you are.
		Finding out who you are gets you out of
		trouble.
    
Rita thinks about this silently then begins to worry and
doubt all over again.
    
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
INT. CAB - LATER
    
Betty holds the slip of paper with the address in her hand.
She turns back and forth watching the buildings on both sides
of the street.
    
				BETTY
		It should be around here...
    
Rita watches out of the window pensively as the cab moves up
Sierra Bonita. They near a modern apartment compound of
bungalows and duplexes almost hidden in the trees and
vegetation. A smooth stucco wall surrounds the complex.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
			(points)
		That's it ... 2590.
			(nudging Rita)
		Does it look familiar?
    
Rita shakes her head..no. Rita is looking at a black car
parked down the street facing 2590. She discerns two men
sitting in the front.
    
				RITA
		Don't stop!
    
				BETTY
		What is it? What do you see?!
    
				RITA
			(quietly - frantic)
		Those men in front, in the car.
    
				BETTY
		Do you know them?!
    
				RITA
		No... but...
    
				BETTY
			(to driver)
		Keep going. Go around to the back.

EXT. SIERRA BONITA APARTMENT - BACK ALLEY - DAY
    
Betty gets Rita out of the cab and pays the driver, who then
drives away. The girls go through a rear gate and enter the
complex walking along a curving concrete walk. This leads
them to an intersection where a registry is printed on a
rough hewn wooden plaque. They scan the list.
    
				BETTY
		Selwyn ... number 12.
    
They both look around the various doors near them. Betty
spots a sign which says, behind an arrow, bungalows #10
through #20.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		It's this way.
    
They set off down another sidewalk toward Bungalow #12. As
they near it and actually can see it just ahead they pass a
chainlink service gate to the alley. Standing in the alley is
a man in a dark suit wearing sunglasses.
    
Both girls dive for the bushes.
    
The man in the black suit turns reacting to the noise and
motion. Both girls are trying to catch their breath and stay
as still and quiet as possible.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
			(panting whisper)
		Now, you've got me scared.
    
Peering through the bushes they see the man still looking in
their direction. Suddenly he turns and smiles at something
to his left.
    

He hurries off, but soon returns carrying two heavy
suitcases, followed by an older woman in a yellow dress.
Both Betty and Rita crawl further forward. They see the limo
and realize that the man they were afraid of is an ordinary
limousine driver just going about his work. The girls stand
up, relieved and a little embarrassed.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		See, I told you there was nothing to be
		afraid of!
    
They go up to Bungalow #12 and stand for a moment facing the
front door.
    
				RITA
		Oh no ... don't.
    
Betty doesn't listen to Rita. She knocks strongly on the
door. They stand waiting. There's no answer so Betty knocks
again harder. They wait.
    
				RITA (cont'd)
		No one's ...
    
Suddenly the door opens. An attractive MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
stands before them.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		Yes?
    
				BETTY
		Diane?
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		Number 17.
    
				BETTY
		But it said #12.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		I switched apartments with her. She's in
		#17. Just walk down that way. It's just
		to the right.
    
The woman seems to be looking now at Rita.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
		It's kind of hidden by the foliage.
    
Betty and Rita start to leave.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
		She hasn't been around for a few days ...

    
				BETTY
		Well ... we'll leave her a note.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
			(starting toward them)
		I'll go with you. She's still got some of
		my stuff.
    
The phone rings from inside her bungalow.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
			(turning back)
		Oh ... go ahead. I've got to get that.
    
The woman hurries back inside and closes the door. Betty and
Rita quickly move up the walkway toward Bungalow #17.
    
				BETTY
		I guess you're not Diane.
    
Rita, still fighting her fear doesn't answer.
    
They reach Bungalow #17. It's set back beneath tall bushes
and an old Eucalyptus tree. The front door is in deep shadow.
Without even looking at Rita Betty knocks quickly. There's no
answer. She knocks again.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Still not home I guess.
    
The girls drift off to the side of the bungalow. Betty tries
to see in the windows. She tries a window and to her surprise
it opens.
    
				RITA
		I don't think...
    
				BETTY
			(looking around for anyone
			watching)
		C'mon help me in. I'll open the front
		door.
    
				RITA
		No.
    
Betty jumps up and catches her knees on the siding, her head
through the open window.
    
				BETTY
		PUSH!!!

    
Rita reluctantly pushes and Betty is in. As she closes the
window ...
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Meet you at the door.
    
Rita walks around to the front door and gets there just as
Betty opens it. Betty has her hand over her mouth and nose.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		I don't know if you want to come in here
		or not. There's some kind of horrible
		smell like... something...
    
Rita is compelled to go in and as the door clicks shut she
reacts to the smell.

Betty begins to go through the bungalow and Rita follows.
All the blinds are closed and the curtains drawn. They move
slowly, looking around at everything as they go. Betty looks
to Rita to see if any of this is something she remembers.
Rita looks as though she's walking in a trance. Through the
half light they move deeper into the bungalow to a corridor.

Betty and Rita are moving down the corridor. They pass a
small room and look in at a couch, wardrobe and make-up
table. They move on down the corridor to a door which is
almost closed. Betty touches the door and it seems to swing
open on its own. They enter the room and stop cold. A scream
starts to build inside Rita. Before them is a dead woman
lying on a bed. Great chunks of mattress are standing upright
having been ripped and torn by shotgun blasts. A dried sea of
blood surrounds the bloated, gray body of the woman. The
scream comes out of Rita as a force propelling her to look
closer. Betty lunges after Rita, her eyes also not able to
leave the sight. She covers Rita's mouth with her hand and
brings her close. The scream is stifled by Betty's hand.
    
In the silence that follows, knocking can be heard. Betty
freezes and keeps Rita quiet with her hand still placed over
her mouth, but she can't stop Rita's violent shaking nor the
horror in her eyes.

EXT. BUNGALOW #17 - DAY
    
The Middle-Aged Woman backs away from the front door, looking
around at bungalow #17. She's not sure if she has heard
something or not. She wonders, then turns and goes back to
her bungalow.
    
Just as she has disappeared the door to Bungalow #17 flies
open and Rita, followed closely behind by Betty, runs with a
look of horror directly toward us until her tortured face
fills the screen.
    
Sounds, churning music.

Sounds, music churning continues.
    
Great sobs, almost hysterical, wrack Rita's body as she bends
over the sink, scissoring into her long, dark hair with a
frenzy. There is a loud sound of the scissors cutting deep
through many strands of hair. Betty's is rushing to her -
her hands reach tenderly, but firmly for Rita's hand holding
the scissors. She keeps her from cutting and moves closer,
whispering in Rita's ear. Rita can't stop crying, but lets
Betty hold her. Music changes ...
    
				BETTY
		Rita... I know what you're doing.
    
				RITA
			(through uncontrollable sobs)
		What ... I..HAVE... to do.
    
				BETTY
		I know what you have to do, but let me do
		it.
    
Rita turns and looks up at Betty, her eyes red with crying.
Betty pulls her up facing her. Rita lets Betty take the
scissors. They look into each other's eyes. Betty gently
strokes Rita's cheek, wiping away some tears.

    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Let me do it.

Panning slowly across we see on the bathroom counter various
open bottles, used Q-tips, towels, combs, a brush, a bowl,
and lots of long strands of cut black hair. We continue
moving up to an empty mirror and eerie music builds. The
reflection of the new Rita moves into the mirror. She has
short, beautiful blonde hair, blonde eyebrows and no make-up.
Betty's reflection comes in beside Rita's. They stare at the
new Rita in the mirror.

We move off the door of Aunt Ruth's apartment and crane
slowly up to the apartment above hers - WILKINS - the one

Wilkins still in his pajamas, bathrobe and slippers from
morning slouches in an enormous stuffed chair and matching
ottoman, surrounded by piles of papers and coffee cups. His
Jack Russell Terrier wakes and stands at the sound of the
phone ringing on a side table next to Wilkins. Wilkins comes
out of a deep thought and picks up the receiver as he runs
his hand through strange, matted tufts of dirty blonde hair.
    
				WILKINS
		Hello. Adam. How's it going? No, it's
		okay. Yeah, I'm working, but... they
		wanted this script a week ago. What?
		What's wrong with your house? The
		poolman? Sure, you can have the couch.
		No, it's no problem..it's just I
		gotta ... I gotta work. Any chance you
		could bring some food. No, I got plenty

Rita has just taken the hatbox from the closet shelf and is
setting it on the bed.
    
				BETTY
		What are you doing?
    
Betty is sitting on the bed opposite. Rita opens the hatbox
and removes her purse. She opens the purse and takes out the
money. She sits down on the bed and while staring at the
money she thinks of what to say.
    
				RITA
		You've been so good to me ... now we know
		why ... why I was so afraid. We know what
		kind of trouble I'm in. I shouldn't...
		ask you... I only have this to offer.
		I'll give you this if I can stay here for
		awhile. I don't know what else to do.
    
Betty moves across the bed to the side of Rita. She puts her
arm around Rita and holds her.
    
				BETTY
		Rita... I want you to stay here and you
		don't have to give me that money.
    
				RITA
		But I want to.
    
				BETTY
		No. We shouldn't touch that money. We
		don't know about that money. That might

We drift along the red bricks past the payphone, along the

trash cans is the dark silhouette of a figure. We move closer
to the figure. It is the bum and the bum sits. We move
closer and the bum's face fills the screen. It's face is
black with fungus. It's eyes turn and they seem to be red.

               The UNIVERSAL PICTURES globe spins. Then comes to a stop on 
               the African continent. A golden papyrus MAP of ANCIENT EGYPT 
               rises up. WE PUSH IN on it, towards a CITY along the Nile, 
               it's name written in hierarchic. WE KEEP PUSHING IN until 
               the golden map turns to golden sand and we find ourselves 
               DESCENDING on this ancient Egyptian city. Only it's not 
               ancient.

               SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS.

                                    THEBES - 2,134 B.C

               Accompanied by a NARRATOR with a very thick Egyptian accent:

                                     NARRATOR
                         Thebes. City of the Living. Crown 
                         jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.

               The CAMERA sets-down in an open plaza. An Arabian horse-drawn 
               CHARIOT comes barreling right at us, driven by PHARAOH SETI; 
               an aristocratic, virile old man. The chariot WIPES FRAME.

               INT. ANCK-SU-NAMUN'S BALCONY WINDOW - PALACE - DUSK

               Glaring out over the city at the setting sun is a handsome, 
               muscular MAN with intense, evil eyes. This is IMHOTEP.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Home of Imhotep, High Priest of 
                         Osiris, Keeper of the Dead.

               A gorgeous, olive-skinned goddess enters the outer foyer. It 
               takes us a moment to realize that the skin-tight dress she's 
               wearing isn't a dress at all, but rather her entire naked 
               body has been PAINTED in the ancient Egyptian manner She's a 
               stunning sight to behold. This is ANCK-SU-NAMUN.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Birthplace of Anck-su-namun. Pharaoh's 
                         Mistress. No other man was allowed 
                         to touch her.

               She makes her way through the ornate statuary. The CAMERA 
               comes to a stop on a CRACKED STONE FACE. A BEAT. And then 
               it's eyes suddenly POP OPEN. It's really a strange looking 
               TATTOOED MAN. Several more of these hideous, bald MEN stand 
               nearby. They are the PRIESTS of Osiris. Imhotep's guys. Their 
               eyes watch Anck-su-namun vanish through the bedroom curtains.

               Anck-su-namun embraces Imhotep, they kiss passionately, 
               feverishly. Imhotep's hands roam over her perfect body, 
               smearing the paint. The Narrator's VOICE fills with lust:

                                     NARRATOR
                         But for our love, we were willing to 
                         risk life itself.

               And we realize that the Narrator is actually Imhotep himself 
               on the other-side of the curtains, the bald Priests rush 
               over and close the doors. But just as they do, the doors 
               suddenly BURST OPEN. Pharaoh angrily strides in, looks at 
               the Priests. The following DIALOGUE is in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, -- 
               SUBTITLED.

                                     PHARAOH
                         What are you doing here?

               The Priests back away, scared shitless, obviously his arrival 
               was unexpected. Pharaoh strides for the curtains. Throws 
               them back.

               Anck-su-namun stands alone. Gives him a sexy smile. Pharaoh 
               sees the smeared body paint. Points his finger.

                                     PHARAOH
                         WHO HAS TOUCHED YOU?!

               From behind him, his sword is ripped out of its scabbard. 
               Pharaoh spins around. It's Imhotep. Pharaoh is shocked.

                                     PHARAOH
                         Imhotep?... My priest.

               Behind him, Anck-su-namun lifts a dagger and plunges it into 
               his back.

               Pharaoh SCREAMS. Imhotep raises Pharaoh's sword. The hideous 
               bald Priests SLAM the doors and bolt them tight. Through the 
               curtains, they see the SHADOWS of Anck-su-namun and Imhotep 
               stab away at Pharaoh. Suddenly, the doors are RAMMED from 
               the other side, --WHAM! Imhotep and Anck-su-namun turn and 
               look. --WHAM! The doors are RAMMED again. The two lovers 
               share desperate looks. --WHAM! The bald Priests run up and 
               grab Imhotep and try and pull him towards the balcony.

                                     PRIESTS
                         Pharaoh's bodyguards!

               Imhotep tries to break free, but Anck-su-namun rips Pharaoh's 
               sword out of his hand and pushes him towards the balcony.

                                     ANCK-SU-NAMUN
                         You must go. Save yourself. Only you 
                         can resurrect me.

               Imhotep's face fills with despair. The DOORS EXPLODE OPEN.

               MEN with BLUE-TINTED SKIN and strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS over 
               their bodies stride in, armed to the teeth. These are the 
               MUMIA. The Priests hustle Imhotep out onto the dark balcony 
               just as the Mumia rip through the curtains.

               Anck-su-namun points at Pharaoh and hisses --

                                     ANCK-SU-NAMUN
                         My body is no longer his temple!

               She PLUNGES the sword into her own heart. Out on the balcony, 
               Imhotep's mouth opens into a horrible silent scream...

                                     NARRATOR/IMHOTEP
                         For murdering Pharaoh, Anck-su-namun's 
                         body was to be cursed. And it was I, 
                         the High Priest, whose duty it was 
                         to curse it.

               EXT. SAND DUNES - NIGHT

               Imhotep leads-a TORCH-LIT procession across the dunes. Anck-
               su-namun's mummy is carried by NUBIAN SLAVES. They put her 
               down in the sand along with FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED JARS.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Her body was mummified, her vital 
                         organs removed and placed in sacred 
                         canopic jars.

               Imhotep, filled with dread, reads from a OBOOKO made out of 
               pure GOLD. THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE LIVING.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         The Book of The Living contained 
                         sacred incantations that would send 
                         the evil dead on a journey into the 
                         dark underworld.

               Strange LIGHT suddenly FLASHES across the faces of the slaves 
               and the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS. Suddenly, everyone's fear-filled 
               eyes all rise, as if watching Anck-su-namun's body rising.

               Then one last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, 
               and it's over. Anck-su-namun's body now lies twisted on the 
               ground.

               Imhotep's Priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus.

               The Nubian slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand. 
               Imhotep then signals to the Soldiers, who throw their spears 
               at the Nubians. Killing them.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         The slaves were killed...

               Imhotep's knife-wielding Priests attack the now unarmed 
               Soldiers, hacking at them in the flickering darkness as 
               Imhotep and the Mumia solemnly watches.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         ...and the soldiers who killed them 
                         were also slain, so that no unholy 
                         person should ever know the exact 
                         location of the burial site.

               The Mumia walk off across the sand and then, one by one, the 
               Priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the 
               vanishing Mumia. As the last Mumia disappears over a distant 
               dune, Imhotep nods, and the Priests leap onto Anck-su-namun's 
               grave and begin digging it back up with their hands.

               EXT. SAHARA DESERT - NIGHT

               CHARIOTS race out into the moonlit desert. Imhotep leads the 
               way. A "hearse" carries Anck-su-namun's mummy. THE MAP OF 
               ANCIENT EGYPT FADES UP. The chariots race across the map.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         But there was another book, The Book 
                         Of The Dead, which was never to be 
                         opened, never to be read, for it 
                         contained the incantations that could 
                         bring a dead body back to life a 
                         most unholy thing.

               The chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic. 
               They race up the stone ramp and in through the city gates.

               SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS:

                              HAMUNAPTRA - City of the Dead

                                     IMHOTEP
                         It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of 
                         the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis, 
                         so that no such sacrilege might ever 
                         disgrace Egypt.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - ANUBIS SITE - NIGHT

               Imhotep pulls an ORNATE CHEST out of a SECRET COMPARTMENT 
               inside the giant STATUE OF ANUBIS. He opens the chest and 
               lifts out THE BOOK OF THE DEAD, made of black stone.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         But for my love of Anck-su-namun I 
                         was willing to defy the gods.

               INT. UNDERGROUND NECROPOLIS - NIGHT

               Big hairy RATS scurry through the mausoleums and over the 
               headstones of this very large, scary, UNDERGROUND CEMETERY.

               A DETRITUS MOAT surrounds the cemetery, -- muck made out of 
               filthy water and human remains. Skulls bob in the goop. The 
               Priests have gathered in a circle. Their hooded, lifeless 
               eyes seem dead to this world. Their bald heads rock back and 
               forth as they CHANT, a quiet eerie HUM. Heinous creatures.

               In the middle of the circle is a strange, twisted ALTAR.

               Imhotep has unwrapped Anck-su-namun's gorgeous, lifeless 
               body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Anck-su-namun's vital organs were 
                         still fresh, so a human sacrifice 
                         would not need be made.

               As Imhotep begins to read from The Book of The Dead, a large 
               SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog. Several 
               Priests look over at it, frightened, then quickly look back 
               down and resume CHANTING. A strange MIST wafts up out of the 
               swirling hole and over to the jars, it passes through them 
               and into Anck-su-namun's body. One of the jars SHUDDERS, the 
               heart inside begins to BEAT. The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING 
               HOLE, WAFTING MIST, BEATING HEART and IMHOTEP'S READINGS are 
               reaching a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's EYES suddenly FLY OPEN.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Anck-su-namun soul had come back 
                         from the dead! Now all that was 
                         needed, was to return her organs to 
                         their rightful place within her body.

               Imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above Anck-su-namun's 
               breast, about to plunge it down. The CHANTING, SWIRLING and 
               BEATING heart CLIMAX. And that's when the Mumia BURST IN and 
               storm through the startled Priests. The HEAD MUMIA SMASHES 
               the jar with the beating heart. The MIST instantly sucks 
               back out of Anck-su-namun's body and IMPLODES back into the 
               swirling hole.

               Anck-su-namun's eyes close. Dying once again. Imhotep SCREAMS 
               in rage. The Mumia grab him and his Priests.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         My Priests were condemned to be 
                         mummified alive.

               INT. EMBALMING CHAMBER (NECROPOLIS RE-VAMP) - NIGHT

               Inside a TORCH-LIT CHAMBER, Imhotep is held by Anubis-headed 
               EMBALMERS. He cringes at the flickering, impressionistic 
               glimpses of his Priests being embalmed and mummified alive.

               The horrid-looking Embalmers, using knives, needles and 
               thread, calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the SCREAMING 
               Priests, who are going insane from the procedure.

               A red hot POKER is pulled out of a pit of burning coals.

               A Priest's head is wedged between two strong boards. His 
               eyes widen in terror as an Embalmer moves to insert the red 
               hot poker up his nose.

               But just before he does, WE QUICKLY CUT TO IMHOTEP'S FACE, 
               horrified, as OFF CAMERA, the Priest SCREAMS.

               WE GO WIDE on the chamber. All twenty-one of Imhotep's Priests 
               squirm inside their wrappings. Imhotep is forced to his knees.

               His arms are held back. His mouth is pried open.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         As for me, I was condemned to endure 
                         the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient 
                         curses. One so horrible, it had never 
                         before been bestowed.

               Using a pair of tongs, an Embalmer slowly pulls Imhotep's 
               TONGUE out of his mouth, then places a very sharp knife on 
               top of it. WE GO TIGHT on IMHOTEP'S EYES as his tongue is 
               apparently cut out. The Embalmer flings Imhotep's tongue 
               onto the floor. The Mumia's dogs attack and quickly eat it.

               Imhotep is WRAPPED ALIVE. Only his mouth, nostrils and 
               fearfilled eyes are left free of the slimy bandages. Detritus 
               muck boils inside a black cauldron. Embalmers scoop out the 
               fetid muck and apply it to Imhotep's wrappings as he squirms.

               He's then laid in a wooden COFFIN inside a stone SARCOPHAGUS.

               An Embalmer with a BUCKET steps up and looks into the coffin.

               Imhotep's wild eyes stare back. The Embalmer empties the 
               bucket over Imhotep's chest: dozens of SCARABS, disgusting 
               dung beetles. They scurry across Imhotep's SCREAMING face.

               Some vanish into his tongue-less mouth and up his nostrils.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         By eating the sacred scarabs, I would 
                         be cursed to stay alive forever. And 
                         by eating me, they were cursed just 
                         the same.

               The lid to the coffin is SLAMMED SHUT. Then, using a strange 
               four-sided KEY, the Head Mumia locks the coffin lid tight.

               The heavy sarcophagus lid is shoved into place and with a 
               loud WHOOSH seals itself airtight. Once again, the Head Mumia 
               uses the strange key, locking the sarcophagus lid tight.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         I was to remain sealed inside my 
                         sarcophagus, the undead for all of 
                         eternity.

               The blue-skinned, strangely tattooed man carefully collapses 
               the sides of the key, -- turning it into a little puzzle 
               BOX.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         They would never allow me to be 
                         released. For I would arise a walking 
                         disease, a plague upon mankind, an 
                         unholy flesh-eater, with the strength 
                         of ages, power over the sands, and 
                         the glory of invincibility.

               Imhotep's sarcophagus is dropped into a DETRITUS PIT. The 
               disgusting muck SPLASHES up, drools down it-s sides, and 
               then is mysteriously sucked into It's seams, vanishing clean.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         And if I could raise my beloved Anck-
                         su-namun from her place in hell, 
                         together, we would be an unstoppable 
                         infection upon this world. The 
                         Apocalypse. The End.

               Imhotep's horrifying tongue-less SCREAMS can be heard coming 
               from inside his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt 
               onto it. THE MAIN TITLE IS SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREAM:

                                        THE MUMMY

               The heavily armed Mumia stand guard around Imhotep's grave.

               Looking down on the burial site is the huge statue of ANUBIS, 
               the jackal-headed god of death. It stares at us. Then begins 
               to DECAY before our very eyes, aging 4,159 years in only 
               seconds. And then we find ourselves and the decrepit, half-
               buried statue of Anubis out in the middle of the desert.

               EXT. SAHARA - HAMANAPTRA RUINS (1925) - DAY

               Imhotep's horrifying SCREAMS become the SCREAMS of a TUAREG 
               HORSEMAN.

               Racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior 
               brethren. Armed to the teeth. SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN 
               are the WORDS:

                                    THE SAHARA - 1925

               A mile across the scorching desert TWO HUNDRED FRENCH FOREIGN 
               LEGIONNAIRES scurry through the ruins, preparing for the 
               onslaught. OUR HERO is up on the wall. His Kepi sits at a 
               jaunty angle. Dashing and handsome. This is RICK O'CONNELL.

               He looks out at the massive SCREAMING horde galloping at 
               him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I knew this was gonna be a lousy 
                         day.

               A doughy little Frenchman joins him as he makes his way across 
               the top of the wall. This is BENI.

                                     BENI
                         Personally, I would like to surrender. 
                         Why can we not just surrender?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.

               Beni pulls off his cartridge belt. Hands it to O'Connell.

                                     BENI
                         Then let's run away. Right now. While 
                         we can still make it.

               O'Connell throws it on, crisscrossing his own bandolier.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Now gimme your revolver, you'll never 
                         use it anyway.

               Beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to O'Connell.

                                     BENI
                         Then let's play dead, huh? Nobody 
                         ever does that anymore.

               O'Connell slides it into his belt, next to his own revolver

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Now go find me a big stick.

                                     BENI
                         In the desert? What for?

               O'Connell turns and goes nose-to-nose with him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So I can tie it to your back, you 
                         appear to be without a spine.

               The horde of warriors THUNDERS forward. Now a half mile out. 
               Scimitars RATTLING. O'Connell and Beni run through the ruins.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         How'd a guy like you end up in the 
                         Legion anyways?

                                     BENI
                         I got caught robbing a synagogue. 
                         Lots of good stuff in them holy 
                         places; churches, temples, mosques, 
                         and who's guarding them?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Altar boys?

                                     BENI
                         Exactly! I speak seven languages, 
                         including Hebrew, so my specialty 
                         was synagogues. How about you? Kill 
                         somebody?

               Beni trips and accidentally tackles O'Connell to the ground.

               O'Connell gives him a nasty look.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No, but I'm considering it.

               They get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp

                                     BENI
                         What then? Robbery? Extortion? 
                         Kidnapping!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         None of the above, thank you.

                                     BENI
                         Then what the hell are you doing 
                         here!?

               They both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the 
               horde of warriors. The SOUND of CHARGING HORSES is deafening.

               O'Connell gives Beni a big cheesy smile.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I was just looking for a good time.

               And that's when the cowardly Legionnaire Colonel suddenly 
               panics, cuts and runs. O'Connell instantly stiffens.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh shit. Steady!

               Gives the men around him courage. But onward comes the horde 
               Hoofs pounding the sand. Several more Legionnaires take off.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         STEADY!
                              (to himself)
                         What the hell am I sayin'?

               The Tuaregs let loose with those horrifying oooo-loo-loog 
               SCREAMS. More Legionnaires haul-ass. Beni is one of them.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         STEADY!!
                              (to himself)
                         What the hell am I doin'?

               The Tuaregs set their rifles and take aim. O'Connell steels 
               himself, cocks and locks. The cartridge in his mouth suddenly 
               snaps, he spits it into the sand. Another BEAT. And then --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FIRE!

               The Legionnaires on the ground FIRE. The rifles report with 
               a CRASH. The BLAST blows dozens of Tuaregs clean off their 
               mounts. The prone Legionnaires quickly begin to reload.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FIRE!

               The kneeling Legionnaires FIRE. More Tuaregs bite the sand.

               The remaining warriors OPEN FIRE. THUNDER and SMOKE rip the 
               hot air. A third of the Legionnaires are killed instantly.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FIRE!

               The remaining standing Legionnaires FIRE. Tuaregs spin off 
               their mounts. Crash to the sand. And then the entire Tuareg 
               force plows into the ruins and through the Legionnaires.

               O'Connell grabs the barrel of his rifle and starts CLUBBING 
               riders off their steeds, fighting like a man possessed.

               Beni on the other hand, is bellycrawling across the sand, 
               whimpering in full retreat as Legionnaires fall dead all 
               around him. He crawls through the front gate.

               O'Connell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns. He 
               cross-draws, gun in each hand, starts blowing riders off 
               their mounts.

               Beni crawls faster, and then he spots an open TEMPLE DOORWAY 
               amongst the rocks. He gets up and sprints for the door as 
               the last of the Legionnaires are shot off their feet behind 
               him. O'Connell's guns go empty.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Son-of-a-bitch.

               He turns and runs like hell, right through the front gate.

               Four Tuareg warriors on massive Arabians haul-ass after him.

               O'Connell hurdles a stone column, hits the ground running.

               He spots Beni inside the Temple doorway, trying to close the 
               heavy sandstone door.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Hey! Beni! Wait up!

               Beni has no intention of waiting up, he pushes harder.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What are ya doing?! Wait up!

               O'Connell runs faster. Beni pushes harder. The four Horsemen 
               LEAP the big column and CHARGE after him. HOOFS POUNDING.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't you close that door! DON'T YOU 
                         CLOSE THAT DOOR!

               Beni closes the door just as O'Connell reaches it. O'Connell 
               SLAMS his body into the door. It doesn't budge.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I'm gonna get you for this!

               He turns and bolts off around the rocks. Running for his 
               life, weaving through the ruins. The Arabians getting closer 
               and closer. The POUNDING hoofs getting LOUDER and LOUDER.

               O'Connell finally spins around and faces his attackers. The 
               four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him. The 
               vicious Tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off.

               O'Connell just stands there, exhausted and beaten, then he 
               slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird.

               And that's when the horses go ape-shit. All four of them 
               REAR UP. Two of the Riders are THROWN to the ground. The 
               horses SCREECH and BELLOW and SNORT in fear, then buck like 
               fury and haul-ass away as if the devil himself had scared 
               them. The thrown Riders get up and race off after their 
               mounts.

               O'Connell just stands there, stunned, then he lifts his right 
               hand and checks out his middle finger. And then he feels the 
               evil himself, and turns around. -- The shattered, decrepit 
               statue of Anubis stares back at him.

               Suddenly, the sand begins to shift under O'Connell's feet.

               He starts to back away, keeping his eyes on the transforming 
               sand, it looks like huge snakes are wiggling and writhing 
               beneath it, forming lines and shapes, -- drawing a picture.

               O'Connell quickly turns and runs off through the ruins. The 
               sand stops moving, and we can now see that, drawn in the 
               sand, is a picture of IMHOTEP'S SCREAMING FACE.

               EXT. RIDGE - DAY

               Up on a ridge, A GROUP OF RIDERS watch O'Connell stumble 
               clear of the decrepit city. O'Connell feels their presence 
               and looks up. Very different from the Tuaregs, they have 
               BLUE TINTED SKIN and faces covered in strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS.

               The Mumia. Still watching Imhotep's grave after all this 
               time.

               The MUMIA LEADER is a huge, fierce Man in black robes, with 
               dual scimitars across his waist. His face is both handsome 
               and horrible, blue and tattooed. Meet ARDETH RAY. His dark 
               eyes watch O'Connell stagger off into the open desert...

               EXT. CAIRO - DAY

               Cairo, a city so old the stars have actually changed their 
               positions in the sky since it's birth. A city teeming with 
               every form of life. A strange, mysterious, wonderful city.

               WE SUPERIMPOSE it's name across the SCREEN:

                                          CAIRO

               INT. CAIRO MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY

               Deep in the bowels of the museum lie the STACKS. Rows upon 
               rows of towering bookshelves. Filled with literature on the 
               Antiquities. Standing at the top of a tall ladder between 
               two of these rows and leaning against one of the bookshelves, 
               is a rather uninteresting British GIRL: eye-glasses, hair-in- 
               a-bun, long boring dress, your typical prudish nightmare.

               This is EVELYN CARNARVON. We're going to fall in love with 
               her.

               Evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm, blows 
               the dust off it, then places it on a shelf with other books 
               whose titles all begin with the letter "O". Then she grabs 
               another book out from under her arm and reads the title.

                                     EVELYN
                         Tuthmosis?... Now how did you get up 
                         here?

               Carefully, so as not to lose her balance, she looks over her 
               shoulder to the bookshelf behind her, where all the titles 
               begin with the letter "T". Then she looks down. It's a long 
               way to the bottom. Evelyn gently sets the other books down 
               on the top shelf, then turns and gingerly starts to reach 
               across the aisle with the Tuthmosis book. It's a little too 
               far, so she stretches, reaching, holding the top of the ladder 
               with her fingertips, she's almost got it, closer now closer.

               And that's when the ladder pulls away from the shelf. Evelyn 
               YELPS, flings the Tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the 
               ladder, which stands straight up. Evelyn holds her breath, 
               swaying precariously, a long BEAT, and then she loses her 
               balance, the ladder swings around and Evelyn starts 
               stiltwalking down the aisle.

                                     EVELYN
                         OHEIUGM!! AHHHHHH!

               The ladder crosses the aisle, does an about face and heads 
               back the way it came. Evelyn clings to the top, struggling 
               for balance. The ladder teeters out into the main aisle and 
               picks up speed. Evelyn SCREAMS as it does a 180, spins into 
               another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a 
               bookshelf. Evelyn holds her breath, then SIGHS HEAVILY.

               And that's when the bookshelf falls away from her and CRASHES 
               into the next bookshelf.

               Evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor. She 
               looks up just as the domino effect kicks-in: each bookshelf 
               crashing into the next. And onward it goes. Bookshelf after 
               bookshelf. Thousands of volumes flinging off shelves and 
               scattering across the floor. It finally ends as the last 
               shelf CRASHES into a wall. Evelyn's eyes are closed. She 
               opens one eye. Looks left. Then right. Then opens the other 
               eye and stares at the huge mess.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oops.

               The Egyptian CURATOR storms in.

                                     CURATOR
                         Look at this! Sons of the Messiah! 
                         Give me frogs, flies, locusts, 
                         anything but this! Compared to you, 
                         the other plagues were a joy!

               Evelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm sorry, it was an accident.

                                     CURATOR
                         When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it 
                         was an accident. You are a 
                         catastrophe! Why do I put up with 
                         you?

               Evelyn turns to him, trying to contain herself.

                                     EVELYN
                         You put up with me, because I can 
                         read and write ancient Egyptian, 
                         decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, 
                         and I'm the only person within a 
                         thousand miles who knows how to 
                         properly code and catalogue this 
                         library.

                                     CURATOR
                         Who needs smart women? I put up with 
                         you because your mother and father 
                         were our finest patrons, Allah rest 
                         their souls. Now straighten up this 
                         mess!

               The Curator storms out. Evelyn just stands there, steaming.

               And then she hears a NOISE and quickly turns around. A BEAT.

                                     EVELYN
                         Hello?

               Quiet. Eerie. And then she hears it again, like feet, slowly 
               shuffling across the floor, coming from a nearby gallery.

                                     EVELYN
                         Abdul? Mohammed? Bob?

               Evelyn walks through the stacks and enters --

               INT. THE RAMESSEUM

               Filled with treasures and plunder from the Middle Kingdom. 
               It's very dark and quiet in here, the only LIGHT is from 
               FLICKERING TORCHES at either end of the spooky gallery.

               The NOISE again! From the far side of the room. Feet, slowly 
               shuffling, plodding across the floor. Evelyn grabs a torch.

               Looks around, at a statue of Anubis, another of Horus, they 
               stare down at Evelyn, who is starting to get scared now. She 
               walks down the aisle. Past a closed sarcophagus. Past cases 
               of ancient artifacts. Past another sarcophagus, -- only this 
               one is OPEN! Evelyn freezes, swallows hard, nervously looks 
               around to see who could have opened it. Then she slowly leans 
               forward with the torch, and peers inside.

               -- A hideous rotted MUMMY sits up and SCREECHES at her!

               Evelyn SCREAMS, drops the torch and backs away, scared out 
               of her wits. And then, coming from inside the sarcophagus, 
               she hears a Man LAUGHING. Her eyes narrow as a foppish cad 
               crawls out from behind the Mummy, laughing his ass off, half 
               drunk.

                                     EVELYN
                         You...! YOU...!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please 
                         call me something original.

               Meet JONATHAN CARNARVON. As he crawls out of the sarcophagus, 
               Evelyn pulls a cigarette out of the mummy's mouth.

                                     EVELYN
                         Have you no respect for the dead?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Right now, I only wish to join them.

               He grins drunkenly. Evelyn punches him hard in the chest.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather 
                         than later, before you ruin my career 
                         the way you've ruined yours.

                                     JONATHAN
                         My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll 
                         have you know, that at this moment 
                         my career is on a high note.

               He BELCHES, then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb.

                                     EVELYN
                         High note? Ha! For five years you've 
                         been scrounging around Egypt, and 
                         what have you to show for it? Nothing.

               Jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh yes I do! I have something right 
                         here!

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh no, not another worthless trinket, 
                         Jonathan, if I bring one more piece 
                         of junk to the Curator to try and 
                         sell for you.

               Jonathan pulls out a small, ancient BOX; the collapsed KEY 
               to Imhotep's sarcophagus and coffin. Evelyn is instantly 
               curious, she grabs the box out of his hand.

                                     EVELYN
                         Where did you get this?

               Jonathan knows her weaknesses, gives her a mischievous smile.

                                     JONATHAN
                         On a dig, down in Thebes.

               Evelyn rolls the box around in her hands, mumbling to herself 
               as she translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it.

               Jonathan licks his lips in anticipation.

                                     JONATHAN
                         My whole life I've never found 
                         anything, Evy. Tell me I've found 
                         something.

               Evelyn's fingers play with the various little slats on the 
               box, shifting them this way and that way, it's like a puzzle 
               box. Then suddenly, it UNFOLDS ITSELF, almost-mechanically, 
               turning itself into the KEY. Sitting inside the open key/box 
               is a folded piece of GOLDEN PAPYRUS. An ANCIENT MAP.

                                     EVELYN
                         Jonathan?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes?

                                     EVELYN
                         I think you found something.

               INT. CURATOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               The Curator sits at his desk, staring through a jeweler's 
               eyepiece at the key/box. Evelyn hovers behind him, excited.

                                     EVELYN
                         See the cartouche there, it's the 
                         official royal seal of Seti the First, 
                         I'm sure of it.

                                     CURATOR
                         Perhaps.

               Jonathan leans in from across the desk.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Two questions. Who the hell is Seti 
                         the First? And was he rich?

                                     EVELYN
                         He was the last Pharaoh of the Old 
                         Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest 
                         Pharaoh of them all.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Alright, good, that's good. I like 
                         this fellow, like him very much.

               The Curator picks up the MAP. It's actually the exact same 
               map that we established in the opening scenes of the movie.

                                     EVELYN
                         I've already dated it, this map is 
                         almost four thousand years old. And 
                         the hieratics over here...
                              (Inhales deeply)
                         It's Hamunaptra.

               The Curator freezes, suddenly very nervous, then he recovers.

                                     CURATOR
                         My dear girl, don't be ridiculous, 
                         we are scholars, not treasure hunters. 
                         Hamunaptra is a myth.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the 
                         early Pharaohs were said to have 
                         hidden the wealth of Egypt.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Right, right, in a big underground 
                         treasure chamber. Everybody knows 
                         the story. The entire necropolis was 
                         rigged to sink into the sand. On 
                         Pharaoh's command, a flick of the 
                         switch! And the whole place could 
                         disappear beneath the dunes.

                                     EVELYN
                         All we know is that the city 
                         mysteriously vanished around 2,134 
                         B.C.

               The Curator holds the map closer to the burning CANDLE-LAMP.

                                     CURATOR
                         As the Americans would say: it's all 
                         fairy tales and hokum.

               The map 'accidentally,' CATCHES ON FIRE. The Curator throws 
               it to the floor. Jonathan drops to his knees and quickly 
               puts it out. Lifts it up. The left third of the map is now 
               missing.

                                     JONATHAN
                         You burned it! You burned off the 
                         part with the lost city!

                                     CURATOR
                         It's for the best, I'm sure. Many 
                         men have wasted their lives in the 
                         foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra, no 
                         one has ever found it, most have 
                         never returned.

                                     JONATHAN
                              (devastated)
                         You killed my map.

                                     CURATOR
                         I'm sure it was a fake, anyway, I'm 
                         surprised at you, Miss Carnarvon, to 
                         be so fooled.

               The Curator reaches for the key/box. Evelyn quickly snatches 
               it off the desk and gives him a very angry, suspicious look.

               EXT. CAIRO PRISON - GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY

               Cairo prison. One of the worst hell holes on earth. Every 
               low-life form of scumbag can be found here. The WARDEN, a 
               first rate scumbag himself, escorts Evelyn and Jonathan across 
               the gallows courtyard. Evelyn whispers to Jonathan.

                                     EVELYN
                         You told me you found it on a dig 
                         down in Thebes!

                                     JONATHAN
                         I was mistaken.

                                     EVELYN
                         You lied to me!

                                     JONATHAN
                         I lie to everybody, what makes you 
                         so special?

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm your sister.

                                     JONATHAN
                         That just makes you more gullible.

                                     EVELYN
                         You stole it from a drunk at the 
                         local Casbah?!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Picked his pocket, actually.

               EXT. VISITOR'S PEN - DAY

               The Warden ushers Evelyn and Jonathan into the holding pen.

                                     EVELYN
                         And what is he in prison for?

                                     WARDEN
                         I did not know, so when I heard you 
                         were coming, I asked him that myself.

                                     EVELYN
                         And what did he say?

                                     WARDEN
                         He said... he was just looking for a 
                         good time.

               The interior cell door BURSTS OPEN. O'Connell is in chains, 
               dragged by FOUR GUARDS, they shove him up to the cell bars.

               From the looks of it, he's been here awhile; his face is 
               half hidden by long hair, a scraggly beard and many new 
               bruises. Evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance.

                                     EVELYN
                         But he's just a filthy criminal?

                                     JONATHAN
                              (cringing)
                         Way to go, Evy.

               O'Connell gives Evelyn the once over, then looks at Jonathan.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So who's the broad?

                                     EVELYN
                         Broad?!

                                     JONATHAN
                         She's my sister, actually.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a 
                         total loss.

               Evelyn is stunned and furious. The Warden heads out the door.

                                     WARDEN
                         I'll be back in a moment.

                                     O'CONNELL
                              (sarcastic)
                         I tremble with anticipation.

               A Guard CLUBS O'Connell across the head, O'Connell's face 
               bounces off the metal bars. He shows no pain, but just looks 
               back and gives the Guard a nasty look. Evelyn steps closer.

                                     EVELYN
                         We uh,... found... your puzzle box, 
                         and we've come to ask you about it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No.

                                     EVELYN
                         No?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No... You came to ask me about 
                         Hamunaptra.

               Evelyn and Jonathan quickly look around, hoping the guards 
               didn't hear him. They step closer. Evelyn plays coy.

                                     EVELYN
                         How do you know the box pertains to 
                         Hamunaptra?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Because that's where I found it. I 
                         was there.

               Evelyn is dumbstruck. But Jonathan looks suspicious

                                     JONATHAN
                         How do we know that's not a load of 
                         pig swallow?

               O'Connell looks closer at Jonathan, a glint of recognition.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Hey,... don't I know you?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Um, well, you see...

               O'Connell's FIST comes flying through the bars, hits Jonathan 
               square in the jaw, DECKS HIM. He hits the floor. Out cold. A 
               Guard CLUBS O'Connell. His head bounces off the bars again.

               He shows no pain, but gives the Guard another nasty look.

               Evelyn looks down at her brother, then back at O'Connell.

                                     EVELYN
                         You were actually at Hamunaptra?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I just decked your brother

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, well...
                              (shrugs)
                         I know my brother.

               O'Connell almost smiles. There's a bit of spark to this girl.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, I was there.

                                     EVELYN
                         You swear?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Every damn day.

                                     EVELYN
                         No, I mean --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         -- I know what you mean. I was there, 
                         alright. Seti's place. The City Of 
                         The Dead.

                                     EVELYN
                         What did you find? What did you see?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I found sand. I saw death.

               The warden enters. Evelyn quickly leans closer to O'Connell.

                                     EVELYN
                         Could you tell me how to get there? 
                         The exact location?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Want to know?

               Evelyn leans in even closer.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Really want to know?

               She leans her face right up to the bars, nervous and excited

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes.

               O'Connell steps forward and KISSES her full on the lips.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Then get me the hell outta here.

               Evelyn is stunned. A Guard CLUBS him, his face bounces off 
               the bars again, but before he can react the Guards GRAB him, 
               YANKS him away from the bars and DRAG him out of the room.

                                     EVELYN
                         Where are they taking him?

                                     WARDEN
                         To be hanged.

               Evelyn is shocked. The warden shows-off his green teeth.

                                     WARDEN
                         Apparently, he had a very good time.

               EXT. GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY

               Hundreds of filthy PRISONERS stare down onto the gallows as 
               the hangman's noose is draped over O'Connell's head and 
               cinched tight around his neck. Evelyn follows the warden 
               onto a balcony above the gallows. The prisoners all go dead 
               quiet at the sight of her; like jackals staring at fresh 
               meat.

                                     WARDEN
                         No women allowed.

                                     EVELYN
                         I am an English woman.

               This seems to confuse the Warden, he shrugs and sits down.

               O'Connell looks up as Evelyn plops down beside the Warden.

                                     EVELYN
                         I will give you one hundred pounds 
                         to spare his life.

                                     WARDEN
                         I would pay one hundred pounds just 
                         to see him hang.

                                     EVELYN
                         Two hundred pounds.

                                     WARDEN
                         Proceed!

                                     EVELYN
                         Three hundred pounds!

               O'Connell can hear every word, he looks hopeful. Other than 
               Evelyn, you could hear a pin drop. The HANGMAN turns to him.

                                     HANGMAN
                         Any last requests, pig?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, I'd like ya to let me go.

               The Hangman grabs the lever to the trapdoor.

                                     EVELYN
                         FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS!

               The Warden sets his greasy, lecherous hand on Evelyn's leg.

                                     WARDEN
                         And what else?

               Evelyn is revolted, she quickly shoves his hand away.

               Insulted, the Warden angrily turns and gestures to the 
               Hangman, who pulls the lever. The trapdoor DROPS AWAY.

                                     EVELYN
                         NOOO!

               O'Connell DROPS through the hole. The rope pays out. Then 
               JERKS TAUGHT. O'Connell's body SNAPS at the end of the rope.

               But he's still alive, because --

                                     WARDEN
                         His neck did not break! Good! Now we 
                         watch him strangle to death.

               The prisoners go ape-shit, SCREAMING and SHOUTING in anger.

               The GUARDS look around, nervous. O'Connell struggles at the 
               end of the rope, gagging. Evelyn is horrified, she quickly 
               turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear.

                                     EVELYN
                         He knows the location to Hamunaptra.

               The warden spins around and faces her.

                                     WARDEN
                         You lie.

                                     EVELYN
                         I would never!

               At the end of the rope, O'Connell is choking and gagging and 
               turning several shades of red. The Warden stares at Evelyn.

                                     WARDEN
                         Are you saying this filthy godless 
                         son of a pig knows where to find The 
                         City Of The Dead? Truly?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes and if you cut him down, we will 
                         give you ten percent.

                                     WARDEN
                         Fifty percent.

                                     EVELYN
                         Twenty.

                                     WARDEN
                         Forty.

               Evelyn hesitates, bites her lip. O'Connell's eyes bulge as 
               he looks up at her, he can't believe this girl.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Give... give him... give him GLAAAA--
                         !

                                     EVELYN
                         Twenty-five percent, and not one 
                         single farthing more.

               The warden flashes a big green smile, then YELLS in Arabic. 
               A scimitar SLASHES the air. The rope is CUT. O'Connell CRASHES 
               to the ground. Half dead. Rolls over. GAGGING.

               All of the prisoners BURST INTO CHEERS. O'Connell looks up 
               at Evelyn. She smiles broadly and waves down at him.

               CURATOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CANDLE LIGHT FLICKERS across the Curator's face.

                                     CURATOR
                         She must die.

               Standing in the shadows across from his desk are THREE MUMIA: 
               blue tinted skin, hideous facial tattoos, -- the works. One 
               of the Mumia has a rusty metal HOOK for a hand. He shrugs.

                                     HOOK
                         She is like all the others. She will 
                         die in the desert.

                                     CURATOR
                         No! She has seen too much. She knows 
                         too much.

               The Curator leans across his desk, fear in his eyes.

                                     CURATOR
                         Not only does she have a map, but 
                         she has the key.

               Spooks the hell out of the Mumia guys.

                                     HOOK
                         The key!? She has the lost key!?

                                     CURATOR
                         Yes. No one has ever had so much, 
                         been so close. We must stop her, or 
                         it will be the end of us all.

                                     HOOK
                         Then we will kill her, we will kill 
                         her and all those with her.

                                     CURATOR
                         And burn the map and retrieve the 
                         key.

                                     HOOK
                         It will be done. But what of the 
                         American expedition? They leave 
                         tomorrow as well.

                                     CURATOR
                         Forget the bumbling Americans, they 
                         will be like all the others. Without 
                         the map to guide them, how can they 
                         possibly find Hamunaptra?

               EXT. GIZA PORT - DAY

               SMASH CUT TO: our old traitorous friend BENI.

                                     BENI
                         It is three days down the Nile, then 
                         two days by camel, sahibs.

               WE CRANE BACK: to reveal Beni standing on the bow of a 
               PASSENGER BARGE. Surrounded by DANIELS, HENDERSON and BURNS.

                                     DANIELS
                         For all the money we're paying you, 
                         something better god-damned well be 
                         under that sand.

               WE KEEP CRANING BACK: as Henderson slaps Daniels on the back.

                                     HENDERSON
                         "Hamunaptra," Daniels, that's all ya 
                         gotta keep sayin, to yourself, 
                         "Hamunaptra."

               Now we see all of GIZA PORT: Team of explorers swarm the 
               docks. Across the Nile, the PYRAMIDS spike the sky. Evelyn 
               and Jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by HAWKERS 
               selling everything from toy tombs to King Tut action figures.

                                     EVELYN
                         Do you really think he'll show up?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he 
                         may be a cowboy, but his word is his 
                         word.

                                     EVELYN
                         Personally, I think he's filthy, 
                         rude and a complete scoundrel. I 
                         don't like him one bit.

                                     O'CONNELL (O.S.)
                         Anyone I know?

               They both turn. O'Connell walks up; shaved, showered, spit 
               and polished, with a new haircut and clothes. He looks more 
               dashing and handsome than ever. Evelyn is suitably impressed.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh... um,... hello.

               Jonathan grabs O'Connell's arm and shakes his hand.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Smashing day for the start of an 
                         adventure, eh, O'Connell?

               O'Connell quickly checks his pockets.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, sure, smashing.

               He finds his wallet and relaxes. DIRECTLY ABOVE HIM: on the 
               bow of the barge, Burns wipes his bifocals and turns to Beni.

                                     BURNS
                         You're sure Hamunaptra is out there?

                                     BENI
                         Along with the scorched bones of my 
                         entire garrison, sahib.

               And that's when Beni spots O'Connell. Beni shakes his head, 
               as if seeing a mirage, then starts backing away from the 
               men.

                                     BENI
                         A thousand pardons, my good sahibs 
                         but there is much work to be done.

               Beni quickly scurries off, vanishing down into the hold.

               BACK DOWN WITH: Evelyn, recovering, she clears her throat.

                                     EVELYN
                         Mister O'Connell, can you look me in 
                         the eye, and guarantee me this is 
                         not some sort of flimflam? Because 
                         if it is, I'm warning you --

               O'Connell steps up close to Evelyn, invading her space looks 
               her straight in the eye. Evelyn doesn't back away.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         All I can tell you, miss, is that my 
                         Colonel found that map in an ancient 
                         fortress, and the whole damn garrison 
                         believed in it so much, that without 
                         orders, we marched halfway across 
                         Libya and into Egypt to find that 
                         city. Like I told ya, all I saw was 
                         sand. Everybody else was wiped out 
                         by Tuareg warriors. I'll take your 
                         bags.

               O'Connell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto 
               the same passenger barge that Beni and the Americans are on.

               Evelyn's eyes follow him, a bit wistfully. Jonathan sees it.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude, 
                         a complete scoundrel, nothing to 
                         like there at all.

               Evelyn gives him a look. Jonathan just grins. And that's 
               when the warden suddenly brushes past, tipping his raggedy 
               hat.

                                     WARDEN
                         A bright good morning to all.

                                     EVELYN
                         What are you doing here?

                                     WARDEN
                         I have come to protect my investment, 
                         thank you very much.

               And up the plank he goes. Evelyn and Jonathan share a look.

               WE GO WIDE AGAIN: as the barge pulls out and heads down the 
               Nile. WE TILT UP: to the SUN, which then DISSOLVES into --

               EXT. RIVER NILE - NIGHT

               The MOON, shining down on the desert. The THREE VICIOUS MUMIA 
               quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river. The one 
               with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff, the other two 
               row, heading for the PASSENGER BARGE coming their way.

               EXT. THE BAR AT THE BOW - NIGHT

               Jonathan and the three Americans are playing poker. O'Connell 
               comes out a door carrying a GUNNY-SACK.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we 
                         could use another good player.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I only gamble with my life, never my 
                         money.

                                     DANIELS
                         Never? What if I were to wager five 
                         hundred dollars says we get to 
                         Hamunaptra before you?

               O'Connell returns Daniel's cocky look.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yer on.

               Burns slips on his dirty bifocals.

                                     BURNS
                         What makes you so confident, sir?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What makes you?

               Henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon.

                                     HENDERSON
                         We got us a man who's actually been 
                         there.

               O'Connell's poker face drops, perplexed. Same with Jonathan.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, what a coincidence, why --

               O'Connell 'accidentally' hits him in the ribs with the 
               gunnysack, shutting him up. Jonathan quickly covers.

                                     JONATHAN
                         -- whose deal is it? Is it my deal? 
                         I thought I just dealt?

               EXT. BARGE - NIGHT

               Evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river.

               The gunny-sack DROPS onto the table, startling her.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.

                                     EVELYN
                         The only thing that scares me, Mister 
                         O'Connell, are your manners.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?

                                     EVELYN
                         If you call that a kiss.

               O'Connell reaches into the gunny-sack and starts pulling out 
               revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun, 
               and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite.

                                     EVELYN
                         Did I miss something? Are we going 
                         into battle?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The last time I was at that place 
                         everybody I was with died.

               This takes the smile off Evelyn's face. O'Connell starts 
               dismantling and cleaning the guns.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         There's something out there, you 
                         know, something under that sand.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain 
                         artifact, a book, actually, my brother 
                         thinks there's treasure. What do you 
                         think is out there?

               O'Connell looks into Evelyn's eyes.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin 
                         believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, 
                         they call it, "the doorway to hell."

                                     EVELYN
                         Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to 
                         the underworld", actually.

               She gives him a know-it-all grin.

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't believe in fairy tales and 
                         hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do 
                         believe that one of the most famous 
                         books in history is buried out there, 
                         The Book Of The Living. It's what 
                         first interested me in Egypt as a 
                         child. It's why I came here, sort of 
                         a life's pursuit.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And the fact that they say it's made 
                         out of pure gold, makes no nevermind 
                         to you, right?

               Evelyn is surprised by his knowledge.

                                     EVELYN
                         You know your history.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I know my treasure.

               Evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns 
               back to O'Connell, and as matter-of-fact as possible says:

                                     EVELYN
                         By the way,... why did you kiss me?

               O'Connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I was about to be hanged, seemed 
                         like a good idea at the time.

               Evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off.

               O'Connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What?... Wha'd I say?

               Then he hears someone SNICKERING under the table. He quickly 
               reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. It's Beni.

                                     BENI
                         My very good friend! What a surprise.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Why if it ain't my little buddy, 
                         Beni. I oughta kill you.

               O'Connell sticks a knife under Beni's throat. Beni swallows 
               hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin.

                                     BENI
                         You never were any good with the 
                         ladies, O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So you're the one leading the 
                         Americans, I shoulda figured. So 
                         what's the scam? You get 'em out in 
                         the middle of the desert then leave 
                         'em to rot?

                                     BENI
                         Unfortunately no, these Americans 
                         are smart, they pay me only half 
                         now, half when I get them back to 
                         Cairo, so I must go all the way.

               O'Connell pulls the knife away. Beni relaxes, rubs his neck.

                                     BENI
                         You never believed in Hamunaptra, 
                         O'Connell. Why are you going back? 
                         The devil himself lives out there.

               They look as they hear Evelyn YELP. A single CAMEL in the 
               HORSE PADDOCK takes another bite at her. She YELPS again and 
               backs away. O'Connell grins as Evelyn flees down the deck.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The girl saved my life, figured it 
                         was the least I could do, keep her 
                         out of trouble.

                                     BENI
                         You always did have more balls than 
                         brains.

               O'Connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at Beni.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Let's make us even, shall we?

                                     BENI
                         Even?

               O'Connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge.

               Beni SPLASHES into the river. O'Connell takes his gunny-sack 
               and starts walking off down the deck.

                                     BENI (O.S.)
                         O'Connell! I am going to kill you 
                         for this!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Sounds familiar.

               And that's when he spots THREE SETS OF WET FOOTPRINTS, coming 
               up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck.

               O'Connell quickly looks around, immediately on the alert.

               INT. EVELYN'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Evelyn, wearing a nightgown, stands in front of a mirror.

               She gives her head a good shake, letting her hair fall loose 
               over her bare shoulders. Then she turns around, RIGHT THERE 
               IS ONE OF THE HIDEOUS MUMIA! It's Hook. He slams his hand 
               over her mouth and lifts up his hook, ready to strike.

                                     HOOK
                         Where is the map?

               Evelyn's terrified eyes glance down. Hook looks over, sees 
               the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table.

                                     HOOK
                         And the key? Where is the key?

               Evelyn's eyes look confused. She shakes her head. Hook grins.

                                     HOOK
                         Then I'll find it myself.

               He cocks his hook, about to kill her. And that's when the 
               door is KICKED OPEN. O'Connell BURSTS IN, gun in each hand.

               Hook spins Evelyn around and holds her out in front of him.

               O'Connell looks at her.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Friend of yours?

               Evelyn's eyes widen. And that's when the candle on the table 
               FLICKERS. Everything happens at once, READ FAST: O'Connell 
               spins around just as a window BURSTS OPEN. A Mumia leans in.

               FIRES A GUN. Woodchips BLAST OFF the wall next to O'Connell's 
               head. He returns FIRE. Kills the Mumia. The Mumia falls back.

               FIRING BLINDLY. A LANTERN in the room is BLASTED. Kerosene 
               SPLASHES across the wall. BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Evelyn grabs 
               the candle on the table and JAMS IT back over her shoulder, 
               right into Hook's EYE. He SCREECHES in pain and lets her go.

               O'Connell grabs her and YANKS her out of the FLAMING ROOM.

               HALLWAY - NIGHT

               O'Connell pulls Evelyn down the hall, she tries to jerk free.

                                     EVELYN
                         The map! We need the map!

               He shoves her up against a wall.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Relax! I'm the map!
                              (taps his forehead)
                         It's all up here.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh that's comforting.

               O'Connell gives her a look, then pulls her forward.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon, there's still one more of 
                         those guys around here somewhere.

               EVELYN'S FLAMING ROOM - NIGHT

               Hot melted wax covers Hook's face as he holds his sore eye 
               and struggles to the door. Then he notices the key/box on 
               the floor. He bends over to pick it up. And that's when the 
               door is KICKED OPEN again, it hits him in the ass and knocks 
               him into the fire. Jonathan leans in. Sees nothing but flames.

                                     JONATHAN
                         EVY!!

               Then he sees the key/box on the floor and picks it up. A 
               HAND suddenly snatches the key/box away from him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hey that's mine --

               It's Hook. His backside is now ON FIRE. He lifts his pistol.

               Jonathan quickly backpedals out the door as Hook OPENS FIRE.

               EXT. CAMEL PADDOCK - NIGHT

               O'Connell and Evelyn race out onto the deck near the horse 
               paddock. People are SCREAMING and SHOUTING, lots of panic.

               BLAM! A chunk of the wall is BLOWN OFF next to Evelyn's head.

               O'Connell pivots and FIRES BACK. It's the last Mumia, on the 
               other side of the paddock. He and O'Connell exchange GUNFIRE.

               Another LANTERN BURSTS INTO FLAMES. O'Connell SHOOTS OFF the 
               paddock lock. The horses go nuts. O'Connell FIRES over their 
               heads. They CHARGE FORWARD and CRASH through the door. The 
               Mumia SCREAMS as the horses STAMPEDE over him. FLAMES sweep 
               up the walls and race across the roof. Half the barge is now 
               ON FIRE. O'Connell throws the gunny-sack over his shoulder.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Can you swim?

                                     EVELYN
                         Well of course I can swim, if the 
                         occasion calls for it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Trust me.

               He picks her up and throws her over the side.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The occasion calls for it.

               Evelyn SPLASHES into the water. O'Connell dives in after 
               her.

               EXT. BARGE BOW - NIGHT

               Jonathan runs out onto the bow, sees the three Americans, 
               guns in every hand, fanning their pistols, SHOOTING everything 
               in sight. Jonathan just shakes his head.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Americans.

               Hook suddenly stumbles up behind him, -- now a FLAMING TORCH.

               Jonathan turns around, Hook grabs him by the throat with his 
               FLAMING ARM and pins him to the cabin wall. Jonathan's eyes 
               widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the FLAMES about to 
               strike him. The Americans pivot and OPEN FIRE. Blows Hook 
               over the railing. Jonathan turns to the Americans and smiles.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say! Good show!

               Then he points his thumb at himself

                                     JONATHAN
                         And did I panic?

               He lifts up his other hand, -- he has the key/box back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I think not.

               And that's when the horses STAMPEDE onto the bow. Jonathan 
               dives over one side, the three Americans dive over the other.

               NILE RIVERBANK - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden wade out of the 
               water. Evelyn's nightgown clings tight to her body as she 
               wrings it out. She looks good. O'Connell notices.

               Everybody else, including the horses, is getting out on the 
               far shore O'Connell spots Beni running up to the Americans.

                                     BENI
                         Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I 
                         got all the horses!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on 
                         the wrong side of the river!

               Beni looks up at the stars, then angrily KICKS the sand 
               CURSING. The FLAMING barge drifts off, slowly sinking...

               BEDOUIN TRADING POST - DAY

               O'Connell barters in ARABIC with a CAMEL TRADER at a trading 
               post. Jonathan forks over some cash. The Trader hands them 
               the reins of four ugly old camels.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I can't believe the price of these 
                         fleabags.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We coulda had 'em for free, all we 
                         had to do was give 'em your sister.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Awfully.

               And that's when Evelyn steps out of a trading tent. She's 
               changed into a gorgeous, tightly fitted, Bedouin dress.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Then again...

               SAHARA DESERT SAND DUNES - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the warden are on camels in 
               the middle of the frying pan; the endless, sunbaked Sahara.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Never did like camels. Filthy buggers. 
                         They smell, they bite, they spit. 
                         Disgusting.

               The warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile 
               green teeth. Flies buzz around his head. He sucks at his 
               gums, then spits out some gristle. O'Connell watches him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, disgusting.

               Evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well I think they're cute.

               WE DO SEVERAL TIME DISSOLVES: showing the majesty of the 
               desert, and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it.

               FRYING PAN - NIGHT

               The MOON shines down an four lone camel rider's trekking 
               across the vast wasteland.

               Jonathan is sound asleep, his head bobbing comically to the 
               rhythm of his camel. On the camel next to him, the Warden 
               SNORES LOUDLY. Up in front of them, Evelyn slowly starts to 
               slide off her saddle. O'Connell reaches over and stops her, 
               then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle, never waking 
               her. For a long moment, his eyes watch Evelyn, and then he 
               looks up at a distant ridge --

               -- where Ardeth Ray and a group of MUMIA RIDERS are pacing 
               them.

               EXT. GIANT SAND DUNE - ENDLESS HORIZON - DAY

               The dawning sun hasn't yet crested the distant horizon as 
               Jonathan and the Warden ride alongside a giant sand dune.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And you snore!

                                     WARDEN
                         I do not snore!

                                     JONATHAN
                         All night you snored!

                                     WARDEN
                         I have never snored!

               Up in front of them, O'Connell looks at Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We're almost there.

                                     EVELYN
                         Are you sure?

               O'Connell looks down at the ground.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Pretty sure.

               The others look down and see DOZENS OF SKELETONS sticking 
               out of the ground. Bleached and eaten away. Some of the 
               skeletons look like they're trying to crawl up out of the 
               desert floor.

                                     JONATHAN
                         What in bloody hell is this?

               The Warden shivers in fear.

                                     WARDEN
                         Other seekers of Hamunaptra.

               The American Expedition rides out from behind the far end of 
               the dune. The Americans are accompanied by TWO DOZEN NATIVE 
               DIGGERS and an Arab EGYPTOLOGIST. Beni rides lead on a camel, 
               the rest ride horses.

                                     BENI
                         Good morning, my friend!

               O'Connell just nods. The two parties come to a stop a hundred 
               feet apart. O'Connell turns and stares out across the endless 
               horizon. Beni does likewise. The Americans look puzzled.

                                     DANIELS
                         Well, what the hell we doin'?

                                     BENI
                         Patience, my good sahib, patience.

               Henderson looks over at O'Connell.

                                     HENDERSON
                         First one to the city, O'Connell! 
                         Five hundred! Cash bucks!

               O'Connell and Beni just stare out at the flat nothingness.

               Evelyn and Jonathan share a look. And then, the SUN starts 
               to rise in the distance, breaking the flat horizon.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Get ready.

               Evelyn can feel the suspense and the majesty of the moment.

                                     EVELYN
                         For what?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We're about to be shown the way.

               Far off to the right, a HUGE SHAPE begins to rise with the 
               sun. A VOLCANO. O'Connell and Beni watch it, expressionless.

               Daniels, Henderson and Burns share a look, and then --

                                     DANIELS/HENDERSON/BURNS
                         HEYA!

               The Americans take off. Racing towards the rising volcano.

                                     DANIELS
                         SEE YA THERE, O'CONNELL!

               Evelyn and Jonathan give O'Connell anxious, sarcastic looks.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't 
                         we be going?

                                     EVELYN
                         After all, you rode us night and day 
                         to win that bet.

               O'Connell doesn't say a word, staring hard. Beni watches the 
               Americans and spits into the sand.

                                     BENI
                         Fools.

               And then suddenly, the volcano SHIFTS ACROSS THE HORIZON.

               Passing across the sun as it goes. It's a MIRAGE.

               The Americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other 
               way, after the volcano. Evelyn and Jonathan smile, amazed.

               The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN, floating across the watery horizon.

               The Americans crash to a stop again and chase after the 
               volcano. All three of them confused and CURSING. O'Connell 
               and Beni just stare, waiting. The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN. And 
               the Americans crash to a stop again. Burns is THROWN from 
               his horse. Henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it 
               to the ground. Daniels just curses as they give up the chase.

               The volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon.

               The Americans are on the far right. Nothing moves. A BEAT.

               And then O'Connell grins. So does Beni. They share a look.

               And then SWAT their camels and RACE AWAY. Everybody else 
               hauls-ass after them. O'Connell and Beni are neck-and-neck.

               And then Evelyn comes galloping up, hair flying in the wind.

               Beni takes out his camel whip and starts WHIPPING O'Connell. 
               Trying to knock him off his camel. once. CRACK! Twice. CRACK!

               But on the third try O'Connell grabs the whip and JERKS Beni 
               off his camel. Beni SLAMS to the ground and TUMBLES.

               Evelyn and O'Connell race across the desert. Evelyn has never 
               felt so alive. She LAUGHS. O'Connell grins; he likes this 
               girl. Beni stumbles to his feet, then quickly dances out of 
               the way as Jonathan and all the other riders stampede past 
               him. Evelyn beats O'Connell to the stone ramp, racing hard.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evelyn! Slow down!

               Evelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         SLOW DOWN, EVELYN! SLOW DOWN! THERE'S 
                         A REALLY BIG --

               INT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               Evelyn goes ass-over-teacups through the air and crash lands 
               in a sand dune. She sits up, stunned, sandy hair in her eyes.

               O'Connell stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Never mind.

               The Americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside 
               the volcano. O'Connell gives them a big, shit-eating grin.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You boys owe me five hundred dollars.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               Under the guidance of the Egyptologist, the Diggers are busy 
               hauling rock and dirt out of the Temple doorway. The three 
               Americans are playing poker. Beni smokes a hookah and swats 
               flies. Dozens of stray CAMELS roam the decrepit city; dusty 
               backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps.

                                     DANIELS
                         Where'd all these camels come from?

                                     BENI
                         They belong to the dead. They will 
                         wait years for their masters to return 
                         before leaving.

               EXT. OUR HEROES DIG - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden are working next 
               to a narrow CREVICE, which weaves it's way through the ruins.

               O'Connell ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of 
               the coils into the crevice, about to rappel down. Jonathan 
               bends over to have a look, his ass hits something, he YELPS 
               and backs away. It's the decrepit FACE OF ANUBIS.

                                     JONATHAN
                         That thing gives me the creeps.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Be nice. That thing saved my life.

               Evelyn is positioning ancient MIRRORS along the crevice.

                                     EVELYN
                         That "thing" gets me excited.

                                     O'CONNELL
                              (sarcastic)
                         The things that get you excited.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to Bembridge Scholars, 
                         inside the statue of Anubis was a 
                         secret compartment, perhaps containing 
                         The Book Of The Living.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What are those mirrors for?

                                     EVELYN
                         Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

               O'Connell shrugs, then rappels down into the crevice.

               INT. EMBALMER'S CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell waves a TORCH as Jonathan, Evelyn and the warden 
               drop down next to him. Evelyn peers into the spooky darkness.

                                     EVELYN
                         Do you realize, we are standing inside 
                         a room that no one has entered in 
                         over four thousand years.

                                     WARDEN
                         Who cares? I don't see no treasure.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You're welcome to my share of the 
                         spider webs.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And it stinks to high heaven in here.

               Evelyn just rolls her eyes.

                                     EVELYN
                         Cretins.

               Jonathan sniffs the foul air, then he looks at the warden 
               and realizes where the smell is coming from. He stops 
               sniffing.

               Evelyn brushes COBWEBS away from a METAL DISK on the wall, 
               then repositions it on it's pedestal, aiming it at a RAY OF 
               LIGHT shining in from the outer mirrors. -- THE RAY OF LIGHT 
               HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY SHOOTS AROUND THE ROOM FROM ONE 
               DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP. LIGHT 
               RAYS SHOOT OFF DOWN THE PASSAGEWAYS. It's the embalmer's 
               chamber.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That is a neat trick.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god, It's a preparation room.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Preparation for what?

                                     EVELYN
                         For entering the afterlife.

               O'Connell quickly draws his gun. Jonathan gently nudges him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Mummies, my good son, this is where 
                         they made the mummies.

               Evelyn heads down a narrow passageway. The others follow.

               INT. LABYRINTH - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch as they make their way 
               through a narrow, COBWEB INFESTED LABYRINTH. The short, squat 
               warden can stand straight up. Then they hear something and 
               freeze. It sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls.

               They share looks. Then slowly move forward. Getting darker 
               and darker as they go. The strange sound getting louder and 
               louder. And then it stops. Evelyn holds her breath. Jonathan 
               licks his lips. O'Connell cocks his pistol. The warden FARTS.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Evelyn glare at him.

               ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               They slowly creep out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of 
               an enormous half-buried statue. The lower half of Anubis.

               Then they hear the sound again, coming closer now, from the 
               other side of the statue. And closer. O'Connell pulls Evelyn 
               behind him. And closer. O'Connell raises his gun. And CLOSER!

               O'Connell LEAPS OUT. -- THREE HORRIBLE SWEATY FACES LUNGE AT 
               HIM. O'Connell REACTS. But doesn't pull the trigger because 
               it's just the Americans, their guns are up, cocked and aimed.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Ya scared the bejeezus out of us, 
                         O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Likewise.

               But nobody lowers their guns. Daniels grins, the tough one.

                                     DANIELS
                         This here is our statue,... friend.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't see your name on it,... pal.

               And that's when Beni, five Diggers and the Egyptologist step 
               out of the shadows, -- all holding guns aimed at O'Connell.

                                     BENI
                         Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are 
                         no-so-good.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I've had worse.

               Jonathan clenches a tiny derringer.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, me too.

               O'Connell gives him a sideways glance. Beni cocks his gun, 
               grinning, he wants it to happen. The tension thickens. Then 
               Evelyn gently takes O'Connell's gun hand and pulls it down.

                                     EVELYN
                         Let's be nice, children, if we're 
                         going to play together, we must learn 
                         to share.

               Evelyn pulls O'Connell away. Jonathan and the Warden follow.

               Beni and the Americans slowly lower their guns, laughing.

               The Egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell and Jonathan are using sledge-hammers against the 
               ceiling. Evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to my calculations, we 
                         should be right under the statue. 
                         We'll come up right between his legs.
                              (she blushes and laughs)
                         Oh my.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And when those dirty Yanks go to 
                         sleep --
                              (looks at O'Connell)
                         No offense.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         None taken.

                                     JONATHAN
                         We'll sneak up and steal that book 
                         right out from under them.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And you're sure you can find the 
                         secret compartment?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn't 
                         already found it.

               Jonathan looks around.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, what's our smelly little friend 
                         got himself up to?

               INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY

               The Warden crawls into a DARK CHAMBER and LIGHTS A TORCH.

               A mural wall comes alive. Embedded into it are dozens of 
               black amethyst SCARABS; glittering images of the sacred 
               beetles. Awestruck, the Warden pulls out a pocket knife and 
               starts prying away at one of the precious bugs.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Beni and the Americans hover around the Egyptologist, who's 
               found the SECRET COMPARTMENT inside Anubis. The Egyptologist 
               brushes sand away from the seam. Henderson steps forward and 
               grabs the seam, -- the Egyptologist quickly stops him.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         Seti was no fool.

               Henderson sees the intense look in the Egyptologist's eyes

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, sure...

               He looks back at the native Diggers.

                                     HENDERSON
                         We'll let him open it.

               The Egyptologist nods, then YELLS IN EGYPTIAN at the Diggers.

               The Diggers hesitate, filled with fear. Daniels pulls out 
               his gun, aims it at three of the Diggers. The three Diggers 
               hesitantly step forward with crowbars and stick them into 
               the seams. The other Diggers back away, scared shitless.

               Beni and the Americans exchange looks, and then they back 
               away as well.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Three Heroes are still digging into the ceiling

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Lemme get this straight, they stuck 
                         a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, 
                         cut your brain into small pieces, 
                         then ripped it all out through your 
                         nostrils?

                                     JONATHAN
                         OWCH! That's really got to hurt.

                                     EVELYN
                         It's called mummification. You're 
                         dead when they do this

                                     JONATHAN
                         Still...

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.

                                     EVELYN
                         You two are worse than a couple of 
                         schoolboys.

               And that's when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly GIVES OUT.

               O'Connell GRABS Evelyn and JERKS her clear. Jonathan DIVES 
               for the far wall. A MASSIVE STONE CASEMENT DROPS OUT OF THE 
               CEILING AND CRASHES to the floor. DUST FLIES. Fills the room.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER

               Having heard the crash, Beni and the Americans have their 
               guns pointed at the floor. The Egyptologist could care less, 
               he looks at the Diggers, gripping their crowbars, and YELLS --

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         FENI!

               The three Diggers PULL HARD. The ancient seams start to give, 
               The Egyptologist YELLS again. The Diggers PULL HARDER. The 
               compartment starts to loosen. Again he YELLS. The Diggers 
               give one final pull and --

               -- AN INTENSE BURST OF LIQUID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM. HITS 
               THE THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They SCREAM.

               Dying horribly. HALF SKELETAL by the time they hit the 
               ground...

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               The dust is starting to clear. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan 
               slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement.

               We immediately recognize it as IMHOTEP'S SARCOPHAGUS.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks 
                         like a sarcophagus.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Why would they bury somebody in the 
                         ceiling?

                                     EVELYN
                         They didn't, they buried him at the 
                         foot of Anubis. He was either someone 
                         of great importance. Or he did 
                         something very naughty.

               INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY

               The warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch, then 
               greedily starts prying away at another. It rips off, he drops 
               it into his pouch, -- only he misses, and this scarab quietly 
               falls to the sandy floor without the Warden noticing.

               CLOSE ON: the scarab on the floor. It begins to TRANSFORM.

               The amethyst starts to glow. Something inside starts to 
               WIGGLE; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon.

               Then it splits open and a real live hideous SCARAB BEETLE 
               scurries out. It races over to the warden's shoe, quickly 
               burrows into the leather and vanishes inside.

               The Warden's eyes FLY OPEN. He starts to SCREAM, drops his 
               knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg, 
               higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a 
               large, hideous LUMP, BURROWING UNDER HIS SKIN. IT BURROWS 
               IT'S WAY UP HIS FAT BELLY AND ACROSS HIS HAIRY CHEST. The 
               Warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it. The 
               lump BURROWS UP HIS NECK. The Warden starts GAGGING and 
               COUGHING.

               And then the scarab-lump VANISHES INTO HIS HEAD.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Our Heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus, 
               revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph. Evelyn stares at it 
               Jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Well?... Who is it?

               Evelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned.

                                     EVELYN
                         'He that shall not be named.'

               O'Connell dusts off the huge LOCK

                                     O'CONNELL
                         There's some sort of lock here. You 
                         say these thing's are made of granite 
                         with a steel interior?

                                     EVELYN
                         Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting 
                         out.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No kiddin', without a key, it'll 
                         take us a month to crack this thing,

                                     EVELYN
                         A key! That's it! That's what he was 
                         talking about.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Who was talking about what?

               Evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on Jonathan's back.

                                     EVELYN
                         The man on the barge. The one with 
                         the hook, he was looking for a key.

               Evelyn pulls out the key/box. Jonathan tries to take it back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hey that's mine!

               Evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box, -- it's 
               now shaped exactly like the LOCK'S KEYHOLE. Evelyn smiles.

               And that's when they hear the Warden's SCREAMS echoing through 
               the labyrinth. All three of them turn and take-off running.

               INT. LABYRINTH - DAY

               The Warden is SCREAMING and dancing insanely around the 
               labyrinth, totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan run up just as the Warden 
               starts RIPPING his own hair out of his head. O'Connell and 
               Jonathan grab at the Warden's hands, but he's far too crazed, 
               he shoves them aside, runs full bore down the length of the 
               labyrinth and SLAMS his head straight into a rock wall. The 
               Warden drops to the ground. Dead as lead. Eyes wide open.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan just stand there staring, 
               breathing hard, wide-eyed themselves...

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               Evelyn and Jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire.

                                     EVELYN
                         What do you suppose killed him?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Did you ever see him eat?

               O'Connell comes up over some rocks.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Seems the Americans had a little 
                         misadventure of their own today, 
                         three of their diggers were killed.

                                     EVELYN
                         How?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. 
                         Some sort of ancient booby-trap.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Maybe this place really is cursed.

               A GUST OF WIND blows through the camp.

               The campfire FLICKERS O'Connell and Jonathan share a nervous 
               look. Evelyn laughs.

                                     EVELYN
                         You two!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You don't believe in curses, huh?

                                     EVELYN
                         No. I believe if I can see it and I 
                         can touch it, then it's real. That's 
                         what I believe.

               O'Connell cocks his rifle, KA-CHANK! Gives her a big grin.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I believe in being prepared.

               Jonathan opens the Warden's POUCH, the one that held the 
               scarabs. He reaches in, starts scrounging around. WE SLOWLY 
               PUSH IN. Waiting for the attack. THE MUSIC BUILDS. And then, --
               Jonathan SCREAMS in pain and RIPS his hand back out of the 
               pouch. O'Connell and Evelyn both jump.

                                     O'CONNELL/EVELYN
                         WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!

               Jonathan sucks his finger, then reaches back into the pouch 
               and pulls out a LIQUOR BOTTLE, the top has been chipped off.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Seagrams!

               Jonathan smiles at the bottle, then turns the pouch inside 
               out and shakes it, nothing but SAND is inside it.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Well, he may have been a stinky 
                         fellow,... but he had good taste.

               Jonathan takes a swig. O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, guiltily 
               And then O'Connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear 
               to the sand. Evelyn and Jonathan watch him. A BEAT. And then 
               a BARAGE OF GUNFIRE IS HEARD coming from the American camp.

               O'Connell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Stay here!

               He takes off running through the ruins. Evelyn immediately 
               gets up and runs after him. Jonathan grabs a gun, holds the 
               bottle of Seagrams; tight and dashes after her.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Evy! Excuse me! But didn't the man 
                         just say -- !

               EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - NIGHT

               The American camp is under siege. Two dozen MUMIA RIDERS 
               gallop through. FIRING RIFLES. Several Diggers are killed as 
               they run. The Americans leap out of their tents FIRING. Kill 
               multiple Riders. Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps 
               SHOOTING. Henderson and Burns run to his aid, BLASTING AWAY.

               O'Connell races through the ruins and SLAMS right into Beni, 
               who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Goin' somewhere?

                                     BENI
                         Just looking for you, O'Connell! I 
                         wanted to be with my friend!

               O'Connell drags him back towards the American camp.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon, friend.

                                     BENI
                              (struggling)
                         Why do you like to fight so much?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         'Cause I look good doin, it.

               Ardeth Ray gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down 
               with his scimitar. O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks, 
               LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to 
               the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point 
               blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Ray's hand. O'Connell 
               is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them.

               A scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off, 
               misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider 
               off his mount. The horse BOLTS. -- But Ardeth Ray is gone.

               Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly, 
               she hears something coming up behind her and spins around.

               A vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly 
               backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises 
               his scimitar, about to strike.

               Evelyn SCREAMS, trips over a rock and FIRES the elephant 
               gun, -- BLAM! Blows the Rider off his mount and CATAPULTS 
               him twenty feet back into some ruins.

               At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and 
               over a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand 
               dune.

               Jonathan and some Diggers are holding their own near the 
               temple door. Four Riders come CHARGING right at them.

               Jonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Let 'em have it, boys!

               Jonathan and the Diggers OPEN FIRE. When the smoke clears, 
               the Riders are either dead or gone. Jonathan grins.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, bloody good show.

               And then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land 
               behind them. Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around 
               and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat.

               O'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something 
               THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Ray 
               on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively raises 
               his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES!

               Hits his gun, -- CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed, 
               O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick 
               of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It 
               IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Ray, towering above him. The two 
               men lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Ray 
               points his scimitar at O'Connell's head.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         LEAVE THIS PLACE!... LEAVE THIS PLACE 
                         OR DIE!

               Ardeth Ray GALLOPS OFF. The remaining Mumia Riders race after 
               him, vanishing into the night. O'Connell watches them leave, 
               then turns to the burning fuse,... and blows it out. Evelyn 
               staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her 
               and holds her close.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You alright?

               Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes. It's the first time 
               he's shown genuine concern for her. And she likes it. He's 
               also holding her a little too close. And she likes that too.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes,... fine,... thank you.

               Beni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and 
               Burns help Daniels to his feet.

                                     DANIELS
                         See! That proves it! Old Seti's 
                         fortune's gotta be under this sand!

                                     HENDERSON
                         For them to protect it like this, 
                         you just know there's got to be 
                         treasure down there.

               O'Connell looks up into the surrounding ridges, unsatisfied.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         These men are a desert people. They 
                         value water, not gold.

               Evelyn looks at O'Connell, suddenly very worried.

                                     EVELYN
                         Where's Jonathan?

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               Jonathan falls into FRAME. Hits the ground. Eyes wide open.

               Mouth agape. Clearly dead. A BEAT. And then his eyes close 
               and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. Shit-faced drunk.

               O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves, 
               the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone. O'Connell offers the 
               bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly --

                                     EVELYN
                         Unlike my brother, sir, I know when 
                         to say no.

               O'Connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Unlike your brother, Miss, you I 
                         don't get. You're a whole new brew.

                                     EVELYN
                         I know, you're wondering, what's a 
                         place like me doing in a girl like 
                         this?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Something like that.

                                     EVELYN
                         Egypt is in my blood. My father was 
                         a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so 
                         much that he married an Egyptian. My 
                         mother! Who was quite an adventurer 
                         herself

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay, I get your father, I get your 
                         mother and I get your brother, but 
                         what are you doing here?

               Evelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet.

                                     EVELYN
                         I may not be an explorer, or an 
                         adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or 
                         a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But 
                         I'm proud of what I am.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And what is that?

               Evelyn plops back down beside him, really drunk, she grins 
               and proudly lifts her head high.

                                     EVELYN
                         ...I am a librarian!

               She leans in, very close to his face, looks him in the eyes,

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm going to kiss you, Mister 
                         O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No you're not.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm not?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Not unless you call me Rick.

                                     EVELYN
                         Why would I do that?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Because that's my name.

               She gives him a goofy smile. He leans forward and KISSES 
               HER. Evelyn's eyes slowly close. And then she passes out, 
               slumping into his arms. O'Connell looks down at her, and 
               just smiles.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Evelyn's HAND slips the KEY into the sarcophagus, lock and 
               turns it. A series of STRANGE MECHANICAL-LIKE SOUNDS are 
               heard, and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a GIANT HISS.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan all look very, very hungover.

               They start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus.

               PUSHING, SHOVING and GROANING, the lid budging, inch by inch.

                                     EVELYN
                         I can't believe I allowed the two of 
                         you to get me drunk.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Don't blame me, I don't even remember 
                         being there.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well neither do I, thank you.

               O'Connell gives her a hurt look.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You don't?

               Evelyn gives O'Connell a nervous look.

                                     EVELYN
                         No... Why?... Should I?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Gee, yeah, you told me it was the 
                         best time you ever had.

               O'Connell gives her a big cheesy smile. Evelyn's face drops, 
               appalled and embarrassed. And that's when the lid FALLS OFF 
               and LOUDLY CRASHES to the ground. All three of them instantly 
               grab their sore heads and MOAN.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Several fear-filled, sweaty-faced Diggers reach into the 
               secret compartment. Henderson and Burns hold guns on them.

               Daniels has his arm in a sling. The Diggers slowly pull out 
               the ORNATE CHEST. They set the chest down on the sandy floor.

               Beni watches as the Egyptologist translates the hieratics.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         There is a curse upon this chest.

                                     DANIELS
                         Curse my ass.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, who cares.

               The Egyptologist gives them the evil-eye

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         In these hallowed grounds, that which 
                         was set forth in ancient times, is 
                         as strong today, as it was then.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it --

               The Egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription:

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         "Death will come on swift wings to 
                         whomever opens this chest".

               A GUST OF WIND blows through the chamber. TORCHES FLICKER 
               All the Diggers suddenly turn tail and run off SCREAMING.

               The Americans look at each other, suddenly very nervous.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         It says, there is one, the undead, 
                         who if brought back to life, is bound 
                         by sacred law to consummate this 
                         curse.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, well, let's just make sure we 
                         don't bring anybody back from the 
                         dead then, huh?

               The three Americans laugh.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         He will kill all who open this 
                         chest,... and assimilate their organs 
                         and fluids.

                                     DANIELS
                         Assimilate their organs and fluids? 
                         Ya mean eat 'em?

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         And in so doing he will regenerate. 
                         And no longer be the undead, but a 
                         plague upon this earth.

               The WIND WHISTLES. Torches FLICKER. VERY SPOOKY. Beni and 
               the Egyptologist share a fear-filled look. Henderson just 
               shrugs.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Ah hell, let's open it anyways.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               WHAM! Imhotep's wooden coffin is DROPPED to the ground next 
               to his stone sarcophagus. Evelyn is very excited.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god, I've dreamed about this 
                         ever since I was a little girl.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You dream about dead guys?

               Evelyn just gives him a look, then starts brushing dirt and 
               cobwebs off the top of the coffin. Then she freezes.

                                     EVELYN
                         Look, all the sacred spells have 
                         been chiseled off. The hieratics and 
                         hieroglyphs that protect the deceased 
                         on his journey into the afterlife, 
                         they've been removed. This man was 
                         cursed,... doomed.

               O'Connell and Jonathan are too excited to care.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Tough break.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see 
                         who's inside, shall we?

               Evelyn can't believe these guys. Jonathan inserts the key/box 
               into the coffin's lock. Turns it. The lid cracks open with a 
               HISS. They all react to the FOUL STENCH. Then O'Connell grabs

               the lid. It's stuck. He pulls with all his might. Jonathan 
               helps him. It starts to give way. Slowly. Slowly. Slooooowly.

               And then it suddenly POPS OPEN and THE MOST HIDEOUS, MAGGOT 
               INFESTED, ROTTEN CORPSE IMAGINABLE JUMPS UP!

                                     O'CONNELL/EVELYN/JONATHAN
                         AHHHHH!!!

               They all jump back. Scared to death. Imhotep is now the 
               'Elephant Man' of corpses; twisted and deformed. The years 
               have not been kind. He slumps back into his coffin.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Henderson and Daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden 
               chest. Beni and the Egyptologist watch. In the background, 
               Beni starts backing away, filled with fear, sweating buckets.

                                     BENI
                         The curse,... beware the curse!

               Beni turns and bolts from the chamber. Daniels spits.

                                     DANIELS
                         Stupid superstitious bastard.

               And that's when the seal breaks, -- A BLACK VAPOR BLASTS OUT 
               OF THE CHEST. Everybody vanishes into the strange cloud.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly creep forward and 
               carefully look back inside Imhotep's coffin, creeped-out.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Is he supposed to look like that?

                                     EVELYN
                         No. I've never seen a mummy look 
                         like this. He's, he's still...

                                     JONATHAN
                         Juicy?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. He's more than four thousand 
                         years old and still decomposing.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And look at this.

               O'Connell points at the inside of the COFFIN LID, where there 
               are FINGERNAIL SCRATCHES and DRIED BLOOD all over the inside.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god, he was buried alive.

               This sends a chill through everyone. Evelyn leans in closer.

                                     EVELYN
                         And he left a message.

               WE PUSH IN on a grouping of hieratics WRITTEN IN BLOOD.

                                     EVELYN
                         It says: 'Death is only the 
                         beginning.'

               Jonathan shivers. O'Connell looks around.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Where's my gun?

                                     JONATHAN
                         What are you going to do? Shoot him?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         If he decides to wake up, hell yes!

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               The vapor is settling. The Americans have their guns aimed 
               at the chest. The Egyptologist slowly steps up, reaches 
               inside, and lifts out a heavy burlap bag. Everyone's eyes 
               widen in excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and 
               slowly pulls out the black BOOK OF THE DEAD, the same book 
               Imhotep used in his attempt to bring Anck-su-namun back to 
               life.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         I have heard told of this book, but 
                         I never truly believed it existed. 
                         This, good gentlemen, is a most 
                         priceless treasure.

               Henderson kicks the sandy floor in anger.

                                     HENDERSON
                         I wouldn't trade ya for a brass 
                         spittoon!

                                     DANIELS
                         Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta 
                         pure gold!

               Daniels kicks the chest. It breaks open, unfolding to reveal 
               a lower compartment. Inside, are Anck-su-namun's FIVE JEWEL 
               ENCRUSTED CANOPIC JARS (one is shattered and without jewels)

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               The two camps have now joined together. O'Connell and Beni 
               are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire. Jonathan 
               wrinkles his nose, disgusted by the smell.

                                     JONATHAN
                         What is this stuff? It smells like 
                         our late friend, the Warden.

               O'Connell and Beni both grin. Jonathan looks horrified.

                                     JONATHAN
                         You did not!?... We're not!?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Rat gizzards. They smell bad and 
                         taste worse, but that's the best the 
                         desert has to offer.

               The gloating Americans sit down, fondling their jeweled jars.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Say O'Connell, whadaya think these 
                         honey's'll fetch back home?

                                     BURNS
                         We hear you gentlemen found yerselves 
                         a nice gooey mummy. Congratulations.

                                     DANIELS
                         Ya know if ya dry him out, you can 
                         sell him for firewood.

               The Americans laugh. Evelyn walks up, sits down and drops a 
               pile of big dusty BUG SKELETONS onto the ground.

                                     EVELYN
                         Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found them 
                         inside our friend's coffin. They can 
                         stay alive for years living off the 
                         flesh of a corpse, or in this case...

               She shrugs, then looks at the roasting meat

                                     EVELYN
                         Famished.

               O'Connell and Jonathan stare at the bug skeletons, disgusted.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Are you saying somebody threw these 
                         things in with our guy, and they 
                         slowly ate him alive?

                                     EVELYN
                         Very slowly.

                                     JONATHAN
                         He certainly was not a popular fellow 
                         when they planted him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Must of got a little too frisky with 
                         the Pharaoh's daughter.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to my readings, our friend 
                         suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of 
                         all ancient Egyptian curses, one 
                         reserved for only the most evil 
                         blasphemers. In all of my research, 
                         I've never read of this curse actually 
                         having been performed.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That bad huh?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, they never used it because they 
                         feared it so. It's written, that if 
                         a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever 
                         arise, he would bring with him the 
                         ten plagues of Egypt.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The ten plagues?... You mean all ten 
                         plagues.

                                     BENI
                         Like what that Moses guy did to that 
                         Pharaoh guy?

                                     EVELYN
                         That's one way of putting it.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Let's see, there was frogs, flies, 
                         locusts...

                                     BURNS
                         Hail and fire.

                                     HENDERSON
                         The sun turning black.

                                     DANIELS
                         Water turning to blood.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And my personal favorite: people 
                         covered in boils and sores.

               All the men share nervous looks, really spooked. Evelyn just 
               laughs at them, then pulls a meat stick out of the fire.

                                     EVELYN
                         Fried gizzard anyone?

               EXT. CAMP - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Having just freshened up for bed, Evelyn exits the temple 
               and steps past the sleeping Diggers. She spots the 
               Egyptologist, his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm, 
               the Book Of The Dead laying loose under the other. Evelyn 
               stares at the Book, nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks 
               over, carefully steals it, and quickly tip-toes away.

               Lying on some blankets by the campfire, O'Connell rolls over 
               and sees Evelyn, sitting wide-eyed, staring at the Book.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You sure you outta be playin, around 
                         with that?

                                     EVELYN
                         It's just a book, no harm ever came 
                         from a book.

               Evelyn opens the cover. THE FIRE FLICKERS. She and O'Connell 
               share a nervous look, then Evelyn shrugs and starts reading.

                                     EVELYN
                         Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei.

               Evelyn continues READING THE BOOK ALOUD IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Evelyn's VOICE is OVERLAID as WE START WIDE on Imhotep's 
               chamber and SLOWLY PUSH IN on his sarcophagus. WE PUSH IN 
               over the lip of the coffin, then closer and closer towards 
               Imhotep's rotten, twisted head, until his putrid face fills 
               FRAME, -- and then suddenly his crusty eyelids Pop OPEN!

               Revealing EMPTY SOCKETS. -- BIG SCARY MUSIC STING.

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               The Egyptologist sits bolt upright. Quickly looks around, 
               sees Evelyn reading the Book. He gets up and runs for her.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         NO! NOOOO! YOU MUST NOT!

               He skids to a stop as a strange, piercing WHINE is heard, 
               coming from out in the desert. O'Connell and the others all 
               leap to their feet. The Americans run out of their tents.

               The SOUND gets LOUDER and CLOSER. And then from out of the 
               darkness a HUGE WALL OF LOCUSTS SWIRLS into camp and envelops 
               everyone. O'Connell grabs Evelyn, and with Jonathan at their 
               side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid 
               vermin as they go. Beni and the Americans run for the temple.

               The Egyptologist is covered in locusts. He stares at The 
               Book Of The Dead, looking haunted.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         What have we done?

               The campfire is SUCKED UP INTO THE AIR

               INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race down the labyrinth, 
               slapping at themselves and picking locusts out of their hair

                                     JONATHAN
                         Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! 
                         Billions of grasshoppers!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That's one of the plagues, right? 
                         The grasshopper plague!

                                     EVELYN
                         This is not a plague. It's 
                         generational. Every so many years 
                         the locusts of Egypt have a population 
                         explosion and they all take flight.

               Evelyn steps forward, something SQUISHES. O'Connell lowers 
               his TORCH, -- the entire floor is FILLED WITH SLIMY FROGS.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay,... and what about frogs?

               INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

               The Americans, Beni and the Diggers race into a passageway.

               Burns is knocked down, his bifocals skitter across the ground, 
               they get CRUSHED in the stampede. Burns staggers to his feet, 
               squinting. BLURRY FIGURES vanish into the darkness,

                                     BURNS
                         Daniels! Henderson!

               INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               The ground under O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan starts to 
               SHAKE. Then suddenly, right in front of them, -- HUNDREDS OF 
               CHITTERING SCARAB BEETLES BOIL UP OUT OF THE SAND. Start 
               scurrying towards them. Evelyn SCREAMS. Jonathan SCREAMS.

               Even O'Connell almost screams. They turn around and haul 
               ass.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

               Burns staggers down a passageway, squinting, his hands out 
               in front of him, groping, trying not to bump into anything.

               Then ten feet in front of him, a dark, blurry FIGURE steps 
               out.

                                     BURNS
                         Daniels?... is that you?

               Burns half-blindly staggers forward. The Figure doesn't move.

                                     BURNS
                         Henderson?

               Burns TRIPS, stumbles forward, towards the Figure, his hands 
               reach out and SINK INTO IMHOTEP'S PUTRID CHEST CAVITY. Burns 
               jumps like a scalded cat, pulls his hands out and looks at 
               them, -- HIS HANDS ARE COVERED IN MOLTEN FLESH ROT. He starts 
               to SCREAM. A SKELETAL HAND clamps over his mouth.

               LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race up the staircase, just 
               ahead of the mass of SCURRYING, CHITTERING SCARABS.

               O'Connell leaps out onto a pedestal. Jonathan jumps up next 
               to him. Evelyn jumps up into a grotto on the other side of 
               the narrow stairway. The horrible herd of vicious scarabs 
               scurries between them, their ear-piercing CHITTERS send 
               shivers up Evelyn's spine. She leans back. THE WALL MOVES.

               Evelyn falls backwards through an opening. O'Connell and 
               Jonathan watch the scarabs vanish up the staircase. Then 
               they look across the way. Evelyn is gone.

                                     JONATHAN
                         EVY!?

               SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Evelyn sits up, shakes the sand out of her hair, fearfully 
               looks around. It's almost PITCH BLACK. She gets up and feels 
               her way along the dark walls. She rounds a corner. A shaft 
               of MOONLIGHT filters in through a crack in the ceiling. A 
               MAN stands in the middle of the room. Evelyn walks towards 
               him.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh thank goodness, you're one of the 
                         Americans, aren't you?

               Just as she reaches him he turns around. It's Burns. BOTH OF 
               HIS EYES ARE MISSING. He stares at her with vacant sockets.

               Evelyn SCREAMS in horror and backs away, hyperventilating, 
               she bumps into something. She SCREAMS again and spins around 
               It's Imhotep. With two fresh EYEBALLS in his sockets.

               Evelyn SCREAMS again and backs away into a wall. Her hair is 
               down, her face is dirty and sweaty, her blouse is ripped, 
               her dress is torn, she's never looked sexier. Imhotep SQUINTS.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Anck-su-namun?

               LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT

               O'Connell is feeling his way around inside the grotto

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Damn-it! Must be a trap door around 
                         here or somethin'.

               And then they heat MEN SCREAMING, and suddenly, Henderson, 
               Daniels and one of the Diggers come running down the stairs.

                                     HENDERSON
                         RUN, YOU SONS-A-BITCHES! RUUUUN!

               O'Connell and Jonathan join them as they hear the herd of 
               CHITTERING scarabs coming their way. The Digger suddenly 
               trips and falls. O'Connell slows down, about to go back and 
               help him. But it's too late. The Digger SCREAMS in horror as 
               the herd of scarabs run over him, eating straight through 
               him, leaving behind the Digger's half eaten skeleton. Daniels 
               Henderson and Jonathan react in horror. O'Connell's already 
               running, races right past them. The others turn and haul 
               ass.

               SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Imhotep steps forward, -- the sand around him seems to 
               MAGNETIZE, swirling and dancing around his flaking skeletal 
               legs. Evelyn starts backing away, horrified, looks at Burns

                                     EVELYN
                         Help me,... please,... help me.

               Burns opens his mouth, but can only GURGLE and MOAN because 
               HIS TONGUE IS MISSING. Imhotep grabs him, throws him to the 
               ground and sets his skeletal foot on Burns' chest, like a 
               big game hunter standing on his kill. Imhotep then parts his 
               fetid lips, -- A FRESH TONGUE FLAPS BETWEEN HIS ROTTED TEETH.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun!

               Evelyn shivers in fear. Suddenly, O'Connell comes flying 
               around the corner and runs right up to her.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Would you quit playin, around! Let's 
                         get outta here already!

               O'Connell sees the look in her eyes and turns around, -- at 
               the sight of Imhotep, O'Connell jumps back in fright.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         WHOA!

               O'Connell and Evelyn start backing away down the wall.

               Imhotep glides sideways with them, like a tiger cornering 
               his prey, the sand around him SWIRLS and DANCES. Burns starts 
               to crawl away, whimpering as he goes. Imhotep suddenly stops 
               and UNHINGES his skeletal jaw, his skinless mouth stretches 
               to an inhuman size, and he lets out a horrific, primordial 
               SHRIEK.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!

               Evelyn SCREAMS. O'Connell shudders, then, embarrassed by his 
               fear, he opens his own mouth and ROARS right back at him --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Ahhhhhhhh!!

               Then BLASTS him with the elephant gun, --BLAM! Through the 
               SMOKE AND FLAMMAGE we see Imhotep blown off his feet, his 
               ribcage half torn away. O'Connell grabs Evelyn and runs.

               EXT. CREVICE - NIGHT

               SAND and WIND whip through the ruins as O'Connell and Evelyn 
               stumble up out of the crevice and COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH TEN 
               ARMED MUMIA. The Mumia quickly raise their guns. O'Connell 
               and Evelyn quickly raise their hands. Jonathan, Henderson, 
               Daniels and the Egyptologist are already on their knees, 
               hands over their heads. Ardeth Ray steps forward.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         I told you to leave or die, you 
                         refused, and now you may have killed 
                         us all. For you have unleashed the 
                         creature that we have feared for 
                         more than four thousand years.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Relax, I got him.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         No mortal weapons can kill this 
                         creature. He is not of this world.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Are we talkin, about the same 
                         creature? The walking corpse? Really 
                         big mouth? Really bad breath?

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Beni slowly backs up around Anubis, eyes wide, gun up. He 
               turns around, -- IMHOTEP IS RIGHT THERE! Beni SCREAMS, backs 
               away and OPENS FIRE. Six GUNSHOTS perforate Imhotep, but 
               have no effect except to SPLATTER molten flesh rot onto the 
               back wall. Beni retreats into a corner, scared shitless.

               Imhotep moves forward, his one hand trying to stop the molten 
               mummy guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his 
               side. Beni drops his gun and grabs at the CHAINS around his 
               neck, RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS AND ICONS dangle from each chain.

               Beni holds the first one up: A CHRISTIAN CRUCIFIX. He quickly 
               makes the sign of-the cross and blesses himself in English:

                                     BENI
                         May the good Lord protect and watch 
                         over me as a shepherd watches over 
                         his flock. And may Satan in all his 
                         forms be vanquished forever.

               It has no effect on Imhotep, who continues forward. Beni 
               quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons, holding them 
               out towards Imhotep, one after the other, trying to slow his 
               progress: an Islamic Sword and Crescent Moon necklace; a 
               Hindu Brahma medallion; a small Buddhist Bodhisattva statue.

               All while blessing himself in Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and 
               Latin. Nothing works. Imhotep's skeletal hand reaches for 
               Beni's throat. Tears run down Beni's cheeks he's so freaked.

               And that's when he holds up THE STAR OF DAVID and blesses 
               himself in HEBREW. Imhotep stops in his tracks. His hand 
               lowers. His grotesque new eyeballs stare at Beni.

                                     IMHOTEP
                              (subtitled)
                         The language of the slaves.

               Looks at him quizzically. Imhotep takes a step back.

                                     IMHOTEP
                              (in Hebrew -- subtitled)
                         I may have use for you. And the 
                         rewards will be great.

               Imhotep reaches into his tattered robe, and then holds out 
               his fetid hand, filled with squirming MAGGOTS. Beni cringes, 
               about to throw up, but then the maggots part, -- revealing a 
               tiny pile of little JEWELS. Beni's eyes widen. Imhotep raises 
               his other hand, it holds Anck-su-namun's BROKEN CANOPIC JAR.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Where are the other sacred jars?

               EXT. CREVICE - NIGHT

               Several Mumia drag Burns up, he stares out with vacant 
               sockets. Daniels and Henderson are especially horrified.

                                     DANIELS
                         You bastards!

                                     HENDERSON
                         What did you do to him!?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         We saved him! Saved him before the 
                         creature could finish his work. Now 
                         leave, all of you, quickly, before 
                         he finishes you all.

                                     JONATHAN
                         You're not going to kill us?

               Evelyn ELBOWS Jonathan in the ribs.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         We must now hunt him down, and try 
                         and find a way to kill him, before 
                         he consumes the earth. Allah be with 
                         us.

               Ardeth Ray and the Mumia start heading down into the crevice.

               O'Connell yells at them, trying to convince himself.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I told ya, I already got him!

               Ardeth Ray stops and looks back, deadly serious.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Know this, the creature will be coming 
                         for you. He must consummate the curse. 
                         And until he does, he will never 
                         eat, he will never sleep, and he 
                         will never stop.

               Ardeth Ray turns and jumps down into the crevice,

               EXT. RUINS - NIGHT

               O'Connell and Jonathan boost Evelyn up onto a camel. Daniels 
               and Henderson throw Burns up onto another. The Egyptologist, 
               still clutching The Book Of The Dead, gets up on yet another.

               They all head off into the dark, windblown desert...

               And then in the extreme foreground, A SKELETAL HAND SUDDENLY 
               PUNCHES UP OUT OF THE SAND, ACCOMPANIED BY THE MOST HORRIFIC, 
               PRIMORDIAL SHRIEK IMAGINABLE --

                                     IMHOTEP
                         ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!

               EXT. BRITISH FORT - CAIRO - DAY

               A British flag flies over BRITISH SOLDIERS manning the front 
               gate. Our tired, disheveled Heroes saunter up on their dusty 
               camels. The Soldiers check their papers, then let them enter.

               INT. EVELYN'S QUARTERS - DAY

               A steamer trunk is slammed to the floor and thrown open.

               O'Connell chucks a load of DRESSES into the trunk.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I thought you didn't believe in this 
                         stuff!?

               O'Connell heads for the closet. Evelyn UNPACKS the dresses

                                     EVELYN
                         Having an encounter with a four 
                         thousand year old walking-talking 
                         corpse tends to convert one.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Forget it, we're out the door down 
                         the hall and gone.

                                     EVELYN
                         No, we are not.

               O'Connell throws a handful of her underthings into the trunk.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh yes we are.

               O'Connell continues to PACK Evelyn's clothes as she continues 
               to UNPACK them:

                                     EVELYN
                         No we are not. We woke him up, and 
                         we must try and stop him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We?! What we?! You didn't read that 
                         book. I told you not to play around 
                         with that thing.

                                     EVELYN
                         Alright then, Me, I,... I read the 
                         book, I woke him up and I intend to 
                         stop him.

               O'Connell angrily stretches a bra between his hands.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         How!? You heard the man, no mortal 
                         weapons can kill this guy.

               Evelyn grabs the bra and throws it into a drawer.

                                     EVELYN
                         Then we'll have to find some immortal 
                         ones.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         There goes that belief again. Not 
                         me, I am outta here!

               O'Connell stuffs a pile of Evelyn's shoes into the trunk.

               Evelyn KICKS the lid shut, slamming it on his fingers.

               O'Connell YELPS and angrily storms around the room sucking 
               his fingers as Evelyn follows him.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to that Book, once this 
                         creature has been reborn, his curse 
                         will spread, and as he grows in 
                         strength, so will his curse grow, 
                         infecting the people until the whole 
                         of the earth is destroyed.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah? So? Is that my problem?

                                     EVELYN
                              (incredulous)
                         It's everybody's problem!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Look lady, I appreciate you saving 
                         my life and all, but when I signed 
                         on, I agreed to take you out there 
                         and bring you back, and I did, now 
                         were even, end of job, end of story, 
                         contract terminated.

                                     EVELYN
                         That's what I am to you? A contract?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You can either tag along with me, or 
                         you can stay here and play around 
                         with Mister Maggot.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm staying.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FINE.

               O'Connell storms out and SLAMS the door. A BEAT. Then the 
               door opens and O'Connell's hand reaches back in and throws a 
               handful of frilly panties to the floor. SLAM goes the door.

               EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY

               O'Connell angrily strides through the compound. He sees Beni 
               coming up the path with a MAN dressed in hooded robes, his 
               face covered by an ornate death mask. Imhotep disguised.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Beni ya little stinkweed, where did 
                         you slink off to?

                                     BENI
                         You left me! You left me in the desert 
                         to rot.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.
                              (gestures to Imhotep)
                         So who's this guy?

                                     BENI
                         This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest 
                         of Osiris.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh, hey, how ya doin'?

               O'Connell sticks out his hand, -- Imhotep instantly recoils 
               O'Connell gives him the once-over. Beni quickly covers.

                                     BENI
                         The Prince does not like to be touched 
                         by other humans. A Silly eastern 
                         superstition, I'm afraid.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, well, we all got our little 
                         problems today don't we?

                                     BENI
                         He has come to help Mister Burns. 
                         Somehow I feel responsible.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't gimme that, you never had any 
                         scruples.

                                     BENI
                         Do you know where I can steal some?

               O'Connell fake-punches him. Beni flinches. O'Connell gives 
               Imhotep a look as he strides off.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         See ya around, Padre.

               Imhotep's grotesque new eyes glare out from behind the mask.

               INT. CASBAH - DAY

               The proverbial den-of-iniquity. Hard men, hard women and 
               hard liquor. Lots of deals going down. An OLDER GUY with a 
               walrus mustache is drunk and talking to some tough customers.

               He wears British WWI fighter pilot gear. Meet WINSTON HAVLOCK.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'm the last of the Royal Force still 
                         stationed here, you know? All the 
                         other laddies died in the air and 
                         were buried in the sand.

               The tough customers shove him away. Winston staggers over to 
               O'Connell and Jonathan at the bar, not missing a beat.

                                     WINSTON
                         Ever since the end of the Great War, 
                         there hasn't been a single challenge 
                         worthy of a man like me.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I've heard it before, Winston.

               O'Connell shoves him away. Winston staggers back to Jonathan.

                                     WINSTON
                         I just wish I would've chucked it 
                         with the other laddies, gone down in 
                         a flame of glory, instead of sitting 
                         around here, rotting from boredom 
                         and booze!

               Jonathan shoves him towards another group of unlucky sods 
               Henderson and Daniels sidle up to the bar next to them.

               Burns, now tongue-less, talks with a severe impediment.

                                     BURNS
                         The drawer there, spectacles.
                              (tries to laugh)
                         As you see, I won't be needing them.

               Imhotep opens the drawer and pulls out some bifocals. He 
               puts the bifocals on over his death mask, -- and grins 
               broadly, his rotted teeth showing through the mouth hole.

                                     BENI
                         Mister Burns, Prince Imhotep thanks 
                         you for your spectacles, -- and for 
                         your eyes,... and for your tongue.

               The expression on Burns' face starts to change, very puzzled.

                                     BENI
                         But I am afraid more is needed, the 
                         Prince says he must finish the job, 
                         consummate the curse which you and 
                         your friends have brought down upon 
                         yourselves.

               A look of pure fear registers on Burns, face. Beni quickly 
               backs away and runs out of the room. Imhotep picks up the 
               sacred canopic jar, then removes the death mask, revealing 
               his hideous, shattered CORPSE-SKULL.

               INT. CASBAH - DAY

               Three shot glasses clink together. O'Connell, Jonathan and 
               Henderson slug 'em down, -- all three of them instantly SPIT 
               OUT the liquid. Half the bar SPITS OUT their drinks as well.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Sweet Jesus! That tasted just like,... 
                         like...

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Blood.

               They all look at each other, even more nervous.

                                     JONATHAN
                         "And the rivers and waters of Egypt 
                         went red and were as blood."

               A look passes over O'Connell's face, a realization.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         He's here.

               He suddenly jumps away from the bar and runs for the door.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Who's here!?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!

               EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY

               LIGHTNING FLASHES as O'Connell races across the compound, 
               knocking several Soldiers out of his way, panic stricken.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!!

               EXT. BRITISH FORT COURTYARD - DAY

               Evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of 
               books. A BLAST OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING scares her. She drops 
               half the books. Then a HAND GRABS HER! She jumps again and 
               drops the rest of the books. It's O'Connell, breathing hard.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We got problems.

               And that's when a barrage of HAIL AND FIRE slams into the 
               courtyard. O'Connell and Evelyn jump back. A water fountain 
               bursts into STEAM. A wooden trellis catches FIRE. O'Connell 
               and Evelyn run under the eaves as SOLDIERS, SERVANTS and 
               CAMELS run in every direction, trying to avoid the maelstrom.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         He's here! I saw him! That thing is 
                         here!

                                     EVELYN
                         The creature!? Are you sure!?

               O'Connell gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the 
               HAIL and FIRE.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Pretty sure!

               The HAIL and FIRE come to a stop. Everything goes dead quiet.

               O'Connell and Evelyn freeze. And then a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM 
               is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them.

               O'Connell and Evelyn race up the stairs.

               INT. BURNS' QUARTERS - DAY

               O'Connell and Evelyn race into the room, past the Servant 
               who is running out SCREAMING. They skid to a stop as they 
               spot Burns, or what's left of him, lying dead on the floor, -- 
               HIS BODY IS SHRIVELED TO HALF IT'S SIZE.

               Drained of all organs and liquids. O'Connell and Evelyn are 
               shocked. Then they hear a LOUD MOAN and notice Imhotep 
               standing on the far side of the room. O'Connell draws his 
               gun.

               Imhotep is REGENERATING: A thick skin FORMS over powerful 
               new musculature. His tendons RIPPLE. His bones BULGE and 
               REFORM. His mouth opens to an inhuman size as he MOANS and 
               CRIES OUT, in severe pain. And then it's over. And he looks 
               like an incredibly muscular, corpse-like vision from hell.

               The 'Terminator' Mummy. O'Connell and Evelyn are stunned.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We are in serious trouble.

               Imhotep starts to move towards them, staring at Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Back off, creep.

               Imhotep keeps coming. O'Connell OPENS FIRE. BLASTING Imhotep 
               Bullets RIP through his body. Imhotep doesn't seem to mind.

               Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels run into the room. They're 
               all stunned at the sight of Imhotep.

               O'Connell steps forward, throws a RIGHT HOOK, punches Imhotep 
               in the face, -- HIS FIST GOES THROUGH IMHOTEP'S SKULL AND 
               GETS STUCK DEEP INSIDE HIS HEAD. O'Connell stares at it, 
               shocked, then quickly YANKS his fist back out. The area of 
               Imhotep's face that came into contact with O'Connell's fist 
               quickly DEGENERATES and DECAYS, right down to the bone, as 
               if O'Connell's hand instantly infected it.

               Imhotep angrily turns, grabs O'Connell, and with no effort, 
               THROWS him across the room and into Jonathan and the others 
               knocking them down. Imhotep looks at his hand, the one that 
               just grabbed O'Connell, -- IT STARTS TO SHRIVEL and DECAY.

               He quickly turns to Evelyn. Evelyn backs away into a wall, 
               terrorized. Imhotep steps up to her.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         You saved me from the undead. For 
                         this, I shall make you immortal.

               He leans in, about to kiss her with his decayed face.

               And that's when a WHITE CAT jumps onto the piano, HISSING.

               Imhotep SHRIEKS. The balcony doors BLOW OPEN. Imhotep spins 
               into a BLAST OF WIND AND SAND and SWIRLS out the doors. Gone.

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and Daniels stand transfixed.

               Henderson kneels next to Burns, shriveled body, horrified.

                                     HENDERSON
                         The curse. The curse.

               INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY

               O'Connell, Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels follow Evelyn 
               across the Ramesseum.

                                     EVELYN
                         There's only one person I know who 
                         can possibly give us some answers.

               They round a corner and come upon the Curator, -- who is 
               talking with Ardeth Ray. Everybody stops.

                                     EVERYBODY
                         YOU!

               O'Connell and the American's quickly draw their guns. Ardeth 
               Ray just scowls. The Curator nods his head.

                                     CURATOR
                         Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.

                                     EVELYN
                         What is he doing here?

                                     CURATOR
                         Do you truly wish to know? Or would 
                         you prefer to just shoot us?

               Everybody tenses, guns up. Then O'Connell uncocks his .38.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I just saw my fist vanish into some 
                         guy's head.

               He slides his gun back into his shoulder-holster.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I'm willin, to go on a little faith, 
                         here.

                                     CURATOR
                         You will not believe it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Try me.

               INT. RAMESSEUM - MOMENTS LATER

               Everyone is assembled around the tomb display of Seti The 
               First.

               We recognize his chariot and sword. The Curator sits on Seti's 
               throne.

                                     CURATOR
                         We are part of an ancient secret 
                         society, the cult-of-the-Mumia, and 
                         we have a sacred mission, passed 
                         down through thirty-nine generations. 
                         For over four thousand years we have 
                         guarded The City Of The Dead. we are 
                         sworn at manhood to do any and all 
                         in our power to stop the High Priest 
                         Imhotep from being reborn into this 
                         world.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         And because of you, we have failed.

                                     EVELYN
                              (appalled)
                         And you think this justifies killing 
                         innocent people!?

                                     CURATOR
                         To have stopped this creature? Yes!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's 
                         afraid of cats, what's that about?

                                     CURATOR
                         According to the ancients, cat's are 
                         the guardians at the gates of the 
                         underworld. Imhotep will fear them 
                         until he is fully regenerated, and 
                         then he will fear nothing.

               Daniels is totally wigged-out, he looks at O'Connell.

                                     DANIELS
                         Right! And ya know how he gets fully 
                         regenerated?! By killing everybody 
                         who opened that chest and sucking us 
                         dry! That's how!

                                     CURATOR
                         Yes, the creature must first try and 
                         regenerate, and then he will attempt 
                         to resurrect the one he has loved 
                         for more than four thousand years.

                                     EVELYN
                         Anck-su-namun.

               The Curator and Ardeth Ray look at Evelyn, thunderstruck.

                                     EVELYN
                         In the necropolis, when I saw him, -
                         alive,... walking, he called me Anck-
                         su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' 
                         quarters he tried to kiss me.

                                     CURATOR
                         It is because it was you who read 
                         from the Book. He has chosen you to 
                         be the human sacrifice needed to 
                         regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.

               Jonathan scratches his ear with the barrel of his pistol.

                                     JONATHAN
                         This is not good. Not good at all.

               Ardeth Ray has been staring out a wall of windows.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Tonight is the full moon. The moon 
                         of Osiris. It will begin tonight.

               Everyone follows Ardeth Ray's eyes, through the windows we 
               can see the SUN, -- which is now going into a FULL ECLIPSE.

                                     JONATHAN
                         "...and he stretched forth his hands 
                         towards the heavens, and there was 
                         darkness throughout the land of 
                         Egypt."

               EXT. BRITISH FORT - WINDOW - DAY FOR NIGHT

               O'Connell looks out a window at the British Soldiers manning 
               the walls. Above and beyond them, -- is the BLACK SUN.

               EXT. EVELYN'S FOYER - DAY FOR NIGHT

               Evelyn and Jonathan are pacing the foyer

                                     EVELYN
                         We must stop him from regenerating.

               She turns to Daniels and Henderson.

                                     EVELYN
                         Who opened that chest?

                                     HENDERSON
                         Well, there was me and Daniels here 
                         and then poor Burns of course, oh 
                         yeah, and that Egyptologist fella.

               O'Connell turns from the window.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What about my buddy, Beni?

                                     DANIELS
                         Naw, he scrammed outta there,

                                     EVELYN
                         We must find the Egyptologist and 
                         bring him back here to the safety of 
                         the fort, before the creature can 
                         get to him.

               O'Connell looks at Evelyn, Daniels and Henderson.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay,... Evelyn, you wait here, you 
                         two come with me.

               All three of them pounce on him at once --

                                     HENDERSON
                         The hell with that! I'm not goin' 
                         nowhere! We're safe here.

                                     DANIELS
                         Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for 
                         nothin'.

                                     EVELYN
                         Who put you in charge? You can't 
                         just leave me behind like some old 
                         suitcase. I'm the one responsible 
                         for this mess and I intend to be the 
                         one to clean it up.

               O'Connell just shakes his head and SIGHS. Totally put-upon.

               Then he takes Evelyn, shoves her into the bedroom, slams the 
               door and locks it with a skeleton key. From inside her room 
               we can hear Evelyn POUNDING on the door and YELLING.

               O'Connell throws the skeleton key to Daniels.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Keep an eye on her. If you leave her 
                         door, I'll rip your spleen out. C'mon, 
                         Jonathan.

               Jonathan swallows hard and points to himself.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Me?

               CAIRO ALLEYWAYS - BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT

               The Egyptologist stumbles through the dark alleys, looking 
               haunted. He clutches the Book of The Dead in one hand and 
               his SACRED CANOPIC JAR in the other. Imhotep is stalking 
               him. A STREET VENDOR turns and sees Imhotep's horribly decayed 
               face.

               He reacts and scurries away. Imhotep lifts his robe, covers 
               his face, and moves in on the Egyptologist, who is heading 
               into the bazaar. WE PAN UP TO --

               THE EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT

               Beni is RANSACKING the joint, pulling out drawers and files 
               and throwing them on the floor. He finds a silver pocket 
               watch, shakes it, then throws it into his pocket, then he 
               starts tipping over bookcases and clearing shelves.

                                     O'CONNELL (O.S.)
                         Well, well, well.

               Beni spins around. O'Connell and Jonathan stand in the door.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Lemme guess, spring cleaning?

               Beni turns and runs for an open window. O'Connell grabs a 
               chair, FLINGS IT into his path. Beni TRIPS and CRASHES into 
               a wall. O'Connell strides over, grabs him and lifts him up 
               the wall. Beni's feet dangle off the floor.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Where's your new friend?

                                     BENI
                         What friend? You're my only friend.

               O'Connell quickly slides his knife up under Beni's chin.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Then you got no excuse for living. 
                         What the hell you doin, being buddies 
                         with this creep, Beni? What's in it 
                         for you?

                                     BENI
                         It is better to be the right hand of 
                         the Devil,... than in his path. As 
                         long as I serve him, I am immune.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Immune from what?

                                     BENI
                         You shall see.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What are you looking for? Lie, and 
                         I'll slit your throat.

               O'Connell shoves the knife deeper into Beni's skin.

                                     BENI
                         The book! The black book they found 
                         at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. 
                         Said to me it would be worth it's 
                         weight in diamonds.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What does he want the book for?

                                     BENI
                              (shrugs)
                         Something about bringing his dead 
                         girly-friend back to life. He needs 
                         the book...
                              (looks at Jonathan)
                         And your sister.

               O'Connell looks at Jonathan. Beni seizes the moment and KNEES 
               O'Connell in the balls. O'Connell doubles over and collapses.

               Beni leaps out the window. Jonathan cringes.

                                     JONATHAN
                         That looked rather painful.

                                     O'CONNELL
                              (wincing)
                         Ya know, ever since I met you, my 
                         luck has been for crap.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, I know, I do that to people.

               And that's when they hear a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM coming 
               from down in the bazaar. O'Connell and Jonathan scramble to 
               the window and look out --

               EXT. BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT

               Down in the bazaar, people are SCREAMING and quickly backing 
               away from the SHRIVELED CORPSE OF THE EGYPTOLOGIST.

               A partially decayed HAND reaches down and takes the sacred 
               canopic jar out of the Egyptologist's shriveled hand. It's 
               Imhotep, having regenerated even further. He looks up and 
               catches eyes with O'Connell. Imhotep grins, then UNHINGES; 
               his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a 
               huge SWARM OF FLIES comes out of his mouth and races straight 
               up at O'Connell and Jonathan. They both SLAM the shutters.

               The flies SLAM into the closed window and immediately spread 
               throughout the bazaar. Sending people SCREAMING and running.

               EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT

               O'Connell and Jonathan look at each other, panicked.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Damn-it! That's two down and only 
                         two to go.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And then he'll be coming after Evy.

               They turn and race out of the office.

               BRITISH FORT - WINDOW --NIGHT

               Daniels stares out a window, watching the British Guards at 
               the front gate. More Soldiers march the encircling parapet.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Ten o'clock! All is well!

               The lights and MUSIC from the Casbah come up from below

               INT. EVELYN'S FOYER - NIGHT

               Daniels turns from the window. Henderson sits in a chair 
               next to Evelyn's door, chain smoking. Both look wired with 
               fear.

                                     DANIELS
                         The hell with this. I'm goin, 
                         downstairs to get me a drink. You 
                         want somethin'?

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a 
                         shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.

               Daniels nods and heads out. Henderson just sits there, alone, 
               smoking. He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out his 
               SACRED CANOPIC JAR and fondles it. A BREEZE suddenly comes 
               in through the open window. The curtains flutter. Henderson 
               gets up and goes over to shut it. He looks out the window.

               The CAMERA races over the compound, into the window and HITS 
               Henderson square in the FACE just as he's about to scream.

               Henderson is lifted into the air by a mass of SWIRLING SAND.

               His body TWISTS and TURNS and slowly SHRIVELS as the life is 
               SUCKED out of him.

               Then he COLLAPSES to the floor. On the wall above him, the 
               SHADOW of the SWIRLING SAND condenses, forming a SHADOW of a 
               human body. The SHADOW CONVULSES as the body REGENERATES.

               And then it's over.

               Imhotep steps into view. He's regenerated even further and 
               looks almost normal now, his face no longer decayed. He steps 
               over Henderson's shriveled body and up to Evelyn's door, 
               rattles the knob. It's locked. Imhotep grins.

               EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Evelyn is asleep in her bed as SAND begins streaming in 
               through the keyhole, pouring onto the floor, forming a large 
               mound. Evelyn starts to toss and turn. WE PAN BACK OVER TO 
               THE DOOR: The mound of sand is gone and in it's place is 
               Imhotep.

               INT. FOYER - NIGHT

               O'Connell and Jonathan race into the foyer and skid to a 
               stop as they see Henderson's shriveled body on the floor.

               O'Connell runs up to Evelyn's door and rattles the knob, 
               still locked. He bends down and looks in through the KEYHOLE.

               EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Imhotep leans down towards Evelyn, about to kiss her as she 
               sleeps. The door starts to CRASH and BANG from O'Connell.

               Imhotep ignores it. And KISSES Evelyn. His lips and mouth 
               instantly start to DEGENERATE and DECAY. Right down to the 
               bone. The door BURSTS OPEN. Evelyn wakes up. Sees Imhotep's 
               rotted mouth kissing her. She SCREAMS and shoves him away.

               Imhotep's putrid mouth grimaces in sadness.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Get your hands off my girl, pal.

               Imhotep's sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces 
               O'Connell. Imhotep licks his fetid lips. O'Connell smirks.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Nice lips.

               Imhotep starts to move for O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I figured you might be here, so I 
                         brought a friend.

               He throws the white cat at Imhotep. Imhotep instinctively 
               catches it.

               He SHRIEKS, drops the cat and stumbles back towards the 
               window, -- which suddenly BLOWS OPEN. Imhotep spins like a 
               dervish and BURSTS INTO A WHIRLWIND OF SAND.

               Everybody covers their eyes. The Imhotep/sand-devil EXPLODES 
               out the window and vanishes over the compound.

               Jonathan aims his gun at the window, his hand shaking badly.

               O'Connell hugs Evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust.

               Daniels walks in, looks at Henderson's shriveled body on the 
               floor... and drops the martini glasses.

               INT. 1923 CONVERTIBLE DUSSENBERG - NIGHT

               Jonathan races his big convertible through the streets, 
               HONKING constantly. Evelyn sits between him and O'Connell, 
               looking scared and nervous, then she gives O'Connell a look.

                                     EVELYN
                         You called me your girl?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, 
                         you know, figure a speech.

                                     EVELYN
                         I think you were jealous

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see 
                         that guy's face?

               Daniels leans forward from the back seat, filled with fear,

                                     DANIELS
                         Shut-up! JUST SHUT-UP! We gotta do 
                         somethin'! we gotta do somethin, 
                         NOW! Before it's too late!

               They race into the driveway of the museum of Antiquities.

               EXT. CAIRO BAZAAR - NIGHT

               A FULL MOON now shines down on the bazaar, still bustling 
               with activity. Suddenly, a BREEZE kicks-in. GREEN MIST begins 
               to SWIRL down the street and through the stalls. The people 
               begin to CHOKE and COUGH and RETCH, as if being hit by a 
               severe sickness -- it's already too late.

               Imhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half rotted 
               off, his deformed mouth grinning happily. Beni is at his 
               side, looking very nervous.

               And then, one-by-one, the people silently begin to follow 
               Imhotep, their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous BOILS 
               AND SORES.

               INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - NIGHT

               O'Connell., Jonathan, Daniels, the Curator and Ardeth Ray 
               follow Evelyn as she strides through the museum.

                                     EVELYN
                         Last month I came across an 
                         inscription that mentioned The Book 
                         Of The Dead.

                                     DANIELS
                         That book we found at Hamunaptra?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. I dismissed it, because it talked 
                         about bringing people back from the 
                         dead. A notion I was unwilling to 
                         believe.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Believe it, sister. That's what 
                         brought our buddy back to life.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And now he's going to use it to bring 
                         his girlfriend back

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         And if he succeeds, the two of them 
                         together will bring about the 
                         apocalypse.

               The Curator joins Evelyn at her side as she heads up the 
               stairs, everyone else in hot pursuit.

                                     THE CURATOR
                         The plagues we have seen so far, are 
                         merely Imhotep flexing his muscles. 
                         Only at the moment of Anck-su-namun's 
                         resurrection will he be truly 
                         invincible.

               They reach the display cases. Evelyn quickly opens them.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm thinking that if the black Book 
                         Of The Dead can bring people back to 
                         life --

                                     CURATOR
                         -- then perhaps, the golden Book Of 
                         The Living can return them to the 
                         underworld.

                                     EVELYN
                         Exactly --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So your sayin', if we find the book 
                         made outta gold --

                                     CURATOR
                         -- And read the sacred incantations 
                         contained inside it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You think it'll send this guy back 
                         to hell?

                                     CURATOR
                         Correct, And that's when --

               LOUD CHANTING is heard coming from outside. They all rush 
               over to the upper windows and look down -- OUTSIDE: A large, 
               CRAZED MOB covered in hideous boils and sores comes CHANTING 
               up the driveway: 'Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!'

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         It has begun. The beginning of the 
                         end.

                                     EVELYN
                         Not quite yet it hasn't. C'mon.

               Evelyn dashes back to the display cases. Everyone follows.

               EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

               The crazed mob CRASHES into the huge front doors, which are 
               locked. They pound furiously, throwing themselves at it while 
               CHANTING CONSTANTLY. Imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway.

               INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - UPPER BALCONY - NIGHT

               The BANGING on the doors can be heard as Evelyn and the 
               Curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets.

               The others watch. Evelyn pulls out a large piece.

                                     EVELYN
                         Got it!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Got what?

               The BANGING gets LOUDER. Multiple windows SHATTER. Evelyn 
               talks while quickly translating the tablet:

                                     EVELYN
                         Since the black Book of The Dead was 
                         found inside the statue of Anubis, 
                         then according to this, the golden 
                         Book of The Living should be inside...

               Evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What?

                                     JONATHAN
                         What?

                                     DANIELS
                         WHAT!?

                                     EVELYN
                         The golden Book Of The Living, is 
                         inside the statue of Horus.

                                     CURATOR
                         Which would be located not far to 
                         the east of the Anubis statue.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't tell me we gotta go back out 
                         there?

                                     CURATOR
                         If we want to kill the creature, 
                         yes.

               TWO HIDEOUS BOIL & SORE-COVERED MEN charge out of a doorway, 
               SCREAMING. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray grab them and chuck them 
               over the railing. The men fly through the air and CRASH into 
               the lower display cases. The front doors suddenly BURST OPEN, 
               The crazed mob pours into the museum. our heroes haul ass 
               across the balcony and down the staircase.

               EXT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITY - NIGHT

               Jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his 
               convertible. Suddenly, a splinter group of the diseased mob 
               comes around the side of the museum. Jonathan instantly bugs 
               his eyes out, starts drooling, and begins CHANTING --

                                     JONATHAN
                         Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!

               The crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors 
               of the museum. Jonathan leaps into the convertible, fires it 
               up and 180's it back over to the bushes.

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Daniels, Ardeth Ray and the Curator jump 
               inside the car. Beni steps out of the museum and sees them.

                                     BENI
                         Imhotep! IMHOTEP!

               Imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper 
               windows just as the convertible PEELS OUT. O'Connell points 
               a finger at Beni as they race past him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You're gonna get yours, pal!

               Imhotep UNHINGES his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman 
               size, he lets out one of his horrific, primordial SHRIEKS.

               His disease-ridden disciples immediately begin pouring out 
               of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car.

               EXT. BAZAAR - NIGHT

               The convertible hauls ass down the narrow bazaar street.

               Crazies start jumping out of stalls and LEAPING onto the 
               car. O'Connell and the others fight them off, throwing them 
               overboard. More people JUMP on. Jonathan SWERVES the car, 
               CRASHES through some stalls, knocking them off, but not before 
               they manage to open the back door and YANK Daniels out. He 
               TUMBLES across the pavement. Gets up SHOOTING. Backs into a 
               corner, FIRING his pistol into the hideous rabble, killing 
               several, keeping them at bay. His gun goes empty, CLICK! 
               CLICK! CLICK! But the mob stays back, looking at him like 
               rabid vultures. Daniels eyes them, filled with fear.

               The mob parts like the red sea as Imhotep walks through them 
               and up to Daniels. Daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down 
               his cheeks. Then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket, 
               and pulls out his jewel encrusted SACRED CANOPIC JAR. He 
               holds it out for Imhotep. Imhotep takes it and grins. Through 
               his tears, Daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared.

               WE CUT WIDE: Somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased 
               mob, we hear Daniels give out A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM...

               INT./EXT. CONVERTIBLE - STREETS - NIGHT

               The convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys. WE 
               DOLLY across the hood of the car from Jonathan to Evelyn to 
               O'Connell. Ardeth Ray and the Curator are still in the back.

               All of them staring out the front windshield. Freaked-out.

               Then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls CRASHES through the 
               windshield! Everybody SCREAMS. Jonathan hits the gas, loses 
               control, the car SLAMS into a wall. O'Connell grabs Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go!

               They all leap out of the car. But the angry, festering mob 
               quickly surrounds them. O'Connell quickly reaches into his 
               gunny-sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into 
               his pocket and pulls out a match. He looks around for a way 
               to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across Ardeth 
               Ray's stubbly face. Ardeth Ray YELPS. O'Connell holds the 
               lit match near the fuse.

               The crazed, CHANTING mob gives O'Connell a wide berth, staring 
               at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes.

               And then Imhotep steps through, -- having fully regenerated, 
               he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did 
               the day he was buried alive. Evelyn stares at him.

                                     EVELYN
                         He's gorgeous.

               O'Connell gives her a look, the match burns his fingers. He 
               YELPS and throws it down, grabs another match and strikes it 
               across Ardeth Ray's face again. Ardeth Ray YELPS and gives 
               O'Connell a look to kill. The Curator shakes his head.

                                     THE CURATOR
                         He has consummated the curse, now 
                         all he need do is raise Anck-su-namun 
                         from the dead, then it will be the 
                         end of us, and the beginning for 
                         them.

               Imhotep moves forward, heading right for them. O'Connell 
               LIGHTS THE FUSE. Imhotep steps up to O'Connell and stops, 
               watching the fuse burn down. it's a game of chicken. The 
               tension mounts. The LIT FUSE is about to vanish inside the 
               stick of dynamite, blowing it up, -- when Evelyn leans forward 
               and blows it out. O'Connell exhales, but keeps his eyes on 
               Imhotep, who extends his hand to Evelyn.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Koontash dai na.

               Beni steps through the swarming mass, translating.

                                     BENI
                         Take his hand and he will spare the 
                         others.

               Evelyn hesitates, looks around at the huge, bloodthirsty 
               crowd surrounding them, holding axes, picks and scimitars, 
               waiting to pounce, then she looks at Imhotep, confident, 
               powerful, invincible. Then she looks at O'Connell.

                                     EVELYN
                         Any bright ideas?

               O'Connell talks through angry, grit teeth.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Sorry, fresh out.

               Evelyn looks back at Imhotep, then starts to reach out to 
               take his hand. Both O'Connell and Jonathan move to stop her, -- 
               but Ardeth Ray grabs them both and holds them tight.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't do it, Evelyn.

                                     EVELYN
                         I have no choice.

               Evelyn's trembling hand touches Imhotep's: His hand closes 
               around hers. Nothing happens. Imhotep smiles.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan.

                                     BENI
                         Come with me my princess. It is time 
                         to make you mine, forever.

               Evelyn gives Beni a nasty look, correcting him --

                                     EVELYN
                         All eternity, idiot.

               Then she looks at O'Connell and puts on her best face.

                                     EVELYN
                         You better think of something, because 
                         if he turns me into a mummy, you're 
                         the first one I'm coming after.

               O'Connell almost smiles.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Got guts, lady.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep 
                         them.

               Imhotep suddenly notices something. He reaches forward and -- 
               RIPS THE KEY/BOX OUT OF JONATHAN'S UPPER JACKET POCKET.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hey that's mine -- !

               Ardeth Ray holds Jonathan back. Imhotep pulls Evelyn away.

               O'Connell can't take it anymore, he tries to break free of 
               Ardeth Ray's grip.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evelyn!

               The huge, powerful man holds him tight.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Be calm. There is still time. We can 
                         stop him yet.

               The crowd parts for Imhotep and Evelyn. And then Imhotep 
               stops and looks back at O'Connell.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Pared oos.

               Evelyn SCREAMS.

                                     EVELYN
                         NOOO!!

               Beni smiles.

                                     BENI
                         Kill them.

               Imhotep pulls her away. O'Connell breaks free of Ardeth Ray's 
               grip and stumbles forward.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         EVELYN!

               But the rabid vultures are already moving in for the kill.

               O'Connell quickly bends down, pulls open a CISTERN/MANHOLE 
               COVER and shoves Jonathan down inside it, then jumps in after 
               him. The Curator pushes Ardeth Ray towards the cistern hole.

                                     CURATOR
                         Go! Find a way! Kill the creature!

               The Curator turns and throws himself at the mob as Ardeth 
               Ray crawls down into the hole. The mob tears the Curator 
               apart.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray slosh their way down the 
               watery catacomb, crazies pouring in behind them. Up ahead, a 
               LIGHT suddenly shines in from another cistern hole, and then 
               more of the infected crowd drop down, SCREECHING like rats.

               O'Connell jags right, pushing Jonathan and Ardeth Ray ahead 
               of him, he strikes a match off the wall, lights the nubby 
               fuse on a stick of dynamite, throws it, and runs like hell.

               FIRE BLAST incinerates a bunch of crazies.

               STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT

               The EXPLOSION blows a cistern cover fifty feet into the air, 
               followed by a mass of FLAMMAGE...

               EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

               A sewer grate is kicked out of a wall. O'Connell, Jonathan 
               and Ardeth Ray climb out of the hole and into AN ALLEY.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We gotta get her back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I'm with you, old man. No one touches 
                         my sister like that and gets away 
                         with it.

               O'Connell looks at Ardeth Ray.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You know where he's taking her?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the 
                         ritual.

               Jonathan looks worried.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And what ritual would that be?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         The ritual to bring the body of Anck-
                         su-namun back to life.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And how does one do that?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         By reading the Book Of The Dead.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh yes, of course.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         And then killing your sister.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Excuse me?

               Ardeth Ray looks at O'Connell.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Imhotep is now able to cross the 
                         desert with great haste.

               Jonathan taps him in the shoulder.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Begging your pardon, but I wasn't 
                         quite clear on that last part.

               Ardeth Ray ignores him.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         If he arrives before us, it will be 
                         too late.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Did you say 'kill' my sister?

               O'Connell smiles.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I know how to beat him to it.

               And on that WE SMASH CUT TO -- THE ERFOUD DUNES - DAWN 

               Jonathan's bashed-in convertible steams it's way up to a set 
               of semi-abandoned Quonset huts. A single WWI BIPLANE with 
               R.A.F. INSIGNIAS sits in the sand beside them. A SIGN READS:

                               HIS MAJESTY'S ROYAL AIR CORP

               EXT. QUONSET HUT - DUNES - MINUTES LATER

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray stand before Winston 
               Havlock, the massive dunes of Erfoud as our background.

                                     WINSTON
                         So what's your little problem got to 
                         do with His Majesty's Royal Air Corp?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Not a god-damned thing.

               Winston looks intrigued.

                                     WINSTON
                         Is it dangerous?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You probably won't live through it.

               This really interests him.

                                     WINSTON
                         By Jove, do you really think so?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Everybody else we've bumped into has 
                         died, why not you?

               Winston nods his head, he's hooked.

                                     WINSTON
                         So what's the challenge then?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         To save the damsel in distress, kill 
                         the bad guy and steal his treasure.

               A slow grin spreads across Winston's face, then he gives 
               them a snappy salute.

                                     WINSTON
                         Winston Havlock at your service, 
                         sir!

               SAHARA - DAY

               Way off across the desert, a large SAND-DEVIL races over the 
               dunes. The SANDY WHIRLWIND comes to a stop and starts to 
               dissipate. Evelyn and Beni are suddenly ejected out of it, 
               they land in a dune. The SWIRLING SAND CONDENSES AND FORMS 
               INTO IMHOTEP. He looks up into the sky, listening carefully.

               Evelyn shakes the sand out of her hair and looks at Beni.

                                     EVELYN
                         What just happened?

                                     BENI
                         All I remember is him turning into a 
                         blast of sand,... and then I remember 
                         nothing.

               Then they hear a plane in the sky and look up.

               INT. BIPLANE - DAY

               The WIND whips at Winston in the cockpit. O'Connell sits in 
               the gunner's compartment. Jonathan is strapped spread-eagle 
               across the left wing, Ardeth Ray is tied tight to the right.

               Both men are scared out of their wits and SCREAMING in fear.

               EXT. SAHARA - DAY

               Imhotep's jaw UNHINGES, his mouth opens to an inhuman size, 
               he lets fly with another one of his horrible SHRIEKS. -- And 
               a massive WALL OF SAND rises up out of the desert

               BIPLANE - DAY

               O'Connell watches the desert below him come alive and rise 
               up towards the plane. Winston looks over the side and sees 
               what's coming. He laughs, throws the throttle, and puts the 
               plane into a dive.

                                     WINSTON
                         Hang on, men!

               WE GO WIDE AS: The sandstorm chases the diving, twisting 
               biplane. Getting closer and closer, about to engulf it.

               O'Connell looks back into the blinding sand and sees a GIANT 
               FACE forming inside the sandstorm. It's Imhotep. Grinning.

               O'Connell grabs the Lewis machine-gun, cocks the bracket and 
               FIRES, blasting away at Imhotep's giant face inside the 
               sandstorm. Imhotep's face begins to laugh, then his jaw 
               unhinges, his mouth opens wide, and he ENGULFS the plane.

               Winston blindly fights for control, elated.

                                     WINSTON
                         We're going down!

               The biplane SPINS inside the BLOWING SAND. Engines ROARING. 
               Wind HOWLING. Jonathan and Ardeth Ray SCREAMING. Winston 
               Havlock LAUGHING.

                                     WINSTON
                         Here I come, laddies!

               O'Connell braces himself for impact,

               SAHARA - DAY

               Evelyn leaps to her feet and runs over to Imhotep.

                                     EVELYN
                         Stop it! You'll kill them!

               Imhotep grabs her, pulls her close, her beautiful eyes stare 
               into his shockingly intense ones. Then he kisses her, hard.

               Evelyn's eyes widen, stunned and mesmerized, then she pushes 
               herself away and falls back into the sand. Imhotep laughs.

               EXT. BIPLANE - DUNES - DAY

               The biplane SMASHES over a dune, ROLLS OVER and CRASHES upside-
               down into another dune. The SAND SWIRLS as O'Connell falls 
               out of the gunner's compartment. The left wing is jammed 
               into the dune, Jonathan hangs upside down.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Excuse me... A little help would be 
                         useful... IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH 
                         TROUBLE!!

               O'Connell goes to help Jonathan. Ardeth Ray stumbles over to 
               the gunner's compartment and tears the Lewis gun off it's 
               mount. He throws the machine-gun over one shoulder, a 
               cartridge belt over the other and staggers away. O'Connell 
               and Jonathan look into the cockpit. Winston Havlock is dead.

               A smile on his face. The plane suddenly starts to move, the 
               sand sinks under their feet, they quickly high-tail-it away.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make it to some rocks and 
               look back. The biplane, with Winston Havlock inside, slides 
               away over a dune. O'Connell gives it a salute. The plane 
               vanishes over the dune and into the SWIRLING SAND...

               HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray come down a ravine in the 
               volcano and look out over the ruins of Hamunaptra.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay, now what the hell does this 
                         Horus guy look like?

                                     JONATHAN
                         He's a big fellow with pointy ears 
                         and a face like a falcon.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Got it.

               HAMUNAPTRA STAIRWAY - DAY

               Carrying TORCHES, O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make 
               their way down a long, winding, narrow staircase. Heading 
               into the bowels of the necropolis. A passageway to hell.

               NECROPOLIS - DAY

               Evelyn follows Imhotep into the underground cemetery. She 
               stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying through 
               the mausoleums and over the gravestones. Beni shoves his 
               rifle into her back and pushes her forward.

                                     BENI
                         Keep moving.

               Evelyn gives him a look.

                                     EVELYN
                         You know, nasty little fellows such 
                         as yourself, always get their 
                         comeuppance.

               Beni suddenly looks worried.

                                     BENI
                         Yeah?

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh yes, always.

               Beni looks even more worried, he nervously starts chewing on 
               his lip. All three of them walk over the bridge crossing the 
               disgusting DETRITUS MOAT. Evelyn looks down at it, horrified.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               O'Connell and Ardeth Ray are busy digging out a collapsed 
               doorway. Jonathan notices an AMETHYST SCARAB on the far wall.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, look at that.

               He walks over and tries to jiggle it free. It comes loose in 
               his hand. He looks at the scarab in his palm. It starts to 
               glow. And then something inside it starts to WIGGLE.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Say, gents! You should come have a 
                         look at this.

               The wiggling continues; a long, agonizing BEAT, and then the 
               scarab breaks out of it's cocoon and instantly BURROWS into 
               Jonathan's palm. Jonathan starts to freak out and SCREAM.

               O'Connell runs up and rips the arm off Jonathan's shirt. The 
               scarab is now BURROWING UP JONATHAN'S ARM. O'Connell whips 
               out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs Jonathan's 
               arm. Jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in 
               front of his face. Jonathan SCREAMS LOUDER, obviously being 
               cut open. O'Connell's hand flicks something away.

               The scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying 
               back towards Jonathan, wanting to finish the job.

               O'Connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, -- BLAM!

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               The GUNSHOT echoes into the cemetery as Imhotep, Evelyn and 
               Beni step-up to the strange ALTAR, where four thousand years 
               ago Imhotep tried to bring Anck-su-namun back to life.

               Imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a CANOPIC 
               JAR. He pulls out the crusted remains of Anck-su-namun's 
               heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts reading 
               from The Book Of The Dead. Then he BLOWS the dust against a 
               mausoleum wall, -- THE WALL STARTS TO COME ALIVE.

               Evelyn and Beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed.

               TWO FORMS emerge from the mausoleum's wall. Horrific-looking 
               mummified CORPSES. Two of Imhotep's long dead Priests.

               They bow to Imhotep, then turn and move off down a passageway.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               O'Connell helps Ardeth Ray mend Jonathan's wound.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         From now on, don't touch anything. 
                         Not a damn thing. Keep your hands 
                         off the furniture, got it?

               Jonathan swallows hard and nods vigorously.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Imhotep prepares the altar while speaking in HEBREW. Beni 
               holds his gun on her, translating:

                                     BENI
                         Prince Imhotep wants your heart.

               Evelyn blushes, feeling complimented by the handsome prince.

                                     EVELYN
                         Tell him, I'm truly flattered... but 
                         that it's already taken.

               Imhotep continues SPEAKING while laying the four jewel 
               encrusted canopic jars next to the shattered one.

                                     BENI
                         He wants your heart and your brain, 
                         your liver, your kidneys...

               Evelyn's eyes widen.

                                     BENI
                         ...and how do you say? Those slimy 
                         things, in your stomach?

                                     EVELYN
                         Intestines.

                                     BENI
                         Yeah! Them.

               Evelyn can't believe it, she furiously turns to Imhotep.

                                     EVELYN
                         You only want me for my organs?!

               Imhotep looks at her and grins, then BACKHANDS her -- WAP!

               Evelyn goes down for the count. Imhotep stares at her, cold, 
               malevolent, then he turns and walks off into the mausoleums.

               Beni nervously glances around, then quickly scurries away.

               TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell squeezes through a small crevice in a wall and 
               drops to the floor of a dark chamber. He picks up his 
               gunnysack and scans the darkness. Something GLITTERS. Jonathan 
               and Ardeth Ray crawl in behind him.

               O'Connell notices a SHAFT OF LIGHT, high above him, shooting 
               through a small hole in the ceiling and stopping against a 
               wall next to one of those mirror disks. O'Connell aims his 
               gun. FIRES. The bullet STRIKES the disk's pedestal, spinning 
               the mirror into the shaft of light, -- And WHAM! THE SHAFT 
               OF LIGHT HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY BOUNCES AROUND THE ROOM 
               FROM ONE DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP.

               It's an enormous TREASURE CHAMBER. Filled to overflowing. 
               Everything sparkles and shines. The wealth of Egypt.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray are speechless. That's 
               when the two mummified Priest-mummies walk in.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Who the hell are these guys?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Priests. Imhotep's priests.

               O'Connell pulls the elephant gun out of his gunny-sack.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I never killed a priest before.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         They are evil, cursed, they matter 
                         not.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Well, okay then.

               O'Connell FIRES the elephant gun. SMOKE and FLAME shoot out.

               BLASTS one of the mummies. Blows it's upper torso clean off.

               O'Connell pumps the gun, the huge spent cartridge flips 
               through the air. He FIRES again. BLASTS the other mummy, 
               blows this one's torso clean off as well. The smoke clears.

               The two sets of LEGS keep walking forward, unaffected by the 
               loss of their upper torsos. O'Connell can't believe it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh come on, gimme a break here.

               And then the disemboweled upper torsos start to move, turning 
               over and crawling towards our heroes, who start to back away.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Imhotep turns from the altar as he hears more GUNSHOTS echoing 
               out of the passageways. He angrily reaches into another of 
               Anck-su-namun's canopic jars, pulls out her crusty liver and 
               crushes it to dust, then quickly starts reading a passage 
               from the Book and BLOWS the dust down a passageway.

                                     IMHOTEP
                              (ancient Egyptian -- 
                              subtitled)
                         Kill them! Kill them all! And bring 
                         me the Book Of The Living!

               INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

               A dusty BREEZE blows into the chamber as O'Connell, Jonathan 
               and Ardeth Ray back away from the mummy pieces. The floor 
               where they were just standing suddenly STARTS TO MOVE. Two 
               more mummies slowly dig their way up out of the floor. More 
               mummies start coming out of the walls and crawling out of 
               the piles of gold. All the mummies head for our heroes.

               O'Connell lifts the elephant gun. Ardeth Ray stops him.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         My turn.

               Ardeth Ray OPENS UP with the Lewis gun. BLASTING the shit 
               out of the mummies. They keep on coming. Even more now.

               O'Connell OPENS FIRE with the elephant gun, pumping and FIRING 
               as all three of the men back away and haul ass. The mummies 
               and mummy pieces follow them into the passageway.

               Then Beni creeps into the chamber. He stares in wonder at 
               all the treasure. Then falls backwards into a pile of jewels 
               and rolls about.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Evelyn wakes up, lying chained to the top of the altar. She 
               blinks, then turns her head, -- and looks right into the 
               ROTTED FACE of Anck-su-namun's corpse. Evelyn SCREAMS.

               INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAYS - DAY

               The elephant gun FIRES, blasting FLAME and SMOKE right into 
               the LENS. O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray race down a 
               passageway, a dozen mummies striding after them.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         This whole place is comin, alive!

               The men race around a corner. More mummies. They race around 
               another corner. More mummies. Onward they come. Methodical. 
               Relentless. Boxing in our heroes. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray 
               FIRING as they go. Ardeth Ray goes empty.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         I'm out.

               He throws the machine-gun down and they all race into --

               HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

               -- A small chamber. The lower half of the giant statue of 
               HORUS stands in the middle of the chamber.

                                     JONATHAN
                         There he is!

               They run up to the base of the statue,

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hello Horus old boy.

               O'Connell looks back at the mummies coming down the 
               passageway. He reaches into his gunny-sack and pulls out a 
               stick of dynamite. Ardeth Ray taps him on the shoulder.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Allow me.

               O'Connell hands him the dynamite and a match, then turns to 
               look at the statue. Ardeth Ray reaches forward and strikes 
               the match off O'Connell's stubbly face. O'Connell YELPS.

               Ardeth Ray lights the dynamite and throws it down the 
               passageway. They all hit the deck. The dynamite EXPLODES.

               Ripping apart the creatures, causing a CAVE-IN and sealing 
               the passageway with rock and dirt. Now there's only one way 
               out, -- another dark, creepy passageway.

               INT. CEMETERY

               Chained tight to the top of the altar, Evelyn hopelessly 
               struggles to free herself. She stops as Priest mummies start 
               surrounding the altar. Evelyn is horrified as the hideous 
               mummies kneel down and begin to CHANT, -- which now sounds 
               even more horrific due to the lack of tongues, jaws and mouths 
               in the room.

               Imhotep steps up carrying the black Book Of The Dead. His 
               hand reaches out and lovingly caresses Anck-su-namun's decayed 
               cheek.

               INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell and Jonathan are digging away at the seams of the 
               secret compartment, it starts to give. And that's when Ardeth 
               Ray spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the 
               dark passageway, heading right for them. O'Connell looks up.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         These guys just don't quit.

               Ardeth Ray grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells 
               and runs off towards the mummies.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Keep digging!

               O'Connell and Jonathan redouble their efforts, pulling harder 
               on the seam. The compartment starts to loosen. About to give.

               The last time this happened, salt acid sprayed out, remember?

               Our heroes keep tugging. The tension mounts...

               And that's when a SKELETAL HAND BURSTS UP OUT OF THE GROUND 
               and grabs O'Connell's ankle. Several more moldy hands BURST 
               up out of the ground. O'Connell and Jonathan struggle with 
               the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor.

               One of the mummies violently shoves O'Connell away. Another 
               grabs Jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him. A 
               third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard.

               AN INTENSE BURST OF ACID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM AND HITS ALL 
               THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it in 
               the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly.

               INT. CEMETERY

               Imhotep begins to read from The Book Of The Dead.

               A large SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog.

               Evelyn's eyes widen in amazement and horror.

               INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Ardeth Ray BLASTS AWAY at the oncoming mummies. over at the 
               base of the statue, O'Connell and Jonathan pull an ornate 
               chest out of the secret compartment. O'Connell rips off the 
               lid, reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag.

               He and Jonathan exchange nervous, excited looks. Then he 
               reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the SOLID GOLD 
               Book Of The Living -- GOLDEN LIGHT reflects off their faces 
               as they stare at it in wonder.

               The elephant gun goes empty. Ardeth Ray takes it by the barrel 
               and wades into the remaining mummies swinging.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Save the girl! Kill the creature!

               The mummies quickly overwhelm and start to tear him apart.

               O'Connell lights the last stick of dynamite and throws it 
               against the far wall. He and Jonathan hit the deck.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That's the last one, we better get 
                         lucky.

               The wall BLOWS. Debris COLLAPSES, -- but now here's a hole 
               for them to get out. O'Connell and Jonathan race out through 
               the hole just as the remaining mummies enter the chamber.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA RUINS - DAY

               Outside, Beni staggers across the sand with a saddlebag filled 
               with treasure. He throws it over the rear of a camel.

               Starts to climb up. Hesitates. Looks back at the temple door.

               Licks his lips. And then his greed gets the better of him 
               and he quickly climbs down and scurries back towards the 
               door.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Imhotep READS from the Book. The rotten Priest-mummies rock 
               back and forth, CHANTING. Evelyn struggles.

               Then suddenly, the strange MIST wafts up out of the swirling 
               hole and over to the sacred jars, it passes through them and 
               into Evelyn. Evelyn JERKS as though she's been electrified.

               The MIST passes through her and into Anck-su-namun's body.

               The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING HOLE, WAFTING MIST and 
               IMHOTEP'S READINGS reach a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's crusty 
               EYELIDS suddenly POP OPEN. Evelyn stares at her in disbelief.

               Anck-su-namun's rotted head turns and looks at Evelyn with 
               empty sockets. Evelyn freaks out and struggles wildly, then 
               she notices Imhotep holding the ancient sacrificial knife.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         With your death, my love and I will 
                         be invincible!

               He raises it up over Evelyn's chest, about to plunge it down.

               Evelyn's eyes widen in horror. And that's when O'Connell and 
               Jonathan BURST IN. Imhotep spins around and faces them.

               Jonathan beams as he holds up the golden Book Of The Living.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I found it, Evy! I found it

                                     EVELYN
                         Shut-up and get me off of here!

               O'Connell grabs an ancient sword out of a statue's hand, 
               jumps up onto a gravestone and leaps out over the Priests.

               The Priest-mummies stop chanting. The MIST vanishes.

               Imhotep steps forward. O'Connell STRIKES the sacrificial 
               knife out of his hand. Imhotep BELLOWS a command. The Priests 
               stand up, swords and knives in hand, they ATTACK O'Connell.

               EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE, READ FASTER:

                                     EVELYN
                         Open the book, Jonathan! Open the 
                         book! That's the only way to kill 
                         him!

               O'Connell RACKS and CHOPS at the attacking Priest-mummies, 
               fighting his way to Evelyn. The skeletal creatures wildly 
               SWING their swords, trying to STAB O'Connell. Jonathan fumbles 
               with the book, struggling to open it, -- he can't.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I can't open it! It's locked or 
                         something!

               O'Connell CUTS two of the mummies in half, then swings his 
               sword down at Evelyn, -- CLANG! One chain breaks free.

               Jonathan spots a series of SOLID GOLD, FOUR-SIDED LOCKS along 
               the binder. It hits him like lightning --

                                     JONATHAN
                         We need the key!

               Imhotep grins, then grabs the KEY/BOX hanging from a chain 
               around his neck, rips it off and shoves it into his pocket 
               He picks up the sacrificial sword and heads for Jonathan.

                                     JONATHAN
                         What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?

                                     EVELYN
                         Read the inscription on the cover!

               O'Connell swings his sword down again, -- CLANG! Evelyn now 
               has one hand and one leg free. More mummies attack O'Connell 
               force him back.

               Jonathan quickly starts translating the cover inscription, 
               but his ancient Egyptian is clearly awful.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Keetash-something, naraba-something.

               Jonathan starts to backpedal through the cemetery, clutching 
               the golden book; wide-eyed, as Imhotep moves in on him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm -- ?

               Jonathan trips and falls on his ass. Imhotep CHARGES FORWARD.

               O'Connell SLASHES another chain. Only one more left holding 
               Evelyn. Jonathan sits up and quickly looks back at the cover.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Rasheem Aaaaa ANUBIS!

               Imhotep raises the sacrificial sword, about to kill Jonathan.

               And that's when the giant statue of Anubis suddenly CRASHES 
               through the wall -- shades of Ray Harryhausen. Only better.

               The god of Deaths, horrible, decrepit STONE FACE stares 
               angrily down. Jonathan stares back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh boy.

               O'Connell DECAPITATES a mummy and looks up at Anubis.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         This just keeps gettin, better and 
                         better.

               Imhotep leaves Jonathan and heads for the giant statue.

               O'Connell leaps over and with one last swing of the sword, 
               frees Evelyn from her chains. More Priest-mummies attack, 
               forcing him away. Evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to 
               head for O'Connell, -- a SKELETAL HAND grabs her! Spins her 
               around. It's Anck-su-namun's rotted corpse. Evelyn reacts.

               Imhotep looks up at Anubis, points to O'Connell, and in 
               ANCIENT EGYPTIAN commands him to attack. Anubis moves for 
               O'Connell, STOMPING over mausoleums and through the detritus 
               moat on his way. O'Connell quickly backs away.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!

                                     JONATHAN
                         You have got to be joking?

               Evelyn is backing away from Anck-su-namun.

                                     EVELYN
                         Finish the inscription, idiot!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh.

               Anck-su-namun ATTACKS Evelyn. Evelyn fends her off as best 
               she can. Jonathan quickly looks back at the hieroglyphs on 
               the book cover, fumbling badly under the pressure --

                                     JONATHAN
                         Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now 
                         what is this last symbol here?

                                     EVELYN
                         What's it look like!?

               Anck-su-namun grabs Evelyn by the throat. The statue of Anubis 
               corners O'Connell, reaches down and GRABS him with it's 
               MASSIVE TALONS. O'Connell HACKS away at it. Jonathan stares 
               at the inscription, slightly oblivious.

                                     JONATHAN
                         It's an Anck symbol, with two little 
                         squiggly lines above it, and a bird, 
                         a stork! on either side.

               Evelyn is being STRANGLED by Anck-su-namun.

                                     EVELYN
                         Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes,... I see.

               The talons lift O'Connell up and start to CRUSH him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hootash im Ahmenophus!

               The giant statue of Anubis instantly freezes in it's tracks 
               and PETRIFIES. It's off balance. Starts to fall. O'Connell 
               slides free of it's talons. Evelyn SHOVES Anck-su-namun away, 
               Anck-su-namun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream 
               just as Anubis CRASHES DOWN on top of her, SMASHING HER to 
               powder and DRIVING her into the ground.

               Imhotep SHRIEKS in rage and horror, then turns and angrily 
               heads for Jonathan. Jonathan, sitting on his ass, quickly 
               backpedals on his hands and heels.

               O'Connell leaps to his feet, sword in hand and runs for 
               Imhotep. Imhotep grabs Jonathan, lifts him up, rips the golden 
               Book Of The Living out of his hand and pins him to a wall.

               O'Connell runs up and swings his sword at Imhotep, -- WAP!

               SLICES Imhotep's right arm off. It drops to the ground, still 
               clutching The Book Of The Living. Imhotep drops Jonathan and 
               spins around, facing O'Connell. O'Connell grins.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay pal, let's see how tough you 
                         are without your right arm.

               Imhotep grabs O'Connell with his left arm and THROWS him 
               half way across the cemetery. O'Connell SLAMS into a 
               gravestone, bounces off and crashes to the ground. He shakes 
               it off.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Alright,... so he's left handed.

               Imhotep is already striding towards him. Jonathan lifts up 
               his hand, -- HE HAS THE KEY/BOX BACK! He smiles at Evelyn.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I got it!

               Evelyn runs for Jonathan.

               O'Connell SWINGS his sword and CLEAVES a big chunk of molten 
               flesh rot out of Imhotep's stomach. On the outside, Imhotep 
               looks human, but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy.

               Imhotep BACKHANDS O'Connell. Knocks him twenty feet back.

               O'Connell staggers to his feet. Imhotep is right there. CLUBS 
               him hard with his left arm. O'Connell spins through the air,

               SLAMS into the side of a mausoleum. Imhotep approaches, rage 
               in his eyes. O'Connell gets up, quickly pivots and HACKS 
               into Imhotep's head. Imhotep grins and PUNCHES O'Connell in 
               the face. O'Connell is thrown back, pulling his sword with 
               him.

               He bounces hard off the mausoleum. Lands on his feet.

               Totally beat-to-shit. Knees buckling. He can barely stand.

               Jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book, -- Imhotep's severed 
               hand still clings to it. Jonathan cringes in disgust. Evelyn 
               yanks it off, throws it away, then start furiously working 
               the key into the series of locks, unlocking each of them.

               Imhotep strides forward. O'Connell backs into the mausoleum, 
               swings the sword, Imhotep tries to catch it, -- it CLEAVES 
               through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm.

               No matter, Imhotep rips the sword away from O'Connell and 
               casually flings it away.

               The golden Book Of The Living opens with a HISS. Jonathan 
               holds it tight as Evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages 
               looking for something.

               O'Connell turns to run, but Imhotep grabs him by the throat 
               and lifts him off his feet. O'Connell hangs there, a dazed 
               mess. Imhotep grins, says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, 
               then starts to strangle O'Connell. O'Connell chokes. About 
               to die.

               Evelyn turns and faces Imhotep and reads an inscription:

                                     EVELYN
                         Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal! Pared oos! 
                         PARED OOS!!

               Imhotep pivots and looks at Evelyn, a look of sheer terror 
               on his face. Then he looks over at the detritus bog. Which 
               starts to BUBBLE and SHIFT. The SWIRLING HOLE begins to open.

               And then suddenly THE SPIRITS OF THE EGYPTIAN GODS waft out 
               of the black bog and SWIRL around the Priest-mummies. The 
               mummies all collapse and turn to dust. And then the spirits 
               attack Imhotep. Lifting him and O'Connell up into the air.

               Imhotep lets go of O'Connell, who falls to the ground.

               Evelyn and Jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits, 
               Jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws The Book of 
               The Living into the detritus bog. Evelyn watches as the golden 
               book sinks into the black putrescence. Jonathan looks like 
               he's about to cry.

               Ten feet off the ground, the spirits SWIRL around Imhotep's 
               body, TWISTING IT and TURNING IT and slowly SHRIVELING IT.

               Accompanied by the same strange FLASHING LIGHT we saw at the 
               beginning of the movie when Anck-su-namun was cursed. One 
               last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and Imhotep 
               is spit out and thrown to the floor. He staggers to his feet, 
               he looks perfectly normal. His body is completely intact.

               O'Connell swings his sword. Imhotep jerks back. The sword 
               scrapes Imhotep's chest, -- a swath of blood appears across 
               Imhotep's chest where the sword hit him. Imhotep touches the 
               blood on his chest, amazed and horrified. He's mortal.

               O'Connell runs Imhotep through with the sword and shoves him 
               backwards. Imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus 
               bog. The sword still in his stomach.

               Evelyn and Jonathan run up next to O'Connell. They watch as 
               Imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp, slowly dying. And 
               then, just before his head goes under, Imhotep looks up at 
               them, grins broadly, and says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.

               Evelyn translates:

                                     EVELYN
                         Death is only the beginning.

               Imhotep's grinning face vanishes under the black bile.

               STAFF CHAMBER - DAY

               Beni staggers across a chamber, straining under the weight 
               of another saddlebag filled with treasure. He spots a large, 
               ornate STAFF sticking out of a wall. He throws the saddlebag 
               over the staff and collapses against the wall. Exhausted.

               A BEAT. And then the weight of the treasure PULLS THE STAFF 
               DOWN. Which starts a massive AURAL CHAIN-REACTION.

               Beni-backs away from the wall, wide-eyed, filled with fear.

               ALL THE WALLS START TO SINK INTO THE GROUND. Driven by tons 
               of pouring sand. Beni turns and hauls ass out of the chamber.

               CEMETERY - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan look around as all the walls 
               start to DESCEND. O'Connell grabs Evelyn's hand.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon!

               He pulls her forward and all three of them race past sinking 
               pillars. They duck as they run into a descending doorway.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               Beni scampers down a passageway, the ceiling getting lower 
               and lower until he has to crouch. And then he has to stick 
               the TORCH between his teeth and crawl on his hands and knees.

               INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch-run into the treasure 
               chamber. Evelyn skids to a stop. Looks in wonder at all the 
               treasure. SAND rains down on them. O'Connell grabs her again 
               and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards 
               a SINKING DOORWAY on the far side of the room. The SOUND of 
               the sinking walls is deafening.

               Beni crouch-runs into the treasure chamber. O'Connell, Evelyn 
               and Jonathan race past him. He joins them as they run up a 
               staircase. Heading for a DESCENDING DOORWAY, which is already 
               half gone, it's now only four feet high -- now three feet 
               high -- now two feet. Jonathan dives through the narrow gap.

               Then O'Connell dives through, he spins around. Evelyn dives, 
               but gets stuck in the middle, about to get cut in half.

               O'Connell grabs her arm and YANKS her through in the nick of 
               time. Beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand --

                                     BENI
                         O'CONNELL!!

               O'Connell grabs it, but it's too late. Beni yanks his hand 
               back just as the top of the door CRASHES to the floor.

               Sealing him in. Beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as 
               the ceiling SLAMS down behind him. He stands up and looks 
               around with his diminishing torch.

               All the doorways FINISH CLOSING. There's no way out. He's 
               trapped. And then he hears something, and turns around. Over 
               in the corner, a scarab-beetle stares at him, CHITTERING.

               Beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away.

                                     BENI
                         Go away.

               He stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens 
               upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him.

               Beni is absolutely terrified. The scarabs start to move in.

               And that's when Beni's torch goes out. PITCH BLACK. A BEAT.

               And then we hear Beni start SCREAMING in horror and pain.

               And the scarabs CHITTERING hungrily.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               The temple COLLAPSES as O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and a 
               pack of stray camels race through the ruins. A SINKING CREVICE 
               DROPS OUT right behind them. Chasing them out through the 
               front gates. The whole place RUMBLES ominously.

               They make it down the ramp as more ruins CRASH DOWN behind 
               them. A MASSIVE CLOUD OF SAND AND DUST billows out over the 
               wall and into the air. our heroes and all the stray camels 
               race out into the desert...

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. PLATEAU - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan stand in the middle of the 
               plateau, surrounded by stray camels. They stare off at the 
               sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to RUMBLE-ominously.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Well,... I guess we go home empty 
                         handed.

               O'Connell looks at Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Wouldn't say that.

               Evelyn returns the look, A BEAT, and then she wraps-her arms 
               around his neck and kisses him. O'Connell returns it.

               Jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs 
               up onto a camel.

               When the kiss is over, O'Connell and Evelyn share a smile, 
               then O'Connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs 
               Evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him. Evelyn wraps her 
               arms around his waist. O'Connell and Jonathan slap the reins.

                                     O'CONNELL/JONATHAN
                         TUK-TUK-TUK!!

               The camels start to move out. WE PAN DOWN: to the saddlebag 
               behind Evelyn, hidden under the closed back flap, -- we can 
               see that it's filled with Beni's stolen TREASURE.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan ride off into the SUNSET.

                                         THE END
MUTE WITNESS

                              (1994)



                           Screenplay by

                           Anthony Waller



 CREDITS (First part)

 White letters on black screen. We hear the sound of a radio with a
 lot of statics. Apparently, someone is scanning the channels.
 After we've heard different channels, the scanning stops on a
 channel with jazz music.

 With a loud sound, the credits stop, the black screen moves away
 to the right and is replaced by :

 FILM SET - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
 (it is actually day-time, but the scene in the film being shot is
 supposed to take place during the night. So all the artificial
 lights make us believe it is night-time)

 We still hear the sound of the radio.

 We are on a film set, even though we don't know it yet. The way it
 is filmed makes us believe we are in a real bedroom.

 A bedroom, seen through a window. Nice, clean, elegantly furnished
 and very well lit. Large bed. On the other side of the room from
 the window, a young woman is seated in front of desk facing the
 wall. The young woman stands up, with a paper document in her
 hand. She is wearing thick hoses, large slippers and a man's white
 shirt, which hangs down to the middle of her thighs.

 She walks out of the bedroom, to the next room. The window opens,
 and the camera, which acts as the eyes of the intruder, looks
 around the room.

       VOICE ON THE RADIO
       We interrupt this program to bring you a special news
       bulletin.

 The camera moves to the next room :

 FILM SET - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

 A dining-room with a large mantlepiece. In the center of the room,
 a round dining table with four chairs around it. The table is set,
 ready for dinner.

       VOICE ON THE RADIO
       Ernest Strohbecker and two accomplices escaped from a
       maximum-security ward in Bellevue Hospital last night...

 The camera (and consequently the eyes of the intruder) keeps on
 looking around the room and then focus on the radio set sitting on
 a small table.

Close shot on the radio. The volume of the radio goes up.

       VOICE ON THE RADIO
       ... after brutally stabbing two nurses and a custodian to
       death. Strohbecker is extremely dangerous, brutal and
       unpredict...

 The radio is suddenly switched off.

 The camera moves upward to show us the corridor and the open door
 of the bathroom in the corridor.

       THE YOUNG WOMAN (Voice over)
       Harry ?

 FILM SET - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

 Close shot on the mirror, in front of which the young woman is
 standing. She looks a bit surprised by the sudden silence of the
 radio, but very soon goes back to her make-up.

FILM SET - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

The camera (and consequently the eyes of the intruder) moves along
the corridor, toward the door of the bathroom. It stops very
shortly to look at the young woman, still taking care of her make-
up, and moves away to look at the open door on the other side of
the corridor.

FILM SET - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

A kitchen. There is no light and the room is very dark. Close shot
on the row of knives hanging on the wall. A man's hand takes one
of the knives.

FILM SET - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

The young woman opens a small closet, temporarily hiding her face
to the camera. She takes a lipstick and start doing her lips.

Close-up shot on the woman's lips, with the lipstick moving around
them.

Back to the mirror, showing the reflection of the young woman. She
opens the small closet. In the mirror, which covers the door of
the closet, we see a man approaching slowly, with a knife in his
hand.

Close-up shot on the woman's lips.

FILM SET - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

High-angle shot of the corridor, seen from the ceiling.

The woman comes out of the bathroom. She sees something, stops and
walks slightly backward.

       THE YOUNG WOMAN
       Harry ?
She walks to an half-open door and closes the door.

       THE YOUNG WOMAN
       Harry ?

When she closes the door, a corpse, who was hidden by the half-
open door, falls, face down, on the floor. The woman screams.

The corpse on the floor. It is a man with blood on his face. The
woman bends down on the man and shakes him.

       THE YOUNG WOMAN
       Harry !

She turns him around to look at his face. We see the white shadow
of a man coming out of a room.

FILM SET - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

A white telephone in the foreground. The girl runs toward the
telephone. She dials on the phone. We see the mysterious man in
the background, slowly walking into the room, coming from the
corridor. The girl has the telephone handset on her ear, but
apparently, she gets no tone. She frenetically taps on the
telephone hook to make it work. Then she sees the cut wire on the
phone and picks it up. The man is coming closer to her. He has a
black mask on his face, and a white apron covered with blood.

The woman sees the man. She drops the phone and walks back until
she reaches the wall. She moves out of the room to :

FILM SET - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

The woman walks back until she reaches the bed. The man, covered
with blood, has his knife raised above his head. The woman falls
backward on the bed. The man raises his knife above the woman's
body. The woman screams. The man stabs repeatedly the woman with
his knife, and then moves away from the bed.
FILM SET - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

The man enters the room and takes the mask away from his face.

FILM SET - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

Apparently, the woman is not dead and she walks to the desk.

FILM SET - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

The man crosses the room.

The bedroom can be seen through the large open door between the
two rooms. The woman tries to steady herself by holding on the
desk, but she falls down on the floor, and the desk with her.

The man sits himself on a table, and searches the breast pocket of
his shirt for a cigarette.

The woman crawls on the floor toward the dining room. She is
holding her stabbed stomach.
The man rolls a cigarette.

The woman stands up, holding on bookshelves set on the wall
between the two rooms.

The man licks the paper of his cigarette.

The woman still holds on the bookshelves.

The man has put the cigarette in his mouth. A hand moves into the
shot, holding a lit match to his cigarette.

The woman falls on the floor, with the bookshelves falling on top
of her.

The two men, the one who stabbed the girl and Arkadi, the one who
lit the other man's cigarette, they both look at the woman and
laugh.

The woman crawls out from underneath the bookshelves. She stands
up, holding on the table.

Back to the two men. A hand comes into the shot, holding a metal
flask to Arkadi. He doesn't take it and the camera moves on the
right to a third man sitting near the two other ones. He drinks
from the flask.

The camera moves to the right of the shot, and the title of the
film appears in white letters on a dark screen. The camera keeps
on moving from one face to another, apparently the faces of the
members of the film crew. And on those faces, we see :

CREDITS (Part Two)

In the background, we hear the noises of the girl who keeps on
falling down and breaking the furniture.
Close up on a dial. A needle is moving on the dial, on which,
besides numbers, is written «Groove Depth» and «Batteries».

The woman falls down. Since she was holding on the tablecloth, the
tablecloth comes away with her, and everything that was on the
table falls down on the floor.

Arkadi and the «murderer» are laughing.

Close shot on the face of the sound engineer, with the earphones
on his ears.

By now, we've started to understand that what we have seen up till
now is not real, but is part of the shooting of a film, a strange,
a bit gory film, but still a film.

The sound engineer shushes the two laughing man down, and looks
down at his tape recorder.

Close shot of the tape recorder.

The camera moves to the right, and shows a female hand writing on
a clipboard, then moves up and shows a large stopwatch hanging
from a cord around the neck of the writing girl. The camera keeps
on moving up to show the face of the writing girl. She is Karen
Hughes, the assistant director and girlfriend of the director. She
looks at what is going on around the set and squints her eyes,
apparently not liking it.

The camera moves to the right and shows the face of Billy Hughes,
Karen's sister and FX make-up artist.

Back to the actress playing the part of the stabbed woman. She
holds the corner of a chest of drawer, and makes everything on top
of that piece of furniture fall on the floor, including several
bottles of alcohol.

Back to Karen and Billy. Billy represses a laughter behind her
hand.

Close shot on Lyosha, a young assistant camera operator, looking
at Billy and smiling. Then close shot on Billy's face.

The actress holds the drapes of the nearest window. She falls down
on the floor tearing the drapes and breaking the curtain-rod off
the wall.

Karen and Billy are both laughing silently.

The actress gets slowly out from under the torn drapes.

Lyosha looks at the actress, and then at Billy.

Billy looks at the actress, and then at Lyosha.

Close up shot on Lyosha's face, smiling.

Billy walks behind Karen's back to the other side of Karen. Karen
looks at her, and then looks in the direction into which Billy is
looking.
Lyosha keeps on smiling.

Karen whispers in Billy's ear.

       KAREN (whispering)
       He has the hots for you.

Billy answers in sign language. We understand that Billy cannot
speak, but she isn't deaf.

       BILLY (in sign language)
       For me ? No.

The actress, half-covered with the drape, drags the curtain-rod
behind her.

Billy is smiling and Karen is looking at the scene with her mouth
half open.

Close shot on a smiling bearded film crew member. The camera then
moves to the right, to an open ring binder, with a hand following
whatever is written on the document. The camera keeps on panning
on the right, showing part of instruments and people's hands,
while we hear some whining noises coming from the actress.

END OF CREDITS

The camera stops on a close shot on Andy Clarke's face. Andy is
the film director.

The actress looks like a ghost with the drape covering her. She
slowly falls down on the floor, among the mess she has created by
breaking and dropping every prop in sight.

Andy looks thunderstruck by what he sees on the set.

Close up shot on the camera. A button just switched off, showing
that there is no more film inside the camera.

Andy looks at the camera and sighs.

       ANDY
       Cut. Brilliant.

He puts his hands on his eyes.

The actress, still lying on the floor under the drape, raises the
drape to look at Andy.

       ANDY (yelling)
       Natasha !

He stands up.

Both Andy and Natasha, the interpreter, walks toward the still
lying actress and squats around her.

       ANDY
       Okay, I think we have a little communication gap here.
Natasha translates in Russian what Andy just said.

       ANDY
       When I said «more»...

Natasha translates.

       ANDY
       ...I didn't mean trash the fucking set.

Natasha translates.

       ANDY
       This is not Chekhov. You're not the star. You're just
       another victim.

Natasha translates.

The actress tries to understand what Andy tells her through
Natasha.
       ANDY
       You get stabbed. You die.

Natasha translates

       ANDY
       I want to see the pain.

Natasha translates.

       ANDY
       I want to see the blood spurting.

Natasha translates. Andy turns around to Billy and Karen standing
among the film crew members.

       ANDY (voice over)
       Billy, where was the blood ? I want to see her bleed to
       death.

Billy answers in sign language.

       ANDY (to Billy)
       Okay ?
       (to the actress)
       Okay ?

The actress, still lying on the floor under the drape, nods her
head.

       ANDY (voice over)
       Let's do it again, folks !

A man yells some orders in Russian. Billy walks to the actor
playing the murderer, sitting on a prop. She checks his blood
device. She takes the knife and plugs a tube coming from the man's
shirt on the knife's handle. She explains, by signs, how the knife
works, and he nods. Billy fixes something inside his shirt and he
reacts when Billy touches his stomach.

       THE ACTOR
       Oh !

He smiles. Billy squeezes a small bag full of fake blood. She has
just taken that bag from the inside of the man's shirt. The actor
keeps on smiling and Billy doesn't seem to like the man's smile.
She puts the bag back inside the actor's shirt. Then Billy signs
her sister for her to come. Karen joins Billy, who explains to the
actor what he has to do, and Karen translates Billy's sign
language.

       KAREN
       You make the blood flow by squeezing the bag with your
       elbow. Okay ?

       THE ACTOR
       Sure.

       KAREN
       We're gonna be here till Christmas, right ?
       (turning around and calling)
       Natasha !

Natasha joins the group.

       NATASHA
       Yes.

       KAREN
       Tell him you make the blood flow by squeezing the bag with
       your elbow.

She mimes the squeezing movement while speaking. Natasha
translates in Russian. Karen nods her head. The actor says a few
words in Russian, nodding his head.

       KAREN
       Okay.

Billy looks at Natasha.

       NATASHA (voice over)
       Tell her that he will get it right next time.

       KAREN
       Mmmm... She heard you. You all keep forgetting she can hear
       you perfectly well.

Billy smiles.

       NATASHA (voice over)
       Oh, I'm sorry.

       BILLY (in sign language)
       It's okay.

The actor laughs.
Lyosha, who actually is the assistant operator, is behind the
camera, near the camera operator. Andy sits down on his chair.

       ANDY
       Okay, from the top.

His Russian assistant, standing near the camera, with an open ring
binder in his hands, says a few words in Russian. We hear an angry
voice in the background.

       THE VOICE
       Stop. Stop. Stop!

On the dining room part of the set, where the young Russian
actress broke everything in sight, two men are trying to fix the
broken furniture. Another one, a tall man with a beard, talks very
angrily in Russian.

Andy, still seated on his chair, looks at his Russian assistant.

       ANDY
       What's the holdup ?
The angry bearded man speaks angrily in Russian.

Andy looks and listens at him and then turns toward his Russian
assistant, trying to speak, but is cut off twice by the angry
voice of the man.

The bearded Russian man walks away. Then he comes back and shows
his wristwatch, saying a few more angry words in Russian.

Andy looks up at his Russian assistant.

         ANDY
         What is he saying ?

         THE RUSSIAN ASSISTANT
         He says he's awfully sorry, but he needs at least a day to
         redress the set.

         ANDY (yelling)
         A day ?

         THE RUSSIAN ASSISTANT
         Yeah.

Andy stands up and slaps his thighs, looking very nervous.

         ANDY
         Okay, well, let's just do the close-up of the corpse now,
         and that'll wrap it for today.

The Russian assistant says a few words in Russian. Andy makes a
sign to the camera operator for him to come closer to him. The
operator joins Andy.

         ANDY
         All right. Okay. So, what I want to do is zoom in, do a
         slow zoom into the puddle of blood...
On another part of the set, behind the dining room, Billy kneels
down in front of a big ancient-looking wooden trunk.

On the lid of the trunk is written, in white large capital
letters : «KEEP OUT ! BILLY'S BOX». Billy opens the trunk. Inside,
on the inside part of the lid, various props, and in the trunk
itself, a big square plastic bottle and, in a plastic box, plenty
of smaller bottles.

Behind   Billy, who is still kneeling in front of the trunk, we see
Lyosha   walking around. He looks at Billy, who feels she is being
looked   at. She turns around and looks at Lyosha. Natasha walks
toward   Billy.

         NATASHA
         Billy.

Natasha kneels down to be at Billy's level.

         NATASHA
         Madame Olga wants some sugar in her blood again.
Billy laughs.

       BILLY (in sign language)
       Thank you.

Billy stands up and starts pulling the big heavy square plastic
bottle out of the trunk. Lyosha comes to help Billy pull the
bottle out of the trunk. They both slowly put the bottle down on
the floor. Billy looks up at Lyosha, who is smiling to her. Then
he walks away. Billy, kneeling on the floor, opens the bottle.
Karen walks in from behind the trunk. She leans on the open lid of
the trunk.

       KAREN
       So, he's kind of cute.

Billy is pouring a bag of sugar in the bottle.

       KAREN
       Three months in Moscow, cold winter nights...

Billy smiles.

       KAREN
       Just a thought.

Billy makes several language signs.

       KAREN
       Billy, that's what Mom would say.

Billy looks at her sister.

Another part of the set, near the entrance of the set. The
building janitor, wearing a more or less official cap, just walked
in. Karen sees the janitor and waves at him. Billy looks in the
janitor's direction.
       KAREN
       Hi.

Billy waves at the janitor, who waves back at the girls. Then he
yells something in Russian. Billy and Karen look at each other.
They seem to understand what he says. Billy shows two finger to
him. The janitor says something in Russian and walks away.

The dining-room set. The young Russian actress is sitting on the
floor among the debris she has created and she is putting lipstick
on her lips, looking at her face in a small pocket mirror. Billy
walks in with a small plastic case in her hands. She sits on the
floor next to the actress and puts the box down beside her. She
takes the lipstick and the mirror away from the actress' hands,
and puts them down on the floor. Then she gives her a little piece
of white cotton to wipe the lipstick out of her lips. The actress
takes it and starts wiping her lips. Then Billy takes some make-up
to put it on the actress' face. A male hand puts a light meter
close to the actress' face.

A strong light starts playing on Billy's face, and we hear a
Russian voice who seems to come from a loudspeaker.

The upper part of the film set. Three big spotlights on a rack. An
electrician is playing with one of them.

Billy puts her hand above her eyes to try to locate who is sending
that strong light on her face.

The electrician says a few words in Russian.

The actress looks up to see who is talking.

Closer shot on the electrician sitting on the spotlight rack. He
is Arkadi, the man who was sitting next to the actor playing the
murderer, and who offered him a light for his cigarette. He speaks
in Russian with a queer smile on his face.

Natasha squats down near Billy and the actress, to speak to Billy.

       NATASHA
       He says use more white like a real dead body.

Billy covers her eyes and looks up at the spotlight rack.

Arkadi smiles and winks to Billy.

Billy closes her plastic case.

The actress eats a piece of cake. She lies down on the floor.

       ANDY (voice over)
       Okay, Boris, get everyone ready.

Billy, using a pair of tweezers, puts something, which looks like
a cherry, out of a small bottle and into the actress' mouth.

       A VOICE OVER WITH A RUSSIAN ACCENT
       Out of frame, Billy.
Billy stands up and walks away.

The camera, and the group of people around it. Andy is sitting on
his director's chair, and Karen is kneeling on the other side of
the camera, writing on a clipboard. A clapperboard girl walks in
front of the camera, says a few words in Russian, claps her
clapperboard and walks away. We hear a loud noise, and most of the
spotlights are suddenly switched off. Andy looks up at the
spotlight racks.

       ANDY
       What... what is going on now ?

Billy, standing in the half-dark set with her plastic case in
front of her, looks up around her as more spotlights are switched
off with loud noises.

Alex, who must be the assistant producer, walks toward Andy,
tapping his wristwatch.

       ALEX
       Andy. Sorry, it's six o'clock.

       ANDY
       One shot, one more shot !

       ALEX
       We have no time.

Billy opens her arms in a gesture of despair.

All the people around Andy start leaving the set.

       ANDY
       One shot ! I can't believe this.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR EVENING

Night is coming. The sky is grey. In the background, a group of
people is coming out of a building.

Andy and Billy are crossing the parking lot. Cars are driving
around them : the film crew members are leaving the studio. Andy
waves his hand at one of them.

Andy and Billy come to a white car parked near a red car. Karen is
walking on the other side of the white car. She opens the driver's
door. Billy is standing near the red car, and looking for
something in her purse. She can't find it and looks disappointed.
She taps on the roof of her car.

Karen was ready to get inside her car, but, when she hears Billy's
tapping, she looks up. Billy explains something in sign language.
Andy doesn't understand and turns towards Karen

       KAREN
       She needs to go get Strohbecker's face.

Andy claps his hands.
       ANDY
       Ohh ! Right ! His dummy falls off the balcony on Monday.

       KAREN
       We'll wait for you here.

Billy starts walking away. Andy turns toward Karen.

       ANDY
       Karen, she's got her own car.

Billy explains something in sign language.

       KAREN
       Okay. Okay. Don't forget tonight.

She opens the door of her car. Andy turns around to face Billy.

       ANDY
       Yeah, yeah, yeah! Fiesta ! I'm making my famous chili con
       Clarke.
Near Andy's car, Alex, the assistant producer we just saw on the
set, is opening the door of his car.

       ANDY
       Alex !... what do you say ? You coming ?

Alex has already opened the door of his car.

       ALEX
       Sorry. I have tickets for the Bolshoi Ballet tonight.

Andy sneers.

       ANDY
       Well, try and stay awake.

Andy opens the door, gets inside the car and closes the door.

CINEMA STUDIO - BILLY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR EVENING

Close up shot on a green hideous mask held with both hands by
Billy.

Around Biily, all the props used for the film she is working on,
or other films. Billy puts the green mask down. She looks around
for something. She throws away various masks she doesn't need.
Billy is kneeling near a large box used as a table. On the box
something is written in large capital Russian letters. Around
Billy, a lot of props are scattered around. Apparently, Billy
can't find what she is looking for, and sits back on her heels in
despair. She hears a loud noise. She sits up when she hears the
noise. She tries to figure out what that noise means. She stands
up and runs toward a window.

The sky is darker. The night is coming soon. Billy looks through
the window.
On the parking lot, seen trough the bars of the window, the
janitor is crossing the yard with his dog.

Billy opens the window and turns around, looking for something to
hit the metal bars of the window. She takes a spear from a suit of
armor. Then she bangs on the bars of the window with the long
handle of the spear.

On the parking lot, seen through the bars of the window, the
janitor keeps on walking around with his dog, apparently not
hearing the noise made by Billy. Then he closes the main door of
the studio parking lot.

Billy drops the spear on the floor and runs away from the window.

CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

A large corridor. A door opens and Billy rushes out. She opens a
door at the end of the corridor and runs out.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT
The gallery around the top of the set. A door opens and Billy runs
along the gallery.

At ground level, we see Billy coming down the stairs leading to
the gallery. Billy runs across the film set, which seems not to
have been used recently.

Billy reaches a heavy metal door and tries to open it... without
any success. She kicks it.

CINEMA STUDIO - ANOTHER ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The parking lot seen trough the heavy metal bars of a door. It is
darker than before and completely empty. Close-up shot on an big
padlock and a thick chain set across the bars of the door.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

We hear very loud rock music.

Close shot on the gas stove. Ground meat is cooking in a frying
pan. Chopped onions are being poured into another frying pan from
a wooden cutting board.

Andy is spraying some spices on the meat. He is wearing an apron
tied around his waist. He tastes his «cuisine» from a spoon. He is
bobbing up an down in rhythm with the music. Andy makes the round
spice rack spin around very fast and picks up a jar from the rack.
Then he pours spices from two different jars with both hands, in
rhythm with the music, miming a drummer beating his drums with his
sticks. Then he pours tomato sauce from a can into a saucepan. He
throws the empty can away.

       ANDY
       Yeah !

He takes another spice jar. But the lid of the jar comes off, and
all the spices fall down into the meat. He puts the empty jar
down.

       ANDY
       Damn !

He takes the lid off the meat. We hear the phone ringing. Andy
lowers the volume of the music from the radio set hanging on the
wall. The phone is still ringing.

       ANDY
       Honey ! Honey, can you get that ?

Andy takes the meat frying pan out of the stove to pour the meat
into the onions frying pan.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The kitchen seen from the dark living room. There is no door
between kitchen and living room, just a wide open arch. The phone
is still ringing. Andy turns around.

       ANDY
       Honey !

       KAREN (voice over)
       I'm in the shower !

Andy puts the frying pan back on the stove and runs in the living-
room. He picks up the phone from a table.

       ANDY
       Hello ?... Hello ?

Close dark shot of Billy with the telephone handset to her ear.
She taps on the microphone of the handset. The telephone set is on
a small shelf fixed on the wall.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Even if the volume of the radio has been lowered, it is still loud
enough for Andy not to be able to hear Billy's tapping. A hissing
sound, coming from the kitchen, makes him turn around.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

On the stove, a big stew pot is hissing, and water is leaking
between the lid and the pot.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Andy takes the telephone set and runs toward the kitchen. But the
cord is a bit too short and is stretched tight just when he
reaches the kitchen. He drops the telephone set on the floor.

       ANDY
       Hello ?

He tries to reach the stove control panel while still holding the
telephone handset to his ear.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

of the kitchen.

building near the river.

Fade in to :

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

Andy is setting some food on a plate on the small table. The music
is off. We hear the waiting tone of the telephone.

       KAREN (voice over)
       Didn't it even cross your mind ?

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen is seated at the table, holding the telephone handset to her
ear. We still hear the waiting tone. The telephone set is beside
her on the table, where three candles are burning in three
candlesticks.

       KAREN
       It could've been Billy.

       ANDY (voice over from the kitchen)
       I was thinking about dinner.

Full shot of the room, with Karen seated at the table, and Andy in
the kitchen in the background, still fixing dinner.

       ANDY
       I'm still thinking about dinner.

       KAREN
       She's not there either. Shit.

She shuts the telephone by pressing on the hook, still keeping the
handset to her ear. We ear the long tone of the telephone.

       KAREN
       Okay. Ohh !

She dials another number.

CINEMA STUDIO - BILLY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT

There are no light, and the room is completely dark. We hardly see
a huge bear and a bat. The camera pans on the right, tilting
slightly down. The camera comes to Billy, seated behind a desk and
dialing on a telephone set. She puts the handset to her ear, but
only gets a busy tone. She puts the phone down on its hook.

Documents are scattered on the desk. A draught makes one of the
documents fly away. Billy looks surprised by what just happened.
Some more papers fly away. She looks on her right at a door with
frosted small window panes, which closes shut by itself.
On the top of the door, a small bell is ringing.

Billy looks at the door and stands up

CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

A long dark corridor. A door opens on the right, ringing the small
bell. It's the door of Billy's workshop. Billy walks out of the
room. In the dark, we only see the dark outline of her figure. She
stops, not sure about where she is going to go next. Eventually,
she starts walking slowly. She stops again when she hears voices
speaking in Russian. Then she starts walking again.

A metal door with a notice hanging from the handle. Zoom on the
notice, on which something is written in Russian. Actually, it is
an elevator door.

CINEMA STUDIO - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy peeks from behind the elevator door to look at what is going
on down below.

High angle shot of the elevator shaft. We hear voices speaking in
Russian and we see some light at the bottom of the shaft, where
the cabin is.

Billy is still peeking into the elevator shaft. A draught is
waving her hair. She moves away.

CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy closes the door of the elevator. She walks toward the
staircase, and starts walking downstairs. Through the open door of
the staircase, we see her stopping, because she just heard a faint
sound of a telephone ringing.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
Karen is still seated behind the table and listening to a
telephone which keeps on ringing without any answer. Andy walks
slowly toward the table, coming from the kitchen. Karen looks very
nervous. Suddenly we hear a clicking noise in the telephone.

       KAREN
       Hello, Billy !

Karen looks up at Andy.

       KAREN
       Thank God. She's there. Are you all right ?

       ANDY
       Ask her about the mask.

Karen shushes Andy with her hand.

       KAREN
       You want to tap something through ?
CINEMA STUDIO - BILLY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy is holding the telephone next to her ear. She taps on the
microphone with her finger.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen has the telephone handset squeezed between her head and her
shoulder.

       KAREN
       Wait. Wait. Wait.

Andy turns around because he just heard a hissing noise in the
kitchen. He runs toward the stove.

       ANDY
       Oh, man !

       KAREN (voice over)
       A...O...

       ANDY
       Oh, man !

In the kitchen, Andy tries to save his cooking.

       KAREN
       ...L ?

Andy puts his frying pan down into a large white plastic can full
of water, where it starts hissing.

       ANDY
       Man ! Oh, man !

       KAREN
       Was it L ? The second letter, was it L ?
Karen shushes Andy with her hand.

       ANDY
       Shit !

Andy is getting his frying pan out of the plastic can.

       KAREN
       A-L-L ?

While Karen is trying to understand her sister's message, Andy is
banging the frying pan on the side of the can, to get rid of
everything that was inside it.

       KAREN
       O...kay !

She smiles.

In the kitchen, Andy looks at his empty frying pan.
       ANDY
       We're eating out tonight.

       KAREN
       Okay. So are you coming over now ?

CINEMA STUDIO - BILLY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy keeps on tapping on the microphone.

       KAREN (voice over on the telephone)
       Do you have the mask ?

Billy taps again.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

       KAREN
       Well, don't worry. Just get over here.

       ANDY
       You hungry ?

       KAREN
       Bye.

Andy throws the frying pan in the can of water, where it hisses
again. Karen looks at Andy, puts the telephone down and makes a
face.

CINEMA STUDIO - STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy is running downstairs.

CINEMA STUDIO - A FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

The entrance of a film set. We hear some giggles. The door opens,
Billy enters and closes the door behind her.
In the background, spotlights are switched on above a scenery :
apparently, someone is shooting a film. Billy walks noiselessly
across the empty part of the set. As Billy comes closer to the lit
part of the set, we hear strange noises that sound like a woman
having an orgasm.

With Billy in the background, we see a camera with an operator
behind it.

On a bed, two actors are having sex. The female, a blonde woman,
is naked, the male has his pants down to his ankles and is wearing
a T-shirt and a white mask.

Billy looks slightly embarrassed by what she sees.

Close shot on the face of the camera operator, looking into the
viewfinder of his camera. He is Lyosha, the young man who was
courting Billy.

The blonde naked woman is moaning. She is a slightly plump woman
with hair too blonde to be true. She could be in her forties.
Billy, still looking slightly embarrassed, is also smiling.

The woman is faking a very strong orgasm.

       LYOSHA (voice over)
       Stop ! Stop ! Stop !

The woman instantly stops faking her orgasm and gets up from the
bed. Lyosha talks in Russian to the woman, who is still lying on
the bed. Her «lover», lying on the woman, is answering Lyosha in
Russian.

Lyosha looks back into his viewfinder.

We hear the woman, moaning again. Billy walks around the set.

Close shot on the face of the «lover». He is wearing the mask
Billy has been looking for. In the background behind the man, we
see Billy, looking from behind an open window in the scenery.

Lyosha looks up from his viewfinder, then back again into it.

The woman's «lover» slaps her gently on the face, but keeps on
having sex with her. The man slaps her again but much harder this
time. She screams.

Billy looks surprised by what she sees.

The man holds the woman down on the bed with both hands. He slaps
her very hard several times and then hits her with his fist.

Billy closes her eyes, disgusted by what she sees. We hear the
woman being hit and screaming.

The woman seems very surprised by what is happening to her. The
man keeps on hitting her. She tries to cover her face from the
blows she is getting repeatedly.
Lyosha smiles, looking very happy with what is happening on the
set.

The woman tries to get the man away from her. She grabs his mask
and throws it away. Underneath the mask, the man has another black
very close-fitting fabric mask hiding his face, which could be a
black stocking. He grabs both her hands with one of his hands, and
holds them above her head. Then he takes a black strong ribbon
from under the bed and ties her hands with it. The woman is now
very frightened and tries to get free. The man slaps her very
hard.

Close shot on a pillow being lifted by the hand of the man. Under
the pillow, there is a long very sharp knife.

Billy can't believe what she sees.

The man takes the knife and slowly lifts the knife above his head.

Billy looks more and more frightened. She has tears in her eyes.
She is crying silently with her fist in her mouth.
The man start stabbing the woman. Her blood is splashing on the
wall and the man's T-shirt. The woman is covered with her own
blood.

Billy starts walking away from the window and across the set.

The woman doesn't seem to move anymore, but the man is still
stabbing her.

Billy walks backward across the set and she bumps into a hatstand
which falls down. Everything that was in the open purse hanging on
the hatstand - hairbrush, keys, lighter, make-up things, etc. -
falls on the floor. A plastic diskette-case skids on the floor and
slips under a big wooden wardrobe.

Lyosha, alerted by the noise, stands up from his camera.

Billy is kneeling on the floor near the fallen hatstand.

Lyosha goes back to his camera.

Billy, kneeling on the floor, puts everything back into the purse.
Then she stands up, puts the hatstand back on its legs and walks
away from it. She hides behind the large wooden wardrobe. Lyosha
walks slowly toward the place where Billy is hiding. Billy walks
away and Lyosha stops near the hatstand.

CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

The long dark corridor. In the foreground on the left, the
staircase, the only part of the set where there is light
(apparently coming from the windows and the street lights). Billy
is running upstairs. She enters the corridor, where she starts
running, just when Lyosha appears in the staircase, running after
Billy. When he reaches the landing, Lyosha switches on the lights
in the corridor. Just before Lyosha enters the corridor, in the
background, we see Billy hiding in a nook, a small partition, in
the corridor.

Lyosha looks for her. Billy seems suddenly interested by something
up on the wall across from her. It is a sign for an emergency
exit. Billy looks in the direction the sign is pointing at. It is
the emergency exit.

Lyosha is coming toward Billy's hiding. He stops to listen for a
meaningful noise. He opens a door to look into a room. Billy peeks
from behind her hiding nook. She runs toward the emergency exit,
which is located toward the end of the long corridor.

The open door, and just behind it, Lyosha looking into the room.
He switches the light off, just as Billy reaches the emergency
exit. He walks out of the room, and closes slowly the door behind
him. He looks at the far end of the corridor.

       LYOSHA
       Hey !

He walks a couple of steps and stops. He turns around and says a
few words in Russian.
Billy is hiding behind a big red vending machine at the far end of
the corridor. Lyosha looks around him and Billy looks at the
emergency exit.

Close shot on the handle of the emergency door. Then the camera
pans on the left and stops on the red emergency box, with the door
key inside. Near the key, is posted a long notice in Russian.

Lyosha walks slowly toward Billy. He tries to open a door, but it
is locked. We hear him talking in Russian.

Billy is still hidden behind the red vending machine.

       LYOSHA
       Hello ?

Lyosha keeps on walking slowly toward Billy.

       LYOSHA
       Is anyone there ?

Lyosha is looking at the far end of the corridor. He crosses
toward a door.

       LYOSHA
       I can explain.

He opens the door and walks inside the room.

Billy peeks cautiously from behind the machine, and sees the open
door. She runs toward the emergency exit. She breaks the glass
with her hand and grabs the key.

       LYOSHA (voice over)
       Ho ?

Billy runs back toward the vending machine, behind which she hides
again.

Lyosha walks out of the room, leaving the door open, and looks at
the far end of the corridor.

Billy is still hidden behind the vending machine. Lyosha is coming
toward her. Billy moves slowly along the wall, keeping her back as
close as possible of the wall. She opens a door and enters a dark
room. She closes the door behind her.

Lyosha reaches the vending machine, and starts running toward the
emergency exit. He stops near the emergency box with its broken
glass. He looks inside the emergency box. His finger comes out of
the box, with the tip covered with Billy's blood. He tries to open
the emergency door, which is locked.

CINEMA STUDIO - STORE ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

A dark store room, with large windows. The door opens and Lyosha
walks in. He runs to the window. He looks outside, but seeing
nothing significant, he turns around and walks a couple of steps
inside the room. He stops and looks around. He starts walking
again across the room. Suddenly something catches his eye.

Close shot on the bottom of a long drape. There is a thin space
between the bottom of the drape and the floor. And on this thin
space, the tip of a shoe is showing. Lyosha walks slowly toward
the drape. He pulls the drape open with a very quick movement.
Several racks of shoes were actually hidden by the drape.

CINEMA STUDIO - BILLY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT

A door opens in the back of the room and Billy walks in the room.
There is some light coming from the door. Billy walks to the main
door of the room and opens it. She raises her arm and grabs the
bell at the top of the door to silence it. She walks out of the
room.

CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

The long corridor. The lights are still on. Billy walks out of her
workshop and closes the door. She starts running along the
corridor toward the emergency exit. She suddenly stops, when she
hears a door opening. She runs back toward the staircase and hides
near the entrance of the staircase. In the background, we see
Lyosha coming out of a room. The camera pans toward the staircase
and Billy. A door opens on the floor below, and the large shadow
of a man is projected on the wall of the staircase. Billy runs on
the other side of the landing, while the man starts climbing the
stairs. He is Arkadi, the electrician working on Andy's film, and
the one who was playing with a spotlight on Billy's face. He is
bare-chested, which makes us believe he was the poor actress'
murderer. He reaches the landing and stops.

Billy is still hiding in a dark corner. She sees Arkadi coming on
the landing.

       ARKADI
       Lyosha !
Lyosha is coming to meet Arkadi. They speak in Russian.

Billy looks at the two men, then she moves silently away from
them. She reaches the door of the elevator, which is supposed to
be out of order, and opens it. She puts the key of the emergency
exit door in her mouth, and start climbing down the elevator shaft
emergency ladder.

CINEMA STUDIO - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy climbs down the emergency ladder, trying not to miss the
steps.

Her face is now on the level of the bottom of the door of the
elevator. There is a small gap between the bottom of the door and
the floor, which enables Billy to peek at what is going on in the
corridor.

A shoe appears in the gap between the door and the floor.

Close shot on the small window at the top of the elevator door.
Arkadi's face appears in the window. He looks around inside the
elevator shaft.

Billy is not in front of the gap anymore, but hiding in the dark.
She puts the key in front of the gap.

Arkadi tries to open the door of the elevator. But it is locked.
The blood on his hand proves that Arkadi was actually the poor
actress' murderer. Through the small window, he looks around in
the shaft.

Billy tries not to be seen through the gap.

Arkadi still looks around in the shaft. He turns his head to talk
in Russian to Lyosha.

Billy has got the key back between her teeth. We hear the two men
talking in Russian.

Arkadi's face moves away from the window. Some lights are switched
off, making the window slightly darker.

Billy moves away from the wall of the shaft and falls. She catches
the elevator cables.

Close shot on Billy's face. She is holding the cables. She makes a
face because of the pain. She doesn't have the key in her mouth
anymore.

Close shot on a concrete ledge somewhere along the shaft. The
emergency door key drops on it, then moves away from it.

Billy is trying to climb back up to the door.

We see the elevator cabin at the bottom the shaft, and Billy in
the foreground, trying to climb back up. There is some light in
the cabin. We hear some strange noise in the shaft. Billy looks
down at where the noise is coming from.
Close shot on the key, seen through the chicken wire roof of the
cabin, and resting on the floor of the cabin.

Billy, still holding the cables, starts going slowly down. She
misses a step but holds on the cables. She keeps on going down the
shaft. She eventually reaches the roof of the cabin. We hear
muffled voices talking in Russian.

Billy sits down on the roof of the cabin to rest a little. Through
the chicken wire that covers the roof of the cabin, she sees the
key on the floor of the cabin. She tries to open a panel in the
chicken wire. It is stuck but she eventually succeeds in opening
it. She moves the panel on its hinges and rests it against the
wall. We still hear the muffled voices talking in Russian. Billy
starts climbing down in the opening in the chicken wire.

Billy drops down on the floor of the cabin. The front door of the
cabin is wide open showing the well lit store room in front of the
cabin. But the cabin is not completely at the same level as the
room : it is slightly higher. We hear banging noises in the
background.
Billy looks at the room and is suddenly frightened by something.
She stands up and looks up at the roof of the cabin. She climbs
back toward the roof. We see Lyosha in the room, walking toward
the elevator.

Lyosha is coming closer, carrying a large plastic trash bag on his
shoulder. When he reaches the elevator, he takes the bag down from
his shoulder, and drops it in the gap between the bottom of the
cabin and the floor of the room. The plastic bag drops down to the
bottom of the shaft.

Billy, lying on the roof of the cabin, is looking through the
chicken wire.

Arkadi is walking toward the elevator, carrying a bag on his
shoulder, and pulling another one on the floor.

Close shot on the key, which was not actually on the floor of the
cabin, but on the floor of the room, just outside the cabin. The
plastic bag, pushed by Arkadi under the cabin, pushes the key in
the gap.

Lyosha and Arkadi are standing just outside the cabin. Lyosha is
pushing another bag in the gap. The two men then walk away from
the cabin.

Billy climbs down from the roof of he cabin and stands up on the
cabin floor. Seeing Lyosha, she squats down, but Lyosha walks
away.

Billy climbs out of the cabin. Then she enters the gap and starts
climbing down the shaft, using the emergency ladder.

The bottom of the shaft is full of plastic bags and various
debris. Billy reaches the bottom and steps on the bags. She kneels
down and starts searching for her key. Suddenly, we hear a very
loud noise. Billy, startled by the noise, stands up.
Lyosha is looking through the gap at the bottom of the shaft. He
turns around and talks in Russian to Arkadi.

       LYOSHA
       Arkadi !

Billy is hiding among the plastic bags.

Lyosha is still calling Arkadi.

       LYOSHA
       Arkadi !

He talks to him in Russian.

Arkadi comes near Lyosha with a powerful flashlight, and, with it,
he looks into the bottom of the shaft. The light from the
flashlight is playing on the bags.

Close shot of Billy's face, hidden among the bags. The light moves
near Billy's face, then moves to a transparent bag, near Billy,
with a head inside. Billy looks up at the bag. She screams
noiselessly. Suddenly she turns around, because she has seen
something else.

Close shot of the emergency door key, lying among the debris,
brightly lit by Arkadi's flashlight.

Arkadi walks away from the elevator, followed by Lyosha. Before
leaving, they close the outside door of the elevator. After the
door has been closed shut, the elevator shaft becomes completely
dark.

Billy slowly comes out of the bags. She takes the key. Then she
slowly stands up, puts the key in the pocket of her sleeveless
jacket and starts climbing the emergency ladder along the wall of
the shaft. She climbs just a few step to reach the first door, the
basement door.

Close shot of the small window on the door of the elevator, seen
from outside the shaft. Billy's face appears in the window. The
basement is completely dark.

Billy tries to open the door, but it is locked. She bangs on it
with her hand. Then she shakes it violently. She looks up, on the
verge of tears. She sighs. Then she hears some steps.

Arkadi is coming carrying a powerful lamp.

Billy looks very frightened. The light from the lamp plays on her
face.

Billy moves away from the door.

CINEMA STUDIO - BASEMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT
Arkadi walks away in the basement. Billy slowly comes out of the
elevator door and runs away in the opposite direction from Arkadi.
She hides behind a pillar, because she sees Arkadi's lamp in the
background. Arkadi is coming back, and Billy moves around the
pillar to be hidden from Arkadi's eyes. Arkadi stops near the
elevator. He opens the elevator's door.

Billy runs away. She trips on something and makes a little noise.
She stops.

Arkadi, coming out of the elevator, looks in Billy's direction.

Billy opens a door and walks out.

Arkadi slowly walks away from the elevator door.

The door closes smoothly behind Billy.

CINEMA STUDIO - STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy is walking rapidly upstairs.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

The door of the set opens and Billy walks in. She walks slowly
through the set, looking around her. Suddenly, the big spotlights
are switched on one by one.

In the electricians' control cabin, we see Lyosha switching the
lights on. More spotlights are switched on.

Billy is running around on the set, trying to avoid the lights.
She reaches the scenery and jumps out of one of the scenery
windows.

A searchlight, controlled by Lyosha. The searchlight is following
Billy.
Billy tries to avoid the searchlight. She runs away toward the
exit of the set. She meets Arkadi coming back on the set, but she
keeps on running.

       ARKADI
       Billy !

Billy starts climbing a ladder, but before climbing, she pushes a
heavy piece of furniture to block the bottom of the ladder. The
piece of furniture falling down makes other props fall down.
Arkadi starts moving the props out of his way. He reaches the
bottom the ladder.

       ARKADI
       Wait. I explain.

He starts climbing the ladder, turning his head around to yell :

       ARKADI
       Lyosha !
In the electricians' control cabin, hearing his name, Lyosha looks
outside the cabin.

       ARKADI (voice over)
       Lyosha !

He says a few words in Russian.

A gallery near the ceiling of the set. Billy is running along the
gallery.

Lyosha runs out of the electricians' control cabin and on the
gallery.

Billy runs down a few steps and outside the room. From the other
side of the gallery, Lyosha comes running after her.

CINEMA STUDIO - STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT

Lyosha runs downstairs.

CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

The long dark corridor, with the staircase in the foreground.
Lyosha runs in the corridor from the staircase, but before
entering the corridor, he switches the lights on. With the lights
on, we can see Billy running away to the far end of the corridor.
Lyosha runs after her.

Zoom on the emergency door, coming closer to us.

Billy is running toward the door.

Billy puts the key in the keyhole. She opens the emergency door
and shuts it behind her.

Lyosha runs toward the door. He pushes it open.
CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The other side of the door, opening on a small gallery leading to
the emergency ladders set along the exterior wall of the building.

The door is been violently pushed open by Lyosha. With Lyosha's
violent push, Billy falls backward, above the balcony of the
gallery and down on the yard below.

Billy falls on her back on a huge pile of used film metal boxes.

Lyosha bends over the balcony and looks down at Billy.

Billy is lying among the boxes and moves her head.

A blurred dark picture with lights dancing around. It is what
Billy's eyes are seeing when she tries to focus after her fall.
She sees the blurred picture of Lyosha running down the emergency
ladder along the wall of the building.

       KAREN (voice over)
       Hello!
The corner of the building. A shadow is moving hidden by the
building.

       KAREN (voice over)
       Hello ?

Lyosha is bending over Billy. When he hears Karen's voice, he
looks up.

       KAREN (voice over)
       Is anybody there ?

Karen appears at the corner of the building, looking around.

       LYOSHA
       Come here, quickly !

Karen runs toward them.

       KAREN
       Oh, my God, Billy.

       LYOSHA
       Quickly !

Karen runs toward Billy, still lying on the film boxes in the
foreground. She bends over her.

       KAREN
       What did happen ?

       LYOSHA
       I don't know.

Lyosha looks up at the gallery where Billy fell from.

       LYOSHA
       She slipped and fall bad. Poor Billy.

Karen yells in Andy's direction.

       KAREN
       Andy, she's at the back !

       LYOSHA
       Get the doctor, quickly.

       KAREN
       You go. I'll stay here with her.

Billy is trying to say something to her sister.

       KAREN
       Let go of her.

       LYOSHA
       No, I must hold her. She must not move.

Lyosha's hand is restraining Billy's arm.
       LYOSHA
       Danger she'll never walk again if she move.

Billy is moving nervously, trying to get her arm free to talk to
her sister.

       LYOSHA
       Go !

       KAREN
       Yeah, okay.

Billy tries to move her hand away from Lyosha and bangs on a film
box.

       KAREN (yelling in voice over)
       Andy !

She bends over Billy.

       KAREN
       Billy !... Billy, you mustn't move... You may become
       paralyzed. It's dangerous... Don't worry. I'll be right
       back... I promise.

Karen starts moving away from Billy

       KAREN
       Andy !

Billy moves nervously, raises from the film boxes and looks
desperately at Karen.

Karen just saw Billy's last expression and seems worried.

Billy is trying to articulate some words.
Karen runs back toward Billy. She reaches the pile of film boxes
and bend over Billy. She looks at Lyosha.

Andy is walking toward them.

       ANDY
       What's going on ?

Karen turns toward Andy.

       KAREN
       Andy, go with the janitor...

Lyosha seems worried.

       KAREN (voice over)
       ...and fetch an ambulance !

Andy joined the janitor with his dog.

       KAREN (voice over)
       Billy's had an accident.
       ANDY
       What ?

Lyosha says something in Russian to the janitor.

       KAREN (voice over)
       Don't just stand there !

Karen looks at Andy.

       KAREN
       Do it now !

The dog barks. Andy turns toward the janitor

       ANDY
       Ambulance !

The janitor answers in Russian. The dog keeps on barking. Andy
pushes the janitor toward his office.

       ANDY
       Come on !

They both walk away.

Karen bends over Billy.

       KAREN
       It's all right, sweetie.

Billy is still moving restlessly.

       KAREN
       I'm here now and an ambulance is on its way.

Karen pushes Lyosha's hand away.
       KAREN
       Let go of her. She's trying to say something.

Lyosha stands up. Billy talks to Karen with her hand.

       KAREN
       Police ?

Billy keeps on signing.

       KAREN
       Murder ?

She looks up at Lyosha.

Lyosha shrugs his shoulders and makes a face that means he doesn't
know what Billy is talking about.

       KAREN
       Andy ! Andy !
CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

This the set where the poor actress was brutally murdered.

Billy is seated between Karen and Andy. She has a disoriented look
on her face, and a blanket is wrapped around her shoulders. Karen
is tenderly stroking Billy's shoulder. We hear some laughing and
people talking in Russian.

Lyosha and Arkadi are talking to an uniformed Russian policeman,
who seems to be in charge of the inquiry. Consequently, he will
be, from now on, mentioned as «First Policeman»

The other policeman (who shall be mentioned as «Second Policeman»)
is kneeling down, looking at something on the floor, and the
janitor is standing in a corner with his dog on a leash.

Lyosha, Arkadi and the first policeman are still talking together.
They slowly walk toward the rest of the group. The second
policeman, who was still kneeling down, stands up.

Billy is listening to Lyosha, apparently trying to lip-read and
understand what he says. Lyosha turns toward her.

       LYOSHA
       Excuse me. It's true. We just fake murder. If we really
       want to murder...

The two uniformed policemen are listening to Lyosha.

       LYOSHA (voice over)
       ...why make film of it ?

Lyosha and Arkadi both laugh.

       LYOSHA
       We're not stupid, really.
The janitor is trying to follow the conversation. We hear a
policeman talking in Russian.

Arkadi answers in Russian.

Arkadi must have said something funny, because the policemen are
laughing.

Lyosha and Arkadi look at Billy.

       ARKADI
       No, no. Sorry.

Billy doesn't look at Arkadi, but Karen does.

       ARKADI (voice over)
       We understand how she feel. She think she see...

Back to Lyosha and Arkadi

       ARKADI
       ...a real murder and panic.
Billy taps on Karen's arm. Karen looks up at Arkadi.

The first policeman looks at the paper he is holding in his hand.

       FIRST POLICEMAN
       Where did you see the murder from ?

Billy stands up and, pointing her finger, shows where she was
during the murder.

The two policemen both turn around to look at the place Billy is
showing. The second policeman moves away and the first one looks
at his paper.

       FIRST POLICEMAN
       And it was this man ?

He points at Arkadi.

Billy, seated again, points at Arkadi.

Lyosha looks at Arkadi.

The first policeman resumes the reading of his paper.

       FIRST POLICEMAN
       But you say here : «He wore a stocking pulled over his
       head.»

Billy looks very angry and keeps on pointing at Arkadi.

       FIRST POLICEMAN
       «And then they chased me through the building and try to
       kill me as well.»

Arkadi yells something in Russian. Lyosha also says something in
Russian, but with a quieter voice.
       ANDY
       Guys ! Guys ! English, please.

Arkadi stops yelling. Lyosha speaks to him. Arkadi pushes him
away.

       ARKADI
       We make test for you.

The first policeman looks at Arkadi, and then at Billy.

       ARKADI
       For your film. We try make blood much big.

Andy looks at Arkadi and then at Billy.

Close shot on Billy, enabling us to read her words on her lips.

       BILLY (in sign language)
       He's lying !
       LYOSHA (voice over)
       Sorry, Billy.

Billy looks at Lyosha

       LYOSHA
       We not tell you. Keep secret not to hurt your feelings.

       ANDY
       I would've let you done tests.

Karen slaps Andy.

       KAREN (whispering)
       Andy.

Karen tries to tell silently to Andy to shut up.

       ANDY
       What I mean is... What I mean is... Let's see their film.
       I'll know if it's real.

Billy nods her head, approving what Andy just said.

       FIRST POLICEMAN (voice over)
       You're right.

The first policeman looks at the two men, and speaks in Russian to
them.

Arkadi and Lyosha both look slightly embarrassed. Lyosha starts
walking away.

Karen looks, with a worried eye, to the departing Lyosha.

       KAREN
       Wait. Stop !
Karen runs after Lyosha.

       KAREN
       He could expose the film.

The first policeman takes Lyosha's arm and talks to him in
Russian.

       FIRST POLICEMAN
       Let her do it. Please.

       KAREN
       Okay.

Karen starts working on the hermetic bag used as a portable dark
room. Karen puts her arms inside the bag.

       KAREN
       This lets you unload the film without needing a darkroom.

       FIRST POLICEMAN
       I see.
Close shot on Arkadi's face. He looks very menacing.

Andy starts taking his jacket off.

       ANDY (whispering)
       God, it's hot in here.

In the background, Arkadi is bending down on something we don't
see. He looks up at Karen.

       KAREN (voice over)
       If he had exposed the film to the light, he could have
       destroyed all the evidence.

Billy looks at Arkadi, still busy doing something that we don't
see.

       KAREN (voice over)
       Actually, I haven't done this since film school.

Arkadi stands up from whatever he was doing.

       KAREN (voice over)
       Right. It's safe in the can now.

Arkadi walks around the group.

       KAREN (voice over)
       Here. Take it to the lab immediately...

Close shot on Arkadi walking away.

       KAREN (voice over)
       ...for developing.

Billy, who understands something wrong is going on with Arkadi,
stamps her feet.
Karen gives the film to the first policeman.

       KAREN
       It's okay... It's okay.

Arkadi is walking slowly with something that looks like a knife in
his hand. We hear Billy clapping her hands. Andy turns around to
look at Billy.

Billy points to Arkadi and tries to explain something in sign
language.

Karen looks at Billy.

       KAREN
       Murder weapon ? Where ?

Arkadi grabs Andy and pushes him against the wall.

Karen screams.
Arkadi stabs Andy in the stomach with his knife. Andy screams. He
has blood on his cheek. Arkadi keeps on stabbing Andy.

The first policeman takes his gun out of his belt.

Both policemen grab Arkadi from behind. They pull him away from
Andy. They have both drown their guns.

Karen rushes toward Andy, whose shirt is covered with blood.

Karadi, still restrained by the two policemen, is yelling in
Russian.

       LYOSHA (voice over)
       Stop. Stop. Stop!

Arkadi drops his knife, and it remains attached to his wrist by a
plastic tube. Actually, it was a fake prop knife.

Andy stutters, trying to explain something to Karen.

       ANDY
       I'm...

       KAREN
       What ?

       ANDY
       I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

       KAREN
       You...

       ANDY
       Oh, my God!

Karadi shows the knife to the policemen. He makes the retractable
blade work, to prove it is harmless.
Billy walks to her trunk and notices that the padlock on the lid
has been broken. She opens the trunk. She takes the fake blood can
out of the trunk : it is almost empty.

The policemen taste the fake blood.

       FIRST POLICEMAN
       Tastes sweet.

       ANDY
       It's for the actors. They put the stuff in their mouths.

Billy stamps her foot. They all turn toward her. She explains
something in sign language.

       FIRST POLICEMAN
       What she say ?

       KAREN
       That it's her knife. They broke into her box and used all
       the blood.
       FIRST POLICEMAN
       So now she say it was a trick.

Billy keeps on talking in sign language. Karen translates.

       KAREN
       It happened so fast she couldn't see the knife clearly.

       FIRST POLICEMAN
       But everything else she saw tonight was clear ? Huh ?

Billy keeps on talking in sign language. Karen translates.

       KAREN
       The body in the elevator shaft. She saw that.

Billy points to the elevator door.

CINEMA STUDIO - BASEMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT

They are all walking in the basements toward the elevator. Several
of them are carrying torches. Billy is still wrapped in the
blanket.

They reach the elevator and Arkadi opens the door. The first
policeman points his torch in the bottom of the elevator shaft.
The dog barks. The janitor tries to calm it down. There are many
plastic trash bags scattered in the bottom of the shaft. The first
policeman talks in Russian to the second one. Apparently, he asks
him to go down to the bottom of the shaft and look at the bags.
The second policeman doesn't look very happy to do it.

But he does go down in the shaft, and starts looking into the
bags. He even pours the content of the first one out of the bag.
But there are only trashes in the bag.

Arkadi and Lyosha look at each other.
The second policeman finds a bloody sheet in a bag.

Lyosha talks to him in Russian. And the first policeman apparently
tells him to do what Lyosha just asked

Reluctantly, he second policeman tastes the blood on the sheet. He
smiles and says a word in Russian.

The first policeman repeats that word to Lyosha

       KAREN
       What ?

       ANDY
       What ? What ?

       FIRST POLICEMAN
       Sweet. It is fake blood.

       ANDY
       It's fake blood.
       KAREN
       They could have soaked the sheets in fake blood afterwards.

       FIRST POLICEMAN
       But... where is the body ? Huh ?

The second policeman keeps looking through the trash bags.

The first policeman shows the paper, he is still holding, to
Billy.

       FIRST POLICEMAN
       Here you say, "A head cut off."

The second policeman has just emptied another bag. He makes a sign
meaning «Nothing significant» and talks in Russian.

Arkadi answers something that makes Lyosha and the two policemen
laugh.

Billy says something in sign language.

       KAREN
       Oh ! Wait. Wait. Ah ! She says... Well, there were more
       bags in there before.

The first policeman seems a bit fed up with Billy.

       ARKADI
       No, she's right. I will show you.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

They are all coming out of the basement on a ramp that reaches the
yard and the parking lot around the building. Arkadi is leading
them.
       ARKADI
       From lift shaft we take the rubbish here. Fast. Easy.

The janitor says something in Russian. They have reached the large
plastic trash containers where all the trashes from the studio are
dropped off, waiting for the garbage collectors to take them away.
The second policeman raises the lid of a container, while the
first policeman looks inside. Arkadi takes a bag out of another
container and drops it on the ground. The second policeman looks
inside the bag with his flashlight. There seems to be a head
inside the bag. The policeman pours the content of the bag on the
ground. Actually the head was just a mask !

       ANDY
       Hey, we need that.

He picks up the mask from the rubbish. He wipes it with his hand.
The first policeman gives his card to both Billy and Karen.

       FIRST POLICEMAN
       Sorry, I can do nothing for you now. But I will call you
       after I see the film. Okay ? Sorry.
He walks away. The second policeman shakes hands with Arkadi and
Lyosha and goes away with his chief.

Billy rests her head on Karen's shoulder.

Lyosha looks at her, shrugs and smiles.

ANDY'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close up shot on Billy's face, seated in the back of the car. She
looks very sad and disappointed.

Andy is driving, with Karen seated next to him.

       ANDY
       Well, I've never been more embarrassed in my entire life.

       KAREN
       I don't get it. I mean, Billy's a pro. She'd know the
       difference between a real murder and a gag.

       ANDY
       Please, has she even seen a real murder ?

       KAREN
       That's my point. If what she saw tonight was real, then she
       has seen the difference, right ?

       ANDY
       Oh, come on, honey. We all bought the guy cutting me up
       tonight. Even I believed it.

       KAREN
       Because you're a wuss.

She laughs.
       ANDY
       I'm gonna let that slide.

Karen looks at Billy.

       ANDY
       No offense, Billy, but I'd like to re-shoot the stuff today
       using that guy's knife.

       KAREN
       It was her knife. God !

A very short flash-back sequence of the murder of the actress.

       ANDY
       Whatever. It looked good.

Another very short flash-back. We understand those short flash-
backs come from Billy's mind reliving what she saw a couple of
hours before.

Karen, looking at Billy, seems to understand what's going on
inside her sister's head, because she says to Andy :

       KAREN
       Shut up.

More short flash-backs of the murder, and a close-up shot on
Billy's face. She seems very disturbed.

CINEMA STUDIO - BASEMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT

The janitor is patrolling the basement with his dog. He is
carrying an electric torch.

He checks a heavy metal door, which is closed.

While he is checking the door, the dog runs away.

The janitor looks around him.

       JANITOR
       Buka !

He is apparently calling his dog, but he gets no answer. He starts
looking around.

He reaches the door of the incinerator. We hear the noise of the
incinerator, and we see its light on the janitor's face. The
janitor seems surprises that the incinerator is working so late in
the night. We hear the dog whining.

       JANITOR
       Buka ?

The janitor enters the incinerator room. He walks slowly around
until he reaches the incinerator. The incinerator door is slightly
open. He looks inside.

Close shot of the inside of the incinerator. Among the flames, a
human skull is burning.

The janitor walks backward with a terrified look on his face. He
trips on something and falls down.

Close shot on the fallen flashlight rolling around. In the light,
we see a pair of boots, belonging to a still unknown man, standing
on the floor.

Still lying on the floor, the janitor discovers his dog lying next
to him, and starts patting it. The dog's fur is covered with
blood.

       JANITOR
       Buka.

Arkadi walks toward the janitor.

       JANITOR
       Buka. Buka.

Arkadi raises something we don't clearly see (a knife ?) above his
head and hit the janitor, still lying on the floor.

A RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close up shot of a knife hitting a beefsteak. The directors's idea
was, of course, to give us the impression that it was Arkadi's
knife hitting the poor janitor !

Larger shot of the steak being cut into the plate. We hear some
soft music.

Karen and Andy are seated, side by side, at a table in a
restaurant, with Billy sitting on the other side of the table.
Andy, with his shirt still covered with fake blood, is eating with
an evident good appetite. Billy doesn't seem to be very hungry.
Andy gives his plate to Billy.

       ANDY
       Please, Billy, take some of mine. You'll feel better.

Billy explain silently that she is not hungry. Andy takes his
plate back.

       ANDY
       Okay.

Andy pours a lot of ketchup on his steak.

Billy says something in sign language. Karen looks at her, while
Andy drinks his wine. Billy keeps on «talking».

       ANDY
       Could you pass me the salt, please ?

Karen gives the salt to Andy.

       KAREN
       You could at least make the effort.
Andy stops eating, looks at Billy drinking water and then at
Karen.

       ANDY
       Listen... I'm sorry. All I can think about now is the
       movie, but as soon as we get back, I promise, I'll learn.

He starts eating his steak again.

       KAREN
       How often have I heard that ?

       ANDY
       Come on. I can understand some of what she's saying.

       KAREN
       What ?

Andy puts his fork and knife down.

       ANDY
       Okay, how about this ?

Andy makes a sign.

       ANDY
       Means «makeup», right ?

Billy smiles and nods her head «No».

       KAREN
       Wrong. It means somebody's look, the expression on their
       face.

       ANDY
       That was close.

       KAREN
       What Billy said she'll never forget the look on the girl's
       face tonight from the moment she knew she was gonna die.
       She said the pain and the terror was real. You can't act
       that.

Billy looks at Andy and Karen with a worried face. Andy seems
suddenly a bit worried too.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The chimney of the studio seen from the parking lot in a low-angle
shot. A lot of black smoke is coming out of it, certainly from the
incinerator.

Lyosha is smoking on the ramp leading to the basement, and he,
like the chimney, exhales a lot of smoke, but white one !

The door of the basement opens and Arkadi walks out. There seems
to be a lot of smoke in the basement too. He coughs. Lyosha throws
him a pack of cigarettes, which he catches. He spits, takes a
cigarette out of the pack and lights it.
Two cars are coming toward them. The fist one is a large black
limousine.

Lyosha picks up a small plastic bag.

The cars stop near the ramp. Arkadi and Lyosha walk toward them. A
man gets out of the front passenger door of the second car. He is
Wartschuk, the Big Boss' first assistant. He closes the door and
walks toward Lyosha and Arkadi. Lyosha gives him the plastic bag.
The man says a few words in Russian and nods toward the limousine.
He walks away, but Lyosha doesn't move.

A man is sitting in the back of the limousine, his face hidden in
the dark. He is called «The Reaper» and he is the famous «Big
Boss» of the whole criminal organization, and consequently of
Arkadi and Lyosha.

       THE REAPER
       Come closer, Mr. Hausmann. I won't bite.

Lyosha starts walking slowly toward the car.
       THE REAPER (voice over)
       Did it go smoothly ?

       LYOSHA
       About the money...

       THE REAPER
       Did it go smoothly ?

       LYOSHA
       Yes, of course. No problem.

The Reaper bends slightly, so his face appears in the light.

       THE REAPER
       Did it go smoothly, Mr. Hausmann ?

       LYOSHA
       We did our job. The condition was...

       THE REAPER
       The condition was that everything would go smoothly.

       LYOSHA
       Yes. Yes, and we have your diskette.

       THE REAPER
       And who informed the police ?

       LYOSHA
       American girl say something, but nobody believe her.

       THE REAPER
       As long as there are witnesses, there's no money.

       LYOSHA
       You mean ?...
       THE REAPER
       I think we understand each other, Mr. Hausmann.

The Reaper winds his car window up. Then he sits back in his seat.

Lyosha and Arkadi look at the two cars driving away.

Lyosha gives a folded paper to Arkadi, who unfolds it.

Close up shot on the paper. It shows Billy's address and telephone
number.

A STREET IN MOSCOW - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Low-angle shot on the buildings around the street. Then the camera
tilts down to street level. Andy's car drives toward us and stops.
Billy opens the back door and walks out of the car. Karen opens
the driver's door and walks out. Both sisters close their doors.
Billy starts walking toward her building and Karen follows her.

       KAREN
       No, honestly, you can come back to our place, and we'll set
       up the couch if you want.

Andy has remained in the car.

Billy answers her sister in sign language.

       KAREN
       You're not on one of your «I'll show her how independent I
       am» kicks, are you ?

Andy has got out of the car and is watching the two sister,
leaning on the roof of the car.

       ANDY
       Honey, you coming or what ?

Billy waves to Andy and enters her building. Karen looks at her
sister and then turns toward Andy.

       KAREN
       Andy, don't you care about her ?

Andy looks offended by Karen's words.

       ANDY
       I don't care ? I don't care ? Fine, fine. I'm calling the
       American Embassy tonight, okay ?

Billy has stopped near her building door and is looking at Karen
and Andy's verbal fight.

       KAREN
       It's the weekend. They're closed.

       ANDY
       Not for us. My dad gave me the duty officer's direct number
       before we left, just in case. So say goodbye.
He waves to Billy, who waves back to him. She blows a kiss to her
sister, who blows one back, and enters her building.

POLICE HEADQUARTERS - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

A long corridor. In the foreground, the two uniformed policemen,
who took care of Billy's case, are sitting on a wooden bench. The
second policeman is asleep. The first policeman stands up when he
sees a group of three people, a woman in white coat (like a nurse)
and two men in suit and tie, coming toward them. The first
policeman wakes up the second policeman, who stands up.

One of the men is Mr. Larsen, a high-rank police officer, the
other one is Mr Lovett, the US ambassador's secretary.

The woman in white shows the two policemen to Larsen, then walks
away. Larsen takes his hat off.

       LARSEN
       Mr. Lovett, these are the two officers who answered the
       complaint.
He shakes hands with the two policemen.

       LOVETT
       Good evening, gentlemen.

Lovett shakes hands with the two policemen.

       FIRST POLICEMAN
       Good evening.

       LARSEN
       Please speak English to the ambassador's secretary. My
       chief asked me to meet Mr. Lovett here. If this witness is
       correct about what she saw tonight, she may help my own
       investigation.

       LOVETT
       Your English is quite good, Mr. Larsen.

       LARSEN
       Thank you. My mother was a translator.

       LOVETT
       In the university ?

       LARSEN
       No. KGB.

After Larsen's answer, there is a slight embarrassed silence
between the two men. Fortunately for them, a door opens and a man
in white coat walks out of a room, carrying a film box under his
arm. He talks to Larsen in Russian, and shows him the room where
they have to go. Larsen shows the room to Lovett.

       LARSEN
       Please.
They all follow the technician.

POLICE HEADQUARTERS - PROJECTION ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The door of the projection room opens and Lovett enters, followed
by Larsen.

       LARSEN
       We've been tracking gangsters in Moscow running an
       international pornography and prostitution racket.

The two policemen enters behind them. Larsen shows a seat to
Lovett. The projection room looks like a small cinema theatre,
with rows of red seats.

       LARSEN
       Sit down, please. We have information they have made snuff
       films here and sold them all over the world.

Lovett sits down. Larsen takes his coat off and sits down next to
Lovett. The two policemen sit on the row behind the two men.
       LOVETT
       Snuff film... Is that what I think it is ?

       LARSEN
       Victims believe they are making a sex film, but they are
       murdered in front of the camera.

Larsen turn toward the two policemen.

       LARSEN
       What is the name of the witness ? What is it ?

He snaps his fingers.

       FIRST POLICEMAN
       Billy Hughes, sir.

       LARSEN
       Billy Hughes. Yes. She claims to have seen one being made.

POLICE HEADQUARTERS - PROJECTION CABIN - INTERIOR NIGHT

The technician is setting the film reel on the projector. We can
hear the voices from the room coming through the loudspeaker of
the cabin.

       LARSEN (voice over from the loudspeaker)
       The victims are illegal immigrants exploited as prostitutes
       by a gang headed by one man.

The technician is feeding the film into the projector.

POLICE HEADQUARTERS - PROJECTION ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

       LARSEN
       He is brutal, ruthless. They call him The Reaper.

Larsen is making nervous movements with his hands.
       LARSEN
       I'm surprised his men gave up the film so easily. If it is
       what I think it is, our witness, Billy Hughes, is in great
       danger.

The sequence ends with a close shot on Larsen's worried face.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close up shot on the gas flames of the water heater.

Billy is getting ready to take a bath. She is just wearing a bath
towel wrapped around her body. With her hand, she tests the
temperature of the bath water. She pours some bubble-bath from a
big bottle into the water. We hear the telephone ringing. Billy
turns her head toward the living-room

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The apartment is a bit ancient-looking. It doesn't «look like»
Billy. One can tell it is only a rented apartment for a short
period. Various clothes are scattered around the room.

Billy walks from the bathroom along the corridor to the living-
room. The telephone keeps on ringing.

The telephone and the special answering machine are set on a small
table. Billy picks up the telephone handset and puts it on the
machine. Then she sits down on a chair and puts a pair of earphone
on her ears. Finally, she presses a button on the machine.

Close up shot on the screen of the machine. It looks a bit like a
computer screen. The machine offers the choice between different
sentences :
     «Hello»
     «Hello this is Billy Hughes speaking»
     «I am using a digital voice computer»
     «Please have patience and I will answer»
     «My address is apartment 923 - 126 Kievsky Prospekt»
     «My telephone number is 9205910»
     etc.
Billy chooses the second choice, using a ball-mat. Then she brings
the arrow on an icon to start the machine.

       DIGITAL VOICE
       Hello, this is Billy Hughes speaking.

Momentarily, the scene is seen through a binocular, which makes us
realize that Billy is been spied by someone.

Billy, apparently getting no answer but a deep breathing noise,
chooses the first choice.

       DIGITAL VOICE
       Hello.

A shot on the large bay window makes us guess where the spy is
hiding : somewhere across the street.
       DIGITAL VOICE
       Hello, this is Billy Hughes speaking.

Billy keeps on trying to get an answer.

       DIGITAL VOICE
       Hello.

But she gets only a disconnection tone. She takes the earphone out
of her ears, and puts them on the table. She looks at the window.

Shot on the window, with a zoom on another window across the
street. Behind that window, we see the figure of a man looking at
Billy with binoculars.

Billy seen through the «neighbor's» binoculars. She walks to the
window and pull the drapes to hide the window.

The «spy» sees the drapes being pulled through his binoculars.

POLICE HEADQUARTERS - PROJECTION ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
The same men are still in the projection room. The first policeman
has taken his cap off. And Larsen is now seated in a seat behind
Lovett.

       FIRST POLICEMAN
       Have you seen a... how do you say... snuff film before ?

       LARSEN
       I saw a woman tied to a tree   kept alive while her arms and
       legs were cut off. It's hard   to talk about it, or even
       think about it. And it makes   you sick to watch it. You
       never forget the look in the   victim's eyes. The sheer panic
       and horror when they realize   they're about to die.

Lovett looks very disturbed by what Larsen just told him. The
technician knocks on the window between his cabin and the room.
Larsen and Lovett turn around, and Larsen makes a sign to tell the
technician to start the film. Then he takes a cigarette from the
pack he left on his former seat. The room becomes dark and the
projection starts. The four men watch the film which has no sound.

On the screen of the projection room, we see the sequence when the
young actress, pretending she is dying very slowly, breaks the
whole set.

Lovett and Larsen turn their head toward the cabin.

POLICE HEADQUARTERS - PROJECTION CABIN - INTERIOR NIGHT

The technician is also watching the film through the window
between the two rooms. When he sees Larsen looking at him, he
shrugs to tell him that he is not responsible for what is shown on
the screen.

POLICE HEADQUARTERS - PROJECTION ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Larsen and Lovett turn back to watch the screen.
On the screen, the sequence when the young actress is pulling the
tablecloth away from the table, and also everything that was on
the table.

The two policemen are smiling because they find what they see on
the screen quite funny.

Lovett and Larsen do not smile, because they are disappointed.

Now, on the screen, the actress is pulling the drapes down from
the windows.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen, wearing her night-gown, is seated on the edge of the bed.
We hear Andy talking into the telephone.

       ANDY (voice over)
       Yes, sir... No, sir.

Andy is walking up and down in the next room, carrying the
telephone set in his hand and with the handset on his ear.
       ANDY
       Right... Right... Right, sir. Right, sir. Thank you, Mr.
       Ambassador. So, I really appreciate the call. I'll give Dad
       your best. Right.

He puts the phone down back on its hook.

Karen has a worried look on her face.

       KAREN
       Well ?

       ANDY
       I told you. There's nothing to worry about. He says the
       film's the biggest piece of shit he's ever seen.

Andy is smiling, but Karen still has a worried look on her face.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

High-angle shot of the room, seen from the ceiling. Billy is lying
in her bathtub, surrounded by foam and bubbles. Her eyes are
closed. She slowly puts her head underwater, and leaves just her
face above water.

One of the faucet is leaking and water is dropping from it.

One of the glass panes is broken and fixed with adhesive tape and
newspaper.

He eyes closed, Billy has her daydreams flashbacks again. She sees
the actress' blood spurting on the wall of the scenery. She sees
her being stabbed. She sees herself running away from Lyosha in
the long dark corridor.

Suddenly, she feels drops of blood on her face. And, opening her
eyes, she sees the bloody actress behind the broken glass pane.
She quickly sits up in her bath. She looks at the window, which is
empty. She hears the phone ringing. She stands up in her bath and
takes her bath towel to dry herself.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy opens the bathroom door and walks out and along the
corridor, while drying her hair. She has put a bathrobe on.

She puts the telephone handset on the answering machine. She puts
her earphones on and select an answer.

       DIGITAL VOICE
       Hello, this is Billy Hughes speaking.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen is sitting on the bed, with the telephone handset to her
ear. Andy is lying next to her, asleep.

       KAREN
       Hi, Billy. It's Karen. I hope you weren't sleeping. I just
       wanted to check and see if you're okay.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy smiles, hearing her sister's voice. She start typing on the
keyboard of the answering machine. The she sends the text to the
digital voice translating system.

       DIGITAL VOICE
       I am fine. No need to worry. Did you call earlier ?

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen is still seated on her bed.

       KAREN
       No, I got straight through. You sure you're okay ?

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy starts typing again.

Close up shot on the machine screen. We can read what she is
typing.

       DIGITAL VOICE
       Sure. Had bath. All fine. Now I go to bed. You too.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

       KAREN
       I just wanted to tell you : they saw the film, and it's not
       the real thing.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy is listening to her sister.
       KAREN (voice over from the telephone)
       That's good. Right ?

The doorbell rings. Billy turns her head toward the door.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

       KAREN
       Did I hear something there ?

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy starts typing her answer.

       DIGITAL VOICE
       Doorbell. Wait. I'll see who.

She puts her earphones down, and stands up. We can still hear
faintly Karen's voice coming from the earphones.

       KAREN (voice over from the telephone)
       What ? Ah ! It's almost one o'clock. I wouldn't get that,
       Billy...
       (louder)
       Billy ?

Billy is looking through the peephole on the door.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen is looking worried.

       KAREN
       Billy ? You be careful, now. Check who it is first.

Karen's louder voice has awaken Andy, who sits up.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy is still looking through the peephole.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LANDING OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR - INTERIOR
NIGHT

The landing, just outside Billy's apartment front door, is dark
and empty.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy, still looking in the peephole, moves her head from right to
left, trying to see further on the landing. She slowly moves away
from the door to a small table by the door.

Close up shot on the table, and a business card lying on it. It is
the first policeman's card. It says : «Police Inspector Vladimir
Pekar - Precinct 22» and underneath an address and a telephone
number.

Billy is still standing near the door. She puts the safety chain
on. And then she slowly opens the door. Arkadi appears behind the
door. Billy tries to shut the door, but he puts his foot between
the door and the wall.

       ARKADI
       Please. I want to talk.

Desperately, Billy tries to push the door shut.

Close up on the earphones on the machine keyboard.

       KAREN (voice over from the telephone)
       Billy ?

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen seems very excited.

       KAREN
       Billy, are you still there ?

       ANDY
       Would you leave her alone ?

He lies back in the bed.

       KAREN
       I heard a noise, Andy. Something's happened. I swear.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy is trying to push the door shut. Arkadi has a big wire-
cutter in his hand. He brings the cutter near the chain. Billy
takes an umbrella from the stand near the door, and, with it,
tries to prevent Arkadi from cutting the chain. Arkadi cuts the
tip of the umbrella off. With her slippered foot, Billy kicks
Arkadi's foot still jamming the door, but it doesn't move it off.
Then she takes the heavy metal umbrella stand and hits Arkadi's
foot with it. Arkadi removes his foot from the door. Billy can -
at last - slam the door shut. She leans on it, panting.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen is now very frightened. She yells in the phone.

       KAREN
       Billy !

She puts the phone down and stands up from the bed.

       KAREN
       Okay, that's it. I'm going there.

Andy sits up on the bed.

       ANDY
       What ?

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
Billy is still leaning on the door, panting. We hear the noise of
an electric machine. Billy's eyes widen with horror. She rushes to
the telephone, and starts typing frenetically.

       DIGITAL VOICE
       Karen, help. Call police. Emergency.

Close up shot on the door lock. We can guess that Arkadi is trying
to open the door with a power tool.

Billy puts her earphone on. She hears the disconnection tone. She
presses the disconnection switch on her own telephone.

Close up shot on the door lock. One of the screws holding the lock
pops off and falls on the floor.

Billy is listening to a Russian-speaking female voice in her
earphones. She types on her keyboard.

       THE VOICE ON THE PHONE
       Hello ?... Hello ?
She sends her message.

       DIGITAL VOICE
       Police, emergency.

A few word in Russian and then, more distinctly :

       THE VOICE ON THE PHONE
       Police ?

Billy types «Yes».

       DIGITAL VOICE
       Yes.

Getting a Russian answer, she types «Da»

       DIGITAL VOICE
       Da.

Billy chooses a pre-recorded message, and sends it.

       DIGITAL VOICE
       Hello, my name is Billy Hughes. My address is apartment
       923...

Close up on the lock : another screw just pops off. The telephone
operator keeps on speaking in Russian, apparently not listening to
Billy's message. We hear the power tool working again on the lock.

       DIGITAL VOICE
       ... 126 Kievsky prospekt...

Billy takes her earphones off and rushes out of the room.

       DIGITAL VOICE
       Telephone 9-2-0-9-5-9-1-0...

under Arkadi's tool.

       DIGITAL VOICE
       This is a digital voice computer.

Close up on the answering machine screen. Billy select another
message. She puts her earphones on.
       DIGITAL VOICE
       Please have patience and I will answer.

Apparently, the telephone company found an English-speaking
operator.

       TELEPHONE OPERATOR
       Hello ? You English ?

Billy works frenetically on her answering machine.

       DIGITAL VOICE
       My name is Billy Hughes.

       TELEPHONE OPERATOR
       Yes ? What do you want, please ?

Close up on the screen. Billy is typing a message.

       TELEPHONE OPERATOR
       Hello ?

       DIGITAL VOICE
       Help. Intruder.

But apparently, the operator doesn't speak such a good English

       TELEPHONE OPERATOR
       I no understand. Sorry.

The operator speaks in Russian, certainly to another operator.
Billy types another message.

       DIGITAL VOICE
       Bad man want to kill me.

       TELEPHONE OPERATOR
       Bad man ? I get man who speak English, yes ?
Close up on the lock : another screw pops off.

Billy takes her earphones off and rushes to the light switch. She
puts all the lights of the room at their maximum lighting
capacity.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM WINDOW - EXTERIOR NIGHT

We see Billy's living room window from the outside. Billy is
pulling the drapes wide open. Then she starts waving her arms to
attract the attention of the peeping-Tom and his binoculars.

Reverse angle shot on the window where the peeping-Tom was
standing when he was watching Billy. There is light coming through
the window and someone is moving in the room behind the curtains,
but the peeping-Tom doesn't seem interested by Billy at the
moment.

Back to Billy's window. She unties her bathrobe and shows her
breasts.
The peeping-Tom is still moving in the room behind the curtains,
but he doesn't come to the window.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy is standing in front of the window, with her bathrobe wide
open, revealing her naked body to whomever wants to watch it !

Close up on the lock. Another screw is vibrating and pops off. We
see the drill bit coming through the hole it just made.

Billy hears a male voice coming from her earphones.

       MALE TELEPHONE OPERATOR
       Hello ? Hello ?

Billy picks up the earphones and put them on her ears.

       TELEPHONE OPERATOR
       I speak English.

The door burst open and Arkadi walks into the room. Billy picks up
her big kitchen knife and points it to Arkadi.

       MALE TELEPHONE OPERATOR
       Are you okay ?

Arkadi presses the light switch to dim the lights in the room.

Close up shot on the earphones.

       MALE TELEPHONE OPERATOR
       If you just give your address, we send somebody
       immediately.

Arkadi is walking slowly inside the room. Billy is walking
backward away from him, but still pointing her knife at him.
       MALE TELEPHONE OPERATOR
       Hello ?

Arkadi tears the telephone cord off the telephone handset. He
tries to get near Billy, but she is still pointing her knife at
him. He pulls the drapes back on the window.

Walking backward, Billy has reached the wall, in which she bumps.
She takes a white statuette on a chest of drawers and throws it at
Arkadi.

Arkadi bends down and avoid the statuette, which crashes on the
wall behind him. He takes his own knife out of his pocket, a
switchblade knife.

Billy pushes the chest of drawers toward Arkadi. It crashes on the
floor, but Arkadi avoids it. Billy is still pointing her knife at
Arkadi, when we hears some bumping noise.

APARTMENT BELOW BILLY'S - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

In the bedroom just underneath Billy's apartment, a Russian couple
is trying to get some sleep, which, with all the noise in Billy's
apartment, is not very easy.

The woman is still in the bed, but the man is standing up on the
floor, holding a broom with both hands, and hitting the ceiling
with the handle of the broom. Both members of the couple swear in
Russian.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy, who has understood the situation very well, is hitting the
floor with a stick.

APARTMENT BELOW BILLY'S - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The man hears the noise made by Billy, and answer by hitting the

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy is waving her knife around her, to prevent Arakadi from
coming closer to her. She throws the knife at him. Arkadi bends
his head and the knife hits the piano.

Close up of the piano keyboard, with the knife stuck between two
keys.

Billy rushes out of the room, closing the door behind her.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy rushes into the kitchen. She takes various knives hanging
from the wall and throws them at Arkadi, as he tries to enter the
kitchen. One knife gets stuck into a painting on the other side of
the corridor. Arkadi almost catches Billy, but she jumps through a
sort of window set between the kitchen and the living-room.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
Billy stands up after her jump through the window, and she slams
the door of the corridor in Arkadi's face. This door being a sort
of French window, with plenty of small glass panes on it, Arkadi
crashes through the door, scattering pieces of glass all over the
floor. He falls on the floor. Billy slips on a piece of glass and
also falls on the floor. Arkadi tries to catch her by the ankles.
She kicks him in the face. He grabs her ankles back. Billy grabs a
big white vase from the floor, she sits up and crashes the vase on
Arkadi's head. Arkadi lets her go, and she rushes to the front
door, but, as she reaches the door, Lyosha comes in. She rushes to
the corridor. Arkadi, still a bit groggy, looks at Lyosha with
blinking eyes.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Same high-angle shot, as before, of the bathroom seen from the
ceiling.

Billy enters the bathroom, and locks the door behind her.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
Arkadi stands up slowly and walks into the corridor.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Arkadi tries to crash the door open. Billy looks around for a
possible escape.

She opens the door of the small cabinet above the sink, and takes
everything out of it

BILLY'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close up shot on the bathroom door. Arkadi has put his knife
inside the lock of the bathroom door to open it.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close up shot on the door. We see the handle of the lock spinning
slowly.

Billy, still looking in the cabinet, sees the handle spinning. She
rushes to the door and spins the handle back into the lock
position. A knife blade comes through the door a few inches from
Billy's face. Billy goes back to the cabinet and starts searching
it again. Eventually she seems to have found what she was looking
for : a small disposable razor.

The door is shaking under Arkadi's blows. Eventually his hand
breaks through the door and tries to find the handle of the door.
Billy picks up the toilet brush (the handle of which is a Donald
Duck), and hits Arkadi's hand with it. But the door starts falling
down under Arkadi's blows. Billy looks through the hole Arkadi has
made in the door with his hand.

Through the hole, we can see Arkadi going to the end of the
corridor, and running back full speed to smash the door.
At the last moment, when Arkadi is going to hit the door, Billy
opens it. Arkadi can't stop himself, he crosses the bathroom and
falls into the full bathtub. Billy hits him on the head with the
Donald Duck toilet brush. Then Billy takes the hair-drier, switch
it on, and throws it in the bathtub. Arkadi is instantly covered
with blue sparks. Then he falls back into the bathtub where he
remains motionless. Billy grabs a bunch of clothes and rushes out
of the bathroom.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Lyosha is looking through Billy's documents scattered on the desk.
When Billy comes rushing through the room, he grabs her. She tries
to fight him but he locks both of her arms behind her back. He
brings her to the desk, and slams her face on the desk. He puts a
knife very close to her face.

       LYOSHA
       Where's the diskette ?

He puts a piece of paper and a pen in front of her face. He frees
her right hand for her to be able to write.
       LYOSHA
       Where is the diskette ?

Billy takes the pen and starts writing.

Close up shot on the paper. Billy writes : «What diskette ?»

       LYOSHA
       I know you have !

Lyosha raises Billy's bathrobe above her waist, revealing Billy
naked bottom underneath.

Billy looks very frightened, afraid of what Lyosha can do to a
defenseless naked girl. She takes the pen very firmly in her hand
and brings it violently to Lyosha's leg.

Close up shot of the pen hitting Lyosha's leg.

Lyosha screams. He raises his knife to bring it down on Billy.
Billy is waiting for the worse to happen. She hears the noise of
something - or someone - falling violently on the floor. And
suddenly, she realizes she is free. She raises from the table and
sees Larsen holding Arkadi's big wire-cutter in his hands. He just
hit Lyosha with it. Larsen throws the wire-cutter on the floor and
bends on Billy.

       LARSEN
       My name is Alexander Larsen. I'm a policeman. Take your
       clothes. We must get out of here.

Larsen goes to the window and peeks through the drapes.

       LARSEN
       You must hurry.

Billy rushes to her clothes she had dropped on the floor when
Lyosha grabbed her. She sits down on the floor and starts putting
her socks on.

       LARSEN
       I explain everything in the car.

He is still peeking through the drapes.

       LARSEN
       In the car. No time now.

He gathers the rest of Billy's clothes, takes her hand to makes
her stand up, and drags her outside the apartment.

BILLY'S LANDING - INTERIOR NIGHT

They come out of the apartment and start running along the
corridor on Billy's landing. They reach the staircase. Billy drops
a piece of clothing and picks it up. Larsen opens the door of the
elevator, and pushes Billy inside. He closes the door.

BILLY'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
Larsen is ready to press the number «1» on the control panel, but
the button number «1» lights up by itself before Larsen presses
it.

       LARSEN
       They are coming.

Billy starts putting her panties on.

       LARSEN
       We are in great danger.

He looks down at Billy, who is still putting her panties on. He
takes the rest of Billy's clothes in his hands, and presses the
button number «3».

THIRD FLOOR LANDING - INTERIOR NIGHT

The elevator stops and Larsen opens the door. Billy walks out of
the elevator, and follows Larsen down the staircase.

SECOND FLOOR LANDING - INTERIOR NIGHT

Larsen and Billy are coming from the third floor and start going
downstairs toward the first landing. The elevator is going up with
two people inside. They look very much like Andy and Karen.

STREET IN FRONT OF BILLY'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Larsen and Billy are coming out of the building.

       LARSEN
       Quick.

Larsen's car is parked just in front of the building. Larsen opens
the passenger's door for Billy, who climbs inside the car. Then he
walks around the car, open the driver's door and climbs inside. He
starts the engine.

A big black limousine, with two men inside, starts and follows
Larsen's car, which has just started. The driver is Wartschuk,
whom we have seen before with The Reaper, and who is The Reaper's
first assistant.

LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Larsen gives a quick look in the rear-view mirror.

We see the headlights of the other car through the back window of
the car.

Billy resumes her dressing. When she puts her white sweater on,
without a bra, her breasts are showing. Larsen gives a quick
glance toward her, and then turns his head away. Billy looks back
at him, smiles and kisses him on the cheek.

       LARSEN
       It's not over yet.
Billy puts her jacket on. Larsen looks in the back-view mirror.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen and Andy enter the apartment and stop when they see the mess
around them. We realize that it was really them and not some
gangsters going up in the elevator.

       KAREN
       My...

       ANDY
       Oh, my God, it's trashed !

Karen rushes through the room. Andy remains on the doorstep.

       KAREN
       Billy, where are you ?

       ANDY
       I'll call the police !

BILLY'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen is running through the corridor.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Andy picks up the telephone handset without noticing that the cord
has been cut.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen is checking all the rooms to find her sister

       KAREN
       Billy ! Oh, Billy. Oh, my God !
BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Andy is still trying to get a dialing tone

       ANDY
       How do you work this thing ? Oh, there it is.

Behind Andy, the front door is closing slowly, revealing Lyosha
standing behind it. He has the big wire-cutter in his hand, and is
ready to hit Andy with it. Andy looks at the cut cord, but doesn't
realize the telephone can't work with a cut cord.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen enters the bathroom

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

We hear Karen screaming. Andy puts the telephone down on the table
and rushes across the room

BILLY'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
Karen is coming out of the bathroom, screaming.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Andy walks toward the corridor, but Karen meets him at the door.

       KAREN
       Someone's dead in the ba...

She doesn't finish her sentence, because she has just seen Lyosha
behind Andy. She grabs Andy and moves him out of the way of
Lyosha's wire-cutter. The wire-cutter smashes what is left of the
door of the corridor.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Andy and Karen run and enter a room, presumably Billy's bedroom,
and slam the door behind them.

       KAREN
       God ! Oh, my God !

Lyosha looks at the door, and doesn't even bother to smash it. He
slowly walks back to the living room. We hear Karen and Andy's
voices in the room.

       KAREN (voice over)
       Get the door ! Get a chair ! Get the chair !

       ANDY (voice over)
       What chair ?

       KAREN (voice over)
       The chair ! Out of the way ! Move ! Put it over there!

       ANDY (voice over)
       Move! Get the wardrobe over !
Lyosha enters the living-room through what remains of the door.

       KAREN (voice over)
       Andy, quick ! Push it !

APARTMENT BELOW BILLY'S - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The man, seated on his bed, stares at the ceiling, through which
we can hear Andy and Karen yelling. His wife has put the sheet
over her head to try not to hear the noise. The man stands up and
throws one of his slippers to the ceiling. Then he sits back,
while his wife stares at him.

       ANDY (voice over)
       I'm pushing ! Get out of the way !

       KAREN (voice over)
       What are you doing ?

       ANDY (voice over)
       I can't. Oh, my God !
BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Lyosha sits down in an armchair and takes a pack of cigarettes out
of his pocket. But he doesn't take a cigarette. He gives a quick
look at the front door, and closes his eyes, ready to fall asleep.

The front door bursts open, and two uniformed policemen enters the
room, guns in hand. Lyosha looks at them without moving from his
chair, with a sort of look of indifference in his eyes. He shows
them the corridor, where we can still hear Andy and Karen yelling
in the bedroom. From Lyosha's attitude, we can guess that those
policemen are not real ones, but fake ones.

       KAREN (voice over)
       I can't. I can't ! You hold the door !

       ANDY (voice over)
       Get out of the way !

The two fake policemen cross the room.

       KAREN (voice over)
       Come here! Andy! Come here!

       ANDY (voice over)
       Don't yell at me! I'm trying to get the goddamn wardrobe
       near the fucking door!

       KAREN (voice over)
       Oh, my God!

Lyosha doesn't even look at them. He just smiles. Before going
through the smashed door into the corridor, one of the policeman
nods to his «colleague», who takes his gun from his holster, aims,
and sends a bullet through Lyosha's head, whose blood splatters
the wall. The gun is equipped with a silencer, and doesn't make
much noise. Then the policeman goes through the smashed door to
join his colleague.

LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

While driving, Larsen talks to Billy.

       LARSEN
       The girl you saw murdered tonight...

Billy nods in approval.

       LARSEN
       ...her boyfriend stole a diskette full of information.
       Money, names, connections, everything. He blackmailed The
       Reaper. Very dangerous. And now he thinks that you have the
       diskette.

Billy mouth a word we can easily understand.

       BILLY
       Me ?
       LARSEN
       You have it ?... Huh ?

Billy is trying to think about the lost diskette.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Andy and Karen are kneeling on the floor, with their hands joined
behind their heads. One of the fake policeman is searching the
room, throwing everything off the shelves on the floor, while the
other one is aiming his gun at Andy and Karen. He is leaning on
the piano, and he throws all the objects, which are on top of the
piano, on the floor. He raises briefly the piano lid, and then
starts looking behind the picture hanging on the wall.

       ANDY
       We don't have any diskettes.

The policeman picks up a diskette he had thrown on the floor and
looks at it.

       ANDY
       Not that one. That's my script.

Karen hits Andy with her elbow. The policeman puts the diskette
into a small white plastic bag he is carrying around. He puts
another diskette in the bag. The other policeman is speaking in
Russian in a walkie-talkie.

THE CAR FOLLOWING LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Wartschuk is answering the fake policeman on his own walkie-
talkie. Next to him, his passenger is screwing a silencer on his
gun.

A STREET IN MOSCOW - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The street is empty at this time of the night, but for the two
cars following each other.

LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

       LARSEN
       The girl had it when she went into the studio. Then she was
       murdered, and it was gone. Where is it ? Think. You were
       the only person there.

Close up shot on Billy's face trying to think about the mysterious
diskette. She has a short flashback of Arkadi taking the knife to
murder the actress. Then another one of the naked actress lying on
the bed. Then another one of the blood splattering the wall. Then
another one of Arkadi stabbing the girl.

       LARSEN
       Think.

Another short flashback of Billy going away from the   set. Then
another one of Billy bumping into the hatstand. Then   another one
of the girl's purse contents scattered on the floor.   Then another
one of the diskette skidding on the floor and hiding   under the
large wooden wardrobe.

Billy grabs Larsen's shoulder.

       LARSEN
       Write. Write it.

Billy takes a notepad and starts writing on it. But she is
interrupted by a Russian voice coming from somewhere in the car.
Larsen opens the glove compartment and takes a walkie-talkie out
of it. He talks in Russian in the talkie.

Billy looks at the pair of handcuffs in the glove compartment.

Larsen puts the talkie back in the compartment.

       LARSEN
       Write it.

They drive along a police station, but Larsen doesn't stop. Billy
looks a bit worried all of sudden.

       LARSEN
       Quick, write.

Billy shows the police station to Larsen. Then she writes «Police»
on the notepad.

       LARSEN
       Police ? Yes. Yes, but only with the diskette.

She writes «Why ?» on the notepad.

       LARSEN
       You know, I work undercover. The Reaper thinks I work for
       him. Trust me. Trust me.

She grabs the steering-wheel to force Larsen to park the car.
THE CAR FOLLOWING LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Through the car windshield, we see Larsen's car zigzagging on the
street. The two passenger talks in Russian

Billy shows him the handcuffs key. Then she slams the door. Larsen
moves his hand nervously, but, of course, can't get it out of the
handcuff.

A STREET IN MOSCOW - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Billy is running away from Larsen's car toward the other car.

Billy is walking in the street and she suddenly stops. She sees a
ray of light on the sidewalk.

THE CAR FOLLOWING LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Through the windshield, we see Billy who has stopped on the
sidewalk. She starts crossing the street, and the camera moves to
a nook between two building, near the car, and where a man is
hiding. Actually, he is Wartschuk's passenger.

LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Larsen puts his gearshift into reverse and starts driving
backward.

LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy climbs into the back of the car and closes the door.

A STREET IN MOSCOW - EXTERIOR NIGHT

LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy looks through the rear windshield at the car following them.
Larsen has a hard time driving with his hand tied on the steering
wheel.

       LARSEN
       Please, give me the keys.

Billy nods her head «No». Larsen gives her the notepad.

       LARSEN
       Write. Where is the diskette ?

Billy looks at the following car.

       LARSEN
       We cannot escape in this car. Write. Write.

Billy starts writing. Then she shows the note pad to Larsen, who
reads it.

       LARSEN
       Studio. Where in the studio ?
Billy makes a «No» with her finger.

A STREET IN MOSCOW - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Larsen's car makes a left turn into another street.

THE CAR FOLLOWING LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Through the windshield, we see Larsen's car turning into the
adjacent street. Wartschuk speaks in his talkie.

       WARTSCHUK
       Delta three.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

One of the fake policeman picks up his talkie from the table

       WARTSCHUK (voice over from the talkie)
       Delta three.

The policeman answers «Da», then listen to Wartschuk speaking in
Russian. He says «Da» again and a few more words. Karen and Andy
look at him, with a worried look on their face. Wartschuk answers
him. Apparently, Andy understood a few words, because he says :

       ANDY
       What ?

The policeman drops the talkie on the table and talks to his
colleague.

       ANDY
       What ?

The other policeman walks near Andy and Karen, raising his gun.

       ANDY
       This is all a big misunderstanding and... Excuse me, but
       this is...

The first policeman takes Andy's hands and cuffs them behind his
back.

       ANDY
       You don't have to arrest us. Why is he arresting me ? This
       is ridiculous. I'm an American citizen. Do you understand
       what I'm saying ? Now, I'm a director.

Karen turns her head and looks at the dead Lyosha.

       ANDY
       You know, I'm directing a movie here in Moscow. I'm
       bringing a lot of money in this place.

The policemen don't seem to take any notice of what Andy is
saying. One is still cuffing his hands while the other one is
holding his gun.

       ANDY
       And my father, okay, he knows a lot of big people, and...
       Listen.

The policeman raises Andy to his feet and moves him away from
Karen.

       ANDY
       You want money ? Is that what you want ?

The policeman has seated Andy on an armchair. He bends him down
and puts the barrel of his gun on Andy's neck.

       ANDY
       I don't understand what is going on here. We don't have a
       diskette !

       FAKE POLICEMAN # 1
       You have one more chance to tell me where is diskette.

Since the policemen are not looking at her, Karen moves slowly on
the floor.
       ANDY
       The diskette. You know, I mean, this is ridiculous. We
       don't have a diskette. That's what I'm saying.

The policeman clicks his gun in a «ready to shoot» position.

Karen grabs the carpet with both hands and pulls it violently.

The small telephone table falls on the floor, but also the
policeman who was ready to kill Andy. In his fall, he pulls the
trigger of his gun, which shoot a bullet at the other policeman,
who falls dead on the floor.

Andy tries to get off the armchair, but just falls down with it.

Karen picks up the telephone handset, with its cut cord hanging
from it. She rushes to the first policeman, and starts hitting him
on the head with the handset. Andy stands up.

       ANDY
       Karen, get the key ! Get the key ! Unlock me !

APARTMENT BELOW BILLY'S - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The couple was eventually asleep, but with what is happening now
in Billy's apartment, they wake up. The man switches the light on.
We hear Andy yelling.

       ANDY (voice over)
       Find the key !

The man swears in Russian and puts his night robe on.

       ANDY (voice over)
       He's not gonna move, is he ? Okay, okay.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
Karen is unlocking Andy's handcuffs. When it's done, Andy massages
his hands and puts his jacket back on. Karen drops the handcuffs
on a table.

       ANDY
       Right. Let's get out of here.

Close shot on the talkie lying on the floor.

       WARTSCHUK (voice over from the talkie)
       Delta three. Delta three.

Andy and Karen look at the talkie.

       KAREN
       Answer it.

       ANDY
       Why ?

       KAREN
       They may say something about Billy.
       WARTSCHUK (voice over from the talkie)
       Delta three.

Karen picks up the talkie and gives it to Andy.

       ANDY (with an exaggerated deep voice)
       Da.

Of course, he gets an answer in Russian.

       ANDY
       Da.

He gets another Russian answer, but the word «studio» is clearly
understandable.

       ANDY
       Da.

Karen takes the talkie out of his hands and throws it.

       KAREN
       I got something about studio. Come on.

The policeman, who had been knocked out by Karen, is slowly waking
up. Karen sees him and yells.

       KAREN
       Look out !

Karen picks up a gun and points it at the policeman. Andy grabs a
wooden armchair and crashes it on the policeman's back. The
armchairs breaks apart. The policeman falls down, unconscious.

The door opens and the next floor neighbor walks in. He yells
something in Russian. Karen turns toward him, with the gun still
pointed in front of her. The man look at the mess, the dead
bodies... and the gun. He raises his arms above his head. Andy
throws away the pieces of armchair he still had in his hands.
Karen puts the gun behind her back.

       ANDY
       Mmm... It's not what you think. What do you say ?... How do
       you ?... In Russian, what ?...

Karen says a couple of words in Russian. Andy turns toward her.

       ANDY
       What ? What does that mean ?

       KAREN
       Hel...

       ANDY
       Hello ? We need help !

The man starts talking rapidly in Russian.

       ANDY
       I'm a director, and I'm making a movie here. This is not a
       movie.

The man hasn't stopped talking. Actually, he and Andy have been
talking together. Now he yells something in Russian. Andy turns
toward Karen.

       ANDY
       Put the gun away. You look like a hit man. He thinks we're
       gonna kill him !

Andy took the gun from Karen and now he is waving it at the man.

       KAREN
       We're not gonna kill you !

       ANDY
       This is not even ours !

       KAREN
       The policemen wanted to kill us !

The man turns around and runs out of the apartment, yelling in
Russian.

       KAREN
       We gotta get out of here.

       ANDY
       Well, I think we should call the cops.

       KAREN
       Are you crazy ?

       ANDY
       Well, we can explain this.

       KAREN
       Explain ? You are crazy. Come on. Here.

She has a gun in her hand and she gives him another gun. She runs
out of the apartment. Andy takes the handcuffs from the table.

       ANDY
       I'll take these too.

He follows Karen out of the apartment.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Close shot on the entrance of the studio, where a plate says
something in Russian and underneath : «Central Film Studio».

Larsen's car enters the studio. It stops near the building.

We see Billy and Larsen through the windshield. Larsen shows his
handcuff to Billy.

       LARSEN
       And now ?
Billy tries to get out of the car, but she can't open the back
door.

       LARSEN
       Child locks.

Billy gets the key out of her pocket and gives it to Larsen, who
unlocks the handcuff.

He gets out of the car and closes the door. He goes around the car
to open Billy's door. As he is doing it, he sees car headlights
coming his way.

       LARSEN
       Don't look now, but our friends are still here.

They both runs toward the building. He opens a big metal door and
they enter the building.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

This is the unused set, where Billy went, at the beginning of the
story, when she found herself locked in. It has metal doors
opening directly on the parking lot.

Billy pulls the big bolt that locks the door from the inside. Then
Larsen puts a padlock on the bolt.

       LARSEN
       I will block the other entrances.

They both walk away.

MOSCOW - A STREET NEAR RED SQUARE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Karen's car is driving full speed toward The Red Square. When she
takes a turn, the tires are screeching on the macadam and the car
zigzags a little.

KAREN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT.

Through the windshield, we see a small roadblock with lights on
it. It is not permitted to cross Red Square during the night.

       ANDY
       What... what are you doing ? That... that's Red Square.

MOSCOW - RED SQUARE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The car rushes toward the roadblock.

KAREN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT.

When he sees the roadblock coming toward him, Andy slides down
under the dashboard.

       ANDY
       Oh, perfect.
MOSCOW - RED SQUARE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Without even slowing down, Karen's car smashes through the
roadblock. The debris are flying around. And the car keeps on
driving full speed toward Red Square.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Wartschuk and his passenger are walking on the empty yard, guns in
hand. Voices are coming from their walkie-talkie. Several cars are
entering the parking lot behind them. The cars stop in front of
the building. Men carrying machine guns are coming out of the
cars.

Wartschuk directs the whole operation with his walkie-talkie.

A man tries to open the big metal door, but it's locked. He yells
something in Russian to Wartschuk, who answers him and points at
something. Apparently, he tells him to go around the building,
because the man starts running away.

Just outside the parking lot, Karen's car is coming to a stop near
the entrance. We hear the Russian voices in the parking lot. Karen
and Andy get out of the car. Karen walks to the entrance of the
parking lot and peeks inside. Andy joins her, trying to make his
gun work.

       ANDY
       This damn gun, I can't work the safety.

Karen shushes him down. They both peek inside, and they are
surprised to see such a number of big black cars.

       ANDY
       Holy shit !

Wartschuk is giving orders through his walkie-talkie. A man with a
machine-gun walks away from him.
Back to Karen and Andy, still standing outside the entrance.

       KAREN
       Around the back.

They run across the entrance. The men, all looking toward the
building, don't see them.

Wartschuk is still giving orders. All the men with machine-guns
are scattering around the building. Someone is calling Wartschuk
through his talkie. Wartschuk smiles. He walks away from his men.

On the other side of the studio compound, Karen and Andy are
entering the place by climbing over the wall. Karen is already in
the place and she is helping Andy to join her. For the moment, he
is sitting on top of the wall and he throws the two guns to her.
Then he goes down himself. Karen holds his legs.

       KAREN
       Okay. Jump, Andy. I got you.
       ANDY
       What ?

       KAREN
       I got you. I got you.

Andy falls down heavily on the ground.

On a balcony on a near building, a man is watching the yard with a
flashlight. This is the balcony which Billy fell from.

Andy and Karen are crossing the yard, trying to be as discrete as
possible.

Wartschuk is climbing rapidly up an emergency ladder to meet the
man with the flashlight.

Karen and Andy, lying low, are coming slowly toward the building.

Wartschuk has reached the balcony where the man is watching the
yard. They whisper in Russian. Then Wartschuk goes inside,
actually through that same emergency door through which Billy
tried earlier to escape. The watcher closes the door behind him.

Andy and Karen are still crawling slowly toward the building.

On the balcony, the man is smoking a cigarette.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

This is the set where the poor actress was murdered.

Larsen is trying to use a telephone on the wall.

       LARSEN
       It's no use. All lines are cut.

Billy is watching Larsen. Behind her, we see Wartschuk peeking
through the half-open door.

       LARSEN
       Where is it ?

Billy shows him the ancient-looking wardrobe under which the
diskette is hidden. He bends down. Then he raises and takes a
piece of wood from a rack. He slides the piece of wood under the
wardrobe.

Wartschuk enters silently on the set.

Larsen gets the diskette out of its hiding place. Billy picks it
up. Behind her, Wartschuk has got his gun out. Billy stands up
with the diskette in her hand. She smiles. Wartschuk grabs her
from the back. She throws the diskette. Larsen catches it.

       LARSEN
       You helped us a lot, Billy. Thank you.

Larsen puts discreetly the diskette in Wartschuk's pocket.
       WARTSCHUK
       The Reaper wants to meet the woman who has kept him up all
       night and witnessed a live snuff.

He gives his gun to Larsen.

       WARTSCHUK
       He wants you to do it.

       LARSEN
       You know why we call him The Reaper ? You see his face, you
       die.

Billy spits in Larsen's face. Then she yells silently, because
Wartschuk is squeezing her a little tighter. Larsen wipes the spit
from his face. Larsen raises his gun, holding it by the barrel.
Billy looks very frightened, because she knows that Larsen is
going to knock her out. But the butt of the gun lands violently...
on Wartschuk's head, who screams and falls heavily on the floor.
Billy looks from Larsen to the falling man, not understanding
clearly what happened.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR

Andy is hiding behind a trash can. He looks up at the watcher on
the balcony. He finally comes out of his hiding place, but bumps
into a beer can lying on the ground. The watcher says something in
Russian and points his flashlight toward Andy.

       ANDY
       Nice night, isn't it ?

Karen is slowly going around the pile of empty film boxes on which
Billy fell earlier.

       ANDY
       I'm just taking a piss. Right, you know, just...
The watcher walks slowly down the ladder. Karen reaches the
ladder, climbs on something we don't see, and catches the
watcher's foot through the steps of the ladder. The man falls and
rolls all the way down the ladder. He is unconscious and Andy ties
his wrist to the ladder with the handcuff. Karen joins him. Andy
seems very happy about the successful operation.

The Reaper's black limousine is entering the parking lot.

Karen, who has started to go up the steps of the ladder, looks at
the limousine.

       KAREN
       Who the hell is that ?

       ANDY
       Well, whoever it is, they're coming here.

They reach the balcony and enter the building.

The Reaper's car is driving toward the building, with all the men,
equipped with machine guns, watching his arrival.
CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen and Andy are running along the long corridor. Andy is still
trying to work out the safety of his gun.

       ANDY
       I can't work the safety.

       KAREN
       Andy, come on.

       ANDY
       Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

He falls down, dropping all the bullets on the floor.

       KAREN
       Hurry !

Andy picks up his bullets, stands up and runs after Karen.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The Reaper's car is still surrounded by all the guards in arms.

We see only the shadow of The Reaper inside his car.

       THE REAPER
       Where is she, Larsen ?

We guess he is talking into a walkie-talkie.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

This is the unused film set, with large metal doors opening on the
parking lot
Karen enters the gallery above the room, followed by Andy. She
bends down, and makes him bend down.

       THE REAPER (voice over from the talkie)
       Larsen, are you reading me ?

       KAREN (whispering)
       Somebody's coming.

       ANDY (whispering)
       I'm waiting.

Down below, on the set itself, Billy is walking, with Larsen
behind her, pointing a gun in her back.

       LARSEN (answering The Reaper)
       I'm bringing her out now.

On the gallery, Andy is still trying to work his gun.

       KAREN
       Shoot him. Shoot him, Andy.
       ANDY
       Okay.

Andy shoots, misses Larsen, and hits a statue.

Larsen and Billy try to hide from the shooter.

Andy shoots again and misses again.

       KAREN
       Be careful of Billy ! God.

Karen runs along the gallery, while Andy shoots and misses again.
And once again. Then he realizes that the gun is empty and he
drops it on the floor of the gallery. He runs after Karen.

Down below, Larsen brings Billy near the big metal door opening on
the outside. He unlocks the padlock that he had put earlier on the
bolt of the door.

Karen rushes toward them.

       KAREN (yelling)
       Billy !

Larsen pulls the bolt open. Billy is very surprised to see her
sister. Larsen points his gun at her and yells something in
Russian.

Karen stops running, but Billy makes large signs to her, signs she
doesn't seem to understand. Karen hides, and then comes out.

       LARSEN
       Stay where you are !

Karen throws a piece of metal at Larsen. The piece of metal hits
his hand and he drops his gun.
       KAREN (yelling)
       Run, Billy. Run ! Run !

Billy opens the big metal door. Andy runs in to join Karen. Larsen
picks up his gun, and points it at Billy.

       LARSEN
       Stand back !

But Billy is already out of the building.

       KAREN (yelling)
       Not out there !

Andy grabs Karen and pulls her out of Larsen's gun.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Billy runs out of the building. An army of men, armed with
machine-guns, is waiting for her. The cars' drivers all switched
their headlights on high beams. With all that light in front of
her, Billy doesn't see anymore where she is going and stops
running.

The Reaper, still in his car, bends down to look at her. He takes
his walkie-talkie.

       THE REAPER
       Kill her, Larsen.

Larsen walks out of the building, and we hear the end on The
Reaper's sentence coming from his own walkie-talkie.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen and Andy rush to the window, to look at what is happening on
the parking lot.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Billy looks at the men in front of her with a frightened face. She
turns around to look at Larsen pointing his gun at her. Then she
turns back to the men in front of her, and especially The Reaper,
looking at her from his car. Behind her, Larsen aims his gun at
her.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen and Andy are still looking through the window.

       KAREN (yelling)
       No !

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Larsen closes one eye before shooting. He shoots seven times. We
see the bullets going through Billy's body from the back, and
coming out through the front, making red bloody spots on her white
sweater. Billy falls down on her stomach, and remains motionless
on the ground with her arms spread apart.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen, still standing behind the window, can't believe what she
just saw.

Through the window, we see Billy's body lying on the ground, with
all the big black cars surrounding her.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Through the half-open door, Larsen shows The Reaper the diskette
he has found on the set.

The Reaper smiles. The big metal door closes as Larsen goes back
inside.

All the men go back inside their cars. The engines start. And the
cars start driving out, The Reaper's car being the first one to
go.
Billy is still lying motionless on the ground, her blood flowing
slowly on the tarmac.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen is in Andy's arms, crying.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The last cars are leaving the parking lot.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

Andy, with Karen crying on his laps, looks at Larsen coming back
in and closing the door.

       LARSEN
       Now please, let me explain. Please ?

       KAREN (yelling)
       Explain ?

She rushes out of Andy's arms and bumps violently into Larsen.

       ANDY
       Karen !

They both fall on the floor, and Larsen's gun flies away from his
hand. Karen hits Larsen very hard with both her fists. Andy picks
up the gun and points it at Larsen. Larsen pushes Karen away from
him. Karen takes the legs of a statue and hits Larsen with it.
Then she grabs Larsen by the ears and throws him on the metal
door. She turns toward Andy.

       KAREN
       Kill him.

Karen opens the door and walks out.
CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Billy, still lying on the ground, opens one eye and smiles.

Karen runs out of the building and rushes toward her sister, who
stands up when she sees her. Karen stops and looks at her. Karen
sits up and raises her sweatshirt.

Underneath, she is equipped with the special effect system she
uses to pretend people are being shot. Little bags, full of fake
blood, explode one by one, tearing the piece of clothing in front
of them, and pouring the blood through the fabric. For the
spectator, it does looks like bullet going through a body and
blood spurting out.

Karen rushes to Billy and hugs her.

       KAREN
       You genius !

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT
Larsen is still kneeling on the floor. Andy is pointing the gun at
him, trying to look mean, which is a bit hard for him.

       ANDY
       You thought we were tourists, huh ? Guess again, pal.

Larsen is slowly getting up.

       ANDY
       Don't move. Don't move! I'm talking to you !

He shoots the gun to the ceiling.

       ANDY
       I'm warning you. Don't move or I'm gonna shoot you ! Okay !

He shoots at Larsen, who doesn't react and walks closer to him. He
shoots twice more, walking backward. He bumps into a prop and
falls down on his back... next to Wartschuk, all tied up and with
a large piece of tape across his mouth. Wartschuk moans, Andy
screams and gets quickly up. He rushes out of the building while
Larsen is trying to get over what just happened to him

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Andy rushes out of the building and sees Karen cleaning Billy's
face.

       ANDY
       Billy ! Billy ! Billy !

       KAREN
       She's okay. She's fine.

       ANDY
       She's fine ? She's okay ?
Billy mouth the words «I'm fine» and shows him the special effect
device on her stomach. Larsen comes behind her and takes her by
the shoulder, saying a few words in Russian. Billy says something
in sign language to Karen.

       KAREN
       A cop ?

       ANDY
       A cop ?

       KAREN
       Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

       ANDY
       Sorry.

       LARSEN
       Forget it. Your sister was brilliant.

Karen pats Larsen's shoulder.
       KAREN
       Next time, hit back.

Larsen throws a remote control into Andy's hands.

       ANDY
       Oh !... this is the remote. I get it.

They all laugh. Larsen pats Andy's shoulder.

       LARSEN
       Big cowboy.

Billy starts talking in sign language to Larsen. He turns toward
Karen.

       LARSEN
       What ?

       KAREN
       That was an invitation to dinner sometime.

       LARSEN
       How you say ?... It would be a pleasure.

Billy mouthes the word «Pleasure» and then makes the sign for it,
which is rubbing you stomach. Larsen makes the same sign. Then he
stops and seems to think about something.

       LARSEN
       I still don't understand.

       KAREN
       What ?

       LARSEN
       I don't understand why The Reaper didn't take the diskette
       off me.
       KAREN
       Who ?

The sound of a shot, and a blood bag explodes under Billy's
sweater. Karen screams. Since she was just in front of Billy, her
face is covered with fake blood. Andy looks at them, the remote
control in his hand.

       ANDY
       Whoops !... Shit. I'm sorry.

They all look at him. Larsen smiles.

       LARSEN
       Big cowboy.

A little later.

Andy drives his car near the entrance of the building. Billy walks
toward the car, looking at Wartschuk, his mouth still gagged,
being forced by Larsen to go inside his car. He moans
incomprehensible words, and seems not to want to get inside the
car.

Andy waves to Larsen.

       ANDY
       Ciao !...

Andy opens the back door of his own car to let Billy inside. But
she doesn't climb in, still surprised by Wartschuk's attitude.

Finally, Larsen succeeds in putting his prisoner in the back of
his car, where another prisoner, also gagged, is already waiting
(certainly the man that Andy had handcuffed earlier on the
emergency ladder).

Before climbing into the driver's seat, Larsen waves to Billy.

       LARSEN
       Billy, tomorrow !

He makes the «pleasure» sign. Billy waves back to him.

       LARSEN
       Tomorrow !

Billy looks at Wartschuk inside the car. She seems worried.

       ANDY
       What's the matter ?

Billy makes several signs. Andy doesn't understand, but he looks
at Larsen. Larsen smiles back to him.

       LARSEN
       Big cowboy.

Karen is already seated in the car, and doesn't understand the
reason for the delay.

       KAREN
       Guys, could we get out of here, please ?

Close shot on Wartschuk's face, who is trying to tell them
something.

Andy eventually understand what Billy is trying to tell him. It is
the word he learned earlier in the restaurant.

       ANDY
       The expression ?

Billy nods «Yes». Larsen smiles to her and starts his car. Billy
slams violently on the roof of Andy's car. She seems frightened by
something. She yells silently.

       ANDY
       The car ?

Billy keeps on yelling silently and moving her arms. Andy is
beginning to understand what she means.

          ANDY
          The car...

Wartschuk looks more and more frightened.

Andy want to rush to Larsen's car, but Billy holds him back.

          ANDY (yelling)
          Get out of the car ! Get out of the car !

Watching Billy and Andy, Larsen has suddenly a worried look on his
face. He is beginning to understand that something is wrong. He
gets out of his car, walks a few steps, and then his car explodes
and he falls on the ground.

Andy, Billy and Karen, who is now out of her car, they all look at
the car burning and at the motionless Larsen lying on the ground.
Billy looks very sad.

But, slowly, Larsen begins to move. He sits up and looks at Billy.

Billy is crying and smiling at the same time. We get to understand
she must be in love with Larsen.

NIGHT TIME 

                                        [The "POLTERGEIST" Treatment]



                                                  Written by
                         
                                               Steven Spielberg


                         
          March 31, 1980
                         
          Steven Freeling is a successful husband, father and provider. His innate practicality and above
          average intelligence have made him a successful real estate salesman for a large agency in a
          nearby community. He is well liked, and respected by his boss and co-workers, and is considered
          an upstanding member of his community.
                         
          Nora Freeling, now 34, was married at 17 and pregnant at 18. She, with active help from Steven,
          is in the process of raising 4 children, ranging in age from 6 to 16. During this time she has also
          managed to juggle her family life well enough to earn a degree in teaching and is active in the
          community as a substitute teacher.
                         
          Nora and Steven are close enough in age to their own children that the experiences of a strict
          upbringing (whippings, edicts and traditions) are still fresh memories. Thus has the generational
          pendulum swung. They govern their domain with chummy lenience, and serious, but
          good-natured discipline. They treat their children with respect and humanity, and are afforded
          the courtesy of being treated the same. They are a close, open and loving family, fairly typical of
          this neighborhood.
                         
          The children, Sweeny, age 16, Angel, age 14, Lawrence, age 12, and Carol Ann, age 6, are
          children of the 80's. They watch more TV than they should, see all the "PG" movies at the local
          six-plex, and do just enough homework to get by in school. They participate in a "healthy"
          amount of sibling teasing and fighting, with subjects ranging from which TV show should be
          aired to who stole who's toys. They are gregarious children who all have "best friends," "2nd
          best friends," "3rd best friends".......
                         
          Carol Ann is typically precocious for a child with much older brothers and sisters.
                         
          They family generally spends quiet evenings together with bed time dictated at 10:00.
                         
          Elmer, the last member of the Freeling family, is a silver-buff Cocker Spaniel who has been a
          member of the family almost as long as the oldest child.
                         
          TAGINA BARRINS is a 65 year old medium. She has studied under some of the well known
          psychics of the times and is a regular contributor to the National Enquirer; this being the only
          accepting outlet for her communications with "the other side." She is eccentric in her manner of
          dress and speech, but is sincere in her beliefs and very probably a true psychic.
                         
          Why must all tales of ghosts and hauntings find their settings in gothic cobwebbed mansions,
          miles away from civilization? Where does an audience draw the line between what is real and
          what is fantastic?
                         
          NIGHT TIME is the story of a frightening occurence; not in a haunted house on a hill, but in the
          center of middle class suburbia.
                         
          The Freelings, a middle class family, live at 3443 Wanda; a four bedroom, three and one half
          bath, ranch style house. It is a typical tract house located at the end of one of the several
          hundred cul-de-sacs in a shopping mall district called Vista. As its name implies, the center of
          activity is a large modern shopping center complex. This large, child infested community holds
          five schools: two elementary, two junior high, and one high school. On the neatly manicured
          rolling hill fringes of town are a well used, man-made lake and the community's "rec-center."
          This Chicago suburb is one of many similar communities springing up every day. Its planners'
          goal: to bring families and the conveniences of life closer together.
                         
          It is a quiet evening. The children have gone to bed allowing Nora and Steven their cherished
          hours alone. They go to their bedroom, turn the TV on to THE TONIGHT SHOW, (Something they
          do almost every night) and prepare for a well deserved evening of rest and relaxation. They are
          lulled to sleep by the voices on the television set. The rest of the evening's programming, the
          late-late movie, the broadcast of the local news, the sign-off consisting of the Blue Angels
          performing to strains of the Star Spangled Banner, color bars and test patterns, the local sign
          off....and finally, static, or white noise. It is through this blizzard of static snow, and beyond the
          slumbered breathing of Nora and Steven, that the first flash of paranormal communication
          occurs. The television moans something chillingly audible and the static non-picture rearranges
          into something indistinguishable. Steven turns over in his sleep, but does not awaken. The days
          that follow bring a stream of odd but not necessarily suspicious occurrences. Periodic phantom
          phone calls break the silence in the middle of the night. On the other end, nothing but static
          noise; similar to the static of the blank night television.
                         
                         
                         
          Food disappears from the cupboards and refrigerator, and a special lemon meringue pie is
          marred by nibbling fingers. But with children in the house, and the children's friends, the blame
          is not easily fixed. The furniture, slightly at first, is rearranged. Just enough to annoy a
          meticulous mother; not enough to cause suspicion. Elmer, the family dog, begins wandering to a
          certain alcove in the house. He then sits there, facing the wall, occasionally whimpering toward
          it, reaching out his paw and scratching at the air. But, well, he's getting old, and if people can get
          senile, so can dogs.
                         
                         
                         
          Angel, their 14 year old daughter, while cleaning out the garage, finds an old record of 19th
          century songs supposedly sung by pioneers as they crossed the country. It becomes her favorite
          album and is played all the time. She finds it soothing and somehow familiar. The songs become
          a part of her life; humming them as she studies, walks to school and does her daily chores. But
          then "things" start happening. Annoying things, inexplicable things, nerve fraying things.
                         
                         
                         
          The television starts to change channels by itself; to news station and cartoons, specifically. The
          children, bright and inventive, are at first blamed for creating some gadget to "annoy and
          frighten your mother." Having proven innocence or at least protested enough, Steven goes next
          door to see if the neighbors are playing tricks with their remote controls. But the neighbors
          aren't home. And a phone call to a friend assures Steven that a friend's remote control wouldn't
          work on his set anyhow.
                         
                         
                         
          The Freelings are bird lovers. They have built a beautiful aviary which has become the home of
          many different kinds, colors and sizes of birds. The aviary is located on a patio that is attached to
          the house. Steven and Nora awaken one early morning to find birds flying all over the house. At
          first, angry at the children for not closing the cage, Steve wakes them and takes them all
          downstairs for a lecture on closing and locking the bird cage. But upon entering the porch,
          everyone is silenced by something: the sight of the aviary torn open, a feat accomplished by
          something beyond human strength. But no noise had awakened them..."what is going on?"
                         
                         
                         
          Windows and doors open and close, seemingly by themselves. In the middle of the night
          someone has to go downstairs to re-bolt a window or re-lock a door. Furniture is being moved
          around more obviously now.
                         
                         
                         
          Nora, preparing a meal in the kitchen, hears someone swimming in the pool. She calls outside
          for whoever it is to get out and get ready for dinner. Her calls are ignored. She goes outside to
          the sight of something invisible doing what looks like laps in the pool (Or perhaps we, the
          audience, see something doing laps, but when Nora gets out there, it is gone). This could make
          her even more nervous, thinking that there is something wrong with her, or that it is someone
          playing tricks.
                         
                         
                         
          One evening, as Angel is getting ready for bed, she takes off her clothes and moves to the bed
          when she is startled and almost screams. There is a lump in her bed, a lump shaped like a body.
          Recovering, she starts to scold her sister for scaring her, and turns back the covers to discover
          that there is nothing there. She turns to her sister's bed across the room. She is fast asleep.
          The usual bluish of the household lights turn different colors and hues, both day and night.
          Sometimes not enough to cause any more than squinting, or rubbing of the viewing party's eyes.
                         
                         
                         
          Steve and Nora prepare to leave for a dinner with their friends. They have called a babysitter
          because the older children are going to a movie. As Steven is shaving, the 19th Century Music
          album is turned on full volume. This startles him and causes him to cut himself. He storms out of
          the bedroom, goes to the stereo, takes off the album and breaks it. He then yells for Angel and
          reprimands her for turning it on so loud. She hasn't done it. The other children deny it also.
          Steven accuses one of them of lying. "Record players don't just turn themselves on, you know."
                         
                         
                         
          Angel, upset with her father for breaking her album, and for accusing her unjustly, goes to her
          room upset. She has to prepare for her date.
                         
                         
                         
          She sits at her vanity looking at herself, and being angry with her father. She starts to put on
          lipstick. Looking into the mirror, she is putting her lipstick on someone else's face. She screams.
          This brings her image back to the mirror. She is frightened to look into mirrors from this point
          on.
                         
                         
                         
          Anxious to get out of the house, Angel hurries her older brother, with whom she and several
          other friends are going to the movies, out of the house. The babysitter, a 15 year old teenager,
          arrives allowing Nora and Steven to be on their way.
                         
                         
                         
          As she puts the children to bed, they talk her into telling them a story. She concedes, and tells
          them a ghost story. As she tells her story, actual events in the house upstage the fictional story
          she is telling them, adding to and punctuating the higher points. Terrified, the babysitter,
          negligent of her duties, runs screaming from the house into the night. Neighbors' lights go on,
          obviously disturbed by the screaming.
                         
                         
                         
          The older children get home to find the little ones sitting together on the steps, no babysitter in
          sight. The parents return to a story of a deserting babysitter who says their house is haunted.
          The evening's events have everyone on edge, especially Steven and Nora.
          Nora sits at her vanity brushing out her long auburn tresses. As she brushes her hair somewhat
          mindlessly past her right shoulder, an invisible wind lifts her hair out from her brush and her
          hand. It arches her hair slowly over her head and lays it to rest on her left shoulder. She sits
          frozen, unable to speak, the empty brush in her hand, her wide eyes locked on her image in the
          mirror. At that moment, she feels something touching her cheek. We see two indentations, such
          as fingers would make, as her cheek gently caves in, opening her lips, and her face is tilted
          upward by an invisible hand. She then receives a "ghost kiss," a long, forced, passionate kiss,
          from which she cannot free herself. As she is released, there is a noise from the living /dining
          area. Steven bolts from their bathroom, sees the wide-eyed, almost panicked, expression on his
          wife's face. He grabs her hand, and together they walk down the hall to check the house. The
          furniture in the dining room has been totally rearranged. The chairs are on top of the furniture.
          Some of the furniture has been moved from room to room. They wake the children, pack lightly,
          pick up the dog and leave to spend the night at the local Holiday Inn. They will stay there for the
          evening, then move into Nora's sister's house within a day or so.
                         
                         
                         
          The next day, unable to work because of the events of his home life, and not knowing what to
          do, he calls the Parapsychological organization within the University of Chicago. They all decide
          that the best idea for the Freelings is to spend another night at the hotel, while some of their
          experts spend an evening at their home with test equipment.
                         
                         
                         
          That evening in the hotel room, feeling things are getting better, Nora and Steven make love.
          However, something happens. A spirit enters Steven's body, causing his personality and actions
          to be altered a bit. He does and says things to her that are obviously not of his doing. Things
          which Nora would find baroque, to say the least. His manner of love-making is altered, but
          rather than Nora being turned off, she is somehow excited by this change. What in essence is
          happening, is that she is making love to two men at the same time. Steven, and another spirit.
          Some of the things which he says harp back to an old time, long, long ago.
                         
                         
                         
          The next morning at breakfast, things are a bit strained. A normal breakfast conversation is
          changed into a frightening experience when the six-year-old, Carol Ann, is talking about what
          she is going to do at school when all of a sudden, for no more than three or four words, her
          voice changes, slips two octaves, and a man's voice continues telling the story in the child's
          own words, but only for a few seconds before the young girl's voice returns. The whole family
          stops eating, and stares. It is obvious that the child is not aware of what has just occurred. Nora
          gets up. Puts her hand over her mouth, stares at Steven with a realization of the night before,
          and runs back up to their room.
                         
                         
                         
          They come to grips with the fact that it might not be the house, but themselves that are
          "haunted." The desire for familiar surroundings, and the realization that no one's been hurt,
          causes them to go back home.
                         
                         
                         
          On arriving home, they realize that their house has been invaded by an entourage of young,
          long-haired parapsychologists. Between their visit and the horrifying experience of the
          babysitter, the entire neighborhood realizes that something terrible is happening in their
          neighborhood.
                         
                         
                         
          Also taking place at this time is a major archeological dig. This is going on not from from the
          Freeling's home (Perhaps instead of a dig, it should be just the building of some new homes in a
          tract, nearby). The excavators discover bones. Human bones. Thousands of them. It is
          discovered that what has been unearthed is an extremely large grave site. The results of a
          massive massacre of white settlers, perhaps 150 years ago. The bones had been shoveled into
          shallow graves in approximately a 100 acre perimeter. Children, babies, pioneer men and their
          women. Arrow heads, scalping knives-a horrible way to die.
                         
                         
                         
          This discovery, along with the disclosure of the events at the Freeling household, cause experts
          to hypothesize that perhaps through a rift in the barrier between "now" and "then," and
          through one of the members of the Freeling family, as a mortal host, the spirits have found a
          gateway into the 1980's and American suburbia. Some hypothesize that they are looking for
          help to the next world, the world that they belong in, and the world that has been denied them.
                         
                         
                         
          The Freelings are instantly descended upon by professional, pseudo-professional and crack-pot
          ghost hunters who all want to spend an evening in the house with the ghosts and their
          new-fangled equipment for recording spirits on film and tape. A psychologist informs the family
          that perhaps the spirits are attracted to one member of the family, and that a battery of tests
          could be run to determine who it was. Not wanting to place any kind of "blame" or ostracization
          upon any member of the family , they refuse the testing. Besides, what would they do with the
          "guilty" party?
          As the Freelings and their house become unwitting celebrities, the children are saddled with a
          barrage of torment from schoolmates. They are avoided. They are "the haunted people."
                         
                         
                         
          One of the people who comes to help the Freelings is TAGINA BARRINS, a psychic, and regular
          contributor to the National Enquirer. She is a comic character who, though she comes off as a
          crazy old lady seeking attention, is probably the most helpful and authentic psychic of them all.
          She spends a lot of time just walking around talking to the house. At one point, TAGINA is
          awakened in the dead of night, and in a somnambulistic state, drives to the Freeling's home, is
          admitted by our unseen visitors, and walks into Nora and Steven's bedroom. They wake with a
          start, finding her talking to the television set static.
                         
                         
                         
          The Freeling's neighbors, once very friendly, have been almost hostile. A petition has been
          started by the Eisenhowers to force them to leave the neighborhood. It is what Steven and his
          family want more than anything. They look for a home in the area in which Steven works, but
          are informed by his boss that if they think about bringing their bizarre ghostly rumors and cultist
          rituals to his 400 acres of suburban tranquility, he will be fired and will never work in real estate
          again.
                         
                         
                         
          Within a short period of time, the Freeling neighbors have problems of their own. Screams and
          panic indicate that like a contagious virus, the haunting has spread: first to the Eisenhower
          home, then across the street to other neighbors; then down the block. Beyond causing
          frightened residents to harm themselves while fleeing ghostly manifestations, ghost fires are
          set. (A ghost fire is a phenomenon which can take place in any room of a house. Perhaps in the
          cold center of the haunting in that home. The fire will devastate everything in a specific area,
          but will not spread to other rooms or other floors.) Each haunting, in each home, is signaled by
          the television. Where there is a remote control device, the TV will flip on by itself in the early
          hours of the morning to a station that is broadcasting static noise. The manifestations originate
          there.
                         
                         
                         
          Other items for possible incorporation would be:
                         
                         
                         
          The manifestations love to materialize (not in humanoid form such as ghosts), and occasionally
          we will see ectoplasmic displays, perhaps emanating from the toaster in the house. (Ectoplasm
          is a spermatozoa-like substance that originates often from the fingers of mediums trying to
          contact spirits from the other side). But yet these ectoplasm manifestations could come from
          the family toaster, or from the microwave oven, or from anything naturally uncommon.
                         
                         
                         
          Occasionally there is a manifestation of a whisp-like type of smoke in basic humanoid form that
          keeps changing shape and travels from one room to the next, until if finds the recipient is has
          been looking for. When found, the smoke will dissipate into the sleeping person. We will see
          their hair blow from their ear, as if a ghostly breath is whispering something privately, and
          chillingly. We might even hear mournful crying of "help me, help me" from perhaps a
          poltergeist. Beyond the toaster and the microwave oven, the ectoplasmic manifestations will
          finally develop first and foremost from the television sets that are on during static hours, as if a
          form is trying to climb out of the TV set and into your home to haunt you. This could be the
          climax of the story.
                         
                         
                         
          Another aspect of the dog's being affected by the Haunting, could be for the family to see it roll
          over on its back, as if it is being tickled on the tummy; and without anything obviously petting it,
          he wags his right leg, the common reaction of most dogs when being tickled above the
          abdomen.
                         
                         
                         
          One possible ending for NIGHT TIME could be the evacuation of the town by the townspeople.
          As we slowly pan through the empty town and its deserted homes, we see ghost fires being lit.
          The town burns, TV sets imploding; the burial ground has not been consecrated, and the souls
          are set to rest in peace.
                         
                         
                         
          Addition to treatment dated July 31, 1980
                         
                         
                         
          A petition has been started by the Eisenhowers to force the Freelings to move from the
          neighborhood. Following various threatening telephone calls throughout dinner, Steven angrily
          calls the police and asks for someone to come out and investigate the situation. A call from the
          Freeling home or other families on this community suburb, protesting unusual occurrences.
                         
                         
                         
          A policeman arrives approximately 8pm. He asks Steven and his family questions about recent
          threats, etc. And then falls into a serious discussion about the Freelings moving from the
          neighborhood all together. At least consider a temporary move. Growing hostility has been
          evident through periodic vandalism. Several windows over the last week with broken windows
          in their house and automobile along with other assorted mischief. Steven loses his temper at
          one point during their conversation and questions whether the local police department has
          really made a concerted effort to do anything to protect his family let alone control this
          mounting violence. As the conversation heightens almost to hysteria, an iron comes hurling
          through the living room plate glass window followed by the loud chanting of an angry mob
          outside, "Free us from the Freelings." Steven grabs the police man and screams, "What are you
          going to do about that?" pointing hysterically out the window. Flustered, the policeman frees
          himself from Steven's grasp and takes control by ordering Nora and the children into the living
          room on the floor out of the way of the windows. Things settle for a bit and the policeman and
          Steven move toward the front door. He reaches over to pull it open, gun drawn, he jumps back
          just as a frying pan flies by catching the corner of the door jamb. Out of sight, but with the door
          still ajar, the policeman yells orders for the crowd to disperse. Footsteps and scurrying can now
          be heard on the roof, Nora attempting to calm the children. Lightheartedly (on the surface), she
          heads to the kitchen to get the children some milk and cookies. It's obvious the crowd, laden
          with guns, frying pans, kitchen knives, crow bars, etc., are paying little attention to the
          policeman's demands. He reaches over to shut the door, the chanting continues, several octaves
          higher now. As the door slams, he yells to Steven to get on the phone for some backup units. As
          he says this, a huge gush of water pours out of the fireplace, sending a cloud of ashes and soot
          into the living room. The children jump up running and screaming. Nora, in the kitchen, sends a
          glass pitcher crashing to the floor, she screams and runs to the living room. Steven, angry and
          frightened, grabs the phone to call for reinforcements but the phone lines have been cut and
          the phone is dead. Nora and the children begin bolting the doors and windows frantically. The
          chanting outside continues. The youngest of the Freelings, Carol Ann, silently sobs in the corner
          of the couch holding snugly to a white stuffed bunny rabbit. In the midst of the terror, she
          suddenly stands and makes her way toward the window, a very content look on her face as she
          gazes outside at the angry faces. Her bunny drops and dangles from her hand as she slowly looks
          toward the sky. Slowly at first, then like locusts, real rocks begin descending from the sky,
          pummeling the mob. People begin screaming and running in all directions. Slowly various
          members of the family stop what they're doing and move toward the living room window.
          Within a few minutes, the yard is cleared of people and rocks cover what was a lawn. The family,
          relieved but uncomfortable, stare silently at Carol Ann, who softly giggles and caresses her
          bunny-off in a world of her own.

          A SUBURBAN HAUNTING WHERE A TYPICAL FAMILY IS MOLESTED BY GHOSTLY
          MANIFESTATIONS THAT FIND ACCESS TO OUR WORLD FROM THEIRS THROUGH THE TELEVISION
          SET AFTER BROADCASTING HAS CEASED.
                         
                         
                         
          It further concerns the epidemic spread through the suburban neighborhood of this malevolent
          haunting. The carrier is the youngest daughter, (Carol Ann). Wherever she goes, "it" follows. The
          film aims to trace the mental disintegration of this American nuclear family unit as well as the
          psychological effects on an entire community, that ultimately sets off a vigil-anti action against
          the Freeling family.

          Nora is feeling very uneasy and tired from little sleep during the night. Steven has headed off for
          work and the children, except for Carol Ann, are all off to school. Jim and Joannie Bender live
          next door and are really the only close neighborhood friends the Freelings have. When the
          housing tract was announced, they were the first two families on the list after camping out in
          line for almost a week. A feat Nora now tends to regret. She telephones Joannie and asks if
          she'd like to come by for a morning cup of coffee. Joannie indicates that it's a pretty busy time
          for her, but before she finishes, Nora cuts in, edging on hysteria, almost begging. A little
          alarmed, Joannie quickly agrees and the Freeling doorbell is ringing within minutes. Nora,
          straining to be relaxed, gives her a big hug and talking a mile-a-minute heads for the kitchen
          with Joannie in tow. Certain things in the house are still disheveled from all the activity during
          the night. Joannie takes notice of this as she follows Nora to the kitchen. A concerned look
          crosses her face as she knows Nora is a meticulous house keeper. Nora hands Joannie a cup of
          coffee, and blurts out, almost in tears, "Joannie, could Steve and the kids stay with you and Jim
          tonight?" Joannie immediately assumes that Nora and Steven are separating, hence the frantic
          call. Nora immediately straightens that out but still avoids any discussion about ghosts. She
          reveals that they believe there have been burglars in the area and they're all feeling a bit
          uncomfortable staying there knowing they haven't been caught. Without hesitation from
          Joannie, everything is arranged.
          Steven arrives home after picking up the kids and finds Nora and Carol Ann patiently waiting in
          the living room with bags packed. She then announces she has made arrangements with Joannie
          and Jim for the family to spend the night at their house. Steven gets slightly irritated, feelinng
          that Nora is over reacting but quickly agrees to have dinner, but not necessarily spend the night.
          All the kids are delighted because the Bender children are close in age and they look forward to
          one big party.
                         
                         
                         
          Following dinner, Lawrence suggests a game of charades. Nora and Joannie are in agreement
          but set the bed time hour at 10:00 pm. After a mass flurry of stacking dishes and clearing the
          table all the kids head to the living room, leaving the adults with coffee in the dining room. The
          kids choose sides and begin acting out various movie idols, etc. We're aware of the adults
          engaged in a loud political discussion and kids screaming clues, guesses, etc. We then focus our
          attention to Angel Freeling as she begins giving her clues. A couple of periodic wisecracks from
          her brother Sweeny and then out of nowhere, Angel freezes and glares into the fireplace with an
          absolutely horrified expression on her face.
                         
                         
                         
          The laughter from the children stops instantly and we visibly see two of the children shudder
          and slowly turn and look in the direction Angel is staring. The fire wavers slightly as if there was
          a breeze. Then from upstairs in the bedroom the 19th Century music album can be heard full
          blast as Angel screams and throws her arms back outstretched and fighting as if being tired to a
          stake. Her face contorts in agony. She throws her head back and forth violently. All the children
          in the living room are stunned and just stare, mesmerized. Angel cries out several times, "No
          more fire! No more fire!" The violent jerking subsides for a moment as her eyes rise, still a
          horrific look on her face, her hair slowly rises as if someone has hold of it and is going to scalp
          her. Again she screams violently and her head drops limply in front of her. Her arms are still
          outstretched but she's become more resolved to the pain now, almost unconscious. We are
          aware that is has become a freezing temperature inside the room, frost has gathered on the
          windows even though it is the middle of July outside. We then become aware of very faint
          imprints of faces in the windows. Then writing starts to appear on the filmy condensation, like
          finger painting. All the screaming has brought Steven and Jim into the living room. Steven enters
          with an angry tone, "What the Hell..." his voice trails off as he sees Sweeny huddled in the
          middle of the floor rocking Angel, trying to comfort and calm her. The other children, with teeth
          chattering, still stare as if in shock. Steven and Jim's arrival breaks the silence. Carol Ann jumps
          up and runs hysterically to her father. Steven scoops her into his arms at the same time that one
          of the Bender children becomes aware of the faces in the windows, she screams, which sets off
          a chain of reaction screaming. Then as quickly as it happened, it ends. The blaring music stops,
          the frost runs off the windows. All the children are obviously shook. Joannie and Nora run in
          with a flurry of questions. None of which has an audible answer from the children. Nora looks at
          Steven, they realize the ghosts have followed them.
          Everyone has gathered with the kids in the kitchen to have warm milk and cookies to calm
          everyone's nerves. Angel is back to normal with little sign of her ordeal. All the kids decide
          they'll sleep in the living room except for the two youngest. Nora and Joannie are in fair
          agreement to this as they head up the stairs with the little ones. The other kids get the sleeping
          bags out and start rearranging the furniture for space. Lawrence Freeling is really impressed
          with the Bender's new Advent TV screen. Johnny Bender runs through the remote control with
          him and they loudly discuss how great the football games can be seen and they can't wait for
          the season to start. Soon things settle down, the kids are set and the grown-ups head upstairs.
          Half way up, Nora says "Ok, everyone quiet, it's way past bed time, lights out, no talking and no
          watching television." After the "good-nights" and the periodic giggling subsides, the room gets
          very quiet except for the usual night time creaks. About 30 minutes go by and we hear
          Lawrence, "psst...Johnny, are you awake?" There's a moaning sound, then "yeah...what'd ya
          want?" (Lawrence) "What time is it?" Johnny looks over at the big Grandfather clock on the far
          wall. "It's 2:00 in the morning. Why are you still awake?" Lawrence ignores the question and
          says "How do you turn on the TV...and make sure there's no sound." (Johnny) whispering,
          "You're nuts, go to sleep, there's nothing on at this hour." (Lawrence) "Wanna bet? We've got to
          get it just as it signs off." (Johnny) "You mean to tell me you like to sit and watch the snow or
          something?" (Lawrence) "Something like that, you'll see." Reluctantly Johnny craws out of his
          sleeping bag and over to the set; flips it on just in time to see the jets go by on the sign off.
          (Lawrence), "Great, perfect timing." (Johnny) "Don't you think there's been enough weird shit
          tonight?" (Lawrence) "Oh come on be a sport, just watch." The two boys crawl back into their
          sleeping bags and with their chins resting on folded arms, they stare in great anticipation at the
          Advent screen and the mass of static snow. Shortly we see both of the boys drift off to sleep
          trying as hard as they can to fight staying awake with no luck. Just as they drift off, the images
          that began to appear in the Freeling home begin to slowly take shape at the Benders. It's 3:00
          am, the Grandfather clock chimes on deaf ears.
                         
          August 8, 1980
                         
          Carol Anne and her best friend, Jeanette are playing house upstairs in Carol Ann's bedroom.
          They have dressed up in various old clothes of Nora's and some of her jewerly and hats. Tea has
          been served though a minature little tea set which Carol Ann has obviously used often with all
          the chips and cracks, etc. Both girls are talking a mile a minute to their dolls. Although this is
          make believe, like any little girls six years old, they're playing very seriously.
                         
          Carol Ann wear an old hat of her mother's. On the left side holding up the netting is an antique
          stick pin which Nora found at one of the local antique shops. The hat is obviously too big for
          Carol Annand as she bends down to serve her doll some tea, the hat tumbles off onto the table.
          Jeanette giggles, grabs the hat and puts it on her doll. Carol Anne, at that point, becomes very
          serious, rises from the table and moves over to the record player. She then puts on the 19th
          Century record; at exactly this moment, Jeanette begins gazing at the stick pin in the hat and in
          slow motion she reaches outand removes it from the hat. Carol Ann, standing sternly and
          motionless by the record player in the background. In the foreground, Jeanette takes the pin, as
          if it were a buck knife and drives it slowly into the chest of her doll. She then removes her hand
          leaving the pin embedded. At the head of th epin we reveal a carving of an Indian Fire God
          (something to be established earlier in the story possibly). Then instantly, Carol Ann reels
          around, confronts Jeanette and begins speaking like an adult (or perhaps in an Indian language),
          all signs of being six years old are gone except for her physical appearance. Then looking straight
          at Jeanette says "She must die." Jeanette turns from Carol Ann, pulls this pin from the chest of
          the doll and with ferocity, drives the pin into the chest a second time. Carol Ann, still gazing in a
          trance, looks at Jeanette, then the doll and the doll burts into flames. Jeanette, as if snapping
          out of a dream, jumps back, startled and runs for the door. The door then bursts into flames.
          Jeanette, terribly frightened now, begins to scream and cry. The door and the doll blazing away
          brings Nora frantically up the stairs. Carol Ann up to this point has not moved. At the sound of
          her mother's voice, she returns to he rnormal voice, "Mommy, mommy make the fire stop!" By
          now, the neighbors have called the fire department. Fire trucks roar up to the house and a
          ladder is quickly thrust up to the 2nd floor, bringing the girls to saftey. As the fireman descends,
          he says under his breath, "oddest thing, only burned a doll and a door, didn't spread to any
          other part of the house. Damnest thing I ever saw."
                         
          August 14, 1980
                         
          Toward the end of the picture, we should reveal that Carol Ann is beginning to "get to" Nora.
          Nora has already felt trapped over the past few years. She married at a very young age. She's
          bright and enthusiastic and has begun to voice her discontent to Steven. It's obvious that Carol
          Ann was not a planned baby as noted by the ages of the other children.
                         
                         
                         
                         NIGHT-NORA'S BEDROOM
                         
          Nora is sound asleep; it's her first night alone in their new house. Steven is on a three day
          business trip. Even with the kids and the dog, Nora has always been a bit nervous without him
          there. Carol Ann comes in after Nora has finally drifted off to sleep. She stands quietly by the
          bed, then softly at first, "Mommy" pause..."Mommy"....pause. Nora wakes up. Groggily, "What
          is it honey?" Carol Ann, "I got somethin' to tell you." Nora, "What honey?" Carol Ann, "I got
          somethin' to say." Nora (getting a little irritated), "Then say it honey, I want to go back to sleep."
          Carol Ann, "Can I get up on the bed to say it?" Nora, "Sure..." she pats the side of the bed, "Now
          what is it you have to tell me?" Carol Ann climbs up and looking straight into her mother's face
          but with a distant stare, she says "It's Night Time, It's Night Time...." Nora is visibly unnerved and
          then windows above Nora's bed fly open; she screams. Sweeny comes running into the room.
          Nora, slightly embarrassed but obviously feeling very distant to Carol Ann. "It's nothing," she
          says, "Carol Ann just startled me, that's all." Sweeny, not quite sure what to make of the
          situation, leads Carol Ann out of the bedroom. He looks in the door, after he's tucked Carol Ann
          in, at his mother, smiles and says "You gonna be alright?" Nora, still a little unsettled, "Just fine,
          see you in the morning. Just the jitters with your dad gone."
                         
                         
                         
          The next day, Nora tries to observe Carol Ann from a distance. Too many unexplained things
          have been happening and Nora is beginning to doubt her own children. While doing relatively
          routine chores, a thought comes to mind. She goes to the phone and calls information for a
          locksmith. "Would it be possible to install a lock on a bedroom door today?" pause..."Oh thank
          you. 3:00 this afternoon. Great." She hangs up. A look of relief crosses her face.
                         
                         
                         
          [the next page is missing]
                         
                         
                         
          Sweeny has fallen asleep in the rocking chair next to the bed. A thoughtful look crosses her
          [Nora's]face as she grabs her robe and heads for the door. A huge back-hoe can be seen past the
          gentleman at the door. "We've come to start diggin' the pool area, ma'am." Nora, with a slight
          look of embarrassment, "Oh, I'm so sorry, I completely forgot it was Saturday-I"ll show you
          around to the back yard." The door closes. As she comes back in, the rest of the family has come
          to life, the record player is already full blast up stairs, Carol Ann transfixed herself in front of
          Saturday morning cartoons. Nora exits the kitchen, where Angel has already started breakfast.
          "Hi mom, I didn't know they were going to start digging the swimming pool today?" Nora, "I
          totally forgot. I even forgot what day it was. God, I wish your father would come home." Angel,
          "I can't wait for a pool." She can tell that Nora isn't really listening, her head buried in the
          refrigerator. Angle (while turning the bacon), "Mom, what happened last night? I heard
          screaming. Sweeny said you'd had a nightmare. It must have been terrible. Do you remember
          any of it?" As she is saying this with her head still buried in the refrigerator, Carol Ann wanders
          in, bunny in tow, and slides unnoticed under Nora's arm to peer in the refrigerator. Nora goes to
          close the refrigerator, catches a glimpse of Carol Ann and lets out a blood-curdling scream. Carol
          Ann, obviously frightened, drops to the floor and bursts into tears. Angel at this point also
          screams and sends the spatula and bacon grease flying everywhere. Nora, more embarrassed
          than anything, bends down to comfort Carol Ann, she looks up at Angel. A big grin spreads
          across her face and they burst into hysterics. Nora:" I guess I'm still a little shook from last
          night."
                         
                         
                         
          Later that afternoon, nerves still a little frazzled, Nora mentions to Sweeny that it might not be a
          bad idea for him to take the other kids to a movie that night. Sweeny is not overly thrilled about
          the idea, but also senses the urgency in his mother's voice. He agrees and they all head off that
          evening to see "Fantasia" at the local theater, leaving Nora and Elmer home for a quiet evening.
          Nora is obviously relieved. She settles into a good book and a warm fire and we're aware that it
          has begun to rain. She calls Steven and gives him a run down on the events of the day but
          doesn't mention the series of events with Carol Ann. They discuss the new pool, Nora "With all
          this rain, I hope we don't end up with too much mud for the cement to set in...when are you
          due home? I really miss you. You know I hate staying in this house when you're not here." We
          hear him mumble a response. Nora, "I know the kids are here and Elmer's right here keeping me
          company but it's not the same...." They both say goodbye at the same time a deafening clap of
          thunder goes off, startling Nora. It's now pouring rain. Nora flips on the television for some
          company and heads to the kitchen for a cup of tea. Then Elmer begins to act very strange. He
          sits staring at the wall as he's been known to do on occasion. At this point though, it makes Nora
          nervous. She calls his name several times with no reaction. He then suddenly bolts for the
          backdoor. She follows him and looks out into the pouring rain. She tries the outside light but the
          bulb is burned out. Leaving the door slightly ajar, she grabs her tea and heads for the living
          room. Very shortly afterward she doses off. She wakes with a jerking motion. She sits up, some
          sitcom is blaring away with canned laughter, we still hear the pouring rain, she looks at her
          watch, the kids will come home in an hour or two. Nora rises to stretch and suddenly out of
          nowhere the 19th Century record album begins blaring away from Carol Ann's and Angel's
          room. Noticeably disturbed and turning lights on as she goes, Nora heads upstairs to check. As
          she slowly enters the bedroom, the arm of the stereo ejects over to the side and the stereo
          shuts itself off. Nora nervously cases the room. Satisfied that it was nothing overly unusual as
          the girls have left the stereo on before, she heads for her bedroom and gets ready for bed. She
          stares at herself in the bathroom mirror. Slowly she reaches up and touches the dark circles that
          have begun to appear under her eyes, she then pulls slightly at the corners as if remembering
          what it was like without the little wrinkles that now appear there. Then she opens the cabinet,
          pulls out the jar of cold cream and begins slowly removing the makeup from her eyes and face,
          staring lethargically in the mirror. The tap water goes on and she begins rinsing her face with
          several handfuls of water. As the splashing continues we see at the far left corner of the mirror a
          very small trickle of blood begin to spread in very fine lines along the natural ridges in the glass
          of the mirror. Her face covered with water she swings around with her eyes closed to grab a
          towel. Dries her face and reaches over to turn on the facets in the bathtub. Still not noticing the
          trickling blood on the mirror, she reaches underneath the sink for her favorite bubble bath. She
          then climbs in the tub, pours plenty in for lots of bubbles. She then adjusts the force of water
          from the taps, settles back, eyes closed and totally relaxed. As the bubbles begin to rise in the
          tub (and for the first time in our frame) we see that they are pink in color. Nora, eyes still closed,
          sees nothing. Moments later we hear Elmer barking up a storm. This rouses Nora. She opens her
          eyes, sees blood now pouring from the faucet instead of water, screams and flies out of the
          bath. As she grabs a towel she sees the mirror-hysterical, she runs to the bedroom and grabs her
          bathrobe. By now Elmer is not only barking but whining as if hurt. Nora goes tearing downstairs
          out the back door yelling "Elmer, Elmer.." It's raining so hard that Nora is soaked within seconds.
          She hesitates for a moment and almost heads back inside, but Elmer cries again and she strains
          to make out his shape in the distance. It's pitch black as she edges her way out onto the patio.
          Suddenly the ground gives way and she plunges into the freshly dug pit for the new swimming
          pool. She attempts to grab the side but the freshly tilled soil is now thick and gooey muck. Nora
          sinks quickly up to her waist in the quick-sand-like mud. She sees one of the pool lights hanging
          by a wire and struggling, tries to grab it. It has now begun to rain even harder and panic is
          definitely beginning to set in with Nora. Desperately she grabs at the light wire, catches it and
          pulls as hard as she can. At that moment, a wagon wheel comes tumbling through the mud
          along with a sea of skeletons and mummies. One after the other she tries to push off them off of
          her as they bob up and down out of the thick gooey mud falling in all directions. Many of the
          skeletons have severed limbs, old bullet holes through the chest and head. Nora is beyond the
          terror that allows you to scream and is consumed with panic. A bolt of lightning strikes very
          close to the pool area and suddenly all the pool lights (just hanging by wires, no covers) go on,
          illuminating this sea of decay. Nora finally gets out a loud scream which dissolves into sobs....we
                         CUT TO:
                         
                         
                         
          The kids coming out of the theater. Carol Ann is sound asleep in Sweeny's arms. Lawrence is
          beside himself about the film. As they make their way back to the house, we hear bits and
          pieces being reenacted by Lawrence. They all clamor inside the house, whispering and giggling
          "Shh...Don't wake Mom." As a few houselights go on, we are faintly aware of streaked mud on
          the carpet and hand prints on the wall. The children stare stunned and frightened. Sweeny
          directs everyone into the living room. Carol Ann, who remains sound asleep, he stretches out on
          the sofa. He motions to Lawrence and Angel to stay with Carol Ann. He then makes his way up
          the stairs, following the trail of mud along the banister, hand smudges on the wall, mud
          covering the door knob and light switch into Nora's room. Dresser drawers are thrown open, a
          bathrobe covered in mud is draped on the bed. Sweeny then follows the trail into the bathroom.
          Horrified by the bathtub full of blood, he jumps back and turns to run out of the bathroom. He
          just catches a glimpse of the mirror as he smashes right into Angel (who had wandered up the
          stairs in search of Sweeny), they both scream. Lawrence yells from down below. "What's
          wrong?" Sweeny and Angel grab each other, Sweeny shudders and Angel begins to cry, "Oh
          Sweeny, what's happened to Mom?" Comforting as best he can he leads her down the stairs
          back to the living room. Carol Ann still sleeps soundly. Sweeny moves over to the picture
          window and realizes Nora's car is gone. A bit relieved, he turns back to Angel. "The car is
          gone...Mom should be alright. We gotta call Dad." He rushes to the phone and dials. Steven
          answers the phone. Sweeny with a slight loss of control in his voice now, "Dad, oh God Dad,
          you've gotta come home tonight!" pause, "No, Mom's gone." Pause, "I don't know but there
          mud everywhere and blood," (he chokes a little bit), "It's awful, and we can't go to the
          neighbors, they all think we're possessed." Long pause while Steven talks, Sweeny, "Ok Dad,
          yeah they're all fine, we're in the living room, Carol Ann is sleeping," pause..."Bye...please
          hurry." Sweeny hangs up the phone and looks into Lawrence and Angel's frightened faces, "He's
          on his way. Everything's going to be OK. Dad said about an hour and a half, he'll try to call the
          police but I'm sure they won't come..." Under his breath "they never believe us anyway."

           Nora driving in a transfixed stare, headlights lighting her face from ongoing cars. We see that
          her hair is caked with mud along with her arms and face. She pulls into a Motel 6 about 30 miles
          outside of town, checks in, and immediately goes to call Steven. There's no answer. She dials
          again, still no answer. She looks at her watch, it's 11pm. Frustrated, she grabs her bag and heads
          across the street to a little local dive cafe called Indian Palms. She fumbles around with the
          menu. Nothing looks very good, the page flips back revealing a historical overview of Indian
          history in the area with a map and pictures from the early 1800's. Nora barely pays attention to
          what she's looking at until she sees a small picture of a ghastly massacre, an artist's conception
          of the actual event. She continues reading and realizes that the massacre took place at the exact
          location of their sub-division. She stuffs the menu in her purse and peels out of the parking area
          back toward town. We cut to the children at the house. All the younger children have dosed off,
          Sweeny lies wide awake cocking his head at every sound. Finally he gets up and walks into the
          kitchen. He opens the refrigerator and the light from inside spills onto the floor in front of him.
          The storm front seems to be moving on and the pounding rain has turned into a howling wind.
          He reaches in to grab some milk just as the wind gusts through the back door, then slams it shut
          causing Sweeny to jump and drop the cartoon of milk. Sweeny moves toward the back door,
          tries the light switch, nothing happens. He slowly opens the door, "Elmer, hey boy...where are
          you?" He then sees pool lights, or rather an eerie glow emanating from the freshly dug hole in
          the back yard. As he steps out onto the patio, cautiously moving toward the illuminated pit, he
          gets within a few feet and a skeletal head emerges slowly over the edge. Horrified, Sweeny loses
          his balance and falls backward into the mud along the edge. He quickly scrambles to his feet,
          sliding across the patio and into the house, never looks back. He then slams the door shut and
          locks it. He runs to the living room. He sees Carol Ann sitting up, her back to him. All we hear is a
          humming lullaby. He moves around to the front of her. She doesn't look at him, only stares out
          the window, singing to her bunny, "It's night time, it's night time..."Still panicked, he wakes the
          other two kids, "C'mon we gotta go!" He looks at Carol Ann, hesitant at first, "You too, let's go."
          He reaches out to grab her hand. She looks at him sternly and says, "No." Sweeny stares for
          just an instant and then reaches over to pick her up. Angel steps in and says,"Here Carol Ann, I'll
          hold your bunny." Carol Ann turns to both of them and in a low rumbling male voice says, "NO,"
          then pulls the head off her bunny, stuffing flying everywhere. From Carol Ann's POV looking at
          the shocked faces of Sweeny and Angel, we see a ghost fire burst into flames in the neighbor's
          house and Jim and Joannie Bender come running out into the street. Then headlights come
          through the living room window playing across the wall and over to Carol Ann's face. Sweeny,
          Angel, and Lawrence turn to run toward the door and it too bursts into flame, just as we hear
          Steven's voice from outside the door,"Sweeny, are you in there?" Sweeny terrified, "Dad, we've
          got to get out of here. She'll burn the place down." His voice trails off as we hear a chair come
          crashing through the picture window. Quickly Steve helps all the kids outside. He yells for Carol
          Ann, Sweeny grabs his arm, "No!" he screams. "She should stay." Steven looks at Sweeny
          dumbfounded. Just then, Nora drives up and comes running to the four of them. Steven starts to
          go in after Carol Anne, Sweeny practically tackles him, "No Dad, please." Nora rushes over, "Oh
          God, believe him he's right..."she buries her head in his chest. We look up and see Carol Ann get
          up and walk slowly, still humming, toward the back door and out into the yard, moving toward
          the pit. Steven and Nora grab the kids and head for the car. We then realize that ghost fires have
          started throughout the neighborhood, even in those houses that have not yet completed
          construction. People are running with few belongings to their cars, some screams and crying can
          be heard.

          These final revisions to the treatment, dated August 23, 1980, change the "white settlers killed
          by Indians" buried under the neighborhood to simply a regular grave yard that Steven's
          company decided to build on top of. It also amps up the danger to Nora in the scene where she
          is attacked by the ghost in her bedroom before running outside and falling into the newly dug
          pool. Finally, it adds an early scene showing the changing of the TV set channels by unseen
          forces (and also renames "Lawrence" to "Robbie").

          Steven Freeling comes from a family of real estate brokers. His father was selling houses when
          they were going for a thousand to five thousand dollars. Both of his brothers are still in business
          with their Dad and Steven went out on his own. His reputation locally is one of the best. He now
          heads up a huge firm responsible for the last five or six major land development in the area. The
          newest being a housing development designed to handle at least 30,000 people. Ground was
          broken on the area little over two years ago and families started to move in about 6 months
          ago. Steven is in charge of showing the houses, clearing escrow, arrangements for personal
          kitchen designs, etc. Approximately all the houses have been filled-it sits in the middle of several
          other housing development and is separated by rows of poplar trees. A grave yard had stood
          here for years which accounts for the delay in developing the area. Through a lot of
          underhanded payoff with the Planning Commission, etc., Steven's company had gotten the ok to
          build provided they moved the graves to another location. Realizing this would be wildly
          expensive, they had publicized transferring the grave yard when in fact they simply moved the
          grave stones to another location but covered the existing grave site with about seven feet of fill
          and about a foot of dirt, quickly got the foundations laid and before anyone really knew what
          happened, installed housing tract. Steven was never involved in the negotiations but served as a
          representative in the community for the company, therefore becoming a target for the ghosts'
          retaliation.
                         
                         
                         
          This sequence will begin with Nora combing her hair at the vanity-however, no one else is home,
          Steven is on a business trip and the kids have gone to the movies to give Nora a little peace and
          quiet.
                         
                         
                         
          Fairly deep in thought, Nora combs through her hair in long slow strokes. Then without warning,
          the brush lifts her hair from one side of her head and lays it down on the other. Nora stares in a
          state of shock. Indentations from fingers can then be seen as if a hand is grabbing her face and
          turning. Nora is still in a state of shock, unable to move. We then see her lips press in, her nose
          shift off to the side a bit and we realize she is being kissed by a ghost. The indentations leave her
          face and she sits shocked for a few minutes. Then in the mirror, she sees a human form take
          shape from a smoke and gaseous material. Nora slowly rises from her chair and begins to move
          toward the door. Staring at the smoke-like shape which is now dissipating, she reaches up to
          turn on the bedroom light. Just as she switches it on, it immediately goes off. Quickly she turns it
          on again and again something switches it off. She gasps a little and turns to run down the hall
          and the stairs to the living room turning lights on as she goes but they go off as quickly as she
          turns them on. She then turns on the television set which immediately goes off. She runs for the
          phone, which is invisibly taken out of her hand and hung up. Truly frightened, she runs upstairs
          again, half way up the stairs as if someone stepped on the back of her dress, she falls. We then
          see a hand print as if something were gripping her ankle and it begins moving up her leg. Nora
          stares for a moment in horror and then begins to resist, trying to pull herself up the stairs,
          reaching desperately for the banister. As she breaks free she runs into the bedroom, the door
          slams shut moments later and the smokey, gaseous form begins to appear again. We can only
          see it with the moonlight streaming through the window. Nora sits shivering on the corner of
          the bed with her hands crossed over her chest holding onto her shoulders. We're then aware of
          the hand indentations again which grab her wrists and slowly but forcefully uncross her arms
          and drop them to her side. Nora, under her breath, on the verge of tears says, "No, no please
          don't hurt me..." As she says this, her night gown is slowly ripped off her shoulders and she is
          pushed down on the bed. We then see the hand indentations grasp her breast with a strong
          massaging effect and move down to her underwear which is gradually slipped back on the bed.
          Not able to grab at any human form she takes hold of the sheets for leverage to try and get out
          of the ghost's grasp. In the struggle she rolls off the bed, but we're aware that she still can't get
          up. Her arms are suddenly thrown back straight over the top of her head and then her legs are
          pulled apart forcefully, we can see on Nora's face sheer terror beyond the ability to cry. Then
          the sheet over the top of them begins to rise up and down rhythmically, and several times we
          see her face being kissed. Then the sheet falls away from her as if someone rolled over and took
          the sheet with them. Nora, for an instant, stares at the sheet, then jumps up and runs for the
          door grabbing her robe on the way out. She gets downstairs, grabs her purse and heads for the
          front door. She takes hold of the handle and finds that she can't turn it. She pulls frantically to
          no avail. She then runs for the back door, quickly switches on the outside light and runs out on
          the patio. Finding it difficult to see, she runs into the patio table, and knocks a chair over just as
          the outside light goes off. Now, truly horrified she starts backing out onto the lawn. A clap of
          thunder goes off startling her, she turns and steps right into the freshly dug pit for the new
          swimming pool. Another clap of thunder, a bolt of lightning and a huge downpour starts. The
          freshly tilled soil turns into a gooey quick sand like mud very quickly. One end of the pool is very
          steep and as Nora tries desperately to climb out the grade is so steep she slides back each time.
          After the second or third slide, the mud is now up around her waist, another clap of thunder and
          suddenly the pool lights come on. Nora looks around for a moment and suddenly we see areas
          in the mud that start to rise up and then shafts of mud as the pouring rain hits these, we realize
          they are skeletons, more and more bobbing to the surface, then again a bolt of lightening strikes
          and short circuits the pool lights, causing a strobe effect. In sheer terror, eyes shut, Nora begins
          screaming, clawing frantically trying to make her way to the shallow end of the pool. Just as she
          nears the edge a hand reaches out to help her. With one hand resting on the pools edge and the
          other in this hand, she looks up into the eyes of her ghost, a smoke like apparition. For the first
          time, we can make out a human like face. Nora screams and goes sliding down back into the sea
          of skeletons only to come face to face with the corpse of the ghost she just saw. The last image
          we see is Nora huddled in the corner of the pool, strobe lights going and a sea of bobbing
          skeletons, rain pouring down and occasional lightening and thunder.

          Steven sits in the living room one evening after a hard day's work watching Monday Night
          Football with his two boys, Sweeny and Robbie (change name from Lawrence in previous
          treatment). Just as the touchdown pass is thrown, the television goes to snow. Steven jumps up
          furious and starts screaming at the neighbors. He runs over to Jim Bender's house, who is also
          furious and finds that he thinks that Steven's remote control changed the channel on his set.
          They argue fervently for a few minutes and Steven heads back to the house convinced now that
          he will just move the TV somewhere else in the house as to avoid the neighbor's remote control.
          During the night the television set clicks on and starts racing through the channels till it comes
          to snow. This wakes Steven with a start. He jumps out of bed, throws on a robe and races over
          to the neighbor's house. After pounding on the door, Jim Bender answers. Steven immediately
          flies off the handle accusing him of disrupting the household. Jim seems a bit flustered saying he
          was just about to head over to his house because his set went on voluntarily.
                         
                         
                         
          Steven sees this as just an excuse but concedes. This remote control duel continues for a few
          days, until, one evening while the family is watching a late movie, the channels begin racing
          around until they come to snow. Steven jumps up and races outside over to their neighbor's
          house. Peeking through the window, he realizes they are gone. He tries the door several times
          and walks around to the back of the house. He finds this a bit disquieting and heads back to his
          house. As he turns his back, we are aware that the TV set in the neighbor's house clicks on, just
          as we hear a scream from the Freeling home. Nora seems a little more unnerved as Steven
          enters the house, insisting that some form came out of the television set. Steven passes this off
          as her imagination, but doesn't let on that the neighbors weren't home to cause the channel
          changing....thus begins the silent invasion of the Freeling home through the static snow of their
          television sets.

          Scene 1. TITLE SEQUENCE

          
          Darkness. Then, a burst of sparks from a bowl held in a scaly hand.
          The light shows us a mural. We start to move along the wall. First we
          see stars and planets, painted in a primitive, stylized fashion on
          bare rock. A voice on the track speaks softly to us.

          
          VOICE: We did not always live in hiding.

          
          We have come to the image of a huge family tree, which springs from
          a single seed but divides into two separate halves. On the left,
          ruled by the moon, the branches blossom into extraordinary creatures.
          On the right, by sunlight, the branches end in ordinary human beings.

          
          Upon the word Nightbreed the title comes up on the screen, against
          the image of a moon painted on the wall.

          2L. EXT. REEDS NIGHT


          
          Cut to a real moon. Then cut wide to a moonlit landscape, through
          which the camera careens madly. The soundtrack, which was lush and
          almost sacred in the mural chamber, erupts into a tribal rhythm. We
          glimpse creatures in the darkness, moving through the reeds. They are
          barely more than silhouettes. We see teeth, and gleaming eyes;
          glimpses of naked, patterned flesh. Only glimpses.

          

          2M. INT. MURAL CHAMBER


          
          Cut back to the mural chamber. Now we have moved away from the tree
          to a more brutal scene. A symbolic representation of a great
          apocalyptic war between Naturals and Breed. Terrible scenes of
          destruction.

          
          VOICE: But the Naturals made war on us. They feared us for our
          strength. They envied our powers. They called us monsters, killing us
          by whatever means their malice could invent, finding in each of us
          our particular vulnerability. 

          
          We are scanning scenes of that war. A breed being staked like a
          vampire. Another being shot like a werewolf. Another exposed to
          sunlight.

          
          VOICE: None of us was safe. The tribes of the moon dwindled. Our
          gods were slaughtered, our homes destroyed. It was the Apocalypse.

          

          2N. EXT. NECROPOLIS WALL AND GATES


          
          Cut back to the landscape. The clouds roil above the heads of the
          creatures heading through the reeds. We see their destination now. A
          huge wall, with gates.

          

          2P. INT. MURAL CHAMBER


          
          And back to the mural chamber, and a final scene. The gates we've
          just seen are in the painting. Looking over them, calling the Breed
          in, is a vast indistinct form: that of Baphomet. His eyes burn; his
          arms are open in welcome.

          
          VOICE: Only one of our Gods survived the holocaust. Baphomet.
          Wounded and near death, he summoned us, the last of the last, into
          hiding. Into Midian, where we wait now. The battle is over but not
          the war. There will come a saviour.

          
          Now we've moved beyond the image of the gate into a new patch of
          wall on which the pictures are only vague sketches. We can interpret
          some of the images nevertheless: a man with a bloody hole in the
          middle of his chest. A man wearing a mask like a skull. We linger on
          a faceless figure.

          
          VOICE: His name is Cabal. He will lead and give us back the Night.
          We are the tribes of the moon. We are the Nightbreed.

          
          The titles end.

          

          2Q. EXT. NECROPOLIS WALL AND GATES


          
          Cut back to the landscape. Now we are at the gates, and the
          creatures slip through and away into the mist. Only one, a beautiful,
          ferocious female called Shuna Sassi remains, turning to look at us.
          She beckons.

          
          SHUNA: Come...

          
          The camera retreats from her.

          
          SHUNA: Will you not come?

          
          Now the last of the creatures, the Drummer, takes her by the arm,
          snatching her away through the gates. As she disappears, the camera
          follows again, stopping at the gates themselves, which close with an
          unearthly din.

          C.U. on Boone, closed eyes. He is dreaming. His gaze roves beneath
          his lids.

          
          Lori's lips come into shot kissing first his eyes and then traveling
          down his face to his mouth.

          
          LORI: Boone...wake up.

          
          Boone's eyes flicker open.

          
          LORI: Hi. You OK?

          
          Boone: Yep.

          
          Now Boone's eyes are fully open. He sits up. Looks towards the open
          window. Night beyond. She kisses him, distracting him from the sight
          of the window.

          
          LORI: You want something to eat?

          
          BOONE: Sure. What time is it?

          
          LORI: Nine-thirty. I was letting you doze.

          
          BOONE: Thought you'd worn me out, huh?

          
          Lori smiles, and kisses him, then crosses the room to the kitchen
          area, picks up some fruit, and a knife, carrying both back to where
          Boone is lying on the bed. It is unmade. Both Lori and Boone are
          lightly dressed, clothes casually thrown on after an afternoon
          lovemaking.

          
          Lori: You know what?

          
          BOONE: What?

          
          LORI: We should get out of Calgary for a few days. Just take off.

          
          BOONE: Anywhere special?

          
          LORI: Somewhere we can be alone together.

          
          BOONE: More alone than this?

          
          LORI: Yeah. Just you and me. No work. No telephone calls. No...

          
          BOONE: Bad dreams.

          
          LORI: No bad dreams.

          
          BOONE: How did you know?

          
          LORI: I know. I always know. It's no big deal.

          
          BOONE: I'm going around in some crazy loop in my head.

          
          LORI: You're not crazy.

          
          BOONE: No.

          
          LORI: Say it like you mean it.

          
          BOONE: I believe it. I'm not crazy. But I want this damn dream out
          of my head. 

          
          He gets up and goes to the window.

          
          BOONE: Decker's started calling me again.

          
          LORI: When?

          
          BOONE: All last week. Every day.

          
          LORI: What does he want?

          
          BOONE: I don't know. I haven't called him back.

          
          LORI: If he can help, see him. Tell him it's all gone but the bad
          dreams.

          
          BOONE: They're not bad. That's what's weird. The more I have them
          the more I like them. Now I do sound like a crazy, right?

          
          LORI: No. You sound like the man I love. A little haunted, maybe,
          but the sanest man I ever met.

          
          BOONE: Keep going.

          
          LORI: Will you see Decker?

          
          BOONE: You think I should?

          
          LORI: Where's the harm? You tell him from me, I'm the only thing you
          should be dreaming about.

          
          BOONE: I don't think he'd get it. He never had a wet dream in his
          life.

          
          LORI: I don't want to be competing with things I can't see, Boone.
          Can't share I don't want to be always feeling that something's
          pulling at you.

          
          BOONE: I'm not going anywhere, Lori. Except with you.

          
          LORI: I can't hear that often enough.

          
          BOONE: I'll never leave you. Not ever. I swear.

          
          He kisses her, passionately.

          
          BOONE: Can't remember a time when I didn't love you.

          
          LORI: How about before we met?

          
          BOONE: Even then.

          
          They kiss again. We move past them into the darkness outside the
          window.

          
          Dissolve to the moon, clearing cloud.

          16. EXT. RICKMAN HOUSE NIGHT


          
          A pleasant house in a pleasant neighborhood. Lights burn inside.

          

          17. INT. RICKMAN HOUSE NIGHT


          
          Melissa Rickman emerges from the lounge, with a Dagwood sandwich, a
          work in progress. She is thirty-five, and going to seed in a gentle
          way. Her husband, Lou Rickman, a similar type, is planted in front of
          the television.

          
          MELISSA: Okay, you want ham, cheese, pickle, mustard?

          
          LOU: All of the above and a brewski, thank you.

          
          MELISSA: You're getting porky, Lou.

          
          LOU [amiable - tried to grab her]: I'm comfortable. I like myself
          fat. I like you fat too...

          
          MELISSA [secretly amused - she hushes him]: Keep it down, Lou,
          you'll wake the munchkins.

          
          She hears something upstairs, goes to the foot of the stairs, looks
          up. Her eldest son, Lou Two, waddles into view. He's five.

          
          LOU TWO: Mommy...

          
          MELISSA: Sweetie, you're supposed to be beddy-bye.

          
          LOU TWO: I heard something.

          
          MELISSA: What did you hear?

          
          LOU TWO: Bad man.

          
          MELISSA: No, everything's okay. You go back to bed, munchkin, I'll
          be up to see you in a minute.

          
          LOU [V.O.]: How's that sandwich coming?

          
          MELISSA: Coming...

          
          Melissa disappears from the bottom of the stairs.

          

          18. INT. RICKMAN KITCHEN NIGHT


          
          Melissa enters, moves out of sight. We stay at the door. A figure
          appears dressed in black, knives in both hands, and crosses to leave
          the screen again. We do not see his face. But we hear his labours:
          the sound of the blades slicing Melissa. She staggers into view,
          grabbing hold of her slit throat. Blood bubbles between her fingers.
          The figure appears behind her. She turns, as the knife descends.

          

          19. INT. RICKMAN LOUNGE NIGHT


          
          Lou hears a sound, rises and moves towards the kitchen door.

          
          LOU: Melissa?

          
          At the top of the stairs, Lou Two watches wide-eyed.

          

          20. INT. RICKMAN STAIRS NIGHT


          
          Lou Two's P.O.V. - We see blood running along the highway.

          

          21. INT. RICKMAN KITCHEN NIGHT


          
          Lou reaches the kitchen door and sees Melissa laid out, dead, on the
          kitchen table

          
          LOU: Oh God - GOD!

          
          Lou enters, the figure emerges from behind him. While we remain at
          the door watching, detached, Lou fights back, throwing himself back
          and forth around the kitchen. But the figure is much stronger. We
          glimpse its face now, it is a mask, with a zipper for a mouth and
          buttons for eyes, blank. Devoid of compassion, hatred or regret. A
          death's head, made by a mad child.

          
          Atop the stairs, Lou Two listens. His baby sister cries in her cot.
          He looks her way then back downstairs. The sounds cease. Silence.
          Terror on his face. Then the child's perfect nightmare appears at the
          bottom of the stairs. The figure, heavy knife in hand, starts to
          climb, dragging Lou's bloody body after him by the hair.

          clicks on.

          
          BOONE [on tape]: Hi. Please leave a message.

          
          LORI [thru phone]: Boone, pick up will you? Boone? Are you there?
          Boone? Okay, so don't answer. See you tomorrow...G'night.

          Three patrol cars, an ambulance, policeman restraining a small crowd
          gathered outside. A n.d. sedan roars up, red bubble light flashing,
          and Inspector Joyce gets out and moves towards the house. He's
          greeted by the Medical Examiner, Dr Burton, just exiting, carrying a
          medical bag.

          
          BURTON [bitter]: Brace yourself, Inspector.

          
          JOYCE: Same profile?

          
          BURTON: Unmistakable. Doesn't miss a trick.

          
          JOYCE [anguished]: Kids? Two kids?

          
          BURTON: If it's any comfort, they went quickly.

          
          JOYCE: Yeah. Makes me feel a whole lot better about the sick fuck.

          
          BURTON: Find this guy, Joyce. They say these guys want to be caught.
          I think this one likes it too much.

          
          A rookie patrolman stands on the doorstep, on the verge of tears.

          
          JOYCE [gently]: Let's get these tourists back, Officer.

          
          POLICEMAN: Yes sir.

          
          JOYCE [to Burton]: If we can't protect the kids, what the hell use
          are we?

          29. INT. DR DECKER'S OFFICE DAY


          
          Close on a pile of tapes, marked with dates over a period of two
          years. They're on Decker's desk.

          
          DECKER: I've been listening to the tapes of our sessions. All two
          years' worth...

          
          We move from the tapes to Decker, who gets up from his desk and
          moves around to the other side. Boone is sitting on the other side of
          the desk, his posture far from relaxed. He hates this room. As Decker
          moves, we take in the various pictures on the walls. Dance pictures,
          photographs of Decker with civic dignitaries, crippled children etc.

          
          BOONE: Why?

          
          DECKER: Most of my colleagues would have walked away from a case
          like yours. The most they would have done was drug you. But you...you
          intrigued me. All the talk of monsters. And Midian. Remember Midian?

          
          BOONE: That wasn't me. I heard about Midian from other people.

          
          DECKER: But you made it part of your private mythology.

          
          BOONE: I suppose I did. It was a place of refuge.

          
          DECKER: When you imagined yourself being taken off to this invented
          city, to Midian, what crimes were you going to be forgiven?

          
          Boone's looking uneasy now. He wipes sweat from his upper lip.

          
          BOONE: You know what I used to dream.

          
          DECKER: Yes. There's a remarkable consistency in the images you see.
          Great detail. Almost as though the violence was real.

          
          BOONE: They were just bad dreams. Midian doesn't exist. Monsters
          don't exist. 

          
          DECKER: But murder does, Boone. Murder's very real. It may start in
          the mind, but it ends up changing to flesh and blood.

          
          He picks up the envelope we saw in his previous scene, and takes the
          photographs out.

          
          DECKER [cont.]: Two days ago the police brought me some
          photographs. They wanted to know if I had any patients who might be
          capable of what's in these photographs. I'm going to show you them.
          Are you ready for that?

          
          Boone nods.

          
          Decker lays the photographs on the table. Boone picks them up. We
          get glimpses of what they contain. Domestic horrors. Bloody scenes of
          corpses caught by the camera in grotesque positions, sliced up and
          bleeding. Boone's breath quickens.

          
          DECKER [cont.]: When you talk about murder on the tapes, I thought
          it was invention. Now I'm not so sure.

          
          Boone keeps staring at the pictures. The glassy eyes stare hard at
          him. His breathing is now rapid and shallow. One or two of the images
          seem to move. Bodies twitch. He drops the photographs.

          
          BOONE: I didn't...

          
          DECKER: Didn't what?

          
          BOONE: They were bad dreams.

          
          DECKER: What you describe in your sessions is very specific. Houses;
          faces...

          
          BOONE: I don't remember.

          
          DECKER: You want to hear?

          
          BOONE: No!

          
          Decker picks up the photographs. Boone, highly agitated, gets up and
          paces the room.

          
          BOONE[cont.]: You think I did this?

          
          DECKER: Six families killed over a two year period. All within
          driving distance of Calgary...

          
          BOONE [fury]: Do you think I did this?

          
          DECKER: I hope to God you didn't, for both our sakes. We've come a
          long way together. I don't want to believe this any more than you do.

          
          BOONE: But you do.

          
          DECKER: I wouldn't put us through this pain if I didn't...if I
          wasn't...afraid you had.

          
          BOONE [desperate; helpless]: What do I do? God, tell me what to do.

          
          DECKER: I can only go so far on your behalf. Patient
          confidentiality's one thing. Protecting a killer is another.

          
          BOONE [breaking down]: Jesus...Jesus...Jesus...

          
          Decker returns to his desk. Puts the photographs down and picks up a
          vial of prescription pills. He crosses to boone.

          
          DECKER: Listen to me. Take these, they'll help. Go home, and
          consider what we've talked about. I'm going to give you twenty-four
          hours to go to the police and answer their questions of your own
          accord. That's as long as I can give you. if you haven't complied by
          then, I'm afraid I'll have to tell them what I know.

          
          Boone grabs the pills.

          
          DECKER [cont.]: I can't tell you how sorry I am...

          Decker sits at his desk, lifts his briefcase, opens it, tosses the

          on the verge of some powerful emotion. Rage? Revulsion? He snaps shut
          the briefcase. The emotion passes.

          Boone opens his drawers and pulls out photographs, his passport etc
          and starts to make a pile with them. He pours lighter fuel on the
          pictures, and watches them burn. Sitting against the wall still
          sweating he takes some more pills.

          
          We see Lori's love letters burn and hear her voice speaking the
          words as they are consumed.

          
          Boone cries. Then he hears Lori's voice say:

          
          LORI: Boone...

          
          Lori is sitting on the edge of the bed. Boone looks round, sees
          himself against the wall and moves forward past the real Boone towards
          the bed...

          
          Boone watches as he and Lori make love on the bed. We close in on
          the love-making. Lori leans to kiss him.

          
          BOONE: I'll never leave you...

          
          Cut back to boone, his face all grief.

          The water pours on him.

          

          41. HALLUCINATION

          
          Another of the murder scenes comes to life. Corpses pulse with
          hideous animation.

          

          42. INT. BOONE'S BATHROOM AFTERNOON


          
          With a cry Boone slides to the shower floor, panting, haunted,
          destroyed.

          
          BOONE [faintly]: ...I did it...I did it all...

          

          43. INT. BOONE'S APARTMENT EVENING


          
          Behind him, the last of the fire flickers. He looks through the
          blinds at the sunset. Takes another pill. Puts on his leather jacket.
          Exits. The door slams.

          

          44. SCENE DELETED

          

          45. INT. NIGHTCLUB NIGHT


          
          Lori is on stage, sexy, vivacious, fronting a tight C & W band in a
          hip rendition of 'Johnny Be Angry'.

          

          46. INT. NIGHTCLUB NIGHT


          
          Lori's P.O.V. looking though the crowd in front of the stage. Lori
          spots Boone standing near the entrance, his face in shadow.

          
          Her eyes light up with joy as the song builds to climax. It ends.
          Applause, cat whistles, foot stomping. Lori's in heaven. She looks
          out again. 

          
          Boone is gone.

          

          47. EXT. HIGHWAY NIGHT


          
          Boone steps into view by the side of the road, watches the traffic.

          

          INTERCUT:

          

          48. INT. NIGHTCLUB CORRIDOR NIGHT


          
          Confused and worried, Lori stands in the empty corridor, a note
          Boone has left for her in her hand.

          
          Boone edges out closer to the road. Spots a huge semi with a fully
          loaded trailer barrelling down towards him.

          
          Lori opens the note and reads: 'Keep this. Burn the rest. All
          wrong.' Tears burst from Lori's eyes.

          
          Boone flings himself in front of the oncoming truck.

          

          CUT TO BLACK:

          

          FADE IN:

          

          49. INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM NIGHT


          
          A blaze of light. A bustling emergency receiving area. A stern nurse
          goes through the pockets of Boone's jackets, which is lying beside
          him on a gurney. His eyes are closed, face and T-shirt bloody. She
          fishes out the vial of pills.

          
          Boone moans, opens his eyes.

          
          NURSE Lucky you're in one piece, fella.

          
          BOONE [realizing where he is]: ...can't even kill myself...

          
          NURSE: There's a cheerful thought. [to an approaching doctor] I
          don't know what kind of fuel he's using, but this guy's cruising at
          about 35,000 feet.

          
          The doctor takes the vial of pills, checks the label. Opens Boone's
          eyes, shines a penlight flash on the pupils. Boone recoils. Doctor
          takes his pulse.

          
          DOCTOR: You don't hit that altitude on lithium carbonate. Let's get
          the prescribing doctor on the line... [finally - to Boone] Okay,
          we're doing all right, aren't we? Tell me, what've you been taking
          tonight, partner?

          
          BOONE: Lithium...

          
          The doctor opens the vial, looks at a handful of the pills.

          
          DOCTOR: Lithium? This isn't lithium, my friend. [to the nurse] Let's
          move him. Observation, let's get an IV, valium/saline, 200 milligrams
          percodan for pain, as needed...[quietly - hands the pills to the
          nurse] We'll have to call this in.

          
          She nods. With considerable effort, Boone sits up urgently and grabs
          the doctor's hand, holding the pills.

          
          BOONE: What was I taking?

          
          DOCTOR [patronizing]: Easy. We don't know until we run some tests.
          Looks like some kind of lab quality psychotropic hallucinogen. You're
          on what we used to call a 'bad trip' there, buddy. You relax now,
          you're gonna be fine.

          
          The doctor and nurse ease Boone back down onto the gurney. The
          doctor moves away. The nurse pulls back the curtain and rolls Boone
          across the hall into a semi-private room

          

          50. INT. SEMI-PRIVATE HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT


          
          From emergency behind them, a warning buzzer sounds.

          
          VOICE [thru loudspeaker]: Code blue! Code blue!

          
          In an emergency room cubicle, a patient is having a seizure. The
          nurse rushes off, leaving Boone. Interns roll the cardiac cart
          towards the cubicle and curtains close around the scene.

          
          The door to Boone's room swings closed, shutting out the sounds.
          Boone exhales heavily. Closes his eyes.

          
          NARCISSE [V.O.] [muttering - half mumbled ranting]: Shit! Shit! Take
          me, why don't you take me?

          
          Boone opens his eyes. Looks across the room at Narcisse, a wild man,
          half-derelict, half-punk, bloodied, his hand bandaged, pacing back
          and forth like a caged cat, staring out of a large picture window at
          the night.

          

          51. EXT. HOSPITAL WINDOW NIGHT


          
          Looking in at the brightly lit window framed in the dark building,
          as Narcisse restlessly moves across it, peering outside.

          

          52. INT. SEMI-PRIVATE HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT


          
          NARCISSE [low and anxious]: They've gone, they've gone, they were
          here, they were coming for me, where'd they go? Shit!

          
          BOONE: Hey...

          
          NARCISSE [turns on him - viciously]: Shut up, shut up! They saw you,
          they won't come while you're here, they won't show themselves to the
          likes of you, don't you see that?

          
          BOONE [placating - knows the type]: Sure, okay.

          
          NARCISSE: Shit! I've missed them, I've missed them! You scared them
          off, you kept them from me!

          
          Narcisse paces again, starting to sob and sniffle. Boone leans back.

          
          NARCISSE [cont.] [barely audible - between cries]:
          ...Midian...Midian...

          
          Boone's eyes open like a shot.

          
          BOONE: What did you say?

          
          NARCISSE: I said shut up, you want to ruin everything?

          
          Boone leaps to his feet, grabs and easily overpowers the smaller man.

          
          BOONE: What did you say, just now?

          
          NARCISSE [suddenly friendly]: What did you say, just now?

          
          BOONE: You said Midian.

          
          NARICSSE [coyly]: Did I? Maybe...

          
          BOONE [hurting him - desperate]: What do you know about it?

          
          NARCISSE: It's where the monsters go. It takes away the pain...

          
          Narcisse reaches his hands into his pockets, then comes out with
          long, silver, razor-sharp artificial nails, curved like hooks,
          attached to his thumbs. He holds them right at Boone's throat, ready
          to cut. He smiles.

          
          NARCISSE [cont.]: ...what do you know about it?

          
          BOONE [pause; cautiously]: They forgive you there.

          
          NARCISSE: Uh-huh. Ever kill anybody?

          
          BOONE: Yes.

          
          NARCISSE: See, they only take you if you're worthy. You know what
          they do to those that aren't worthy?

          
          Boone shakes his head. Narcisse draws one razor-nail lightly across
          his own throat. A thin trickle of blood runs down his neck. He
          chuckles.

          
          BOONE: It's real. Midian's real. [Narcisse nods; carefully] And you
          know...where it is. Don't you? We could go there...

          
          NARCISSE: They sent you. They sent you to take me.

          
          BOONE: That's right. But first I need to know...you have to tell
          me...where it is.

          
          NARCISSE: It's a test? [Boone nods; Narcisse leans in to him -
          whispers] No maps.

          
          BOONE: But you do know. Don't you?

          
          NARCISSE [looks around; leans in again]: North of Athabasca. East of
          Peace River. Near Shere Neck, north of Dwyer.

          
          Satisfied, Boone releases him, go back to the bed, collects his
          jacket.

          
          NARCISSE [cont.] [ exhilarated]: You'll take me with you, I'm
          worthy, you ask anyone, I knew you'd come, they sent you to take me,
          I was waiting. I know, I know, first I have to show you, that's how
          it works.

          
          Boone is looking out of the window in the door, sizing up his escape.

          
          BOONE: Show me what?

          
          NARCISSE: My true face. That's what there are for. [he raises his
          bladed thumbs] So you can see. I'm not a natural man. Underneath I'm
          a monster, that's how it works; I show you, then you take me with
          you...

          
          He puts the blade to either side of his face. We hear the skin pop.

          

          BOONE: NO!

          
          Blood pours from Narcisse's face, as he traces the outline of his
          face.

          

          53. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM NIGHT


          
          Dr Decker, who's just arrived with Lieutenant Joyce and two
          policemen, is speaking with the doctor that examined Boone.

          
          DECKER [urgent - showing Boone's file]: ...he was an abandoned
          child, raised by the state, first diagnosis of incipient
          schizophrenia at thirteen, juvenile delinquency, periodically
          institutionalized through early adulthood...some violent episodes,
          never criminally charged as an adult, he's been in my care for less
          than a year...

          
          A bloodcurdling scream from the semi-private room rivets the
          attention of the emergency room

          

          54. EXT. SEMI-PRIVATE ROOM NIGHT


          
          Following the nurse and an intern as they burst into the room and
          are greeted with the sight of Narcisse, blood running freely,
          ripping the least of his scalp off his bare skull, laughing and
          crying maniacally.

          
          Boone stands near the door, horrified.

          
          NARCISSE [variously]: TAKE ME! TAKE ME! I'M A MONSTER!

          
          Nurse [over - to Boone] What the hell have you done?

          
          Boone: Nothing!

          
          INTERN: Fucking junkies! [at the door - yelling into the corridor]
          Doctor!

          
          As the door swings open, Boone looks out into the corridor and at
          the far end of the emergency room he sees Decker and the cops looking
          his way. Medical support move towards the room, as the nurse and
          intern try to contain the ranting Narcisse.

          
          Boone grabs a loose doctor's coat off the back of the door, slips it
          on and backs out of the room.

          
          BOONE: Let's get some help in here!

          
          Pandemonium. Narcisse screams, as a half-dozen people struggle to
          subdue him. As help continues to rush into the room, Boone slowly
          backs away, out and around a corner. He stops beside a swinging door,
          sensing something.

          

          55. EXT. SEMI-PRIVATE ROOM NIGHT


          
          Dr Decker moving through emergency towards the mêlée, stops on the
          other side of the swinging door, his senses lit up with alarm. He
          slowly turns to the door. Pushes it open. Empty.

          

          56. EXT. HOSPITAL NIGHT


          
          Boone moves rapidly away from the exit into the parking lot, tossing
          off the white coat, breaking into a run. He tries several car doors,
          finds one open, gets in.

          

          57. INT. CAR NIGHT


          
          With a rush of adrenal intensity, Boone expertly rips open an under
          panel of the dash, locates and patches together the correct ignition
          wires and hot-starts the car. Closes the door. Puts it in gear.

          

          58. EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT


          

          INT. CAR NIGHT


          
          Boone slowly drives out of the lot trying not to attract the
          attention of the fleet of patrol cars sirens wailing, pouring into
          the area.

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          59. EXT. FREEWAY NIGHT


          
          Boone drives up an entrance ramp and onto the highway, past a sign
          that reads:

          

          'HIGHWAY 2/NORTH'

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          60. INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY WARD NIGHT


          
          Dr Decker, a few policeman and medical personnel wait outside the
          door leading to the semi-private room. Lieutenant Joyce exits and a
          surgeon follows a moment later.

          
          DECKER: What's he saying?

          
          JOYCE: He's talking but he's not making any sense. Something about a
          place called Midian.

          
          SURGEON: He's dying. I think he wants to die.

          
          Pause. The surgeon moves on.

          
          DECKER [unobtrusively - to Joyce]: Lieutenant, I know Boone, I know
          how he talks, how he manipulates. Perhaps if the right thing is said
          to this man it'll trigger something...

          
          JOYCE [consider]: No harm in trying.

          
          DECKER: I'll do my best. But I'll need privacy.

          
          Decker enters the room.

          

          61. EXT. SEMI-PRIVATE ROOM NIGHT 


          
          Looking in through the room, we see Decker cross the room to the bed
          where Narcisse is lying. Decker says something to the nurse. She
          exits. Decker moves closer to the bed. He reaches into his pocket for
          something and moves out of our sight.

          

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          62. EXT. HIGHWAY/INT. CAB NIGHT/DAY


          
          Montage - Boone drives through the night, and the following day,
          through a landscape which becomes increasingly more desolate.

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          63. EXT. ROAD SIGN LATE AFTERNOON


          
          The road sign reads:

          

          'DWYER - 56 MILES'

          
          Boone's car speeds past.

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          64. EXT. DIRT ROAD OUTSIDE MIDIAN DAY


          
          Boone's car rolls to a stop. Boone steps out and looks at something
          in the dust. A battered sign. It reads:

          

          'MIDIAN/POPULATION 63'

          
          There is no sign of life.

          
          BOONE: No....oh no...[in despair] No!

          
          His shout echos. The wind blows up a cloud of dust around him. He
          walks through the dust, on the verge of tears. And then...the dust
          clears, and he sees...

          

          INTERCUT:

          

          65. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Necropolis, lying on the other side of a thick expanse of reeds.

          
          Puzzlement overtakes despair. He squints to see more clearly...

          
          The Necropolis is vast. High walls, surrounded by reeds, with the
          tops of mausoleums, showing above it. ALmost a fortressed town.

          
          Boone starts towards it.

          

          66. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES DAY


          
          The sun is low in the sky, the light golden glinting off the gates.
          The reeds sigh. Boone pushes one of the gates open and steps inside.
          His footsteps echo, unnaturally loud in this city of the dead. To
          either side of him, elegant and elaborate mausoleums, running away
          into the distance, with numerous smalls tombs set around and between
          them.

          

          
          The sun finally sinks out of sight. Its final glow dies on the tops
          of the mausoleums. There are already stars overhead.

          
          Boone walks on a little way, as the night sounds begin. Exhausted,
          he sits down on a tomb and leans back against the stone.

          
          BOONE [softly - a bitter irony]: Dead ... all of the dead ...

          
          He rummages for a cigarette in his jacket pocket. Pulls one out.
          Lights it. The flame seems to excite sounds around him. He looks up.
          The walkways are empty in both directions.

          
          There's a guttural sound at his back. He stands, drops the
          cigarette, backs away. From the darkness behind him steps a huge
          form. A knife is put to his lower belly. Its wielder, Kinski, is a
          massive man, face distorted, his features grotesquely bifurcated.

          
          KINSKI [whispers]: Move and I gut you.

          
          Boone stays still. The growling from between the tombs becomes words.

          
          VOICE [from the darkness]: You got him?

          
          KINSKI: I got him.

          
          A reptilian hand reaches out and picks up Boone's dropped cigarette.

          
          BOONE: Midian? Are you from Midian?

          
          KINSKI: We should take him below, Peloquin.

          
          The silhouette of Peloquin, a were-creature, moves between the
          tombs. He draws on the cigarette. By its brightening point we glimpse
          an extraordinary face: more animal than human, but no recognizable
          species.

          
          PELOQUIN: He's not Nightbreed. He's Natural.

          
          BOONE: No! I've killed people, I'm like you, that's why I'm here...

          
          PELOQUIN: Shut the fuck up. You're meat.

          
          KINSKI: If we eat him we break the Law.

          
          BOONE: My God...my God, it's true ...

          
          PELOQUIN: Of course it's true. Everything's true ... [he starts to
          emerge from the shadows] God's an astronaut. Oz is over the rainbow.
          And Midian's where the monsters live. And you came to die.

          
          BOONE: I didn't...didn't come to die. I came to be with you, I'm one
          of you.

          
          Peloquin reaches out and touches Boone's chest.

          
          PELOQUIN: No. Sorry. I can smell innocence at fifty yards.

          
          BOONE: I've killed people. Fifteen people.

          
          PELOQUIN: Who told you that?

          
          BOONE: What do you mean?

          
          PELOQUIN: He lied, asshole. He lied. You're a Natural. And that
          means...you're meat for the Beast.

          
          Peloquin growls, throwing his head back and forth with a strange
          grace, the image flickering as he does so. Boone watches, amazed. In
          the blur of Peloquin's motion he transforms, the tentacles on his
          head lengthening and thickening, thrashing around as though they have
          a life of their own.

          
          He moves towards Boone, taking hold of him and tearing his T-shirt
          open.

          
          KINSKI: We mustn't. It's the Law. They'll exile us...

          
          PELOQUIN: Fuck the Law! I want meat!

          
          He bites Boone's neck, tearing at his flesh.

          
          KINSKI: Peloquin, no!

          
          Kinski takes the knife from Boone's belly and pushes Peloquin aside.
          Boone slips away from them.

          
          PELOQUIN: Damn you!

          
          He races after Boone, who runs blindly, his hand pressed to the
          wound on his neck.

          

          66A. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          The Breed listen. We track running feet past the grille, and move
          close into grille, dropping through a dark rock face.

          

          67. SCENE DELETED

          

          67A. INT. BELOW MIDIAN


          
          In the deep darkness faces look up. The faces are strange and
          freakish. There is a woman locked in the embrace of a dark monster. A
          monstrous baby cries.

          

          68. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Boone takes refuge against a mausoleum wall. He takes his hand from
          the wound on his neck. It is throbbing like a living thing, spreading
          across his muscle. He stares down at the wound, then touches it
          lightly. It gives him pleasure.

          
          A sound above him. He looks up. Peloquin is climbing down the
          mausoleum wall, mouth opened wide to take off Boone's head.
          Boone throws himself forward as the jaws snap shut, missing him by
          inches. He runs. Kinski appears in his path. For an instant Boone
          thinks the game's up...

          
          KINSKI: That way! The gate's that way!

          
          Boone sprints.

          

          69. INT. BELOW MIDIAN


          
          The monsters watch and listen.

          

          70. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES NIGHT


          
          Peloquin pushes Kinski aside and pelts after Boone, who is at the
          gate. He flings himself through, and slams it behind him. Peloquin is
          at the gate, when Kinski comes up behind and restrains him.

          
          KINSKI: He's gone, give it up! You don't dare go out there!

          
          Peloquin stares at Boone through the gate. Panting, sweating, Boone
          stares back. Snorting with frustration, Peloquin recedes, he and
          Kinski disappear into shadow.

          
          Boone heaves a sigh of relief, turns from the gate and trudges away
          into the darkness, when suddenly . . .

          

          71. EXT. OUTSIDE NECROPOLIS GATES NIGHT


          
          Harsh lights hit Boone from every side; police cars in the reeds all
          around, their searchlights focused on him. Two dozen cops, all
          levelling firearms.

          
          JOYCE: Freeze! Right there!

          
          Boone squints against the glare.

          
          JOYCE [cont.]: Aaron Boone, you're under arrest. Hands on your head!

          NOW!

          
          Boone takes a step back. The wound on his neck throbs and swells. At
          the edge of the light, Decker appears, stepping towards him. 

          
          DECKER: Boone, listen to him, it's no use!

          
          JOYCE [to Decker]: Stay back!

          
          DECKER [lowers his voice]: Lieutenant, I can bring him out. He'll
          listen to me.

          
          Joyce ponders, then signals him forward. Decker advances toward Boone.

          
          DECKER [cont.]: Boone, it's all right, I've explained everything to
          them.

          
          Rifles are cocked on every side. Decker stops a safe distance from
          Boone.

          
          DECKER [cont.]: They won't harm you, I give you my word.

          
          BOONE [hanging back]: I didn't do it. I didn't hurt anyone...

          
          DECKER [lowering his voice]: Of course you didn't.

          
          BOONE: You...you believe me?

          
          DECKER: You wouldn't hurt a fly. [extends a hand] Come on, Boone.
          It's safe, I've seen to that.

          
          BOONE [taking a tentative step forward]: What, what about the pills?

          
          DECKER [pause; whispers]: What about them, Boone?

          
          BOONE: They weren't tranquillizers...

          
          A look of alarm crosses Decker's face. Boone reads it. He gets the
          picture.

          
          BOONE [cont.]: You set me up...you bastard, you set me up!

          
          He lunges for Decker, who turns and throws himself to the ground as
          he yells.

          
          DECKER: He's got a gun!

          

          JOYCE: FIRE!

          
          The bullets fly. Boone is about to pounce on Decker when he's hit by
          a barrage, thrown back, riddled with bullets. On the ground, Decker
          covers his head. Boone goes down. The volley ends.

          

          72. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          The sound of gunfire echoes through the walkways.

          

          73. INT. BELOW MIDIAN


          
          In the shadows, a baby held in the arms of a woman with monstrous
          but beautiful features, begins to cry.

          

          74. EXT. OUTSIDE MIDIAN NIGHT


          
          Joyce hears the sound of crying and looks up. Boone's body lies on
          the ground. Decker rises, hearing the distant sobs on the wind.

          

          75. INT. BELOW MIDIAN


          
          The mother hushes the child, her arms, which are tentacles, wrapping
          around it.

          

          76. EXT. OUTSIDE MIDIAN NIGHT


          
          The sound of crying is lost. Joyce moves forward, towards Decker and
          Boone.

          
          JOYCE [trying to convince himself]: ...just the wind. He reaches
          Decker, looks down at Boone's body. Looks around.

          
          JOYCE [cont.]: Where's the gun?

          
          DECKER [seemingly dismayed]: He reached into his jacket...I thought
          I saw it, I swear...oh God, Boone...

          
          JOYCE [quietly, to some cops, meaning Boone]: Get him outta here.

          

          77. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          We track towards a tomb, on which the epitaph reads: 'GOD IS MERCIFUL'

          FADE IN:

          

          78. INT. MORGUE/VIEWING ROOM NIGHT


          
          Moving with Lori, flanked by Dr Burton the pathologist, and a grim
          Joyce. They enter a smaller room. Burton flips a switch. Curtains
          part in front of a thick glass panel, revealing a small, sterile
          viewing chamber.

          
          In the chamber are a morgue attendant and, lying on a stainless
          steel table, Boone's body. Lori looks at the body with heartbreaking
          sadness. She nods. Burton closes the curtains. Lori and Joyce exit.
          On the other side of the glass, the attendant rolls Boone on the
          table towards a door marked 'Pathology'.

          

          79. INT. INTERVIEW ROOM NIGHT


          
          Dr Decker sits alone, looking into his briefcase. The door opens,
          Lori and Joyce enter. Decker closes the briefcase, rises, aggrieved,
          takes both of Lori's hands in his, speaks soothingly.

          
          DECKER: Lori, I'm Dr Decker. Boone was my patient.

          
          LORI: Yes. Hello.

          
          DECKER: I'm so sorry for your loss. I must tell you, you meant the
          world to Aaron. He spoke of you constantly ...

          
          LORI [withdrawing her hand - has the creeps]: Thank you, Doctor.

          
          Lori sits across a table from Joyce. Decker sits against the wall.

          
          JOYCE: Miss Winston, are you sure you wouldn't rather postpone...

          
          LORI: No. Let's get it over with.

          
          Joyce turns on a tape recorder on the table.

          
          JOYCE [starting at the beginning]: What was your relationship with
          Aaron Boone?

          
          LORI [pause]: We were lovers.

          
          We move in on the revolving reels of the tape recorder.

          
          JOYCE: How long had you known Aaron Boone?

          
          LORI: Two months.

          

          80. INT. AUTOPSY ROOM NIGHT


          
          Burton and the attendant, instruments laid out, Boone's body on a
          brightly lit steel table, ready for the autopsy. Burton activates an
          overhead microphone.

          
          BURTON: Deceased is a white Caucasian male, late twenties. Suspected
          cause of death, multiple gunshot wounds to the thoracic cavity and
          extremities.

          
          The attendant lifts up Boone's jacket. Light streams through many
          bullet holes.

          
          ASSISTANT: Jesus. They weren't takin' any chances.

          
          Burton picks up a small digging tool and zeroes in on one of the
          chest wounds.

          
          BURTON: Wound number one: entered between the fourth and fifth left
          ribs, impacted the lower rib, lodging in ligaments adjacent to the
          left lung ...

          
          He digs.

          

          81. INT. INTERVIEW ROOM NIGHT


          
          JOYCE: So he never gave any indication ...

          
          LORI: No ...

          
          JOYCE: Surely there must have been something ...

          
          LORI [firm, angry]; Look, you can say whatever you want to about
          him. I don't believe it. He never raised a hand to me, he
          never harmed anyone in his life.

          
          A strained silence. Decker drums his fingers on his briefcase.

          
          DECKER: Miss Winston, everyone has their secret faces ...

          
          LORI: Drop dead.

          
          Annoyed at Decker, Joyce turns off the tape recorder.

          
          JOYCE: We'll continue this some other time.

          
          Lori stands and heads for the door.

          

          82. INT. AUTOPSY ROOM NIGHT


          
          A pair of callipers drop a distended bullet into a steel bowl,
          containing at least ten other similarly maimed bullets. Fatigued with
          effort, Burton wipes his forehead, turns off the microphone.

          
          BURTON: Coffee break.

          
          The attendant turns off the bright overheads, he and Burton move
          into an adjoining lounge.

          

          83. INT. MORGUE ENTRY WAY NIGHT


          
          Lori is putting on her coat. A contrite Decker approaches her.

          
          DECKER: Miss Winston, I hope you didn't misinterpret what I said.
          Boone meant a great deal to me ...

          
          LORI: Where did he die? [pause] What was the name of the town?

          
          DECKER: A place called Midian.

          

          84. SCENE DELETED

          

          85. INT. AUTOPSY ROOM NIGHT


          
          The bowl wobbles on the ground. The bullets roll off in different
          directions. Sound of glass breaking.

          

          86. INT. MORGUE ENTRY WAY NIGHT


          
          Hearing the breaking glass, Lori and Decker turn back towards the
          autopsy room.

          
          LORI: Boone?

          
          She runs towards the sound, Decker follows.

          

          87. EXT. MORGUE NIGHT


          
          In slow motion, a large first-floor window shatters out towards us.

          

          88. INT. AUTOPSY ROOM NIGHT


          
          As Lori, then Decker enter, moments after Burton, Joyce and the
          attendant. The autopsy table is empty.

          
          BURTON: Someone's taken him...

          
          DECKER: My God...

          
          ATTENDANT [looking around]: Where's his coat?

          

          89. EXT. MORGUE NIGHT


          
          Slow motion  distorting time, we see the rest of the shattering
          window and a dim figure crosses the moon.

          90. INT. LORI'S APARTMENT DAY


          
          Lori hurriedly throws some belongings into a suitcase. We see some
          newspaper clippings beside the suitcase. A headline reads: 'SLASHER

          SUSPECT SLAIN'

          
          Another features a map, showing the location of Midian.

          

          91. EXT. ROAD DAY


          
          Montage - Lori drives, at high speed, down the same roads Boone took
          previously.

          

          92. EXT. SHERE NECK ROAD EVENING


          
          At sunset, Lori enters the town, past a sign that reads: 'WELCOME TO

          SHERE NECK/WELCOME BUFFALO DAYS RODEO'

          

          93. EXT. SHERE NECK MOTEL EVENING


          
          Lori pulls into the parking lot of the motel. A neon sign reads:

          'THE SWEETGRASS INN'

          
          Above it, the moon. From the motel itself, sounds of revelry.

          

          94. INT. MOTEL BAR NIGHT


          
          A wood-panelled, Western Frontier-themed bar. Country music. A
          banner welcomes rodeo participants. A number of rough types
          clustered at tables, many of them wearing baseball caps adorned with
          buffalo horns. Lori enters, looks around. A cowboy lassoes a
          waitress, ropes her in to general applause. Lori takes a seat at the
          bar and is approached by a bartender.

          
          BARTENDER: What'll it be, darlin'?

          
          LORI: A draft and some information please.

          
          BARTENDER [taps a stein of draft]: There's the draft.

          
          LORI [lays down a bill]: I'm looking for a town called Midian.

          
          BARTENDER: You're not the first.

          
          LORI: No?

          
          BARTENDER: Had a bunch of TV news folks passin' through, since they
          nailed that baby-slasher up there.

          
          LORI: Baby-slasher?

          
          BARTENDER: Yeah, hell of a week for us. The rodeo this weekend. That
          scumbag gets blown away. I hear it took thirty slugs to bag that
          sucker. Just goes to show you, don't it? People love a spectacle.

          
          Lori's hit with a burst of emotion. She doesn't want the bartender
          to see her cry.

          
          LORI: Where's the bathroom?

          
          BARTENDER: Right around the corner there, darlin'.

          
          Lori rises, exits.

          

          95. INT. MOTEL BATHROOM DAY


          
          Lori enters and leans on the sink as the grief hits her. She sobs. A
          stall door opens behind her: Sheryl, a girl in her early twenties,
          exits.

          
          Lori pulls a tissue from her bag and tries to compose herself,
          standing back to allow Sheryl access to the mirror, where she studied
          herself before starting to tease her hair.

          
          SHERYL: Which is it, hon', men or money? [Lori looks at her] It's
          usually one or the other, ain't it?

          
          LORI: Oh...[a tiny smile]...A man.

          
          SHERYL: Uh-huh. What'd he do, leave?

          
          LORI: Not exactly.

          
          SHERYL: Jesus, did he come back? That's even worse.

          
          In spite of herself, Lori's brightened by the girl's good humor.

          
          SHERYL [cont.]: Some loser takes a shine to ya, you could toss
          'em in the river tied to a piano he'll come back faster than a dog
          with a bone. Thing is, why go to all this trouble to look so good if
          there's nobody to admire the end product, am I right?

          
          LORI: Can't argue with that, [likes her, feeling lonely] Can I buy
          you a drink?

          
          SHERYL: Hell, yes you can. Better than gettin' hit on by some
          damn buffalo.

          Lori and Sheryl at the bar. Lori's nursing a beer. Sheryl's into her
          fourth Black Russian and is getting friendlier by the moment.

          
          SHERYL [pause - just heard the story]: Lord. I have seen men go to
          great lengths to walk out on a girl. But, I must say, I have never
          heard tell of a fella doin' it while deceased.

          
          LORI: They think some sick bastard's stole the body.

          
          SHERYL: So you want to go check out the place in which he checked out?

          
          LORI: Yeah. Guess it's a way to say goodbye, you know? He was always
          a mystery to me. I loved him...[she looks away]

          
          SHERYL: Tell you what, Lori, why don't I drive up there to this
          Medium place with you tomorrow and keep you company?

          
          LORI: You don't have to do that.

          
          SHERYL: Yeah, but I'm goin' to and I don't want no argument from you.

          
          LORI [smiles, grateful]: Okay. Thanks.

          
          SHERYL: That's all right.

          
          LORI [finishes her beer]: Guess I'll head up to my room.

          
          SHERYL: You get some rest, sugar. I'm gonna stay down here and close
          this damn bar. Maybe one of these lunkheads'll win the 
          lottery.

          
          Lori smiles, squeezes her hand, exits the bar. Sheryl looks around,
          finishes her drink. The bartender sets another drink down in front of
          her.

          
          BARTENDER: Courtesy of that gent in the suit at the end of the
          bar.

          
          Sheryl looks down the bar, sees the man, seems impressed, waves.

          
          SHERYL [low, to the bartender]: Isn't he just the picture of
          sophistication though?

          

          96A. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          We Cut to a wide shot of the Necropolis by night. A shooting star
          falls.

          
          Now we move in on one of the mausoleums, and from the ground below
          we hear a ritualistic chanting.

          
          Once within the darkness of the mausoleum the camera slides down
          over the rock face into the depths of Midian. The volume of the
          chanting increases as we come close to its source.

          

          96B. INT. MURAL CHAMBER


          
          We come into the mural chamber, the camera passing down over the
          family tree of Naturals and Nightbreed and round to see Rachel and
          Kinski approaching and entering the door of the initiation chamber.

          
          Cut to Narcisse and Boone, also approaching the chamber.

          
          NARCISSE: You'll like this. No, really. It's just their way of
          welcoming you to the club.

          
          BOONE: I'm not sure I want to be a member.

          
          NARCISSE: You made your way back here for the same reasons I did. We
          belong here now. There's nowhere else on earth would
          take us in.

          

          CUT TO:

          

          96C. INT. INITIATION CHAMBER


          
          In the middle of the chamber is a kind of font, on which stands a
          bowl of Baphomet's blood, steaming and bubbling. Standing in front of
          it is Lylesburg. To his side Peloquin. Beside him, Rachel.

          
          On Lylesburg's other side, Ohnaka. Standing around the walls as
          witnesses to the ceremony, are a variety of Breed.

          
          Boone enters. The Breed all look his way. Boone sees Shuna Sassi.

          
          BOONE [to Narcisse in a whisper]: Who is she?

          
          NARCISSE: Shuna Sassi. Why?

          
          BOONE: I dreamt her.

          
          Shuna leans towards Peloquin.

          
          SHUNA SASSI: I've dreamt him.

          
          Narcisse nudges Boone forward.

          
          LYLESBURG: Who is your advocate?

          
          NARCISSE: I am.

          
          LYLESBURG: Have you tutored him in the Law?

          
          BOONE: Yes he has.

          
          LYLESBURG: Let the advocate answer.

          
          NARCISSE: Yes I have.

          
          LYLESBURG: You understand what you do, becoming one of us? With this
          night you turn your back on the Natural World. The
          life you lived will after this be as a dream.

          
          BOONE: I know.

          
          Lylesburg takes the glove off his right hand. The flesh beneath is
          cauterized.

          
          LYLESBURG: The blood of the God tells all truths. It can harm as
          easily as heal. Are you prepared to be judged?

          
          BOONE: I'm ready.

          
          Lylesburg nods, and puts his hand into the bowl of the blood. The
          blood bubbles around his wrist.

          
          We cut to Peloquin and Shuna Sassi, who are watching Boone intently.

          
          Boone's eyes are now on Lylesburg's smoking hand as it approaches
          Boone's chest, still marked by his wounds.

          
          LYLESBURG: Be judged.

          
          He puts his hand on the bullet wounds. Boone stiffens. But there's
          no pain. When Lylesburg's hand is removed, the wounds have gone.
          There's a visible release of tension on the faces of all those
          watching.

          
          LYLESBURG: Aaron Boone, in the name of Baphomet, Lord of the tribes
          of the moon, I bid you welcome...

          
          The camera moves out of the chamber, and towards the mural.

          Lori lies awake in bed, staring at the ceiling. Outside, and next
          door, the noise of laughter and partying.

          
          LORI [quietly, a tear in her eye]: I still love you, Boone...

          wearing dark glasses and a horned Buffalo Days hat. The bartender
          pours her an eye-opener.

          
          BARTENDER: Hair of the dog.

          
          Lori enters.

          
          SHERYL: Hi.

          
          LORI: How's your head?

          
          SHERYL: My momma always used to say, 'Sheryl Ann, there's a man out
          walking around with your name on his mind, all you got to do is run
          into him.'

          
          LORI: And he just happened to be checked in here at the crossroads
          of the world.

          
          SHERYL: Isn't that something? His name is Curtis, he is a banker,
          recently divorced and recently relocated in Edmonton, up for the
          rodeo and better yet, he thinks I am the Queen-bee's knees.

          
          LORI: Sheryl, you sure you want to come along?

          
          SHERYL: Wouldn't miss it. Besides, Curtis has to do business today,
          we've got an engagement for this evening and if I sit
          around all day with this head on I'm gonna feel like the hind end
          of a dog sled.

          
          LORI: I'm glad for your company.

          100. EXT. MIDIAN/INT. LORI'S CAR DAY


          
          Lori's car comes to a stop near the edge of the reeds outside the
          Necropolis.

          
          SHERYL: Jesus. Looks like the gold rush is over.

          
          Lori parks the car. She gets out, looks around.

          
          LORI [quiet - reflective]: Why? Why would Boone come here?

          
          SHERYL: To get away from it all? [Lori gives her a look] Shut up,
          Sheryl Ann. You go do what you have to do. I'll stay here and...do
          somethin' else.

          
          Lori nods and heads away down the street, leaving Sheryl beside the
          car. She leans against the car, surveys the emptiness, without
          enthusiasm.

          
          SHERYL [cont.]: My luck, I'll end up buying some real estate.

          

          101. EXT. MIDIAN DAY


          
          Lori - as she leaves the reeds and sees the outer walls of the
          Necropolis.

          
          LORI: Good God...

          

          102. EXT. MIDIAN DAY


          
          Sheryl - wandering from the car into the reeds. She lights a
          cigarette, tunelessly humming to ward off the willies. She stops,
          shivers, suddenly feeling very isolated. The atmosphere's got to her.
          She starts back to the car.

          
          She catches some movement out of the corner of her eye. Stops.
          Slowly walks away from the movement, fighting off panic. She
          turns a corner, and realizes she's lost in the reeds.

          
          She hears movement behind her, turns, startled, then, oddly, she
          smiles.

          
          SHERYL: Curtis ... what are you doing here?

          
          It's Decker, looking like a commuter, hair slicked back, wearing an
          overcoat, carrying his briefcase.

          
          DECKER [big smile]: Hello, Sheryl Ann.

          

          103. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES DAY


          
          Lori reaches the gates, slightly breathless. She pushes one of them
          open. The sun is hot and bright, transforming the Necropolis from the
          dark, dangerous place it was when Boone was here. Now, with its
          gothic tombs and burgeoning plant life, it's almost welcoming.

          

          104. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Lori wanders the walkways, enchanted by the splendor of the place.
          There are strange, bittersweet sights along the way: statues of dogs
          sleeping on their masters' graves; of mourning mothers; of children,
          sitting at their graves. And grotesque images too: gargoyles
          protecting the doorways of mausoleums; a tiger, roaring in stone. It
          is another world, solemn and silent.

          
          Except...suddenly, the sound of an animal in pain. Lori stops and
          looks around. Her gaze comes to rest on a spreading laurel tree
          beneath which the shadows are pitch black. From here, the sobbing
          comes. She approaches. There is an animal beneath the tree, barely
          discernible. She can see its flanks panting, its head moving in pain.

          
          LORI: Jesus...

          
          It doesn't look like a recognizable species, an amalgam of wild cat
          and deer. She approaches. It raises its head, weakly. Its eyes are
          huge and black.

          
          LORI [cont.]: ...It's okay, I won't hurt you...it's okay...

          
          The creature shudders.

          
          LORI [cont.]: ...What's happened to you?...Let me see.

          
          She reaches beneath the branches and tentatively strokes the animal.
          It responds by dropping its head back on to the grass.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Oh God...you poor thing...don't die, please don't die.

          
          She pushes beneath the tree, puts her arms beneath the creature and
          picks it up. It is heavy, a dead weight in her arms. She backs out
          from beneath the tree. As she steps back into the sun, the creature
          snarls and starts to wither in her arms. She realizes what's causing
          it pain and steps back into shadow.

          
          LORI [cont.]: You don't like the sun? Is that it?

          
          The sound of sobbing, off to her left, draws her attention. One of
          the mausoleum doors is open, and a woman, Rachel, dressed in black,
          stands in the shadows, weeping. Lori's astonished.

          
          LORI [cont.]: I'm sorry...is, is it yours?

          
          RACHEL: Bring her. Bring her, please.

          
          Shading the creature from the sun, Lori moves to the door and steps
          into the gloom.

          

          105. INT. MAUSOLEUM DAY


          
          The interior is marble, the air murky. Rachel, a fine-boned, pre-
          Raphaelite beauty in her thirties, moves back against the far wall,
          nursing a wounded arm.

          
          Lori looks down at the creature she's carrying, utterly limp in her
          arms.

          
          LORI: ...I'm afraid it's too late.

          
          RACHEL: No...she can't die. Bring her to me, please.

          
          Rachel reaches out. Lori's reluctant to move further into the
          darkness.

          
          RACHEL: Hurry!

          
          As Lori crosses the floor, she hears whispering from a stairway that
          leads down into the earth. She stops, frightened.

          
          RACHEL: Pay no attention. Please, bring me my Babette.

          
          As the creature is named it starts to move in Lori's arms. Not only
          move, but change. Its claws grab at Lori's breast as it writhes.

          
          RACHEL [cont.]: Babette, no!

          
          LORI: What's happening?

          
          RACHEL: Don't look! Don't look!

          
          But Lori can't help but look. Appalled, she tries to pull the
          transforming creature off her, but its hold is firm.

          
          LORI: Jesus! Jesus!

          
          With effort, she detaches the creature's claws from her, almost
          throwing it at Rachel, who cradles the changing creature in her arms.

          
          RACHEL: Babette...

          
          Lori leans against the wall, trying to wipe the sticky fluids the
          creature's exuded onto her hands. When she looks up she sees the
          creature in Rachel's arms has transformed into a pale, beautiful girl
          of seven or eight. Lori's dumbstruck.

          
          LORI: What...what...what the...?

          
          RACHEL: She likes to play outside. I tell her: you mustn't play in
          the sun. The sun will hurt you. But she's just a child. She doesn't
          understand.

          
          Lori looks back towards the open door, and the sun-drenched walkway
          outside. Then back at Babette.

          
          LORI: This is too weird.

          
          RACHEL [an urgent whisper]: You saved her. I owe you
          something...listen; I know why you came here.

          
          LORI: You do?

          
          RACHEL: You must go, this place is not for you. Midian is a home for
          the Nightbreed. Only for the Nightbreed.

          
          LORI: Is Boone here? Did somebody bring him here?

          
          A deep baritone voice rises up from the shadows of the stairwell.

          
          LYLESBURG: Rachel...you have said too much already.

          
          Lylesburg appears, a commanding, magisterial man with a vast grey
          beard and three slits on each cheek that look like gills. Loping
          along beside him, his fool, a muscular man with an innocently
          beautiful face: Ohnaka.

          
          RACHEL: My Lylesburg, she brought me Babette, she saved her . . .

          
          LYLESBURG: We know. But you cannot help her.

          
          LORI [her spunk surfacing]: Look, I saved the child's life, don't I
          deserve something for that?

          
          LYLESBURG: The child has no life to save, [he looks at her - sizes
          her up] But what she has is yours, if you want it. That's the Law. Do
          you want her?

          
          LORI: No! I just want some answers.

          
          LYLESBURG: You weren't meant to see this.

          
          LORI: I kind of got that impression.

          
          LYLESBURG: Then you also understand that to speak of this to anyone
          will bring dire consequences . . .

          
          LORI: Hey, pal, don't threaten me.

          
          LYLESBURG: Not for you. For us.

          
          His words take the edge off Lori's anger. She notices that inscribed
          in the marble arch above the doorway are the words:

          'WHAT'S BELOW REMAINS BELOW'

          
          LYLESBURG [cont.]: What's below remains below. This is the Law.

          
          Rachel is carrying Babette down the steps. Lylesburg turns to follow
          her.

          
          LORI: Wait! Wait a minute! Boone, Aaron Boone, just tell me, is he
          here? You took him, you took his body, didn't you? Hey!

          
          Lori crosses to the stairs. Lylesburg's disappeared down into the
          darkness.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Talk to me, damn it, I have to know - come back!

          

          105A. INT. MAUSOLEUM STAIRWELL


          
          Lori heads down the stairs.

          
          LORI: Come back!

          
          Lylesburg, Ohnaka, Rachel and Babette have gone, however. Lori
          continues her descent. There are sounds in the darkness below her.
          She stops, and looks back towards the top of the stairs. It's a long
          way off.

          
          LORI [to herself]: How deep does this go?

          
          She heads on down, turning a corner. In front of her, Peloquin. He
          starts towards her. She backs away, into a second creature, and
          starts up the stairs. As she does so a third creature swings down
          from the darkness above her head. She shrieks, and runs like hell.

          
          PELOQUIN [calls after her]: Come back soon, y'hear?

          

          106. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Lori emerges, squinting against the blinding sun, trying to calm
          herself.

          
          LORI: Okay. Walk away, Lori. Don't panic. There's got to be a
          perfectly reasonable explanation, [can't sustain it] And hell if I
          know what it is.

          
          She sprints back towards the gate.

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          107. EXT. MIDIAN DAY


          
          Out of breath, Lori reaches the car, parked where she left it. No
          sign of Sheryl.

          
          LORI: Sheryl! Sheryl! Let's get the hell out of here! [no reply]
          Sheryl?

          
          Lori looks around. Sees Sheryl's purse in the dirt near the reeds.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Sheryl?

          
          She moves towards the reeds. Picks up the purse. Peers inside the
          house. She hears a gurgling laugh from inside. It could be Sheryl.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Sheryl, come on ...

          

          108. EXT. REEDS DAY


          
          The undergrowth is dark and empty. Lori advances cautiously through
          the paths.

          
          LORI: Sheryl, we have to go, uh, something's kind of come up and...

          
          She sees a splash of blood on the reeds.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Oh shit. . .

          
          Something moves across our field of vision in the gloom behind her.
          She turns.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Sheryl?

          
          She turns back and follows the trail of blood around the corner,
          Lying on the floor is Sheryl. Mouth cut away. Tongue cut off.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Jesus! God!

          
          She turns to run, but Decker steps into her path. He wears a mask of
          repulsive simplicity: a linen face with two buttons for eyes and a
          zipper [open at present] for a mouth. In his hands are two large
          carving knives, both blood-stained.

          
          DECKER: Let's get it over with, shall we?

          
          LORI [mind racing, a survivor]: Take it easy, let's talk about this.

          
          DECKER [advancing]: Don't try and reason with me, Lori. I'm a
          lunatic. You don't reason with lunatics.

          
          LORI: How do you know my name?

          
          DECKER: Good question. No reason why you shouldn't have an answer.
          [he pulls off the mask] Wish I had a camera. Oh, the look a your face.

          
          LORI: Why? Why did you kill her?

          
          DECKER: Why did I kill all the others? For the fun of it, of course.
          For pleasure. Everyone ought to have a hobby, don't you agree?

          
          LORI: Boone was innocent.

          
          DECKER: Is innocent, wherever he's hiding. After all the trouble I
          went to to find him a home for his guilt.

          
          LORI: You sick motherfucker...

          
          DECKER: Boone's alive, Lori. And your death is going to bring him
          out of hiding.

          
          He comes at her suddenly, but his heel slides in Sheryl's blood. He
          falls in front of Lori, and stabs at her feet. She avoids the stab by
          an inch. He rises suddenly, throws one of his knives aside and grabs
          the blade Lori holds, with a glove which strikes sparks. It is
          chainmail. Lori lets go, propelling herself through the reeds.

          110. INT. NECROPOLIS LATE AFTERNOON


          
          The light is diminishing behind the Necropolis walls. Lori's screams
          are distant. We track towards the gate as she runs down the hill.

          
          LORI: Somebody help me!

          
          She flings the gate open and enters. Decker emerges from the reeds
          behind her.

          

          111. SCENE DELETED

          

          111A. INT. THE TEMPLE OF BAPHOMET


          
          The temple is an impressive chamber, at the centre of which is a
          dais, ringed with representatives of the six failed saviours of Breed.

          
          In the middle of the ring, a statue of Baphomet. There are benches
          along the walls. Sitting in them, reciting in soft, sibilant voices
          the Laws of Midian, are Breed.

          
          Lylesburg, accompanied by Ohnaka, is also in the chamber, as is
          Boone, being held by the Breed.

          
          BOONE: I have to help her!

          
          LYLESBURG: You can't go.

          
          BOONE: I'll kill him. No-one will ever know.

          
          LYLESBURG: What's below remains below.

          
          BOONE: I can't let her die.

          
          LYLESBURG: When we took you in you made an oath to obey the Law.

          
          BOONE: I won't listen to him butcher her. I love her.

          
          LYLESBURG: She's a Natural. She couldn't love you back. Not now.

          
          BOONE: Wrong!

          
          He starts to struggle against his captors, fighting them off.

          
          BOONE: You're wrong!

          
          Throwing one back, and punching the other, Boone breaks for the door.

          
          LYLESBURG: Boone! Boone!

          
          Lylesburg's shout is ignored, as Boone heads up to the surface.

          

          112. EXT. NECROPOLIS LATE AFTERNOON


          
          Lori runs down the walkways pursued by Decker, her breath coming in
          gasps, close to collapse.

          
          LORI: Help me! Oh please, God, somebody.

          

          113. SCENE DELETED

          

          114. EXT. NECROPOLIS LATE AFTERNOON


          
          Lori collapses. Decker reaches her and pulls on his mask.

          
          DECKER: That's good. Be still. It's quicker that way.

          
          He pulls a particularly nasty blade from his jacket interior and
          advances. She rises and tries to duck the cut. He strikes her with
          the back of his hand. She falls, striking her head on a tomb.

          
          DECKER [cont.] [sudden fury]: I said, be still!

          
          Lori is semi-conscious, blood running from her wounded head. Looking
          past Decker, she sees something...

          
          LORI: Boone...

          
          Decker laughs. Then he realizes she's reacting to the appearance of
          Boone, standing in the shadows behind him, in jeans and leather
          jacket.

          
          Lori slips into unconsciousness.

          
          DECKER: You? Here again?

          
          BOONE: Isn't this where the dead are supposed to go?

          
          DECKER: You're not dead.

          
          BOONE [advancing]: You're wrong. We're both dead, Decker.

          
          DECKER: I'm not Decker!

          
          BOONE: No? Isn't that you, Dr Decker, hiding behind that child's mask?

          
          DECKER: I'm not hiding...

          
          BOONE [still advancing, taunting him]: Decker, Decker. Doctor Decker.

          
          Enraged, Decker throws the knife; it buries in the middle of Boone's
          chest. Decker laughs, then stops, as Boone pulls the knife out and
          tosses it aside.

          
          BOONE [cont.]: Blades are no better than bullets, Decker, don't you
          get it? I'm dead. The walking dead.

          
          DECKER: That's not possible.

          
          Decker turns to run, but Boone races to him, catches, turns him
          and pulls Decker closer, until they're nose to nose.

          
          BOONE: Not just dead...changed. A monster. Want me to show you?

          
          DECKER [whimpering]: No, please ...

          
          BOONE: Not your kind of monster. Not the soulless kind. I've got
          Midian in my veins.

          
          He tears off the mask, uncovering Decker's sweaty, terrified face.

          
          DECKER: Please, please, it's, it's not my fault, it's the mask, it
          makes me do things I don't want to...[Boone pulls him closer] Boone,
          it was the mask and they were going to find me, punish me, I needed a
          scapegoat...

          
          BOONE: You chose the wrong man.

          
          NARCISSE [V.O.]: Man? You call yourself a man?

          
          Boone looks round; Narcisse is squatting on a tomb, his face a mass
          of scar tissue.

          
          NARCISSE [cont.]: You're no more man than I am.

          
          BOONE: Monster, then.

          
          NARCISSE: That's more like it. [he jumps off the tomb, moves towards
          them] Well, go on, are you going to kill him or not? Only I want his
          balls. And his eyes. That is, if you don't want them.

          
          BOONE: I'll pass.

          
          NARCISSE: Remember me, Doctor? I was dying when you had your way
          with me. You made me tell my secrets when I was feeling particularly
          vulnerable. Now was that a nice thing for a doctor to do?

          
          DECKER [to Boone, craven]: Oh God, Boone, don't let him touch me,
          anything, keep him off me, full confession...sweet Jesus, mercy,
          mercy, please, I'm begging you!

          
          Narcisse raises his thumbs, still bearing their silver hooks.

          
          NARCISSE: Let's start with his eyes ...

          
          BOONE: No!

          
          Boone pushes Narcisse back, but as he does so Decker slips his
          grasp. Boone roars and starts to twitch and stamp as Peloquin did and
          we watch as...

          
          Boone transforms into something part man, part carnivore...and gives
          chase.

          
          Decker nears the gate, but Boone is after him at great speed,
          leaping over tombs like a high-jumper.

          

          115. EXT. NECROPOLIS LATE AFTERNOON


          
          Left behind, Narcisse turns his eyes upon the recumbent Lori.

          
          NARCISSE [filled with hunger, greatly consoled): Well...you'll do.

          
          As he advances on her, Lori's eyes flicker open. She screams.

          

          116. EXT. NECROPOLIS LATE AFTERNOON


          
          Boone right on Decker's tail; he hears Lori's screams and stops.
          Decker runs out through the gate. Boone starts back towards Lori.

          

          INTERCUT:

          

          117. EXT. NECROPOLIS LATE AFTERNOON


          
          Lori struggling in Narcisse's arms. He tries to muffle her.

          
          Boone leaps tombs, nearing their location. He bounds into the
          clearing, sees Lori unconscious in Narcisse's embrace. 

           

          
          BOONE: Let her go! 

           

          
          Narcisse, all sheepish co-operation, gently lets her go onto the
          ground.

          
          NARCISSE: Just...keeping her warm.

          

          
          Boone is almost human now. He reaches Lori.

          
          NARCISSE [cont.]: I wouldn't have touched her.

          
          Boone breathes in the last of his monstrous condition, and bends to
          tenderly stroke Lori's face. Then, very lightly, he kisses her, and
          gathers her in his arms.

          

          FADE OUT:

          

          FADE IN:

          BOONE: I had no choice.

          
          LYLESBURG: You've put us all in danger for your love of this woman.

          
          BOONE: Decker can't tell anyone. What's he going to say? That
          he tried to kill a girl and a dead man stopped him?

          
          LYLESBURG: He can still lead our enemies here. If he goes - if
          Midian's unearthed  you're responsible.

          
          BOONE: So let me make amends.

          
          LYLESBURG: Just take the girl and go on your way amongst the
          Naturals. That's the Law.

          
          BOONE: Who made this Law?

          
          LYLESBURG: Baphomet. The God in Obsidian. Who made Midian.

          
          BOONE: So maybe I should speak to this guy.

          
          LYLESBURG: Baphomet is a spirit in stone. He doesn't speak, or move.
          His wounds are too great...

          
          BOONE: What are you afraid of?

          
          LYLESBURG: What Baphomet made he has the power to unmake. His blood
          is volatile. He mustn't be angered.

          
          BOONE: Then I'll make nice.

          120. INT. CORRIDOR BY LYLESBURG'S CHAMBER NIGHT


          
          Boone heads down the corridor. He slows as he passes an entrance to
          one side chamber and looks in...

          
          Inside the chamber, a dog-faced man is working on a vast elaborate
          mosaic mural that extends into shadow in both directions. He looks up
          and locks eyes with Boone.

          
          Boone breaks off the contact and continues down the corridor.

          
          The dog-faced man turns back to his palette; a multi-coloured
          collection of small tiles. He carefully selects a few, then turns to
          the mosaic and we see...

          

          121. INT. MURAL CHAMBER NIGHT


          
          The mosaic mural. Prominent in what appears to be a panoramic visual
          history of the Nightbreed race, is a heroic figure who closely
          resembles...Boone. The dog-faced man applies the tiles he's selected,
          filling in the irises of the Boone-figure's eyes.

          

          122. INT. RACHEL'S CHAMBER


          
          Lori sits up.

          
          LORI: Boone...?

          
          Her head aches. She winces. Babette goes to her aid.

          
          BABETTE: Be still. It was a bad hurt he did us.

          
          LORI: Us? What do you mean 'us'?

          
          RACHEL [moving to them]: You held Babette while she transformed.
          She's made quite a bond with you.

          
          BABETTE: I felt your hurt. I still feel it.

          
          RACHEL: She even knew you were coming here. She saw it all, through
          your eyes.

          
          BABETTE: And you can see through mine.

          
          LORI [pause - she tries to read Rachel]: You're not kidding.

          
          RACHEL: It's true.

          
          Lori rises unsteadily to her feet. Babette takes her hand, but
          Rachel moves her away from Lori.

          
          RACHEL [cont.]: She doesn't want you to touch her, sweet. She's
          afraid.

          
          LORI: You got that right. One minute I'm about to get carved like a
          Christmas turkey, the next I'm...I'm...[a surfacing memory breaks her
          train]...God...it was Boone...Boone saved me.

          
          RACHEL: Yes.

          
          LORI: But he's dead, I saw him in the morgue...

          
          RACHEL: You still don't understand, do you?

          
          LORI: Wait a second, back up...

          
          RACHEL: You're below now. With the Nightbreed. The last survivors of
          the great tribes. 

          
          LORI: Tribes of who? What?

          
          RACHEL: We're shapeshifters; freaks; remains of races your species
          have almost driven to extinction.

          
          LORI: So you're not immortal?

          
          RACHEL: Far from it. The sun can kill some of us. Like Babette. She
          follows her father in that. Some of us could be shot down; others
          would survive that because they've got beyond death.

          
          LORI: Horrible. It's all horrible.

          
          RACHEL: To be able to fly? To be smoke, or a wolf; to know the
          night, and live in it forever? That's not so bad. You call us
          monsters, but when you dream, it's of flying and changing, and
          living without death. You envy us. And what you envy...

          
          LORI [softly; understanding]: ...We destroy...

          
          RACHEL [to Babette]: Show her. Show her the past...

          
          Babette touches Lori's arm.

          
          BABETTE: Be with me.

          
          The skulls in front of Lori fill her sight. We fly through one of
          the eye sockets into...

          Inquisitors step aside to show torture scenes. We track through the
          tortures: racks, crucifixion, floggings, a hanging. The camera moves
          off gallows, past a wall to flags. We cut close on the flag which
          reads FREAK SHOW, track past the flag to a cage, containing freakish
          Breed.

          
          Well-dressed ordinary men and women applaud and laugh.

          Overwhelmed with horror, Lori opens her eyes, breaking her

          RACHEL: We are all that remain.

          
          LORI: And...and you're saying...Boone's like you?

          
          RACHEL: He is Nightbreed. Or he was, until he broke the Law.

          
          LORI [moving towards the door]: No, no, that's not possible -
          I've got to find him, there's been some kind of mistake...

          
          BABETTE: Don't go...

          LORI: Where is he? Where'd he go?

          JOYCE: Decker? This better be good.

          
          DECKER: I found Boone.

          
          JOYCE: Someone brought the corpse down here?

          
          DECKER: He's not dead.

          
          JOYCE: I saw him pumped full of bullets.

          
          DECKER: So did I. But he's alive. He killed again...

          
          JOYCE: In Shere Neck?

          
          DECKER: No, out at Midian.

          
          JOYCE: Why'd he go back there?

          
          Eigerman enters.

          KANE: This is Inspector Joyce. Calgary Police Department.

          
          EIGERMAN: We don't need any city boys on the case. Midian's under my

          Lori finds herself in a cavernous space, lined with chambers
          connected by walkways and ladders, which don't look particularly
          secure. She moves out on to a walkway. It leads her into the central
          core of Midian, which offers a view of dizzying descent into the
          earth. She scans the scene, amazed by the sheer scale of the place.

          
          LORI: My God...

          
          As she descends into the bowels of Midian, creatures in various
          doorways watch her with curiosity. One creature seems to have light
          running from wounds on its body. Another tumbles past her, a slow
          acrobat, defying gravity. She sees only a few of these but hears far
          more, chattering and murmuring in the shadows.

          

          127A. INT. MIDIAN CORE


          
          As Lori moves through the chambers toward Peloquin we see the devil
          creature Lude feeding snakes to his pet, a horned, many legged beast
          which squats on the floor. He gets up and goes to look at her. Leroy,
          a grinning grotesque, appears from the back of the chamber, snatches
          the snake from the maw of the pet, and comes to watch as well.

          
          LEROY [eating the snake]: There goes the neighbourhood.

          reveal...

          
          A ceremony, with the bowls of white blood later seen in Baphomet's
          chamber, is in progress.

          As Lori crosses the bridge something watches from the deep
          shadows...the tone darkens. She steps off the bridge and scorpions
          scuttle away. Lori is now a little nervous. She finds herself in a
          corner with several doors...Through one door she sees a man with a
          white T-shirt. She calls after him.

          
          LORI: Boone?

          
          Lori enters through the door.

          In a corner a ghastly meal is underway. The Boone figure is heading
          away through another door. Lori follows the figure, and the diners
          get up as if to attack. In the next chamber is a tangle of bright red
          glistening bodies with no heads...Lori glances round. The diners
          pursue her.

          

          128D. INT. MIDIAN CHAMBER


          
          Up ahead of Lori is the Boone figure. She approaches it as it steps
          out of the shadows...

          
          It is not Boone!!

          
          She steps away...

          The red beast is rising behind her. Lori turns and exits the
          chamber, flattening herself against the rock. She advances. Crouched
          in a niche above where she's walking, we see a small lizard-like
          creature, Barabas, eating a dead rat.

          Lori enters the final chamber, following the figure she thinks is
          Boone.

          
          On the far side, crouching at a door, a figure.

          
          LORI: Boone?

          
          The figure turns. It's Peloquin.

          
          PELOQUIN: No-one here of that name.

          
          She turns. The Boone figure is in the doorway behind her. He has the
          face of a snake.

          
          PELOQUIN: Told you!

          
          He approaches Lori.

          
          PELOQUIN: I know you. He talks about you. Lori.

          
          He snatches a broach from her.

          
          PELOQUIN: Nice. You're still a Natural. Want to join the family? [he
          goes to bite her]

          
          LORI: No!

          
          Peloquin follows her to the door.

          
          PELOQUIN [at door]: You will. Sooner or later you'll want to live
          forever.

          
          He laughs maniacally, returning into his room.

          Lori continues her descent. As she nears the cavern floor, Lylesburg
          steps into her path, beside him his fool, Ohnaka.

          
          LYLESBURG: You may go no further.

          
          LORI: I want Boone!

          
          LYLESBURG: You're not to blame, but you must understand: what
          Boone's done has put us in jeopardy...

          
          LORI: No problem, you tell me where he is and we're outta here...

          
          LYLESBURG: Boone has gone to Baphomet. He is beyond recall.

          
          A low rumbling issues from somewhere deep inside the passage
          Lylesburg stands before. Underneath the rumble is an animal
          moaning with pain.

          
          LORI: Where is he? He's down here isn't he? You want to stop me
          you're gonna have to kill me.

          
          Impressed by her resolve, Lylesburg stands aside. She moves past him
          and heads down into the chamber, towards a distant light. Lylesburg
          gestures after her. Ohnaka nods and follows.

          The reassuring sounds of the Core fade behind her. She slows her
          advance. Suddenly, Narcisse steps from the shadows.

          
          NARCISSE: Up and about already?

          
          LORI: Keep away from me.

          
          NARCISSE: I'm sorry about upstairs. I see a pretty face and I want
          to kiss it. [Lori moves on past] Don't go down there.

          
          LORI: Why not?

          
          NARCISSE [instant change of subject]: Don't you just love this
          place? Shangri-La on dope. I love it.

          
          LORI: What's that smell?

          
          NARCISSE [sniffs his armpits]: Not me. They keep the Berserkers down
          there. Mad bastards. They'll rip your head off and shit down your
          neck.

          
          LORI: Boone went this way, right?

          
          NARCISSE: And won't be coming back.

          
          LORI: I'll bring him.

          
          NARCISSE: You think love can raise the dead?

          
          LORI: He's not dead.

          
          NARCISSE: He's that and more. If you don't believe me, you wait 'til
          he gets to sniff a little blood. That'll bring out the beast in him.
          I'm telling you, don't go...

          
          LORI: I have to. Nothing makes any sense without him.

          
          NARCISSE: Sense? Who needs it?

          
          Lori moves off down the corridor. Ohnaka follows her.

          Lori starts down the corridor, the walls of which are cracked wide
          in places, the gaps covered with chains. From the other side she
          hears grunts and growls. Then, to her shock, one of the Berserkers'
          arms reaches up from a grille in the floor and snatches at her leg.
          She steps aside to avoid it, and another of the Berserkers' arms
          reaches through the mesh of chains, taking hold of her by the neck.
          It starts to choke her. She shouts for help.

          
          Ohnaka, Lylesburg's fool, appears from down the corridor. He starts
          to rattle the chains further along the wall.

          and get me!

          
          The arm around Lori's neck releases its hold, and we hear the sound
          of the creatures moving along the walls in Ohnaka's direction.

          
          OHNAKA: Fat-asses!

          
          Suddenly, arms reach for him through the chains. He steps away just
          in time.

          
          OHNAKA: Missed!

          
          He grins at Lori, proud of himself.

          Ohnaka and Lori reach the next to last chamber; a roaring from
          below, down a slope in front of them, walls vibrating with the din
          from Baphomet's chamber. Ohnaka withdraws. Blindingly bright light,
          out of which Lori spots a figure climbing towards them.

          
          LORI: Boone? Boone!

          
          She moves down to Boone, scrambling up the slope towards her,
          drenched in sweat, half-mad with terror.

          
          BOONE: Don't...don't look...

          
          He reaches for her, then collapses. She starts down the slope to
          him. Dust falls from the roof, the din makes her reel. But she
          reaches him, starts to haul him to his feet. Then, she looks up and
          we get a glimpse of...

          Out of the blinding light, and seemingly the source of it, a huge,
          black figure turns towards her, twelve feet high, severed limbs
          connected by sinews of hot, white energy and extruded spines, the
          face terrible, wise and beautiful.

          
          Lori's stunned, she averts her eyes. Boone collects himself enough
          to pull her away and they help each other frantically scrabble up the
          slope, out of the chamber.

          Too exhausted and frightened to speak, Boone and Lori
          follow.

          Ominous rumblings urge them on, as Boone and Lori make a stumbling
          ascent through the core, trailing Ohnaka's urgent lead, watched from
          the doorways by a variety of creatures. We cut to the ledge, and move
          to a chamber, where Peloquin and Shuna Sassi are making love.
          Peloquin hears Lori urging Boone on as they struggle across the
          bridge, and looks away from Shuna, out through the door.

          
          PELOQUIN: Well, well...

          
          He goes to the door.

          
          PELOQUIN [cont.]: Guess he couldn't take the heat.

          
          SHUNA SASSI: I dreamt him. He's strong.

          
          PELOQUIN: That's only because the bite was mine.

          
          SHUNA SASSI: No, don't you see? He's the one from the prophesies.
          Cabal. The seventh saviour.

          
          PELOQUIN: So why's he leaving?

          
          SHUNA SASSI: Everything has its purpose. Maybe he hasn't learned to
          hate his tribe enough. He'll be back.

          
          Peloquin kisses her.

          
          PELOQUIN: Why die waiting?

          

          137. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          The sun climbs over the horizon, sunlight penetrates the graveyard.
          A mausoleum door creaks open, Lori and Boone rush out into the open
          air. Lori tries to lead Boone away, he squints painfully against the
          early light.

          
          BOONE: No, no, I belong here...

          
          LORI [grabs him]: Bullshit! Boone, Boone, listen to me - you belong
          with me, that's why you lived, that's why we survived,
          because we belong together...

          
          Ohnaka swings the door shut behind them. Boone sees Lori, as if for
          the first time. She takes his hand, presses it to her face, her
          breast.

          
          LORI [cont.]: This is me. This is why I followed you, this is what
          we're living for.

          
          His eyes clear. A part of him seems to return. He embraces her.

          
          BOONE: Lori...

          
          LORI: They don't need you. Nobody needs you but me. We'll go away,
          far away, where no-one will ever find us. I love you.

          
          They hold each other.

          

          138. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          

          LONG ANGLE:

          
          Boone and Lori - two small figures, alone among the sepulchres. They
          move towards the gate together.

          Empty streets. No activity. Lori's car pulls into the parking lot.

          

          140. INT. LORI'S CAR DAY


          
          Lori turns to Boone, slumped down in the passenger seat, out of
          sight, wearing sunglasses.

          
          LORI: I'll get my stuff, I'll be back in two minutes...

          
          BOONE: Don't leave me alone.

          
          LORI: Boone...

          
          BOONE [fiercely]: No!

          
          LORI [calmly  trying to hide her alarm]: Okay. We'll go in together.

          
          She hands him the Buffalo Days hat and opens the door.

          

          141. EXT. PHONE BOOTH DAY


          
          From a phone booth across the street we see Lori and Boone move
          towards the motel entrance. In foreground, a chain-mailed hand picks
          up the phone and dials.

          

          142. INT. SWEETGRASS INN DAY


          
          Boone and Lori enter the corridor that leads to her room. Eerie
          silence, save for a dog yapping somewhere. Boone stops. Alarmed, she
          turns to him.

          
          LORI [whispers]: What's wrong?

          
          BOONE: Why is it so empty?

          
          LORI: They must be at the rodeo.

          
          She hurries on, Boone follows, clearly disturbed. Lori unlocks her
          door, glancing back at Boone, who has taken off his sunglasses. There
          is something strange about the light in his eyes. A subtle wave of
          colour passes across his face.

          
          BOONE: I smell blood.

          
          LORI: What?

          
          BOONE: So much blood...

          
          She swings the door open. We expect a horror. Nothing. An ordinary
          room.

          
          LORI: It's okay.

          

          INTERCUT:

          

          113. INT. MOTEL LORI'S ROOM DAY


          
          Lori enters and quickly gathers her belongings together.

          
          Boone, sweating with terror, slides down the wall into a squatting
          position.

          
          As Lori packs, she looks down, sees a hole in the wall, the result
          of some massive violence from the other side. She cautiously leans
          down, peers through the hole and quickly retreats, hand over mouth,
          horrified by what she's seen.

          
          LORI: Boone?

          
          Boone appears at the door.

          
          LORI[cont.]: Next door.

          
          Boone goes next door and turns the handle.

          145. INT. MOTEL MURDER ROOM DAY


          
          Boone pushes the door open. Inside, a massacre: five dead card
          players, propped up around a poker table in a sick parody of a poker
          game tableau; throats slit, Buffalo Hats on their heads. Sitting in
          the middle of the table, a tall, elaborate house of cards.

          
          Boone moves into the middle of the room. On his face we can see the
          hunger he feels. Ripples of color begin to move over his features. He
          moves towards the corpses...as he does so, we hear a nearly deafening
          sound from outside...the vibrations knock over the house of cards
          and...

          

          146. EXT. SWEETGRASS INN DAY


          
          Into the empty street, a helicopter descends, discharging Lieutenant
          Joyce and a platoon of heavily armed Swat Team cops. Local police
          cars pour in.

          
          Captain Eigerman climbs out of his cruiser to survey the siege.
          Decker introduces him to Joyce. Sharpshooters take up positions,
          training their weapons on the motel, as the Swat Team moves in.

          

          147. INT. MOTEL CORRIDOR DAY


          
          Lori moves to the door of the murder room. Boone is inside, his back
          to her.

          
          LORI: It was Decker...Decker did this...

          
          In foreground, Boone's face begins to transform, which Lori can't
          see. She hears the cops outside.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Boone, we have to get out of here.

          
          BOONE: Stay away from me...

          
          LORI: Boone, what is it?

          
          BOONE: I don't want you to see...

          
          LORI: See what?

          
          BOONE: Get out! Do as I say!

          
          LORI: I won't leave you...

          
          As she crosses towards him, he turns. His face is in mid-
          transformation.

          

          148. EXT. SWEETGRASS INN DAY


          
          Lori's scream echoes outside the motel. Joyce orders in the Swat
          Team. They charge, entering the motel.

          

          149. INT. MOTEL CORRIDOR DAY


          
          Lori backs out of the room in horror.

          
          LORI: Oh my God...oh my God...

          
          She hears cops charging up the stairs.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Boone! They're coming!

          The transformed Boone covers his face, slams the room door shut and
          moves towards the bodies.

          
          Lori hides at the end of the corridor as the Swat cops appear at the
          far end.

          
          On his knees, in the middle of some frenzied action we can't quite
          see, Boone stops and looks down at his blood-stained hands.

          
          BOONE: No...No...

          
          Out of sight, Lori watches the cops prepare to storm the room.

          

          150A. INT. MOTEL BATHROOM DAY


          
          Boone enters the bathroom with the sound of the Swat Team's entry to
          the motel on the track. He slams the door. There is blood on his face
          and hands. He goes to the sink and turns on the tap. Then he sees
          himself in the mirror, his transformed face is a shock, He looks at
          himself, appalled. Then a wave of nausea overtakes him. He throws up
          into the sink; a splash of blood and flesh he's just eaten. Wiping
          his mouth with the back of his hands he starts to breathe out his
          condition. His face transforms back to his normal state. He makes a
          sob of horror.

          
          SWAT LEADER (V.O.): In here!

          
          Boone looks towards the door, sinking down against the tiles as he
          does so. The door is flung open. We see him cowering as the Swat Team
          come for him.

          Under cover of the trees and cars around the motel, Lori hides in a
          place where she can view the front of the building.

          
          She sees Eigerman talking with Joyce, Decker behind them. They look
          up as the Swat cops manhandle a hand-cuffed Boone out of the
          building. He has totally reverted to human form, the blood-stains
          seemingly a sure proof of guilt. Lori watches as he's thrown into a
          police car and driven off.

          153. INT. SHERE NECK POLICE STATION DAY


          
          A clank of keys opening locks. A steel door swings open. Three cops
          rough-house Boone down the corridor, Eigerman right behind, passing
          other cells holding prisoners watching them go by. We hold on one, a
          young fundamentalist Baptist preacher, Reverend Ashberry. He has
          haunted, maniacally repressed eyes and the ragged look of a habitual
          drunk.

          

          154. INT. POLICE STATION CELL DAY


          
          Boone is thrown into the cell. Eigerman and the three cops,
          Labowitz, Sergeant Pettine and Gibbs, all practised hard guys, enter
          the cell after him.

          
          EIGERMAN: Fuckin' freak! Fuckin' cannibal! [to his men] Stand him up!

          
          They haul Boone to his feet. Eigerman hits Boone with a wicked
          blackjack.

          
          EIGERMAN [cont.]: You picked the wrong town, boy. We believe in real
          justice here, [a blow is delivered] They're gonna take you back to
          the city...[another blow]...but we're gonna leave you
          with something...[another blow]...to remember...[another]...us...by!

          
          Boone sags to the ground, unconscious.

          

          154A. INT. ASHBERRY'S CELL DAY


          
          As the sound of Boone being beaten up filters through the wall,
          Ashberry sits in his cell, Bible in hand. He flicks the pages over,
          attempting to distance himself from the violence he hears with study.
          He halts at a page with an illustration. It is something from
          Revelations: monsters and demons doing battle with angels. He puts
          the book down, and turns over his palm. It is a mass of tiny scars.
          He closes his hand into a white-knuckled fist, retreating into the
          shadows in the corner of his cell.

          
          We cutback to his hand. Blood seeps between the fingers, as his
          nails dig into the meat of his palm.

          

          155. INT. EIGERMAN'S OFFICE DAY


          
          Eigerman enters. Decker is standing looking at Eigerman's collection
          of photographs.

          
          EIGERMAN: You still here?

          
          DECKER: I'm going back to Midian with you.

          
          EIGERMAN: I'm not going anywhere. We got press folks and
          photographers coming in from all over. Wouldn't be polite to keep 'em
          waiting.

          
          Eigerman starts to exit again. Joyce is in the doorway.

          
          EIGERMAN: Tell him. We got our man under lock and key.

          
          DECKER: Don't trust him. He...he...changes. I've seen him.

          
          EIGERMAN: I'll keep an eye out.

          
          JOYCE: He was right about the motel.

          
          EIGERMAN: So?

          
          JOYCE: So maybe there are more of them...

          
          EIGERMAN: Monsters?

          
          JOYCE: Killers. A cult. I don't know.

          
          EIGERMAN: You want to take some of the boys, take 'em Pettine?

          
          PETTINE: Yes, Sir -

          
          EIGERMAN: You, Tommy and Gibbs, take the Inspector out to the
          cemetery. Dig around. If you find anything with more two eyes,
          holler. I got photographers wanting me...

          
          He exits.

          

          156. INT. BOONE'S CELL DAY


          
          Badly beaten, Boone lies in the corner, stirring when he hears the
          door unlocked. Labowitz ushers in a middle-aged, small-town
          physician, Doctor Rose.

          
          LABOWITZ: Doctor's here to examine you, freak. Just so nobody can
          say we laid a finger on you...[he winks at Rose] Looks okay to me,
          what do you think, Doc?

          
          Boone painfully pulls himself upright. Looks up at Dr Rose, who
          slips on his stethoscope, listens to Boone's chest. He moves it,
          listens, moves it again, alarmed. He takes Boone's wrist, feels
          around. Boone stares at him. Dr Rose clears his throat, rises, moves
          to Labowitz at the door and speaks quietly.

          
          DR ROSE: No pulse.

          
          LABOWITZ: What's that?

          
          DR ROSE: No...pulse.

          

          157. EXT. POLICE STATION DAY


          
          A crowd of journalists and on-lookers mill outside the station. We
          find Lori, following her through the crowd as she tries to get a view
          of the building.

          
          As she watches, Joyce and his three-cop escort climb into two police
          cars and drive off.

          

          158. INT. POLICE STATION DAY


          
          An impromptu press conference, with Eigerman centre stage, standing
          at a table laced with tape recorders and microphones.
          Behind him, a map of the town, with coloured pins and a blackboard
          drawing of the Sweetgrass Inn, including a diagram of where the
          bodies were found. Eigerman adores the attention.

          
          EIGERMAN: Yes he may have had accomplices but I can't reveal the
          precise source of my information on that...

          
          1ST REPORTER: Local source, Captain?

          
          EIGERMAN [a glance at Decker in the crowd]: Not so's you'd notice.

          
          2ND REPORTER: Has Boone made a confession?

          
          EIGERMAN: We found him with a piece of human flesh in his mouth.
          How's that for guilty?

          
          Cameras flash furiously. We see Labowitz leading Dr Rose through the
          crowd to the podium. Labowitz reaches Eigerman and whispers in his
          ear. Eigerman makes him repeat it. His brow knits in puzzlement. He
          turns to the press and smiles.

          
          EIGERMAN [cont.]: 'Scuse me, folks, won't be a second.

          
          Eigerman points a beckoning finger at Decker, who follows him into
          his office, along with Labowitz and Dr Rose.

          

          159. INT. EIGERMAN'S OFFICE DAY


          
          Eigerman closes the door and turns to Decker.

          
          EIGERMAN: Just exactly how many bullets did they put into this geek
          up at Midian?

          
          DECKER: Why?

          
          DR ROSE [severely shaken]: Half of them are still in him. In fact,
          he's riddled with them.

          
          DECKER: As I told you, these aren't ordinary people. You're saying
          he should be dead?

          
          DR ROSE: No, I'm saying he is dead.

          
          DECKER: When?

          
          EIGERMAN: Not lying down dead, friend. Walkin' around in my fucking
          cell dead. Now what about that?

          
          Decker's shaken. He grips his briefcase tightly.

          

          160. INT. BOONE'S CELL DAY


          
          Boone sits in his cell, head down, expression masked, eyes moving
          restlessly.

          

          160A. INT. ASHBERRY'S CELL DAY


          
          Ashberry is sitting half in shadow and half in light. His eyes carry
          the half-buried mania that we'll see erupt later on. He puts his head
          against the wall and speaks softly to Boone, his tone intensifying as
          his feelings take stronger hold.

          
          ASHBERRY: Can you hear me? They'll find a way to kill you, you know
          that? Can't fight the darkness. Not when it's inside
          you. Are you listening? You're an abomination, Boone. You have to
          die. There's lots of ways. I've read about them. Seen them when I
          sleep. Horrible. HEAR ME?

          
          He suddenly slams his bloody hand against the wall.

          
          ASHBERRY: Have you got a God, Boone? Any God'll do. I had one,
          but...he doesn't listen any more. I ask him to take the
          dreams away but they keep coming. Blood and fire. Like the end of
          the world...

          
          We move from Ashberry's stricken face to the bloody mark his hand
          left in the wall. It vaguely resembles something we recognize:
          Baphomet's head.

          

          FADE OUT:

          

          FADE IN:

          

          161. EXT. SHERE NECK STREET DAY


          
          Lori emerges from a supermarket with food to eat. She walks into a
          small square, finds a seat and sits down to eat. As she reaches into
          the bag:

          
          BABETTE[V.O.]:Lori?

          
          She looks round. The voice sounded real. No sign of Babette.

          
          BABETTE [V.O. - cont.]: Lori...close your eyes.

          
          LORI [frightened]: Where are you?

          
          BABETTE [V.O.]: Please, do as I say.

          
          Lori closes her eyes.

          

          162. INT. SKULL CHAMBER CENTRE CORE


          
          Lori and Babette's P.O.V. - darkness.

          
          BABETTE [V.O.]: Be with me...be with me...

          
          Dim light. We're in the Midian skull chamber, seeing it through
          Babette's eyes. Their voices merge into one.

          
          LORI/BABETTE [V.O.]: ...where am I? What's happening to me?

          
          Rachel steps into view, and looks directly down at the camera.

          
          RACHEL: What is it, child?

          

          163. EXT. SHERE NECK STREET DAY


          
          Lori's eyes spring open. She's terrified.

          
          BABETTE [V.O.]: Lori! Comeback!

          
          Lori closes her eyes again and we click back into...

          

          164. EXT. SHERE NECK STREET DAY


          
          Lori and Babette's P.O.V. - we see Babette's view of Rachel.

          
          LORI/BABETTE [V.O.]: Is this real?

          
          RACHEL [whispers]: What are you talking about? Babette? [grips
          Babette] What have you done?

          
          LORI/BABETTE [V.O.]: I've brought her, to see. She's in me. Babette
          breaks away, Rachel tries to catch hold, Babette runs.
          P.O.V. camera veers around and down through the maze of Midian.

          

          165. EXT. SHERE NECK STREET DAY


          
          Eyes closed on the bench, Lori gasps as the journey snatches her up.

          

          166. INT. CENTRAL CORE


          
          Lori and Babette's P.O.V. - Babette races over a rope-bridge. We see
          it all through her eyes, her hands coming occasionally into view. We
          head down a narrow tunnel and into a small chamber, which is
          Babette's hidehole. We scan the treasures she keeps there: a doll
          made of grasses; birds' skulls; pretty stones. We hear voices from
          above and we look up at a steel grille, facing out on the surface.

          

          166A. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Pushing closer to the grille we see...Joyce, Pettine, Tommy and
          Gibbs, wandering through the Necropolis, armed to the hilt. Only
          Joyce carries no weapon.

          
          PETTINE: Christ, you could hide a fuckin' army in here.

          
          TOMMY: What egg-zactly are we lookin' for, Sarge?

          
          TOMMY [spits some tobacco juice on a tomb]: We're here to kick some
          major-league butt.

          
          JOYCE [distrusts these throwbacks]: We're here to scout, not engage

          
          TOMMY: Well what if they engage us? What about that?

          
          PETTINE: There's people down there, I can feel it.

          
          Lori/Babette gasps, Pettine hears the sound and walks over to the
          grille.

          

          
          TOMMY: Why don't we just shoot 'em in their graves? Save us
          diggin' new ones, [giggles - fires at one of the tombs]

          
          JOYCE [angry]: Hold your fire!

          
          PETTINE: We want prisoners, Tommy.

          
          Pettine goes down on his haunches beside the grille, runs the muzzle
          of his gun along it. P.O.V. camera withdraws into the
          shadows. He shakes his head and...

          

          167. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          We cut out of the P.O.V. as Pettine stands.

          
          PETTINE: There's something down there all right.

          
          JOYCE: If that's the case we'll call for back-up...

          
          Pettine spots a movement in the shadows of a half-open mausoleum
          door. He catches Gibbs' eye, nods in the direction of the door, Gibbs
          gets the idea and starts to back towards the tomb.

          
          PETTINE [a performance]: I don't know. Maybe we're just spooked.
          Hell, who'd live in a graveyard, anyway? [crossing towards Gibbs]
          What do you say, Lieutenant? Maybe we oughta just pack it in...head
          for home...

          
          He and Gibbs rush the door of the tomb; there's a cry of surprise
          from inside.

          

          168. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Lori and Babette's P.O.V. - Camera glides back up to the grille in
          time to see Gibbs and Pettine drag Ohnaka out of darkness and into
          the sunlight where he lacks the strength to resist.

          
          TOMMY: Well, lookee what we got here...

          
          Tommy strikes Ohnaka with a rifle butt, knocking him to his knees.

          

          169. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          As the cops circle around Ohnaka, he moans, puts his head down and
          covers his face with his hands.

          
          GIBBS: Shit. Don't look so tough to me.

          
          PETTINE: Want we should interrogate it, Lieutenant?

          
          JOYCE [amazed]: Give it some room.

          
          In the sunlight, Ohnaka's naked back begins to smoke and blister.

          
          GIBBS: What the hell for?

          
          JOYCE: God damn it! There's something wrong with him...

          
          TOMMY [disgusted]: Shit...

          
          PETTINE: What the fuck is this?

          
          Gibbs, unfazed, steps up to Ohnaka and kicks the creature over.

          
          GIBBS: We want answers, asshole!

          
          JOYCE: Back off, Gibbs!

          
          Gibbs ignores him, trying to drag Ohnaka's hands away from his face.

          

          170. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Lori and Babette's P.O.V. - Watching the knot of men around the
          defenceless Ohnaka.

          
          LORI/BABETTE [V.O.]: The light...

          

          171. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Gibbs rifle-butts Ohnaka's hands, then pulls them away from his
          face; the features are horribly disfigured, blood running from his
          eyes, scorched by the sun. Now even Gibbs tries to back away, but
          Ohnaka grabs hold of his shirt.

          
          GIBBS: Shit! Shit! Get it off me! Tommy!

          
          TOMMY: No way, man!

          
          Pettine fires his piece at Ohnaka, hitting him in the belly and arm,
          but he still holds on, throwing back his head and howling. Smoke
          rises from his entire body, dust pours from his veins. The howl
          becomes a high-pitched whine and he explodes, in a burst of dust and
          black blood.

          

          172. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Lori and Babette's P.O.V. - They see Ohnaka die.

          

          173. EXT. SHERE NECK STREET DAY


          
          Lori opens her eyes, which are running with tears.

          
          LORI: Oh my God...oh my God...

          
          She stands up, her hand to her mouth.

          

          174. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Lori and Babette's P.O.V. - Babette's trembling hands hold onto the
          grille as she watches.

          
          BABETTE [V.O.]: Lori, don't leave, please don't leave me.

          

          175. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          The cops stare in disbelief at Ohnaka's dusty remains.

          
          PETTINE: Jesus...d'you see that fucker's face?

          
          JOYCE: It was the sun. The sun did it.

          
          GIBBS: Christ on a crutch...

          
          JOYCE: Man, that tears it, I'm calling the fuckin' chief.

          
          Gibbs raises a trembling match to his cigarette as Tommy heads back
          to the cars.

          
          GIBBS: Couldn't have been just...just the sun...

          
          JOYCE: Believe it, shithead.

          
          PETTINE [grinning]: So if all it takes is the sun, we got the
          perfect weapon, right over our heads.

          
          JOYCE: Until it goes down.

          
          Pettine's smile fades. Then a cry of alarm from the distance.

          
          TOMMY [V.O.]: Oh no! Shit! Pettine! Goddamn it!

          
          The men rush to the gate.

          

          176. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES DAY


          
          The two police cars are on fire. The other cops reach them, Pettine
          reaches into the one less involved in flame and pulls out the radio
          microphone.

          
          JOYCE: Who did it, did you see anyone? 

          
          Tommy shakes his head. They all look up, hearing a distant car engine.

          

          177. EXT./INT. BEAT-UP CAR DAY


          
          Wearing a hat and dark glasses, laughing, Narcisse drives this old
          clunker like a maniac, takes a large cigar out of his mouth.

          
          He strikes a match off a thumb hook and lights up. In the back,
          protected from sunlight by shades on the windows, is Rachel.

          

          178. INT. POLICE STATION TOILET DAY


          
          The door opens, a panicked Labowitz enters.

          
          LABOWITZ: Chief, come quick...

          
          EIGERMAN [from inside a stall]: This better be good...

          
          LABOWITZ: Pettine's on the radio, they're under attack.

          
          EIGERMAN: Hot damn, we got contact!

          
          He bursts out of the stall, hitching his trousers.

          

          179. INT. EIGERMAN'S OFFICE DAY


          
          Eigerman enters, takes the two-way receiver. Behind him, Decker,
          Labowitz and Kane enter the office.

          
          EIGERMAN: Pettine, what's your situation.

          

          INTERCUT:

          

          180. EXT. NECROPOLIS


          

           INT. EIGERMAN'S OFFICE DAY


          
          Pettine on the radio, as the others try to keep back the flames.

          
          PETTINE [into radio]: The place is crawling with 'em...they torched
          our cars...fuckin' freaks!...

          
          The transmission breaks up. Eigerman turns to the others in the room.

          
          EIGERMAN [joyfully]: ...Sound the call, boys, let the bells of
          freedom ring, we got to mobilize.

          
          Decker affectionately runs his hand over his briefcase.

          

          181. EXT. SHERENECK STREET DAY


          
          Lori moves down the street, blinking through tears.

          
          BABETTE [V.O.]: I'm afraid ...

          
          LORI: I have to go, Babette, I have to get help. I'll be back, I
          promise. You hide somewhere.

          
          The connection fades. Lori wipes the tears from her cheeks.

          

          182. INT. POLICE STATION DAY


          
          The crowd and journalists still hanging around; Eigerman throws the
          door open.

          
          EIGERMAN: Listen up! We got officers under attack, I need volunteers
          for a posse! Y'all sign up with Officer Labowitz here!

          
          He moves back towards the office, as Labowitz, clipboard in hand, is
          besieged with offers.

          

          183. INT. EIGERMAN'S OFFICE DAY


          
          Decker is sitting with his briefcase open on his lap, gazing

          AFFECTIONATELY 
          at the button head mask inside. He snaps the case shut as Eigerman 
          re-enters, followed by the silent Kane. Eigerman digs a key
          out of his desk.

          
          EIGERMAN: If you're gonna make an omelette you have to break eggs,
          isn't that right, Professor?

          
          DECKER [doesn't follow]: Sorry?

          
          EIGERMAN: Christmas comes early this year.

          

          184. INT. POLICE STATION STORAGE ROOM DAY


          

          
          Eigerman leads Decker, Kane and another cop down into the bowels of
          the station. He unlocks a door and switches on a light. Warehoused
          inside is a virtual arsenal in a number of packing crates stencilled
          with a martial insignia and the name:

          SONS OF THE FREE: SHERE NECK BRIGADE'

          
          The crates are also stamped with their countries of origin: South
          Africa and the Soviet Union.

          
          EIGERMAN: Ounce a' prevention is worth a pound a' cure. Save for a
          rainy day, one day that day will come. Don't matter if it's Commies,
          homos, freaks or Japs, we are ready. World class ordnance, Doc: the
          best private sector money can buy.

          
          Kane, with a clipboard, goes over supplies with the other cop.

          
          KANE [over above  in his element): Okay. We got your spankin' new
          G3 thirty-odd-six Springfield semi-auto with roller-lock
          action and retractable stock. For standard carbine firepower, you
          can't beat this match-accurate Galil AR 7.62 NATO assault rifle and
          for the sportsman in the crowd we carry this handy, double-pump,
          Mossberg Persuader, sling swivels double extractors, which also comes
          in a light-weight single-barrel size for ladies and juniors -

          
          DECKER: Marvelous, really, but -

          
          KANE: Now over here we're talkin' Damascus, high-carbon Spetnatz
          shootin' knives, and for that tough up-close-and-
          personal work, you can always count on your razor-wire/fishing-line
          garotte when nuthin' else will do 

          
          DECKER [over Kane]: Captain, have you considered the possibility
          that knives and bullets won't be adequate to the task?

          
          EIGERMAN: Show him, Kane.

          
          KANE [pulling off a shroud to unveil]: That's why we bought these
          cherry Israeli Army high-octane linear-field flame throwers.

          
          EIGERMAN: Now I know what you're thinkin', Doc; maybe there's some
          sort'a spiritual angle to all this. Well, we got that
          covered, too.

          

          185. INT. POLICE STATION CELLS NIGHT


          
          A cell door swings open. Decker and Eigerman look in on the Baptist
          preacher, Reverend Ashberry.

          
          EIGERMAN: Reverend Ashberry, your services are required.

          
          DECKER: He looks like a drunk.

          
          EIGERMAN: He is; lost his way, poor bastard, [hauling Ashberry to
          his feet] You wouldn't wanna miss the Day of Judgment, now would you?

          
          ASHBERRY [seems he's been waiting for this]: The Apocalypse? It's
          here?

          
          EIGERMAN: They're warming up for it over in Midian. [leading him
          out] Padre, you get your pious butt over to church and load up on
          some Holy Water and crucifixes...we're goin' in there with God on our
          side.

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          186. EXT. POLICE STATION DAY


          
          Boone looks out the window of his cell as a large, unruly posse
          musters outside in a variety of vehicles. A mix of survivalist
          fanatics in Sons of the Free-labelled camouflage, Marlboro Men with
          six-shooters, red-neck bozos with their diesel-dyke mamas and heavily
          made-up bimbos out for a good time. The atmosphere is one of near
          carnival.

          
          Accoutred for combat, Kane and some other cops distribute the weapons.

          
          Boone slumps away from the window, his worst fears realized.

          
          Reverend Ashberry arrives, lugging six full canteens and an arm-load
          of crucifixes. He loads into the back of an enclosed, high-tech
          camper with Eigerman and Decker. Eigerman blows an air-horn, claiming
          the crowd's attention.

          
          EIGERMAN: You are all hereby deputized in the name of the law. Now
          let's kick some ass!

          
          Eigerman's truck leads the caravan, which drives off, horns honking,
          war whoops and liquor-fuelled courage. As the dust clears now, left
          more or less alone, Lori looks at the police station.

          
          A beat-up car squeals to a halt in front of her and the front door
          opens.

          
          NARCISSE: Hey, chickie, want a ride?

          
          LORI: No...

          
          RACHEL: Please.

          
          Lori sees Rachel and gets in the car.

          

          187. INT. BEAT-UP CAR DAY


          
          Narcisse drives around the block, smoking his cigar.

          
          NARCISSE: We have to get Boone out, Midian needs him...

          
          LORI: What could he do?

          
          RACHEL: He went into Baphomet's chamber. He spoke with the Baptiser...

          
          NARCISSE: And survived; nobody ever did that before.

          
          RACHEL: Perhaps Baphomet told him something, something that could
          save Midian.

          
          NARCISSE: Where they keeping him?

          
          LORI: Inside somewhere. He'll be guarded.

          
          RACHEL: He has powers of his own.

          
          LORI: Tell me about it; what's happened to him?

          
          NARCISSE: He was bitten by a Nightbreed, see, the taint's in his
          system...

          
          RACHEL: Boone has been turned, he's one of us...

          
          LORI: Okay. So what you're saying is, you're saying he's dead.

          
          NARCISSE: Hey, some of my best friends are dead.

          
          LORI [horrified]: ...I'm going out of my mind.

          
          NARCISSE [to Rachel]: See? I told you she'd take it well.

          

          188. EXT. HIGHWAY DAY


          
          The posse heads down the road, whoops and hollers emerging from the
          dust cloud it kicks up.

          

          189. INT. CAB OF EIGERMAN'S TRUCK DAY


          
          Eigerman cleans his silver-plate Magnum .45, Decker sits beside him
          holding his briefcase, across from Ashberry, who's frantically paging
          through an ancient Bible.

          
          EIGERMAN: Ever performed an exorcism, Father?

          
          ASHBERRY: No.

          
          EIGERMAN: Ever seen one?

          
          ASHBERRY: No.

          
          EIGERMAN: Well I'd start rehearsin' if I was you. [hands a gun
          towards Decker] Why don't you hang on to that, Doc?

          
          DECKER [a little prim]: Oh no, I wouldn't know how to use it...

          
          ASHBERRY [finds something in the book, reads]: Listen! 'So Moses
          spoke to the people, saying "Arm yourselves for war and let them go
          and take vengeance for the Lord on Midian..." and so they burned with
          fire all the cities where they dwelt and
          killed the kings of Midian, both man and beast!'

          
          EIGERMAN [with a wink]: Hey, how 'bout that, Doc? Sounds like we're
          on a crusade against the Devil himself.

          
          ASHBERRY [not terribly convincing]: I don't believe in the Devil.

          
          DECKER: Oh...you will.

          
          Ashberry looks at Decker; no trace of irony in his expression.
          Ashberry sorts through the canteens, finds the one that doesn't have
          a white cross on it, opens it and knocks back two fingers of bourbon.

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          190. EXT. SHERE NECK POLICE STATION DAY


          
          The sun sinking low in the sky. The shadows are long.

          

          191. INT. POLICE STATION CELL CORRIDOR DAY


          
          The station is eerily quiet. Labowitz and an Irish cop, Connie
          Cormack, guard the cells. Two other cops patrol the end of the
          corridor. All heavily armed. Labowitz moves to the door of Boone's
          cell.

          

          192. INT. BOONE'S CELL DAY


          
          The spy-hole cover is open. Boone looks up.

          
          LABOWITZ [from other side of door]: Hey, freak-face, we found your
          pals. They're gonna fry, just like you. Give us a smile now.

          
          Boone stares at the floor, depressed, defeated.

          

          193. INT. CELL CORRIDOR/OFFICE DAY


          
          Labowitz chuckles and closes the spy-hole. He walks back down to the
          coffee station near Eigerman's office, where Cormack is pouring two
          cups. He takes out a flask, spikes his mug and offers some to
          Labowitz.

          
          CORMACK: Little Irish in your joe, Constable Labowitz?

          
          LABOWITZ [a bad brogue]: Don't mind if I do, Constable Cormack. 

          
          There is a knock on the station door. They look at each other.
          Cormack picks up his gun and crosses to the door.

          
          CORMACK: Who's there?

          
          RACHEL [O.S.]: Help me, please.

          
          CORMACK: What's wrong?

          
          RACHEL [O.S.]: Accident. We need help.

          
          Cormack decides to unbolt the door. On the step stands Rachel,
          shrouded in black veils. Only her eyes are visible. They fix
          Cormack.

          
          CORMACK: What's the problem, lady?

          
          She drops the veil. The other half of her face has disappeared into
          smoke.

          
          CORMACK [cont.]: What the blazes?

          
          Her costume falls to the ground. Her eyes dissolve. As smoke, Rachel
          blows into the station. Cormack fires through the smoke, yelling as
          he does so.

          
          LABOWITZ [running towards the cell]: Hold 'em, Connie!

          

          194. INT. CELL CORRIDOR DAY


          
          The two other cops hear the shot and run towards the station.
          Labowitz runs back in with them before they get there, slams and
          bolts the door.

          
          LABOWITZ [to the other cops]: Hold your ground! [yells through the
          door] Cormack? You all right?

          

          195. INT. POLICE STATION DAY


          
          Cormack turns back towards the door, sees Narcisse, screams and
          fires twice. Narcisse flips one of the bullets out of his chest with
          a thumb-nail, then leaps onto Cormack, who manages to shoot himself
          in the foot. Lori enters, slams the door and locks it. Narcisse
          squats over Cormack, holds his razor-nails under his chin.

          
          NARCISSE: Where is he? Where's Boone?

          
          CORMACK: Cell f-f-f-five...through the door...

          
          NARCISSE [grins at Lori]: I love a coward.

          

          196. INT. CELL CORRIDOR DOOR DAY


          
          Labowitz and the other cops confidently prepare for a siege.

          
          LABOWITZ [calling back to Boone]: Don't think you're getting sprung,
          freak. No way they get through that door; solid steel,
          armour-piercing shells wouldn't even make a dent...

          
          Smoke seeps through the key-hole, and from beneath the connecting
          door.

          
          LABOWITZ [cont.]: You hear me, freak? No fuckin' way!

          
          The smoke from the key-hole begins to form into a face, which floats
          on a cord of smoke/flesh from the key-hole. The smoke from beneath
          the door forms into breasts and rib cage, in which a heart beats.
          Labowitz turns and sees it.

          
          LABOWITZ [cont.]: Jesus Christ...

          
          He empties his gun through the smoke; the two cops on the other side
          of the smoke are hit and go down.

          
          An arm moves towards Labowitz; so does Rachel's face. Her beauty
          mesmerizes him. Her naked breasts, which float beneath
          the head, barely connected to it as yet, enchant him even more.

          
          RACHEL: Come closer...I don't want to kill you...

          
          Her hand presses Labowitz's rifle aside. Rachel's lips touch him. He
          doesn't resist, but once his mouth is sealed against hers he can't
          breathe. He tries to raise the rifle, but she dashes it from his
          hand. Then she snatches the keys from his belt and breaks the kiss.
          He falls to his knees, gasping. Her body completed and naked, Rachel
          unlocks the connecting door, then starts looking for Boone. Behind
          her, as Labowitz reaches for his gun, Narcisse's hand reaches in and
          grabs his throat.

          
          NARCISSE: Naughty, naughty.

          
          Labowitz looks up into Narcisse's scarred face and faints. Lori
          steps past Labowitz to the cell Rachel directs her towards.

          
          RACHEL: We don't have much time.

          
          LORI: I know.

          
          Lori unlocks the door.

          

          197. INT. BOONE'S CELL DAY


          
          LORI [nervous]: Boone?

          
          BOONE [wakes]: Stay away from me. I'll hurt you.

          
          LORI: I don't think so.

          
          BOONE: You know what I did in that room? I'm a goddamn cannibal.
          Stay away!

          
          LORI: They're going to come for you.

          
          BOONE: Let them. Let them find some way to kill me.

          
          LORI: You can't die. Midian needs you.

          
          BOONE: Midian's just a hole in the ground. It's full of things that
          should lie down and stay dead.

          
          LORI: All right. If not for the Breed, then for me. You can't give
          up on us.

          
          BOONE: You talk like you're one of them.

          
          LORI: Maybe I wish I was. Some little part of me. [she puts her hand
          on his face] All I know is, I'm not afraid of you. I know I should
          be, but I'm not. I still want you, whatever you are. And I'm not
          going to leave you. If they come for you, then they'll have to kill
          me too.

          
          BOONE: No!

          
          LORI: So fight. For both of us. For all of us. I don't want to be
          dust. I want us flesh and blood. Kiss me. I love you.

          
          He kisses her. First tentatively, then with great passion.

          

          198. INT. CELL CORRIDOR DAY


          
          Narcisse knocks, calls through the door.

          
          NARCISSE: What the hell are you doing in there?

          

          INTERCUT:

          

          199. INT. BOONE'S CELL DAY


          
          Fucking, is the answer. They are wound around each other: licking,
          biting, gasping. Boone thrusts up into her.

          
          LORI: Yes...yes!

          
          NARCISSE [to himself]: Jesus. Bastard does better dead than I did
          alive.

          

          200. INT. POLICE STATION DAY


          
          The connecting door flies open, a rejuvenated Boone and Lori move
          into the office where Narcisse and Rachel are waiting. Narcisse toys
          with the unconscious Cormack.

          
          RACHEL: Are we going?

          
          NARCISSE: About time.

          
          BOONE: Midian.

          
          NARCISSE: All right.

          
          BOONE: It's about time they saw the truth.

          

          201. SCENE DELETED

          

          202. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES LATE AFTERNOON


          
          Gibbs, Joyce, Tommy and Pettine wait outside the gates. Pettine
          paces. Joyce looks at his watch, moves over to Pettine and speaks
          quietly.

          
          JOYCE: How long until dark?

          
          PETTINE: Two hours. Two and a half. I told 'em to bring gasoline.
          We'll burn the bastards out.

          
          JOYCE: Has it occurred to you maybe we've got this all wrong? We
          could be destroying...I don't know, a whole new species.

          
          PETTINE: You saw that fucker below, Lieutenant, same as me. That
          damn thing was just too weird to live.

          
          JOYCE: Maybe they're just different.

          
          PETTINE: Isn't that enough reason?

          
          Joyce stares at him. In background, Tommy starts to holler. Pettine
          calls.

          
          PETTINE [cont.]: What is it?

          
          Tommy is pointing frantically at a dust cloud in the distance.

          

          203. EXT. ROAD TO MIDIAN LATE AFTERNOON


          
          A violent cut to the roar of engines as we track with the fast-
          moving posse. Eigerman stands up out of a skylight in the cab of his
          truck, eggs on the other vehicles with a rebel war cry.

          
          EIGERMAN: Yee-hah!

          

          204. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES LATE AFTERNOON


          
          As the caravan appears. Ecstasy. Tommy and Gibbs dance a jig together.

          
          GIBBS: It's the fuckin' cavalry!

          
          The posse speeds down towards the Necropolis gates.

          

          205. EXT. ROAD TO MIDIAN


          

           INT. CAR DUSK


          
          Narcisse's beat-up car speeds down the highway towards Midian.

          
          BOONE: How much further?

          
          NARCISSE: A mile, maybe two...

          
          We close in on Rachel, who stares ahead of her, as if in a trance.

          
          RACHEL: We're too late.

          
          NARCISSE: Hang on!

          
          Steering hard, he veers the car off the road and into thick woods.
          Branches thrash against the windshield.

          
          NARCISSE [cont.]: This is a shortcut!

          

          206. EXT. NECROPOLIS DUSK


          
          The posse is busily at work around the Necropolis, Eigerman and Kane
          supervising. Some are laying trails of gasoline through the pathways.
          Others are simply patrolling, guns in hand. There is an air of
          nervous anticipation.

          
          Ashberry comes round a tomb and we follow him down a walkway,
          staring in awe at the mausoleums and statuary.

          
          Looking at a particularly large tomb, Ashberry's eye is captivated
          by a large, fantastically rendered marble winged angel. He approaches
          it, reaches up to touch it. The angel, a monster, turns to look at
          him with sad, impassive gravity. Then we see its shadow on Ashberry's
          face and hear the slow, thick beating of its wings as it flies off.

          
          Ashberry's stunned. He fumbles the top of his bourbon canteen off,
          takes a long drink, then stops when he sees a load of dynamite taped
          to the side of the tomb. He follows the wire that leads off it to
          another dynamite pack on an adjacent tomb and then another. He's
          panicked.

          

          207. EXT. NECROPOLIS DUSK


          
          Kane is escorting Eigerman and Pettine down a pathway, pointing out
          the posse's handiwork.

          
          KANE: ...packets of plastique at every intersection, trip wires
          outside the biggest tombs, we figure those'll be the major escape
          routes...

          
          EIGERMAN: How much longer?

          
          KANE: Five minutes.

          
          EIGERMAN [into walkie-talkie]: Let's pull back to the perimeter
          before we lose the light. We've got movement underground;
          they're hearing it round the walls.

          
          ASHBERRY [approaching them from the side]: Captain!

          
          KANE: Jesus, not there, STOP. [Ashberry freezes] We got Claymores
          planted in the rosebushes, Reverend, cut your nuts off 
          faster'n a hedge clipper.

          
          ASHBERRY: We've made a mistake, there are Angels here, a heavenly
          host...

          
          EIGERMAN: You're drunk, asshole.

          
          Ashberry dumps the bourbon out of his canteen.

          
          ASHBERRY: No. Listen to me, it's wrong, it's sacrilege, this is holy
          ground...

          
          EIGERMAN: Get the hell up that hill, you pinhead.

          
          ASHBERRY: You brought me here because I'm a man of God.

          
          EIGERMAN: That's right; hang round here a couple more minutes,
          Padre, and you'll be sitting at his left hand. Now get your sorry ass
          out of the fuckin' way...

          
          Eigerman backhands him. Ashberry falls. Eigerman, Kane, Pettine and
          the other cops begin to pull back.

          
          Ashberry looks up, as he hears grindings and growls in the earth.
          Boone is lifting off the top of a nearby tomb. Ashberry is about to
          shoot when Narcisse grabs him around the throat, puts a finger to his
          lips and signals him to be quiet. Narcisse follows Boone into the
          tomb. The tomb-lid scrapes as it's pushed back into place from
          beneath. Ashberry starts to pray.

          

          207A. INT. BELOW MIDIAN


          
          Boone and Narcisse move through the panicking underground, creatures
          fleeing in every direction. Boone sees Lylesburg, trying to keep the
          panic down, moves towards him.

          
          LYLESBURG: Stay down! Stay where you are, they're waiting for us
          above...

          
          BOONE [intercepting him]: No! if you stay here you'll be
          slaughtered...

          
          LYLESBURG: This is our home.

          
          BOONE: Not anymore...

          
          LYLESBURG: We belong here...

          
          BOONE: Listen to me, old man, the rules change; if you want to live
          it won't be here and it won't be by your laws...

          
          Other creatures have stopped, watching the confrontation. Boone
          speaks to them as well.

          
          BOONE [cont.]: If you'want to survive we've got to fight back, we
          can't hide anymore! [to Lylesburg] What's it gonna be?

          
          Lylesburg slumps, acquiescing, unable to refuse Boone's assertions.

          
          BOONE [cont.] [to Narcisse]: Get the children above ground, find a
          hiding place...[to the others] Get ready to fight! [to Lylesburg]
          What about Baphomet? Can he be moved?

          
          LYLESBURG: Yes. It could be done.

          
          BOONE: It must be done. Brothers and sisters, it's time to fight!

          

          207A. INT. CHAMBERS


          
          Leroy and Lude listen to Boone on the bridge.

          
          LEROY: You hear what he said?

          
          LUDE: What chance have we got? They're armed.

          
          LEROY [opens jacket]: So am I.

          
          Two one-eyed snakes, nesting in Leroy's belly, slide up from his
          innards and wrap around his neck.

          
          LEROY: They call us monsters, remember? They're afraid of us. Let's
          give 'em reason.

          
          LUDE: It's a long time since I spilled blood.

          
          LEROY: You never lose the knack.

          

          208. EXT. HILL ABOVE THE NECROPOLIS DUSK


          
          From this high vantage point, Decker watches the preparations below
          through binoculars, with the glee of a pyromaniac at a fire-storm.
          The sun is setting. He stares up at it, squinting into its brightness.

          
          THE MASK [V.O.]: ...I'm waiting...Philip?...

          
          Decker looks towards the patrol car parked nearby. The front door is
          open. On the passenger seat sits his briefcase. Decker quickly
          crosses to the car.

          
          DECKER: Be quiet.

          
          THE MASK [V.O.]: Let me out, Philip. There's going to be bloodshed.
          I want to see.

          
          Decker opens the briefcase. The mask and his knives are laid out
          inside.

          
          THE MASK: Ah, that's better.

          
          DECKER: We can't let anyone see us...

          
          THE MASK: I want to be free!

          
          JOYCE [V.O.]: Decker?

          
          Decker swings round, slamming the case shut, as Joyce approaches.

          
          DECKER: Lieutenant...[covering flawlessly] You gave me such a start.

          
          JOYCE: Eigerman's invited you to watch from the command post.

          
          DECKER: Oh, I don't think I'm up to it, really.

          
          JOYCE: ...I've got a bad feeling about this.

          
          DECKER: Believe me, Lieutenant, whoever or whatever's living down
          there deserves what's coming.

          
          JOYCE: Monsters, you mean?

          
          DECKER: Unnatural, misbegotten creatures.

          
          JOYCE: I don't know. The only monsters I've ever seen had a human
          face.

          
          As Joyce looks down at the Necropolis, Decker sneaks an anxious side-
          long glance at his briefcase.

          

          209. INT. NECROPOLIS GATES DUSK


          
          The final explosives-layers exit, their backs covered by
          flamethrower and machine-gun-carrying mob members. A distraught
          Ashberry is the last out.

          
          Midian is now completely deserted. Dandelion seeds drift down the
          walkways, caught in shafts of sunlight.

          

          210. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES/COMMAND POST DUSK


          
          Eigerman, Pettine and Kane, looking at their watches.

          
          KANE [a pause  then]: ...T-minus fifteen seconds...ten, nine,eight,
          seven, six, five, four, three, two, one ...

          
          EIGERMAN: Go.

          
          Kane depresses the detonator. There are two large explosions,
          followed by several smaller ones. Part of the Necropolis wall is
          blasted out. Several members of the posse retreat. Eigerman pulls his
          pistol.

          
          EIGERMAN [cont.]: You there, stand your ground! [fires a warning
          shot] Stand your ground, damn you!

          
          The defectors stop. Several more chain explosions in Necropolis.

          Narcisse is leading a group of child monsters, as the explosions
          bring earth plunging down from the ceiling. Babies cry. Monsters
          scream. We see several creatures howling in bestial terror.

          
          Babette is separated from Narcisse's group by falling earth, nearly
          trampled in the chaos. She is picked up by the dog-faced man.

          
          BABETTE: I want my mother.

          
          MAN: We'll find her.

          

          213A. INT. PELOQUIN'S CHAMBER NIGHT


          
          Peloquin squats on the step overlooking the fire-pit, listening to
          the sound of invasion from above. There is a mixture of fear and rage
          on his face. In the darkness opposite, Kinski.

          
          KINSKI: We began this.

          
          PELOQUIN: I just wanted meat. I didn't know he was going to cause
          this.

          
          KINSKI: There were prophesies. The seventh saviour.

          
          PELOQUIN: I didn't believe the prophesies and I didn't obey the Law.
          You want to see me bleed for it? All right, I'll bleed.

          
          He exits the chamber.

          

          214. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES/COMMAND POST NIGHT


          
          Smoke billows over the walls. Eigerman moves closer to the gates,
          listening to the wild cries from inside. He grabs Ashberry by the
          collar.

          
          EIGERMAN: That sound like a heavenly choir to you, Padre?

          
          ASHBERRY: I have to see!

          
          Ashberry shakes himself free and heads through the gates, into the
          Necropolis. Eigerman turns to the others, lights a cigar.

          
          EIGERMAN: Pettine!

          
          PETTINE: Chief?

          
          EIGERMAN: We're moving in.

          
          PETTINE [locks and loads his machine-gun]: Yes, sir! [turns -
          addresses the posse] We're movin' in!

          
          Car engines are revved, headlights turned on, piercing the smoke.

          

          215. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Ashberry wanders through the Necropolis as the Breed begin to emerge
          on every side.

          
          The air is full of sad, melodious sounds, like whale-song. Ghostly
          forms appear from the smoke and drift towards him.

          
          ASHBERRY [in awe]: Dear Lord...

          
          Some of the creatures brush him as they drift by: their strange
          beauty entrances him.

          
          ASHBERRY: Dear Lord ...Forgive me...

          
          There are images here which have the flavour of Christian
          iconography. Mother and child. A man bleeding from his brow. A
          creature with a halo of smoke. He wanders on.

          Decker watches impassively. Joyce moves towards the gate. As he
          reaches it an extraordinary creature appears.

          
          JOYCE: My God.

          
          It means no harm. Joyce steps aside and the creature moves off into
          the night.

          
          We cut back to Decker.

          
          THE MASK [V.O.]: Don't deny me Philip...

          
          DECKER: Soon. I promise.

          
          Decker hears shouts to his flank, steps back, out of sight and sees
          Lori and Rachel emerge from a hiding place, Lori trying to restrain
          Rachel from going in.

          
          RACHEL: Babette!

          
          LORI: Rachel, no!

          
          Rachel breaks away and runs towards the Necropolis. Lori is alone.

          
          THE MASK [V.O.]: Now, perfect, finish her. She's the only one who
          knows about us.

          
          DECKER: What about Boone?

          
          THE MASK [V.O.]: Boone's a monster. They all die tonight.

          
          DECKER [smiles]: All right.

          
          THE MASK [V.O.]: Quickly, Philip, we'll lose her.

          
          The briefcase is opened. The light of distant fires flicker on the
          mask.

          Boone and Narcisse lead the column of Breed, children and babies up
          from underground into the Necropolis itself.

          
          BOONE: Hurry up.

          
          NARCISSE: Is this wise? Coming above ground?

          
          BOONE: If we stay below they'll slaughter us.

          
          NARCISSE: This is their territory.

          
          BOONE: No. The night's ours. Now get the rest of the children up
          here, I'm going to find a clear way through!

          
          He heads away, leaving a frightened group of Breed and children.

          

          218B. EXT. GATES OF NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Peloquin appears overground, scanning the destruction before racing
          off.

          

          219. EXT. GATES OF NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Eigerman addresses the assembled posse.

          
          EIGERMAN: They're coming out, and they're armed, so watch
          yourselves. It's a fucking freak-show in there! We're not taking
          prisoners! It's us or them! Let's clean up!

          
          The engines rev, and the posse charges the gates. The lead vehicle,
          driven by a manic, grinning Kane, rams the gates, and crashes through.

          
          KANE: Us or them! Us or them!

          
          On the other side of the gates, Peloquin appears in Kane's headlights.

          
          KANE: Shit!

          
          Peloquin jumps up into the air as the car careers towards him.

          
          We see him somersault in the air. Kane hears him land on the car
          roof. We see Peloquin on the roof, bend over the windshield.

          
          His face appears in front of a panicking Kane, the mouth suddenly
          opening grotesquely wide.

          
          Kane slams the breaks on. Peloquin is thrown off.

          
          KANE: Eat dirt, fucker!

          
          Peloquin is thrown to the ground, his face caught in the blaze of
          headlights as Kane's vehicle revs and drives at him.

          
          KANE [ecstatic]: Yeah!

          
          His momentum carries the car towards the crater blown in the ground.
          Kane's pleasure turns to horror.

          
          KANE: Oh shit! Shit!

          
          He turns to swerve, but too late, the car heads over the edge.
          Wounded, Peloquin crawls off.

          

          219A. INT. MIDIAN CORE


          
          Dirt falls from the roof. Headlights appear.

          

          219B. INT. KANE'S CAR NIGHT


          
          The car slides into the earth. The guns stacked behind him fall
          forward.

          
          KANE: Oh my Jesus!

          

          219C. INT. MIDIAN CORE


          
          Kane's car drops through the roof of Midian, falling through the
          core, breaking bridges as it falls. Breed are thrown off walkways to
          their deaths. The car strikes the top of Baphomet's chamber and a
          plume of fire, followed by several small explosions, marks Kane's
          death.

          

          219D. INT. BAPHOMET'S CHAMBER


          
          The explosions rock the chamber. Dirt falls. Baphomet looks towards
          the roof, with great sadness on his face.

          

          219E. INT. INITIATION CHAMBER


          
          Boone enters the initiation chamber. Lylesburg is standing beside
          the bowl of Baphomet's blood, which is bubbling furiously.

          
          BOONE: What the hell are you doing down here? We need help!

          
          LYLESBURG: This was intended.

          
          BOONE: Fuck that! We're not going to lie down and die.

          
          LYLESBURG: It's Baphomet's will. He's going to destroy the Naturals,
          and us. Everything, in one last fire.

          
          BOONE: How do you know?

          
          LYLESBURG: Look for yourself.

          
          He points to the bowl.

          
          BOONE: It's going to blow?

          
          LYLESBURG: Yes.

          
          BOONE: He'll destroy his own people?

          
          LYLESBURG: Better it ends quickly. We can't escape them. We remind
          them of the darkness in themselves. They hate that.

          
          BOONE: So did I. I learned better. We can make it out. But I need
          fighters.

          
          LYLESBURG: We're not warriors...

          
          BOONE: What about the Berserkers?

          
          LYLESBURG: They're uncontrollable.

          
          BOONE: All the better. Let them out. Don't just stand there!

          
          We're the tribes of the moon, remember?

          
          Doubt and fear mingle in Lylesburg's look, but he finally nods his
          head.

          
          LYLESBURG: I'll release the Berserkers.

          
          BOONE: Be quick. We haven't got forever. Yet.

          
          Lylesburg smiles. Boone leaves. The Drummer is at the door.

          
          BOONE: You come with me. The rest of you get out of here.

          
          He exits with the Drummer.

          

          219F. EXT. GATES NIGHT


          
          The posse enter in large numbers, firing to left and right. We see
          Breed shot down.

          

          219G. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Boone races to the entrance, to see Eigerman's posse moving towards
          the Necropolis. One of the posse has a flame thrower. He burns up the
          foliage. From Boone's P.O.V. we view the enemy: grinning sweating
          monsters. There's no way out in this direction.

          

          219H. EXT. GATES NIGHT


          
          Lori looks towards the conflagration.

          
          LORI: Oh Jesus, Boone.

          
          Behind her, we see a familiar, masked figure approaching: Decker.
          She doesn't hear him over the shouts and screams.

          

          219I. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          One of the posse fires a rocket into a giant Breed who explodes.
          Boone reacts with horror at the destruction. When he turns back he
          sees Breed watching too, defenceless.

          
          BOONE: Arm yourselves! Defend yourselves! You're not cattle, for
          Christ's sake. They don't have any right to kill you!

          
          He races back the way he came, and pulls coffins from the walls,
          tearing their lids off with supernatural strength. He breaks the wood
          into clubs. The Breed watch him.

          
          BOONE: Weapons! You need weapons or it's over!

          
          One or two understand, and do as he's doing.

          
          BOONE: All of you!

          
          They do as he orders.

          
          BOONE: Stop them getting in! They'll kill the children!

          Lori turns to see Decker appearing from the darkness. He attacks
          her, cutting her arm. She backs away before he can strike a second
          time, retreating towards the gates. Then she turns and walks through
          the reeds; Decker on her heels.

          The posse led by Pettine invade the entrances to the Necropolis,
          engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Breed.

          

          219L. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Boone races through the Necropolis, finding that other posse
          members are breaking in from other sides.

          
          BOONE: They're everywhere!

          

          219M. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          The Nightbreed children hear the sound of slaughter approaching. One
          of the Breed with enormous, dark eyes, speaks.

          
          LEOPARDO: We can't stay here.

          
          NARCISSE: He told us to.

          
          LEOPARDO: He can't help us. He's too late.

          

          219N. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          We see the posse shooting Breed as they move towards the children.
          Several are entering doorways that lead underground.

          Posse enter the core, firing at anything that moves.

          

          219P. INT. BERSERKERS' CORRIDOR


          
          Lylesburg, his leg broken, is hobbling towards the Berserkers'
          chamber, as the sound of gunfire gets nearer.

          

          219Q. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Narcisse still keeps an increasingly panicked group of Breed and
          children from scattering.

          
          Pettine and two bloodied, grinning posse appear through the smoke.

          
          PETTINE: Look what we got here! A freak-show nursery school.

          
          The group back away, but two more posse members appear, one with a
          flame-thrower, another with grenades.

          
          PETTINE: Say goodnight.

          
          BOONE [from above]: Goodnight.

          
          Pettine looks up. Framed against the stars, Boone. He drops on
          Pettine breaking the man's neck. Then he and Narcisse lead the attack
          against the posse, dispatching them all.

          
          NARCISSE: What way's safe?

          
          BOONE: The west wall! But be quick! I'm going after Eigerman.

          

          219R. EXT. NECROPOLIS


          
          Leroy and Lude hide around the corner of a mausoleum. Two posse
          members are beating a Breed up with their rifle butts. Leroy heads
          out to help.

          
          LUDE: What's the plan?

          
          LEROY: The usual. You take the big guy. [he yells to the Naturals]
          Hey!

          
          They turn. Leroy raises his hands in surrender.

          
          LEROY: I wouldn't do that if I were you.

          
          1ST POSSE: Give me a good reason why not.

          
          LEROY: I'll give you two!

          
          The snakes emerge from his body.

          
          1ST POSSE: Shit!

          
          He raises his gun, but Lude flips over his head, landing behind him
          and in front of the 2nd posse member. Lude's eyes blaze.

          
          LUDE: Pretty gun.

          
          The 2nd posse member looks down at his hands. The gun is covered in
          snakes. He drops the gun. When he looks up Lude has gone. He turns
          again, backing off towards a monument. Lude is there, a living devil
          hidden amongst the carved variety. He takes hold of the man, turning
          him round and driving his horns into the man's neck. He staggers
          back, blood pouring from the opened wounds.

          
          Leroy, meanwhile, draws the 1st into an embrace. The snakes strike.
          Poisoned, the man dies.

          
          LEROY: Look at this mess.

          
          LUDE: Just like the old days.

          

          219S. EXT. NECROPOLIS


          
          Kane leads two cops through the mayhem, firing to right and left. He
          shoots a Breed against one of the mausoleums. Blood is spattered on
          his face.

          
          KANE: Look at these bastards. Fucking freaks.

          
          He wipes the blood from his face. Then he takes off his spectacles,
          and wipes the blood off them. As he does so 1st cop yelps.

          
          1ST COP: Yow!

          
          KANE: What?

          
          1st cop pulls a quill from the back of his neck.

          
          1ST COP: Where the fuck did that come from?

          
          Kane puts his spectacles back on, and sees Shuna Sassi in one of the
          mausoleums. She moves sexily in the shadows. Kane grins and starts to
          approach.

          
          2ND COP: Wait...

          
          KANE: It's just a girl...

          
          1st cop is still rubbing the back of his neck. He is looking sick now.

          
          1ST COP: I don't...feel...so...good...

          
          Kane pushes the mausoleum grille open, as the 1st cop kneels over,
          face down. The 2nd cop kneels to help him. Meanwhile,
          Kane has stepped into the mausoleum. Shuna is in the corner, her
          spines covered with the swaths of red cloth.

          
          KANE: It's OK, Baby.

          
          He lowers his gun. Outside the 2nd cop turns the 1st over. He is
          frothing at the mouth, his face blotchy and sweating.

          
          2ND COP: Oh shit! Kane!

          
          Inside again, Shuna drops her cloth and leaps at Kane. 2nd cop now
          approaches the mausoleum.

          
          2ND COP: Kane?

          
          As he reaches the threshold, Kane staggers out, his body and face
          pierced in dozens of places with Shuna's spines. He reaches for 2nd
          cop.

          
          2ND COP: Keep away from me!

          
          In panic, he fires at Kane, who falls to the ground. As the smoke
          clears a hand appears and strokes his cheek. He turns. It's Shuna. He
          screams, and falls to the ground at her feet, his arm covered in
          spines. He twitches, and dies. She drops her swath of red cloth over
          the faces of the three dead men.

          Cut to Eigerman's leering, grinning face as he fires at Breed.
          Ashberry emerges from the shadows and grabs him.

          
          ASHBERRY:. Please, you've got to stop...[takes out a pistol - points
          it) There's children down there, you're killing children!

          
          EIGERMAN: Go ahead, faggot, [pauses contemptuously] You haven't got
          the balls to pull the trigger.

          
          Eigerman snatches the gun away and pistol-whips him to the ground.
          Eigerman draws a bead on Ashberry's forehead.

          
          EIGERMAN [cont.]: Lemme show you how it's done...

          
          Nearby, Joyce sees them, draws his weapon, ready to fire at 
          Eigerman when a shadow passes over him. He ducks, his expression 
          changing from horror to wonder.

          
          ASHBERRY [eyes closed-hands clasped fervently]: Father, I am
          heartily sorry for having offended thee...

          
          EIGERMAN: Sorry, Padre. Nobody's listening...[prepares to shoot]

          
          BOONE [V.O.]: I hear you.

          
          Eigerman turns, looks and fires as Boone leaps at him. He roars,
          effortlessly picks Eigerman up and body-slams him against the wall of
          Midian.

          
          BOONE [cont.] [to Ashberry]: Get up!

          
          ASHBERRY: Don't kill me!

          
          BOONE: Run, go on! We don't like priests here.

          
          Ashberry pulls at his collar, tears it off, clings to Boone.

          
          ASHBERRY: No, no, take me, I have to see.

          
          Boone gets a sense of his commitment. He heads off. Ashberry
          follows. And, at a distance, so does Joyce.

          

          226. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Boone races through the walkways, Ashberry following. There is
          pitched hand-to-hand battle on every side. Nightbreed are prevailing
          in some; in others the mob repeats scenes from the history we
          witnessed earlier: Breed being beaten or burned to death, impaled on
          stakes. Boone assists some along the way, pulling off their
          assailants.

          Lylesburg has reached the door of the Berserkers' chamber. He puts
          the key in the lock. A shout stops him turning it. He looks towards a
          man with a laser-sight rifle.

          
          MAN: Yo!

          
          The light from the rifle plays on Lylesburg's robes.

          
          MAN: Watch the pretty light.

          
          It moves up towards Lylesburg's face, until it's centred on his
          forehead. The man fires, killing his victim. Lylesburg falls, hanging
          from the door by the key chain around his neck. His many eyes have
          opened. The man grins. Then hears a noise behind him. He turns to see
          the Ferreol Vees, creatures like Manta Rays that glide through the
          air, appearing around the corner. They swoop towards him, separating.
          The middle one opens its mouth as it strikes his face. He is
          eclipsed. When the Vees pass on down the corridor, the man's face is
          a bloody wreck. He falls to the floor, just out of reach
          of the Berserkers, who roar their frustration.

          Boone and Ashberry are on one of the walkways, which are swinging
          violently. Boone hears the Berserkers' roar, and heads towards the
          door that leads into their corridor, leaving Ashberry on the bridge,
          tears pouring down his face. Then he follows Boone. As he reaches the
          ledge he looks back to see a fabulous beast, the Mezzick-Muul, and
          its beautiful rider, Diadaria, appear. He watches, awestruck.

          Boone reaches the door. Lylesburg is dead. Boone pulls the key from
          off Lylesburg's neck, and pulls the corpse aside. Then he turns the
          key in the lock. The door opens. A rush of filthy wind emerges from
          the chamber beyond. Then the Berserkers appear: lethal brutes, all
          teeth, armour and muscle. One of them, Ghost, takes hold of Boone,
          and there's a beat when it seems certain to dispatch him.

          
          Then a burst of light from Baphomet's chamber spills over them, and
          there's a roar from their unseen God. They let Boone go, and they're
          away. Boone looks towards the chamber, then heads back towards the
          surface.

          Tommy leads a line of five posse members who have cornered a number
          of wounded Breed against one of the walls. One of the
          creatures attempts to scramble away. Tommy guns him down. He turns
          to the other gunmen.

          
          TOMMY: Watch this!

          
          The two posse members prepare to kill the Breed. The ground around
          them begins to shudder, and a fist bursts out of the ground and grabs
          the leg of a posse member and drags him down.

          
          Another fist then bursts out of the ground.

          
          Then in silhouette the Berserkers climb out of the earth beside the
          posse. Two of the posse turn, and fire at the Berserkers, who advance
          through the hail of the bullets, and quickly dispatch the two gunmen.
          Tommy has begun to fire at the feet of the cornered Breed, obliging
          them to dance.

          
          TOMMY [laughs]: Dance, fuckers!

          
          The display gets appreciative hoots and laughter from the three
          surviving posse members, who - like Tommy - are as yet unaware that
          the Berserkers are advancing on them. Tommy continues to fire at the
          ground around the Breed, as one by one his three companions are
          dispatched by the Berserkers. We close in on Tommy, whose face is
          suddenly spattered with blood. He stops firing. He looks round to
          find himself surrounded by Berserkers. The shadows fall over him.
          Their hands take hold of him.

          
          We see the shadow of what they do to him on the walls: his body is
          torn apart.

          
          We cut to the Berserkers. Ghost has Tommy's gun, with the hand still
          attached. He tosses it aside, roaring like King Kong. The wounded
          Breed hurry away as the Berserkers head off in search of
          new mischief.

          

          237. EXT. NECROPOLIS NEAR THE GATES NIGHT


          
          With the tide turning inside the Necropolis, a disorganized retreat
          is underway. Eigerman is at the gate watching the remains of his
          'army' staggering away. Joyce is watching the scene.

          
          EIGERMAN: Stand your ground! Stand your ground! They've got to come
          this way. We can mow 'em down.

          
          He climbs up on a vehicle which is parked at the gates. In the
          driving seat is Gibbs. Beside him, a woman, her face smoke-stained,
          her expression near catatonic.

          
          EIGERMAN: Gibbs?

          
          GIBBS: Sir?

          
          EIGERMAN: Lights!

          
          Gibbs switches the lights on, to pierce the smoke. Bad move. The
          illumination shows the Berserkers appearing. They approach the
          vehicle.

          
          EIGERMAN: Shit!

          
          Eigerman jumps from the vehicle, as the retreating posse fire at the
          Berserkers. It's a useless response. Bloodied but unbowed, the
          Berserkers run at the vehicles. The woman throws herself out, but
          Gibbs isn't quick enough. One of the Berserkers pushes the vehicle up
          the wall of the Necropolis, and Blatz, a small, vicious creature,
          stamps on the roof. Inside, Gibbs cowers as the roof is beaten in. He
          is crushed.

          
          Joyce, who has been watching this entire scene, moves away from the
          gate towards the Necropolis. The fires are dying down
          somewhat, and an eerie half-light bathes the scene he moves through.
          A few surviving posse hurry away, firing at every movement in the
          shadows.

          
          Back at the gate we see one of the escaping Berserkers flip another
          car over, while his brothers dispatch posse members. The survivors
          simply drop their weapons and flee.

          The dog-faced man lies dead at the door and beside him Babette, her
          face subtly bestial. Joyce hears Babette weeping; her cries hit him
          hard. He goes to her, gathers her up gently in his arms. Babette
          clings to him; he sees her arms are partially transformed into claws,
          but he keeps holding her. 

          
          Boone emerges from the depths, into the wrecked mausoleum.

          
          BABETTE: Boone...[he goes to them] Lori. She's hurt.

          
          BOONE: Where?

          Boone is tracking them, Joyce following, carrying Babette, who has a

          Chaos, and collapse. Earth is falling all around. Lori picks herself
          up and finds her way back up is blocked by debris. She has no choice
          but to cross the swaying walkways, while the air thickens with dust
          and smoke.

          
          There are only one or two Breed left alive down here, desperately
          collecting their belongings. They exit the chamber leaving the
          smoking bowls...We track towards the bowls, as the contents brighten
          and bubble.

          Lori descends a flight of stairs, to find Peloquin badly wounded at

          PELOQUIN: It's all over. I didn't believe the prophesies and now
          it's all over.

          
          LORI: What prophesies?

          
          Peloquin takes her arm.

          241B. INT. ENTRANCE TO MURAL CHAMBER NIGHT


          
          Peloquin pushes Lori ahead of him.

          
          PELOQUIN: See?

          
          We track towards the mural. Lori can barely believe her eyes. Here,
          laid out on the walls, is a whole history; and featured amongst its
          more recent additions, the face of Boone.

          
          PELOQUIN: Yes, it's him.

          
          Boone squatting in front of his fire of love letters. Boone dead in
          the reeds.

          
          PELOQUIN: All these years waiting for a saviour. But he hasn't saved
          us. He's destroyed us. I made him, and he's destroyed us.

          
          LORI: Made him?

          
          PELOQUIN: The bite was mine. The bite that mocks death.

          
          LORI: That doesn't make him yours. I belong here on this wall, just
          as much as you do. Why aren't I here?

          
          PELOQUIN: You're still a Natural. Go back while you've still got a
          life. Join your tribe.

          
          LORI: That? My tribe? Not any longer.

          
          PELOQUIN: Then die with us. It's over.

          
          Peloquin exits. Lori looks back at the images on the walls once
          more. Then she exits.

          

          242. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Boone, Joyce and Babette approach the hole where Lori fell.

          
          BABETTE: Let me down. I can't go any further.

          
          BOONE: Why not?

          
          BABETTE [looking down into the hole]: Baphomet.

          
          BOONE [to Joyce]: Take her. Run.

          
          Joyce nods and moves off with her into the smoke. As she disappears,
          Decker steps forward from the smoke.

          
          DECKER: Quite a dance, huh? Death everywhere and you and me in the
          middle. Catch!

          
          He throws the head of a Breed at Boone.

          
          DECKER: Even the dead can die!

          
          Then Decker strikes out at him, slashing at Boone's face. Boone
          falls backwards. At the last moment he catches hold of Decker,
          pulling him down into the hole and together they tumble into the
          earth.

          

          243. SCENE DELETED

          

          244. INT. MIDIAN


          
          Boone and Decker land on one of the rope bridges. Boone heads across
          it, pursued by Decker, who slashes at his neck, cutting him.

          
          DECKER: Almost!

          
          Boone falls back. Decker closes on him, the knives at his neck. The
          force of his stabs, which miss Boone's neck, break the boards of the
          bridge. Boone braces his feet beneath Decker and tosses him over.
          Decker gets up and approaches him again, slashing the ropes of the
          bridge with his blades as he comes. The fighters connect and
          struggle, their violent motion carrying them over the edge of the
          bridge, dropping them down another level. Decker lands very heavily,
          and lies still. Boone gets up. His exit along the bridge in one
          direction is blocked. He has to step past Decker who doesn't
          move. Only when Boone has stepped beyond him does Decker get up,
          pursuing Boone across the bridge, and flinging one of the
          knives at his victim's back. The blade cuts straight through Boone,
          sticking out from his chest a good six inches. He turns, his fury
          transforming him into a more extreme creature. Decker comes at Boone
          with a second blade, slashing at Boone's neck. The battle carries
          them off the bridge onto the stairs. Decker takes hold of Boone's
          hair, preparing to deliver the coup de grace. Boone reaches for a
          weapon, finds a skull, and smashes it into the mask. Decker lets go.
          Boone tumbles off the stairs, falling face down on a card table.

          
          Decker follows down the stairs. Boone pulls the table off his chest,
          leaving the Ace of Hearts on the blade in his chest. Decker follows
          through, driving Boone back into one of the Breed's rooms, where the
          fight continues. Decker takes a whip from the wall and uses it to
          disarm Boone, who has snatched up a bone to defend himself with.
          Boone snatches up a second bone and retaliates, delivering blow after
          blow against Decker, eventually knocking the knife from his hand and
          driving him out on to the ledge once more. Decker teeters on the
          edge, now defenceless. Boone approaches.

          
          BOONE: Want to dance?

          
          He snatches the mask off Decker's face and draws him close, impaling
          Decker on his own blade. Decker screams.

          
          Then Boone pushes him off the blade, and over the edge of the ledge.
          Decker falls.

          
          Boone stands on the ledge, and spits down at the corpse. As he does
          so he hears the same roar from Baphomet that called the
          Berserkers from harming him. Out of it, comes Baphomet's face.

          
          BAPHOMET [V.O.]: Boone!

          

          244A. INT. LYLESBURG'S CHAMBER


          
          The chamber is empty of life. There are two or three corpses on the
          floor. We approach the central dais, on which is perched the statue
          of Baphomet, surrounded by six white heads. Momentarily, lines of
          light break from the statue's head and strike the white heads, which
          in turn begin to glow...

          

          244B. INT. VARIOUS CHAMBERS


          
          In the chambers we've seen before we see copies of the six statues,
          in front of which are bowls of Baphomet's fluid...They begin to glow,
          the brightness building. Sparks rise from the fluid.

          

          245. INT. BERSERKERS' CORRIDOR


          
          Lori sits, exhausted, in the corridor. She looks up to see Boone,
          with the knife still transfixing him.

          
          LORI: My God...

          
          BOONE: Decker's dead. Take the knife out.

          
          Lori pulls the knife from him, and throws it down.

          
          BAPHOMET [V.O.]: Boone!

          
          LORI: Don't go...

          
          BOONE: I'm. responsible. I have to.

          
          Lori and Boone head down the corridor, passing Ashberry, who is
          standing in the shadows.

          
          Lori and Boone head down the stairs towards the chamber.

          

          246. INT. BAPHOMET'S CHAMBER


          
          Blinding light. As Boone descends into the chamber, he sees eight
          Nightbreed, surviving members of a Senior Council, Rachel among them,
          standing around Baphomet. They are wrapping severed limbs of
          Baphomet, preparing to include him in the exodus. His head and
          shoulders remain suspended in the light. Baphomet's lips move, making
          a terrible, eloquent sound. Rachel translates, the deep voice we hear
          coming from her lips.

          
          RACHEL/BAPHOMET: Come closer...

          
          Boone obeys. Baphomet's remaining arm reaches down and holds Boone,
          as Baphomet's face stares down at him.

          
          RACHEL/BAPHOMET: ...You have destroyed our refuge...

          
          BOONE: I never meant...

          
          Baphomet silences him. Boone trembles but maintains eye contact.

          
          RACHEL/BAPHOMET: This was foretold. No refuge is forever. But you
          are charged . . .

          
          BOONE: Yes...

          
          RACHEL/BAPHOMET: ...You must rebuild what you've destroyed.

          
          BOONE: Where?

          
          RACHEL/BAPHOMET: That you must find yourself. In the world above.

          
          BOONE: I don't...I don't know how...

          
          RACHEL/BAPHOMET: You shall not be alone. You will find me there and
          heal me. [holds him close] You are not Boone...

          
          And now the words emerge from Baphomet himself, shaking the chamber.

          
          BAPHOMET: ...you are Cabal!

          
          Boone/Cabal is released. Baphomet is consumed in light. The Council
          move towards him to finish their task.

          
          LORI [O.S.]: Boone?

          
          Boone/Cabal turns; Lori stands at the bottom of the slope, offering
          a hand. He takes it, they start up the slope.

          
          Cowering in a niche inside the chamber, out of sight, watching in
          wonder is Ashberry. Transfixed by Baphomet, he crosses himself.

          
          Boone/Cabal glances back. The Council receive pieces of Baphomet
          from the light wrapping his smoking fragments in
          shrouds. The light builds to its brightest level. Pieces of ceiling
          begin to fall.

          

          246A. INT. VARIOUS CHAMBERS


          
          The bowls start to explode with sparks of white light.

          

          247. INT. BELOW MIDIAN


          
          Boone/Cabal and Lori race up towards the surface, as Midian
          continues to collapse around them.

          

          248. INT. BAPHOMET'S CHAMBER


          
          Ashberry descends the stairs into the blaze of light. Tears pour
          down his cheeks.

          
          He watches as the Council prepare to take down Baphomet's head.

          
          Near to him is one of the bowls of Baphomet's light. Ashberry
          approaches it, hungry for a taste of this glory. He reaches to touch
          the bowl. As he does so Baphomet's eyes fix on him. The bowl flips in
          the air. The fluid it holds rains down on Ashberry like acid. He
          falls back, his body smoking.

          

          249. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Boone/Cabal and Lori reach the surface and race through the ruined
          Necropolis, flames all around them. And then, behind them ...

          

          250. INT. BAPHOMET'S CHAMBER


          
          The tentacles attached to Baphomet's head are detached.

          
          The blaze of light instantly begins to diminish...

          

          250A. INT. MIDIAN CORE


          
          The lights start to go out in the core, and earth begins to pour
          from the tunnels.

          
          We see it flood the various corridors, with a shuddering roar.

          

          250B. INT. BAPHOMET'S CHAMBER


          
          We glimpse Baphomet's head being covered by the Council, as the
          roars increase...

          

          CUT TO:

          

          251. EXT. OUTSIDE THE GATES NIGHT


          
          Boone/Cabal and Lori find Joyce, holding Babette, protecting her,
          near the gates.

          
          Joyce steps back from the form of Rachel, who pulls her veils around
          her and holds out her arms.

          
          RACHEL: Give me my child...

          
          Joyce looks at Lori, Boone/Cabal, at Babette and Rachel. He tenderly
          hands the child over. Rachel holds Babette and they both disappear
          into the darkness.

          
          JOYCE [to Boone/Cabal]: ...I never understood...nobody ever told me...

          
          He steps away from them and the night engulfs him.

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          252. INT. MIDIAN CORE


          
          The earth has almost obliterated the core entirely.

          

          253. EXT. OUTSIDE THE GATES NIGHT


          
          The roar ceases. Silence.

          

          254. EXT. NECROPOLIS


          
          Lori and Boone stand in the reeds as the last, bright bloom of the
          fires dies away on their faces. Figures move away through the smoke,
          creatures we recognize. The drummer beats out a tattoo as they depart.

          
          Narcisse appears from the darkness. As he does so, a final explosion
          roars up from the underground. In the smoke pillar above the site,
          Baphomet's image momentarily appears before the wind disperses it.

          
          NARCISSE: Never piss off a God.

          
          Lori looks up into the sky.

          

          CUT TO:

          
          Lori's P.O.V. of the sky, with other Breed, spirits of smoke and
          light, moving away into the night.

          
          LORI: Where are they going?

          
          NARCISSE: Any hiding place they can find. It'll be dawn soon.

          
          BOONE: When I need you where will I find you?

          
          NARCISSE: You'll find me. And you will need me.

          
          He reaches to shake Boone's hand.

          
          NARCISSE: Never touched a legend before.

          
          He laughs his manic laugh.

          
          NARCISSE [cont.] [to Lori]: Good night, pretty.

          
          He fades into the night, the laughter going with him.

          

          255. EXT. NEAR MIDIAN NIGHT


          
          In the distance, the burning ruins of Midian. The wind sighs in the
          moonlit reeds. Cabal and Lori reach the top of the hill, turn and
          look down, standing apart.

          
          CABAL: I'll have to start tonight.

          
          LORI: I'll go with you, Boone.

          
          CABAL: I'm not Boone, Lori. Do you understand? I belong to the Breed
          now.

          
          LORI: Then make me belong too; they made you one of them, you can do
          it to me...

          
          CABAL: I can't...

          
          LORI: I want to be with you.

          
          CABAL: I'll come back for you when I'm finished...

          
          LORI: And when's that gonna be, when I'm ninety and you're still the
          way you are? I went through hell to find you and you
          just, just walk away from me? [pause; broken-hearted] Well go on,
          then, just go. Go on! What more do you want? Leave me some dignity,
          for Christ's sake!

          
          Pause. She turns away, trying not to show him her pain. Cabal turns
          to go. Lori turns back, sees him going. She can't bear it, looks
          around, sees Decker's briefcase lying beside the police car. Runs to
          it, finds a knife.

          
          LORI: Boone!

          
          He turns. She puts the blade to her belly and drives it in.

          
          CABAL: Lori, NO!

          
          She cries out and sinks to the ground in terrible pain. He reaches
          her and holds her in his arms.

          
          LORI: I lied, I lied, you're all I want.

          
          CABAL: Don't die, God, Lori, don't die...

          
          LORI: Well why don't you do something about it, God damn it...
          remember what you said...[fading]...quickly...

          
          He raises her neck to his mouth. Her eyes flicker closed. He bites.
          A fatal, bloody kiss. He rises from her. Her eyes are closed.

          
          CABAL: ...too late?...Oh God, too late...

          
          Her eyes open. She's turned.

          
          LORI: You said you'd never leave me.

          
          She grins, presses up to kiss his bloodied mouth. Camera moves up
          off them to find the moon and we:

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          255A. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          We track through the ruins of the Necropolis. The walls are
          blackened by fires that are almost extinguished; corpses [human and
          Breed] lie in barely distinguishable bundles, from which partially
          cremated limbs jut. Smoke hangs in the air. From the distance we see
          Eigerman, going amongst the corpses, reclaiming guns, bullets and
          grenades. As we get closer we realize that he is a broken man, his
          face dirty, his eyes lunatic. He's been crying, the tracks marking
          the dirt.

          
          Suddenly, he hears a noise, and stands up to see a large figure
          appearing from the smoke. He goes for his own gun, levelling it at
          the figure as it approaches.

          
          EIGERMAN: Keep your distance!

          
          The figure keeps coming, emerging from the smoke. It's Ashberry. He
          has been transformed by the confrontation with Baphomet. His hair has
          been almost burned away entirely and there is a subtle
          reconfiguration in the shape of his skull. His clothes are in
          tatters. There are hints that his once broken body, poisoned by
          alcohol, has taken on new strength. He looks as insane as Eigerman,
          but stronger in his lunacy. There's a dangerous fervour in his eyes.

          
          ASHBERRY: I saw their God...I saw him...

          
          EIGERMAN: What the hell are you talking about?

          
          ASHBERRY: I can still smell him. He's out there...

          
          Ashberry walks past Eigerman towards the exit from Necropolis.

          
          EIGERMAN: You mean you can find them?

          
          ASHBERRY: Oh yes.

          
          EIGERMAN: We'll go together then. You can lead me to the bastards.
          Then I'll wipe them all away.

          
          ASHBERRY: No. They're mine. Their God burned me. I want to burn him
          back. All of them. Burn them all away.

          
          EIGERMAN: You can't, you don't have the wits ...

          
          Ashberry turns on him, his face wild. He takes hold of Eigerman by
          the neck, his fingers digging into the muscle. Blood runs. Eigerman
          tries to raise the gun but Ashberry takes hold of the man's hand, and
          summarily snaps his wrist. The gun is dropped. Ashberry starts to
          lift Eigerman up off the ground. The policeman's flailings stop
          suddenly. The head lolls. Ashberry flings the body aside, and starts
          out of the Necropolis. As he approaches the exit he looks up.
          Sunlight falls on his face.

          

          CUT TO:

          

          256. EXT. MOON NIGHT


          
          Shining, full. We move down to find a derelict barn, standing alone
          in a vast field.

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          257. INT. BARN NIGHT


          
          We track through the darkness to find Rachel, Babette, Kinski and a
          number of other refugees and children of Midian, staring out at the
          night.

          
          BABETTE: ...who will come for us?

          
          KINSKI: His name is Cabal. He unmade Midian.

          
          BABETTE: How soon?

          
          RACHEL: On the next wind. If not tonight, then tomorrow.

          
          Babette gazes out over the cornfields.

          
          BABETTE: On the next wind...

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          258. EXT. HILL NIGHT


          
          Cabal and Lori, standing on the hill, against a background of stars.

          
          BABETTE [V.O.]: ...if not tonight...tomorrow...

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          259. INT. BELOW MIDIAN NIGHT


          
          Moving through the ruined chambers, illuminated by dying flickers of
          flame, we find and track along the end of the heroic mosaic/mural. It
          tells, in a rush of images, the story of the ruin of Midian.

          
          Camera comes to a stop on the final image: Cabal and Lori, as we
          just saw them, on a hill, framed against the star-filled heavens.

          
          The sound of the wind...

          
          Fade to black.

 Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas

NARRATOR
'Twas a long time ago, longer now than it seems, in a place 
that perhaps you've seen in your dreams.  For the story that you are 
about to be told, took place in the holiday worlds of old.  Now, you've 
probably wondered where holidays come from.  If you haven't, I'd say it's 
time you begun.

JACK
Not at all Mayor.

VAMPIRE (fat)
You're such a scream, Jack

WITCH
You're a witch's fondest dream!

Ooo Jack, you make wounds ooze and flesh crawl.

MAYOR
A frightening and honorable mention goes to the fabulous Dark Lagoon leeches

SAX PLAYER
Nice work, Bone Daddy.

JACK
Yeah, I guess so.  Just like last year and the year before that and the 
year before that.

[entering graveyard] 

	Jack's Lament
	Performed by Danny Elfman

There are few who'd deny, at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night

I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet

Yet year after year, it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing

Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there, far from my home
A longing that I've never known

I'm the master of fright, and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France

And since I am dead, I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations

But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown, if they only understood
He'd give it all up if he only could

Oh, there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears

[leaving graveyard and entering forest]

SALLY
Jack, I know how you feel.  

[Sally gathers herbs]

[back at Dr. Finkelstein's castle]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Sally, you've come back.

SALLY
I had to.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
For this?

[showing her arm]

SALLY
Yes.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Shall we then.
That's twice this month you've slipped deadly nightshade into my tea
 and run off --

SALLY
Three times!

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You're mine you know!  I made you with my own hands.

SALLY
You can make other creations.  I'm restless, I can't help it.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
It's a phase my dear, it'll pass.  We need to be patient that's all.

SALLY
But, I don't want to be patient.

MAYOR
Morning gents [to the band]

MAYOR
Jack, you home?

[getting worried, switches face and knocks with desperation then switch 
back to happy face]

MAYOR
Jack?  I've got the plans for next Halloween.  I need to go over them 
with you so we can get started.  

MAYOR (with worried face)
Jack, please, I'm only an elected an official here, I can't make 
decisions by myself.  Jack, answer me!!

[falls down steps]

ACCORDION PLAYER
He's not home.

JACK
Whoa!!!!

	What's This?
	Performed by Danny Elfman

What's this? What's this?
There's color everywhere
What's this?
There's white things in the air
What's this?
I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming
Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this?
What's this? What's this?
There's something very wrong
What's this?
There's people singing songs

What's this?
The streets are lined with
Little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy?
What is this? 
What's this?

There's children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys
And absolutely no one's dead

There's frost on every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones I feel the warmth
That's coming from inside

Oh, look
What's this?
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss
Why that looks so unique, inspired
They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this?

What's this?
In here they've got a little tree, how queer
And who would ever think
And why?

They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings
And there's a smile on everyone
So, now, correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun
This looks like fun
Oh, could it be I got my wish?
What's this?

Oh my, what now?
The children are asleep
But look, there's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them
Or ensnare them, only little cozy things
Secure inside their dreamland
What's this?

The monsters are all missing
And the nightmares can't be found
And in their place there seems to be
Good feeling all around

Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies
Are absolutely everywhere

The sights, the sounds
They're everywhere and all around
I've never felt so good before
This empty place inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough

I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know
I've got to know
What is this place that I have found?
What is this?
Christmas Town, hmm...

SANDY CLAWS
Ho Ho Ho Ho ho ho ho ho

JACK
hmm..

[Halloweentown]

CLOWN
This has never happened before.

Witch
It's suspicious.

Witch (little)
It's peculiar.

VAMPIRES
It's scary.

MAYOR
Stand aside.

WEREWOLF
grrrr

MAYOR
Coming through.  We've got find Jack.  There's only 365 days left till 
next Halloween.

WEREWOLF
364!

MAYOR
Is there anywhere we've forgotten to check?

Clown
I looked in every mausoleum.

WITCHES
We opened the sarcophagi.

Hyde
I tromped through the pumpkin patch.

VAMPIRE
I peeked behind the Cyclops's eye.  I did!  But he wasn't there.

MAYOR
It's time to sound the alarms.

[DR. FINKELSTEIN's castle]

SALLY
Frog's breath will overpower any odor.  Bitter.  [coughing]  Worm's 
wart.  Where's that worm's wart?

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Sally, that soup ready yet?

SALLY
Coming....lunch

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Ah, what's that?  Worm's wart, mmm, and...frog's breath.

SALLY
What's wrong?  I-I thought you liked frog's breath.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Nothing's more suspicious than frog's breath. Until you taste it I won't 
swallow a spoonful.

SALLY
I'm not hungry... [knocking spoon]  Oops!

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You want me to starve.  An old man like me who hardly has strength as it 
is.  Me, to whom you owe your very life.

SALLY
Oh don't be silly.  [eats soup with trick spoon]  Mmmm, see.  Scrumptious.

[Dr. Finkelstein eats soup] 

[Halloween]

MAYOR
Did anyone think to dredge the lake?

VAMPIRE
Ah, this morning!

ZERO
barks

Witch
Hear that?

Witch (little)
What?

Witch
Shh!

ZERO
barks

VAMPIRE
Zero!

[fanfare as Jack and Zero arrive]

Kid
Jack's back!

MAYOR
Where have you been?

JACK
Call a town meeting and I'll tell everyone all about it.

MAYOR
When?

JACK
Immediately!

MAYOR
[in his mayor truck]
Town meeting, town meeting, town meeting tonight, town meeting tonight

[at meeting]

Clown
[giggles as he hits Sally]

JACK
Listen everyone.  I want to tell you about Christmastown.

	Town Meeting Song
	Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast

JACK
There are objects so peculiar
They were not to be believed
All around, things to tantalize my brain
It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen
And as hard as I try
I can't seem to describe
Like a most improbable dream
But you must believe when I tell you this
It's as real as my skull and it does exist
Here, let me show you

This is a thing called a present
The whole thing starts with a box

DEVIL
A box?
is it steel?

WEREWOLF
Are there locks?

HARLEOUIN DEMON
Is it filled with a pox?

DEVIL, WEREWOLF, HARLEQUIN DEMON
A pox
How delightful, a pox

JACK
If you please
Just a box with bright-colored paper
And the whole thing's topped with a bow

WITCHES
A bow?
But why?
How ugly
What's in it?
What's in it?

JACK
That's the point of the thing, not to know

CLOWN
It's a bat
Will it bend?

CREATURE UNDER THE STAIRS
It's a rat
Will it break?

UNDERSEA GAL
Perhaps it s the head that I found in the lake

JACK
Listen now, you don't understand
That's not the point of Christmas land

Now, pay attention
We pick up an oversized sock
And hang it like this on the wall

MR. HYDE
Oh, yes! Does it still have a foot?

MEDIUM MR. HYDE
Let me see, let me look

SMALL MR. HYDE
Is it rotted and covered with gook?

JACK
Um, let me explain
There's no foot inside, but there's candy
Or sometimes it's filled with small toys

MUMMY AND WINGED DEMON
Small toys

WINGED DEMON
Do they bite?

MUMMY
Do they snap?

WINGED DEMON
Or explode in a sack?

CORPSE KID
Or perhaps they just spring out
And scare girls and boys

MAYOR
What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun
I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once

JACK
Everyone, please now, not so fast
There's something here that you don't quite grasp
Well, I may as well give them what they want
And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last
For the ruler of this Christmas land
Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice
Least that's what I've come to understand

And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold
Like a lobster, huge and red
When he sets out to slay with his rain gear on
Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
That is, so I've heard it said

And on a dark, cold night
Under full moonlight
He flies into a fog
Like a vulture in the sky
And they call him Sandy Claws

Well, at least they're excited
But they don't understand
That special kind of feeling in Christmas land
Oh, well...

[Jack's house]

JACK
There's got to be a logical way to explain this Xmas thing.

[Dr. Finkelstein's castle]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You've poisoned me for the last time you wretched girl.

[locks Sally away]

[dingdong]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Oh my head...the door is open.

JACK
Hel-lo

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Jack Skellington, up here my boy.

JACK
Dr. I need to borrow some equipment.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Is that so, whatever for?

JACK
I'm conducting a series of experiments.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
How perfectly marvelous.  Curiosity killed the cat, you know.

JACK
I know.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Come on into the lab and we'll get you all fixed up.

SALLY
Hmm.  Experiments?

[Jack's house]

JACK
Zero, I'm home.

[Jack examines & experiments with Xmas stuff]

JACK
Interesting reaction....but what does it mean?

[Sally's room]

[after Sally jumps to give Jack his basket...]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You can come out now if you promise to behave.  Sally.  Sally.  Oooh!  Gone 
again!

[Jack's house]

[Sally gives Jack his basket and sneaks off and picks a flower which 
catches on fire]

	Jack's Obsession
	Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast

CITIZENS OF HALLOWEEN
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack
Don't know if we're ever going to get him back

He's all alone up there
Locked away inside
Never says a word
Hope he hasn't died
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack

JACK
Christmas time is buzzing in my skull
Will it let me be? I cannot tell
There's so many things I cannot grasp
When I think I've got it, and then at last
Through my bony fingers it does slip
Like a snowflake in a fiery grip

Something here I'm not quite getting
Though I try, I keep forgetting
Like a memory long since past
Here in an instant, gone in a flash
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though

Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door
Though I do not have the key
Something's there I cannot see
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
Hmm...

I've read these Christmas books so many times
I know the stories and I know the rhymes
I know the Christmas carols all by heart
My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart
As often as I've read them, something's wrong
So hard to put my bony finger on

Or perhaps it's really not as deep
As I've been led to think
Am I trying much too hard?
Of course! I've been too close to see
The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me

It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air
Invisible, but everywhere
Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it
 
You know, I think this Christmas thing
It's not as tricky as it seems
And why should they have all the fun?
It should belong to anyone

Not anyone, in fact, but me
Why, I could make a Christmas tree
And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmas time

I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do
Hee,hee,hee

JACK
Eureka!!  This year, Christmas will be ours!

MAYOR
Patience, everyone.  Jack has a special Job for each of us.  Dr. 
Finkelstein, your Xmas assignment is ready.  Dr. Finkelstein to the front 
of the line.

VAMPIRE
What kind of a noise is that for a baby to make?

JACK
Perhaps it can be improved?

VAMPIRES
No problem!

JACK
I knew it!  Dr. thank you for coming.  We need some of these.
[showing picture of Santa and sleigh]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Hmm.. their construction should be exceedingly simple.  I think.

MAYOR
How horrible our Xmas will be.

JACK
No--how jolly.

MAYOR
[switches face]
Oh, how jolly our Xmas will be.  [gets pelted]  What are you doing here?

LOCK

MAYOR
Jack, Jack it's Oogie's boys!

JACK
Ah, Halloween's finest trick or treaters.  The job I have for you is top 
secret.  It requires craft, cunning, mischief.

SHOCK
And we thought you didn't like us, Jack.
[giggles]

JACK
Absolutely no one is to know about it.  Not a soul.  Now--
[whispers to LS&B] 
And one more thing -- leave that no account Ooogie Boogie out of this!

Whatever you say, Jack.

Of course Jack.

	Kidnap the Sandy Claws
	Performed by Paul Reubens, Catherine O'Hara, and Danny Elfman

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws

LOCK
I wanna do it

BARREL
Let's draw straws

SHOCK
Jack said we should work together
Three of a kind

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Birds of a feather
Now and forever
Wheeee
La, la, la, la, la

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then
Turn off all the lights

SHOCK
First, we're going to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing we will
Snap the trap and close the gate

LOCK
Wait! I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for ninety years
Then see if he talks

SHOCK
Then Mr. Oogie Boogie Man
Can take the whole thing over then
He'll be so pleased, I do declare
That he will cook him rare

LOCK,SHOCK, AND BARREL
Wheeee

LOCK
I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door
And then knock three times
And when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

SHOCK
You're so stupid, think now
lf we blow him up to smithereens
We may lose some pieces
And then Jack will beat us black and green

LOCK,SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then, see if he is sad

LOCK AND SHOCK
Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around
If I were on his Boogie list, I'd get out of town

BARREL
He'll be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too, I'll bet

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew
Ummm!

We're his little henchmen and
We take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And stay on his good side

SHOCK
I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb

BARREL
I'm not the dumb one

LOCK
You're no fun

SHOCK
Shut up

LOCK
Make me

SHOCK
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good, you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide
Until his curiosity entices him to look inside

BARREL
And then we'll have him
One, two, three

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, beat him with a stick
Lock him up for ninety years, see what makes him tick
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, see what we will see
Lock him in a cage and then, throw away the key

OOGIE BOOGIE
Sandy Claws..hahaha

[city hall]

JACK
It goes something like this.  [Jingle bells]
How about it?  Think you can manage?

PERSON INSIDE BASS
a one, and a two, and a three, and a. . .

MAYOR
Next!

JACK
Fantastic!  Now why don't you all practice on that and we'll be in great 
shape.  Sally, I need your help more than anyone's.  

SALLY
You certainly do, Jack.  I had the most terrible vision.

JACK
That's splendid.

SALLY
No, it was about your Xmas.  There was smoke and fire.

JACK
That not my Xmas.  My Xmas is filled with laughter and joy and this--my 
Sandy Claws outfit.  I want you to make it.

SALLY
Jack, please, listen to me--it's going to be a disaster.

JACK
How could it be--just follow the pattern.  This part is red, the trim is 
white.

SALLY
It's a mistake, Jack.

JACK
Now don't be modest, who else is clever enough to make my Sandy claws outfit.

MAYOR
Next!

JACK

But it seems wrong to me, very wrong.

This device is called a nutcracker.

LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
Jack, Jack we caught him we caught him.

JACK
Perfect!  Open it up.  Quickly!

[opens to reveal the Easter bunny]

JACK
That's not Sandy Claws!

SHOCK
It isn't?

BARREL
Who is it?

BEHEMOTH
Bunny!

JACK
Not Sandy Claws...take him back!

LOCK
We followed your instructions--

BARREL
we went through the door--

JACK
Which door?  There's more than one.  Sandy Claws is behind the door 
shaped like this.  

[shows Xmas cookie in shape of tree]

SHOCK
I told you!

[LS&B start fighting]

JACK
Arr!!  [making scary face at LS&B]

JACK
I'm very sorry for the inconvenience, sir.  Take him home first  and 
apologize again.  Be careful with Sandy Claws when you fetch him.  Treat 
him nicely.

LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
Got it.  We'll get it right next time.

[Dr. Finkelstein's castle]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You will be a decided improvement over that treacherous Sally.

IGOR
Master, the plans.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Excellent, Igor.

SANDY CLAWS
Kathleen, Bobby, Susie, yes, Susie's been nice.  Nice, nice, naughty, 
nice, nice, nice.  There are hardly any naughty children this year.

[door chime:  jingle all the way]

SANDY CLAWS
Now who could that be?

LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
Trick or treat!

SANDY CLAWS
Huh?

[back to Halloweentown]

[to Jack in Sandy garb]

SALLY
You don't look like yourself Jack, not at all.

JACK
Isn't that wonderful.  It couldn't be more wonderful!

SALLY
But you're the Pumpkin King.

JACK
Not anymore.  And I feel so much better now.

SALLY
Jack, I know you think something's missing.  But --

[pricks Jack's finger with needle]

JACK

SALLY
Sorry

JACK
You're right, something is missing but what?  I've got the beard, the 
coat, the boots --

LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
Jack, Jack  this time we bagged him!

LOCK
This time we really did!
 
BARREL
He sure is big Jack!

SHOCK
And heavy!

SANDY CLAWS
Let me out!

JACK
Sandy Claws in person.  What a pleasure to meet you.  Why you have 
hands!  You don't have claws at all.

SANDY CLAWS
Where am I?

JACK
Surprised aren't you?  I knew you would be.  You don't need to have 
another worry about Xmas this year.  

SANDY CLAWS
What?

JACK
Consider this a vacation Sandy,  a reward.  It's your turn to take it easy.

SANDY CLAWS
But there must be some mistake!

JACK
See that he's comfortable.  Just a second fellows.  Of course, that's 
what I'm missing.  

SANDY CLAWS
But --

JACK
Thanks!  [took Sandy's hat]

SANDY CLAWS
You just can't...  Hold on where are we going now?

JACK
ho ho ho

SALLY
This is worse than I thought, much worse.  I know...

SANDY CLAWS
Me?  On vacation on Xmas eve?

BARREL
Where are we taking him?

SALLY
Where?

LOCK
To Oogie boogie, of course.  There isn't anywhere in the whole world more 
comfortable than that and Jack said to make him comfortable.  Didn't he?

SHOCK & BARREL
Yes he did.

SANDY CLAWS
Haven't you heard of peace on earth and good will toward men?

LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
No!

	Oogie Boogie's Song
	Performed by Ken Page with Ed lvory

OOGIE BOOGIE
Well, well, well, what have we here?
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oh, I'm really scared
So you're the one everybody's talkin' about, ha, ha

You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my eyes
You're jokin' me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy
He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse
I might just split a seam now
If I don't die laughing first

Mr. Oogie Boogie says
There's trouble close at hand
You'd better pay attention now
'Cause I'm the Boogie Man
And if you aren't shakin'
There's something very wrong
'Cause this may be the last time
You hear the boogie song, ohhh

THREE SKELETONS
Ohhh

OOGIE BOOGIE
Ohhh

Ohhh, he's the Oogie Boogie Man

SANTA
Release me now
Or you must face the dire consequences
The children are expecting me
So please, come to your senses

OOGIE BOOGIE
You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my ears
Would someone shut this fella up
I'm drownin' in my tears
It's funny, I'm laughing
You really are too much
And now, with your permission
I'm going to do my stuff

SANTA
What are you going to do?

OOGIE BOOGIE
I'm gonna do the best I can

Oh, the sound of rollin' dice
To me is music in the air
'Cause I'm a gamblin' Boogie Man
Although I don't play fair

It's much more fun, I must confess
With lives on the line
Not mine, of course, but yours, old boy
Now that'd be just fine

SANTA
Release me fast or you will have to
Answer for this heinous act

OOGIE BOOGIE
Oh, brother, you're something
You put me in a spin
You aren't comprehending
The position that you're in
It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got a prayer
'Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie
And you ain't going nowhere

[LS&B laughing]

you who are our glory, you who have frightened billions into an early grave.

Good bye Jack, my dearest Jack.  Oh how I hope my premonition is wrong.

	Sally's Song
	Performed by Catherine O'Hara

I sense there's something in the wind
That feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend

And does he notice my feelings for him?
And will he see how much he means to me?
I think it's not to be

What will become of my dear friend?
Where will his actions lead us then?
Although I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud
Try as I may, it doesn't last

And will we ever end up together?
No, I think not, it's never to become
For I am not the one

news folks.  The worst tragedy of our times.  Jack has been blown to 
smithereens.  Terrible, terrible news.

[back to "normal" town]

Cop
[in car]
Attention, attention citizens.  Terrible news.  There's still no sign of 
Santa Claus.  Although the impostor has been shot down, it looks like 
Xmas will have to be canceled this year.  I repeat the impostor has been 
shot down but there's still no sign ......

	Poor Jack
	Performed by Danny Elfman

What have I done? 
What have I done?
How could I be so blind?
All is lost, where was I?
Spoiled all, spoiled all
Everything's gone all wrong

What have I done?
What have I done?
Find a deep cave to hide in
In a million years they'll find me
Only dust and a plaque
That reads, 'Here Lies Poor Old Jack"

But I never intended all this madness, never
And nobody really understood, well how could they?
That all I ever wanted was to bring them something great
Why does nothing ever turn out like it should?

Well, what the heck, I went and did my best
And, by god, I really tasted something swell
And for a moment, why, I even touched the sky
And at least I left some stories they can tell, I did

And for the first time since I don't remember when
I felt just like my old bony self again
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
That's right! I am the Pumpkin King, ha, ha, ha, ha

And I just can't wait until next Halloween
'Cause I've got some new ideas that will really make them scream
And, by God, I'm really going to give it all my might
Uh oh, I hope there's still time to set things right
Sandy Claws, hmm

[Oogie lair]

SALLY
You wait till Jack hears about this.  By the time he's through with you, 
you'll be lucky if you...

THE END!
A Nightmare on Elm Street, by Wes Craven



   






                             Wes Craven's



                      A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET












1A.   INT.  (MONTAGE).                                                   1A.

      NIGHTMARE MUSIC THEME begins as we FADE UP on a SERIES OF SHOTS,
      all CLOSE and teasing.

              -- A man's FEET, in shabby work shoes, stalking
                 through a junk bin in a dark, fire-lit, ash-
                 dusted place.  A huge BOILER ROOM is what it
                 is, although we only glimpse it piecemeal.
                 Then we SEE a MAN'S HAND, dirty and nail-bitten,
                 reach INTO FRAME and pick up a piece of METAL.

              -- ANOTHER ANGLE as the HAND grabs a grimey
                 WORKGLOVE and slashes at it with a straight
                 razor, until its fingertips are off.

              -- CLOSE ON SAME HANDS dumping four fishing knives
                 out of a filthy bag.  Their blades are thin,
                 curved, gleaming sharp.

              -- MORE ANGLES, EVEN CLOSER.  We can HEAR the MAN's
                 wheezing BREATHING, but we still haven't seen
                 his face.  We never will.  We just SEE more metal
                 being assembled with crude tools, into some sort
                 of linkage -- a splayed, spidery sort of apparatus,
                 against a background light of FIRE, and a deep
                 rushing of STEAM and HEAVY, DARK ENERGY.

              -- And then we see this linkage attached to the glove.

              -- Then the BLADES attached to all of it.

              -- Then the MAN'S HAND slips into this glove-like
                 apparatus, filling it out and transforming
                 it into an awesome, deadly claw-hand with
                 four razor/talons gleaming at its blackened
                 fingertips.  Suddenly the HAND arches and STRIKES
                 FORWARD, SLASHING THROUGH a DARK CANVAS, tearing
                 it to shreds.


1.    EXT.  LOS ANGELES.  NIGHT.  (2nd Unit)                             1.

      A PULSATION OF LIGHT AND SHADOW.  MUSIC DROPS AWAY to a hushed
      RUSHING OF WIND and DISTANT SIRENS.  CAMERA RACKS INTO FOCUS on a
      HIGH PANORAMA of the San Fernando Valley, its night sky lit from
      within by a strange GREENISH LIGHT.  TITLES BEGIN.

      CAMERA TILTS DOWN and ZOOMS SWIFTLY into the valley's web of
      light.

                                                CUT TO:

     
2.    INT.  CONCRETE PASSAGEWAY.                                         2.

      TITLES CONTINUE as TINA GRAY, a strong girl of fifteen in a thin
      night shift, moves towards us down a dark concrete corridor.  Her
      steps quicken as TITLES appear in the portion of frame she leaves
      free.

      A subliminal COLLAGE of SOUND threads in and out of the MUSIC.
      Distant insane LAUGHTER.  Slamming iron DOORS.  A bleating animal
      CRY.  A LAMB, white and blank-faced, skitters across her path and
      on into the dark.  No reason why it's there.

      Then another SOUND, much nearer -- the slithering SCRAPE of
      something like fingernails across slate.  It sets our teeth on
      edge, twists the MUSIC, and sends TINA running.


3.    INT.  BOILER ROOM.                                                 3.

      Suddenly TINA's a tiny figure running among huge boilers steam
      pipes and catwalks -- a shadowed forest of iron and stone.  She
      stops, listening intently as the SOUND of tiny hooves suddenly
      turns into the rattle of DISTANT RAIN.

      Then she hears RIPPING FABRIC.

      Someone is shouldering behind a ragged screen of dirty canvas,
      approaching TINA.

      CLOSER ON THE CANVAS.  The long curved fingerblades suddenly
      punch through, flashing in the firelight, and begin ripping
      through the thick fabric, as easily as scalpels through flesh.
      They make a hideous, extended RIPPING SOUND.

      TINA rushes away, hands over her ears.

      ANOTHER ANGLE -- as the blinded girl stumbles backwards.  Then
      the canvas flaps free.  The blades are gone.  The TITLES END, and
      everything goes silent.

      CAMERA CIRCLES until TINA's looking right into our eyes.  The
      light from a nearby boiler pours through her thin night dress,
      leaving her naked and vulnerable.  Then a deep, ragged VOICE
      whispers at her as CAMERA CLOSES IN ON HER FACE.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                      One two, Freddie's coming for
                      you...

      TINA opens her mouth to scream but only a dry, yellow dust pours
      out.  And at that precise moment a huge shadowy MAN with a grimey
      red and yellow sweater and a weird hat pulled over his scarred
      face lunges at her.  And it's his fingers that are tipped with
      the long blades of steel, glinting in the boney light and giving
      the hulk the look of an otherworldly predator.

      TINA dodges away, her legs suddenly elephantine and slow.  The
      MAN seizes the trailing hem of her nightgown and hauls her back.

      The MUSIC shrieks as TINA manages to tear free -- the MAN lurches
      after her with a hoarse SHOUT as we --

                                              SMASH CUT TO:


4.    INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      4.

      TINA convulses in bed with a SCREAM, looking around wildly.
      Someone is KNOCKING on her door.

                                      WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                      You okay, Tina?

      TINA'S MOTHER sticks her head in with a worried look.  TINA sits
      up and blows out a breath, groggy.

                                      TINA
                      Just a dream, Ma...
                              (more to herself)
                      Damn dream, is all...

      The woman, once attractive, ventures a step into the room.  A MAN
      hovers BACKGROUND.  TINA'S mother waves him away without looking,
      shoving a strand of bleached hair from her eyes.  She appraises
      her daughter.

                                      TINA'S MOTHER
                      Some dream, judging from that.

      She nods at TINA's nightshift.

      TINA looks down at her nightgown, only now aware of the chill
      penetrating it from the room.  There are four long slashes up its
      middle, cleanly cut as if by scalpels.

                                      MAN (OS)
                              (distant, annoyed)
                      You coming back to the sack or
                      what?

                                      TINA'S MOTHER
                      Hold your horses.
                              (lower, to Tina as she
                               stands to leave)
                      You gotta cut your nails or stop
                      that kind of dreaming, Tina.  One
                      or the other.

      The woman shuts the door behind her.  TINA looks back to her
      nightgown.

                                      TINA
                              (low)
                      Oh, shit.

      She suddenly snatches up the cross that hangs over her head, her
      face white as her sheet.

                                              FADE TO BLACK

                                              BURN ON

5.                            THE FIRST DAY                              5.

                                      CHILDREN (OS)
                              (singing)
                      One two, Freddie's coming for you...
                      Three four better lock your door
                      Five six grab your crucifix...


6.    EXT.  HIGH SCHOOL.  DAY.                                           6.

      FADE UP ON SHOT OF this large highschool and its crowds of
      STUDENTS.  FOREGROUND, TINA climbs out of a cherry-red 1959
      Cadillac convertible with two other students, best friend NANCY
      WILSON, and Nancy's boyfriend and owner of the car, GLEN LANTZ.

      FOREGROUND several GRADESCHOOLERS are playing jump-rope, and the
      old ditty they sing continues unbroken from TINA's bedroom.

                                      ROPE JUMPERS
                      Seven eight, gonna stay up late!
                      Nine ten -- never sleep again!

7.    MOVING ANGLE FAVORING NANCY.  She's a pretty girl in a letter      7.
      sweater, with an easy, athletic stride and the look of a natural
      leader.  GLEN, holding her hand, wears one of the school's
      football jerseys; a good-natured, bright kid.  Tina's in
      mid-conversation.

                                      TINA
                              (referring to kids' song)
                      That's what it reminded me of --
                      that old jump rope song.
                              (shudders)
                      Worst nightmare I ever had.
                      You wouldn't believe it.

      Nancy nods.

                                      NANCY
                      Matter of fact I had a bad dream
                      last night myself...

      TINA turns to NANCY, but before either can say more, ROD LANE, a
      lean, Richard Gere sort in black leather and New Wave studs joins
      up with them and interupts.

                                      ROD
                              (to Tina)
                      Had a hardon this morning when
                      I woke up, Tina.  Had your name
                      written all over it.

      Tina cracks her gum with a look of withering indifference.

                                      TINA
                      There's four letters in my name,
                      Rod.  How could there be room
                      on your joint for four letters?

      The guy's stopped in his tracks.

                                      ROD
                      Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn
                      mower!

      He cuts off across the lawn.

                                      TINA
                      Rod says the sweetest things.

                                      NANCY
                      He's nuts about you.

                                      TINA
                      Yeah, nuts.

      TINA makes a face and rakes her fingernails across a tree as she
      passes.

                                      TINA (CONTD)
                              (yawns)
                      Anyway, I'm too tired to worry
                      about the creep.  Couldn't get
                      back to sleep at all.
                              (beat)
                      So what you dream?

                                      NANCY
                      Forget it, the point is, every-
                      body has nightmares once in a while.
                      No biggy.

                                      GLEN
                      Next time you have one, just
                      tell yourself that's just all
                      it is, right while you're having
                      it, y'know?  That's the trick.
                      Once you do that, you wake right
                      up.  At least it works for me.

      TINA looks at GLEN sharply.  He kisses NANCY and darts off for
      class.

                                      TINA
                      Hey!  You have a nightmare too?

      But GLEN's gone.

                                      TINA (CONTD)
                      Maybe we're gonna have the Big
                      Earthquake.  They say things get
                      weird just before that...

      BELLS ARE RINGING, and STUDENTS crowding; TINA and NANCY are
      drawn into the crush.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


8.    EXT.  A VALLEY STREET.  NIGHT.                                     8.

      ANGLE ON A MODEST HOME; no car, just a couple of BIKES in the
      drive.  Every light in the house and yard is turned on.  We HEAR
      the rock group MADNESS played at a 'No adults home' volume.


9.    INT.  TINA'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  9.

      ON GLEN, dialing.  Nancy and TINA are watching, giggling.

                                      TINA
                      I can't believe his mother let him
                      come over here.

                                      NANCY
                      Right.  Well, she didn't, exactly...

      GLEN shoves a cassette into TINA's Ghetto Blaster.

                                      GLEN
                              (to TINA)
                      See, I got this cousin who lives
                      near the airport, that it's okay
                      for me to stay with, right?  So I
                      found this sound effects tape at
                      Licorice Pizza, and...

      The phone is answered.  GLEN jerks the tone arm off the record
      with a SCRUUPT!!

                                      GLEN (CONTD)
                      Hello, Mom?
                              (pushes the 'play' button)
                      Yeah, out here at Barry's.

      A JET PLANE begins to make itself heard on the tape.  GLEN moves
      the machine closer to the phone.  It's a big plane -- sounds like
      a 747 coming in for a landing.

                                      GLEN (CONT)
                      Huh?  Yeah, noisy as usual.  Glad
                      we don't live here -- huh?  Yeah,
                      Aunt Eunice says hello.

      The Jet is SCREAMING IN now, full flaps and howling like a
      monstrous banshee.  NANCY and TINA dissolve into muffled
      giggles.

                                      GLEN (CONT)
                              (shouting over the din)
                      Right, right -- I'll call you in the
                      morning!  Right!  Huh?  Yeah, sure,
                      I, huh?...

      Suddenly the tape goes silent.  GLEN blanches.  Next moment
      another ENGINE is heard, but this one is a FORD LOTUS screaming
      by at 180 mph.

                                      GLEN (CONT)
                              (reacting to his mother's
                               reaction)
                      Uh... some kid's drag racing
                      outside, I think...

      The sound effect changes abruptly to a SPEEDING SEDAN -- and the
      ages-old SCREECH of BRAKES, last-second SCREAM and horrible
      COLLISION.  NANCY gamely tries to find the right button to turn
      it off, but misses.  There's a loud SCREEK of fast-forward mayhem
      -- Glen improvises desperately.

                                      GLEN (CONT)
                      Listen, Mom, I got to go -- I
                      think there's been an accident out
                      front -- I --

      NANCY jumps back from the cassette player -- WORLD WAR II bursts
      out at top volume -- MACHINE GUNS, HAND GRENADES, DIVING BEARCATS
      and SHOUTS of charging Huns.  GLEN makes a last-ditch dive and
      flings the cassette out of the machine.

      Blessed silence at last.

                                      GLEN (CONT)
                      Right.  I'll call the police.  No,
                      just some neighbors having a fight,
                      I guess.  I'm fine, I'm fine!
                      Call you in the morning!

      He hangs up and sags back.

                                      NANCY
                      Worked like a charm.

                                      GLEN
                      Jesus.

      TINA shoves another cassette in, and MICHAEL JACKSON'S 'THRILLER'
      blasts from the STEREO.  The kids relax, the CAMERA GLIDES PAST
      THEM TO THE WINDOW.

      The WIND is moving the bare TREE BRANCH outside.  CAMERA PANS
      BACK to the comfortably threadbare room, uneasy.  We see NANCY
      poking at a flame in the hearth as TINA comes FOREGROUND to draw
      the drapes.

                                      NANCY
                      Nice to have a fire.

                                      TINA
                      Really.  Turn 'er up a little.

      NANCY turns a nearby valve handle, and the gas fire climbs
      brightly over its artificial log.  TINA joins her, heartened.

                                      NANCY
                      Maybe we should call Rod, have him
                      come over too.  He might get jealous.

                                      TINA
                      Rod and I are done.  He's too much
                      of a maniac.

                                      GLEN
                      He should join the Marines, they
                      could make something out of him.
                      Like a hand grenade.

      TINA laughs despite herself.  NANCY brightens.

                                      NANCY
                      See?  You've forgotten the bad
                      dream.  Didn't I tell you?

      TINA shakes her head, wishing she had forgotten.

                                      TINA
                      All day long I been seeing that
                      guy's weird face, and hearing
                      those fingernails...

      NANCY looks up with a flinch.

                                      NANCY
                      Fingernails?
                              (blinks, laughing)
                      That's amazing, you saying that.
                      It made me remember the dream I
                      had last night.

      TINA looks up.

                                      TINA
                      What you dream?

                                      NANCY
                      I dreamed about this guy in a
                      dirty red and yellow sweater;
                      I dream in color, y'know; he
                      walked into the room I was in,
                      right, right through the wall,
                      like it was smoke or something,
                      and just stared at me.  Sort of
                      ...obscenely.  Then he walked
                      out through the wall on the
                      other side.  Like he'd just
                      come to check me out...

      The story has left the room deathly quiet.  Especially TINA seems
      effected.

                                     TINA
                              (quietly)
                      So what about the fingernails?

      NANCY remembers, imitating the frightful coincidence.

                                      NANCY
                      He scraped his fingernails
                      along things -- actually, they
                      were more like fingerknives or
                      something, like he'd made them
                      himself?  Anyway, they made
                      this horrible nose --
                              (imitates)
                      sssssccrrrtttt....

      TINA pales.

                                      TINA
                      Nancy.  You dreamed about the
                      same creep I did, Nancy...

      The girls stare at each other.

                                      GLEN
                      That's impossible.

      They look at him.  He looks away, as if suddenly listening.

                                      TINA
                      What?

                                      GLEN
                      Nothing.

                                      TINA
                      There's somebody out there,
                      isn't there...

                                      NANCY
                      I didn't hear anything...

      Then there's an unmistakeable SOUND.  A distinct SCRAPING against
      the house, just outside the window.  Something multiple, thin and
      sharp.  Something like metal fingernails.  NANCY's mouth opens a
      fraction of an inch.


10.   EXT.  FRONT OF HOUSE.  NIGHT.                                      10.

      CLOSE ON FRONT DOOR as a BOLT UNLOCKS, a KEY TURNS, a CHAIN is
      REMOVED.  At last the door swings open and GLEN swaggers out.

                                      GLEN
                      I'm gonna punch out your ugly
                      lights, whoever you are.

      No answer but a slight RUSTLE in the bushes.  GLEN does a 180 and
      walks right back inside.  The girls prod him right back out,
      giddy with giggling fear.

                                      GLEN
                      It's just a stupid cat.

                                      NANCY
                      Then bring us back its tail
                      and whiskers.

      The girls push him farther.  GLEN edges towards the shadows.
      Then the SCRITCHING again.  GLEN stops; TINA edges back into the
      house.

                                      TINA
                      Anyway, I don't have a cat...

      ANGLE INTO THE SHADOWS.  Turned from the girls, GLEN sobers,
      listening.  IN HIS POV we see the street.  Silent houses.
      Motionless trees on empty lawns.

                                      GLEN
                      Kitty-kitty?  Chow chow chow?

      Not a living, or dead, soul.  GLEN turns back to the girls with a
      shrug.  Instantly, a large FIGURE pounces and throws him to the
      ground with a shout.

      The girls SCREAM in panic and run for the house.

11.   REVERSE -- ROD leaps up and shouts like a sportscaster --          11.

                                      ROD
                      And it's number thirty-six, Rod
                      Lane, bringing Lantz down just
                      three yards from the goal with a
                      brilliant tackle!  And the fans
                      go wild!

      ROD dances into the light, flashing a wild gypsy's grin at TINA.
      The girl's relieved and frightened at the same time.

                                      TINA
                      What the hell you doing here?

                                      ROD
                      Came to make up, no big deal.
                      Your ma home?

                                      TINA
                      Of course.  What's that?

      ROD takes the spindly hand rake he's found and scraps the house's
      wall.  It makes a terrible SCRIIITCHING SOUND.  He grins and
      tosses it aside.

                                      ROD
                      Intense, huh?
                              (sizes up the three)
                      So what's happening, an orgy or
                      something?

                                      GLEN
                      Maybe a funeral, you dickhead.

      ROD wheels, a knife suddenly in his hand, as if ready to take
      Glen's throat out.  NANCY breaks between --

                                      NANCY
                      -- Just a sleep-over date, Rod.
                      Just Tina and me.  Glen was just
                      leaving.

      ROD eyes GLEN, laughs and flips the knife closed and away,
      putting his arm around TINA's shoulder and laughing as if it's
      all a great joke.

                                      ROD
                      You see his face?
                              (lower)
                      Your ma ain't home, is she?
                              (to Nancy & Glen)
                      Me and Tina got stuff to discuss.

      He pulls TINA inside without further ceremony.

                                      NANCY
                      Rod...

      But ROD's already got himself and TINA halfway through the living
      room, heading into the darker part of the house.

                                      ROD
                      We got her mother's bed.
                      You two got the rest.

      ANGLE BACK ON GLEN AND NANCY.

                                      NANCY
                      We should get her out of here...

      TINA darts to the front door, her blouse half out.

                                      TINA
                      Hey -- you guys're hanging around --
                      right?
                              (fake laughing/whine)
                      Don't leave me alone with this
                      lunatic -- Pleeeeze, NANCY!

      She disappears.  GLEN looks at NANCY.  Too innocent.

                                      GLEN
                      So we'll guard her together.
                      Through the night.
                              (moving closer)
                      In each others' arms like
                      we always said.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen.  Not now.  I mean,
                      we're here for Tina now,
                      not for ourselves.

      She kisses him lightly, then pushes him back.

                                      GLEN
                              (frustrated)
                      Why's she so bothered by a
                      stupid nightmare, anyway?

                                     NANCY
                      Because he was scary, that's
                      why.

                                     GLEN
                      Who was scary?

      NANCY turns and looks at him.

                                     NANCY
                      Don't you think it's weird, her
                      and me dreaming about the same
                      guy?
                              (GLEN looks away;
                               NANCY stares closer)
                      You didn't have a bad dream
                      last night, did you?

      GLEN gives her a funny look.

                                      GLEN
                      Me?  I don't dream.

      He takes her inside.  Over the SOUNDS of locks falling shut we

                                              FADE TO BLACK


13.   INT.  TINA'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  13.

      FADE UP ON an old 50's CLOCK, one of those set into the black
      plaster body of a stalking panther.  It's just past 2 AM.

      PAN the cold hearth and darkened living room to REVEAL GLEN on
      the couch, cacooned in sheets.  He's listening miserably to the
      SOUNDS OF LOVEMAKING coming from the next room.  TINA peaks, ROD
      howls.  Then silence.

                                      GLEN
                      Morality sucks.

                                                      CUT TO:


14.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                             14.

      This is a slightly larger room than TINA's.  Adult.  Female.
      Spare in its appointments.  The streetlight throws the narrow bed
      into broken shadow and light.  TINA AND ROD lie in each other's
      arms in the middle of the big bed.  Satiated.

                                      TINA
                      I knew there was sometihng
                      about you I liked...

      ROD yawns into the pillows, happy.

                                      ROD
                      You feel better now, right?

                                      TINA
                      Jungle man fix Jane.

                                      ROD
                      No more fights?

                                      TINA
                      No more fights.

                                      ROD
                              (sleepily)
                      Good.  No more nightmares for
                      either of us then.

      He pulls the covers over his head.  He's almost out already.

                                      TINA
                              (beat)
                      When did you have a nightmare?

                                      ROD
                              (under the blankets)
                      Guys can have nightmares too,
                      y'know.  You ain't got a corner
                      on the fucking market or something.

      He rolls over, practically snoring, and pulls another cover over
      his head.  A dirty red and yellow cover.

                                      TINA
                              (sleepily)
                      Where'd you get this snotty old
                      thing?

      SNORES from ROD.  TINA yawns, turns off the light and snuggles
      against ROD, pulling the cover gingerly over herself, too.


15.   INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT                                       15.

      CAMERA MOVES across the room of the original nightmare to find
      NANCY alone in TINA's bed, staring at the slanting ceiling above
      the bed.  Thinking.  We can just hear her HEART beating.  She
      sighs and turns on her side.

      Immediately the wall above her head turns a faint reddish hue,
      with a broad yellow smear across its center.  All unseen by
      NANCY, the wall begins to pulse in exact time with her heart's
      beat.

      CLOSE ON NANCY'S FACE.  She closes her eyes.

      ANGLE BACK UP ON THE CEILING JUST ABOVE HER HEAD.  SOMETHING
      presses against the surface from the inside.  The plaster buldges
      out as if suddenly elastic, taking the shape of the thing
      pressing from inside -- taking the shape of a man's face.  The
      face opens its mouth.  The knives rake through the surface.

      ANGLE ON NANCY -- as plaster dust snows down on her.

      She jerks awake, sitting bolt upright.  The face retracts
      suddenly -- the wall is normal.

      ANGLE DOWN ON NANCY as she looks up to the ceiling, touching her
      hair and feeling the plaster dust.

      REVERSE IN HER POV TO THE CEILING.  There are three parallel cuts
      in the plaster there.  About eight inches long.  As if cut by
      sharp knives.  Nothing else.

      Back on NANCY.  She draws the covers around her and shivers.
      Eyes wide open.


16.   EXT.  TINA'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                                        16.

      Not a car or person in sight.  A stricken breeze dies in the
      trees.

17.   ZOOM IN on the window of the room where TINA sleeps.  By the time  17.
      we're FULL IN CLOSE on it, the air is again still as death.  A
      moment later a PEBBLE bounces off the pane.  The NIGHTMARE THEME
      appears in the lower registers and holds its breath.

      Another PEBBLE strikes, with a sharper RAP.


18.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                             18.

      CLOSE ON TINA'S FACE as her eyes open.

19.   REVERSE IN HER POV.  Another PEBBLE clatters off the glass.        19.

20.   TINA raises slowly.                                                20.

                                      TINA
                      ROD...

      SNORES FROM ROD.  TINA sits up.

      PAST HER TO THE WINDOW.  The WIND MOVES AGAIN; the trees brush
      the window with their shadows.  Then another pebble.  RAP!  TINA
      slips to the window.


21.   EXT.  TINA'S BACKYARD.  NIGHT.                                     21.

      She looks out on an old yard with a patch of bananna trees
      rattling in the Santa Ana winds.  It seems deserted, though the
      welling dark won't let her be sure.  Then another pebble -- PAP!

      -- hitting with a sharp RACK FOCUS.

22.   A LOW ANGLE TO WINDOW as TINA jumps back, startled.  She hadn't    22.
      seen that one coming.  But she's drawn back to the glass out of
      curiousity, straining to see in the dark.  It's as if the stones
      are materializing out of thin air.


23.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                23.

      WHAP!  This time a heavier stone, and a thin crack bristles
      across the glass.

                                      TINA
                              (low)
                      Who the fuck you think you are,
                      whoever you are?


24.   EXT.  TINA'S BACK YARD.  NIGHT.                                    24.

      WIDE ANGLE ON THE REAR OF THE HOUSE.  A LIGHT COMES ON.  TINA
      appears in the doorway.

                                      TINA
                              (listening)
                      Somebody there?

      She can see through the backward to a yawning gate and the back
      alley.  No one there.  But a word is spoken, as if by wind.

                                      VOICE
                              (garbled)
                      Tina.

      TINA straightens, unable to swallow.  There's a ragged, obscene
      GIGGLE.  Deep in the throat.  Phlegmy.

                                      TINA
                      Who the hell is that?

      TINA charges across the yard and through the gate, the MUSIC
      chasing after.


25.   EXT.  A SERVICE ALLEY.  NIGHT.                                     25.

      She brakes in the middle of the alley and whirls around.
      Listening.  Shivering in the same thin slashed nightgown.

      A sharp crank of METAL, and fifty feet down the alley the lid of
      an ash can rolls from the dark like a huge tin coin and spirals
      noisily down.

26.   LOW REVERSE ACROSS LID TO TINA.  Despite herself she comes over    26.
      and touches it.  She comes up with long worms on her fingers.

      Next moment the exact same shambling MAN from her nightmare
      staggers into view fifty feet behind her.  TINA falls back into
      the shadows, shaking the worms off her fingers in repulsion.  The
      MAN turns and starts directly for her, something shining on his
      right hand as he spreads his arms wide.  He starts scraping the
      steel FINGERNAILS along a cinderblock wall.  Orange sparks spurt
      out -- his arms elongate until they reach from one side of the
      alley to the other -- and TINA is cut off from her home!

      CLOSE ON HER as the SCRAPING of the blades gets louder and
      closer.  She begins to shake uncontrollably.

                                      TINA
                      Oh, shit, please God...

                                      KILLER
                              (softly, approaching)
                      This is God...

      He holds up his steel-tipped hand like a surgical-steel spider.
      TINA runs for her life.

27.   WIDER ANGLE IN THE ALLEY -- a terrifying, all-out footrace         27.
      between the girl and her pursuer.  The MAN is fast; the distance
      between them closes with each heartbeat.  TINA overturns ashcans
      -- claws her way through a rotten back fence, hammers against a
      window.  Ashen FACES appear, recoil, pull curtains closed and
      disappear in fright.


28.   EXT.  TINA'S STREET.  NIGHT.                                       28.

      TINA runs out onto front lawns, SCREAMING for help.  No help
      comes.  In fact, the only response is for all the porch lights on
      the block to be turned off.  The MAN roars out from behind a tree
      -- a tree too narrow to have hidden him -- nearly upon the girl!
      TINA runs in panic -- at last making her own home, only to be
      trapped against its locked front door.

      She hammers against its thick wood.

                                      TINA
                      Nancy!  Open the door -- Nancy!

      The MAN slows.  He has TINA now and knows it.

                                      MAN
                      She's still awake.  Nancy can't
                      hear you.

      TINA turns and looks full at the approaching MAN.  Smudged by
      deep shadow, he's big and hideous.  He wears the same dirty
      yellow sweater from the first nightmare -- from the wall-hanging
      and blanket too -- and has the same sagging hat and leering grin
      over his misshapen face.  And on his fingers are the steel
      talons.

29.   CLOSE ON HIM as he takes the blade on the end of his right index   29.
      finger and lopes off one of the fingers of his left hand.  Then
      another.  We SEE the PIECES OF FINGERS fall past TINA'S face in
      SLOW MOTION.

      ANGLE ON THE GROUND of the FINGERS squirming on the ground, one
      flopping onto TINA's naked foot.

      TINA leaps back, sickened, and begins stamping on then as if they
      were huge bugs.

      The MAN snaps up his arm and the FINGERS fly back into place on
      his hand.  He leers at TINA -- then suddenly lunges at her,
      sweeping with his cutting hand!

      TINA's no weak sister -- blocks his arm, deflecting the spines,
      and grabs the MAN's ugly face with her other hand.  But the face
      only slides off to the bone.  The MAN presses in, and TINA
      contorts in horror as the knives slash across her shoulder --
      cutting her deeply.

29A.  TINA staggers backward, GROANING, her foot now inexplicably        29A.
      caught in bedclothes!  She falls over her bed's conformter, twists
      away from the man and, like a child, pulls the cover over her!
      The skull-faced MAN crushes down, and there's a fierce grappling
      -- punctuated by his GRUNTS and the girl's DEAFENING SCREAMS --
      and they both become totally wrapped in the comforter -- until
      they're beneath it, fighting for life and death.


30.   INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      30.

      ROD lurches up into CLOSE UP in the lightless bedroom,
      half-awakened by the tremendous struggle somewhere, somehow
      inside the dark bed.  ROD grabs groggily, lifting the blanket.

30A.  IN HIS POV we glimpse the dark underside of the blanket -- see     30A.
      TWO SHADOWY FIGURES flailing and clawing under the bedspread --
      TINA and the MAN -- or a shape that could be a man -- raging
      against each other.

      ROD drops the blanket and leaps from the bed, scared full awake
      and terrified.  Then the horrible TINA's GASPS change to the
      CRIES of a terribly wounded victim.  ROD instantly jerks back the
      bedspread.

      IN HIS POV we SEE TINA struggling and flailing along on the
      sheets, the MAN nowhere in sight.

                                      ROD
                      T-tina!?

      Suddenly TINA -- eyes turned inward to her tormentor -- give an
      awful jolt -- her arms and legs are spraddled as if by
      overwhelming force and pinned to the bed.  Next instant, her
      nightgown flies apart and four long gashes chase across her
      torso.  From no visible instruments!  A huge irrigation of blood
      floods the bed.

      Terrified, ROD dives for the light -- but at the same moment
      something invisible grabs TINA, wielding her body in the air and
      bringing it around in a swift blow that knocks ROD crashing into
      the light -- smashing it to bits.

31.   CLOSER ON HIM as he struggles around.  In the blue FLASHES OF      31.
      ELECTRICITY ROD sees TINA sliding up the bedroom wall in a dark
      smear, dragged feet first!

      ANGLE ON ROD -- paralized by terror!

      ANGLE ON TINA'S DYING EYES -- moving with her up the wall and
      bumping around the corner onto the ceiling.  She's just looking
      at who's dragging her, eyes glazing.

      REVERSE IN HER POV -- to the shadowy, horrendously ugly MAN,
      dragging her with fierce glee across the ceiling, literally
      swabbing the ceiling with her bloody body.  SEEN in FORCED
      PERSPECTIVE, the SHOT carries her across a great distance without
      seeming to get anywhere -- as if the ceiling is an endless
      plane.

      ANGLE DOWN ON ROD -- on his hands and knees -- the lamp next to
      him blurting blue SPARKS and STROBING the nightmare room.  ROD'S
      screaming up at TINA'S invisible tormentor.

                                      ROD
                      What the hell's going ON here!
                      Tina!

      ANGLE ON TINA -- upside down, clawing at the hanging swag lamp
      above her mother's dressing table -- desperate for some anchor.
      But she's dragged away from it.  The lamp swings back, it's wires
      gushing more SPARKS.

      CLOSER along the ceiling as TINA rakes a long furrow in the
      ceiling with her fingernails.  But her eyes are glazing,
      glazing.  And then they fall closed.

      WIDE, UP ON THE CEILING, as her body suddenly flops loose,
      hanging for an awful moment by the feet over the bed.

      REVERSE ON ROD -- staring like a terrified child.

                                      ROD
                      Tina --

      REVERSE IN HIS POV -- as the body falls like a sack of rocks onto
      the devastated bed, in SLOW MOTION, striking with a huge splash
      of blood.  A sick, awful GIGGLE floats around the room, then
      ECHOES off into infinity.  ROD staggers up, staring around as if
      hoping to see this phantom.

                                      ROD
                      You motherfucker!  I'll kill you
                      for that!


32.   INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      32.

      NANCY is sitting straight up in bed, terrified.  The CRIES of ROD
      are ringing through the whole house.  She forces herself to move
      -- bolting from the bed despite her terror and sense of dread.


33.   INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             33.

      NANCY flies into the dark hall -- crashing directly into SOMEONE
      who lurches out of the dark before her.  She SCREAMS and jumps
      back --

                                      GLEN
                      What the hell's going on!?

                                      NANCY
                      Oh -- jeez -- Glen!  Rod's
                      gone ape!

                                      ROD (OS)
                              (sobbing)
                      I'll kill you!

      NANCY grabs the door; it's locked; she pounds on it.  BAM! BAM!
      BAM!

      Things fall into sudden, awful silence on the other side.  GLEN's
      voice cracks with fear.

                                      GLEN
                      Rod?
                              (silence)
                      Rod, you better not hurt Tina...

      ROD erupts into terrible HOARSE LAUGHTER AND SOBBING.  Then they
      hear BREAKING GLASS.

      GLEN barrels into the door like the football player he is.  The
      frame splinters and they're in.


34.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                             34.

      Just inside the door NANCY slips and goes down hard.  GLEN finds
      her in the dark more by touch than sight.

                                      GLEN
                      You okay?

                                      NANCY
                      Yeah.  Something slippering all
                      over here...
                              (feeling)
                      Tina?

      No answer.  The room is quiet as a tomb.  Except for a stead
      DRIPPING, from all over.  Then GLEN finds a LIGHT SWITCH.

      On the CLICK the devastation is revealed.  There's BLOOD
      everywhere: up the walls, over the clawed ceiling, soaking the
      killing floor of the bed, and pooling in the dark red puddle
      where NANCY has slipped and fallen.

                                      GLEN
                      Oh, shit...

      NANCY wobbles up and sees TINA in the center of the ravaged bed.
      Unmistakeably and utterly dead.  NANCY presses against the wall,
      then contorts and chokes.

                                      GLEN (CONTD)
                              (numb)
                      I...I'm gonna call the cops --

      He bursts from the room.

35.   TIGHT ON NANCY.  She turns away from the body in repulsion,        35.
      sticking her head through the shattered window ROD LANE used for
      his escape, sucking in the cold night air and moaning.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


36.   EXT/INT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                  36.

      FADE UP ON RED LIGHTS and SIREN as an unmarked POLICE CAR speeds
      to the curb.

      LT DON THOMPSON, a decent-looking man in his mid-40's, exits and
      punches a cigarette from his pack.  His shaken aide, a uniformed
      patrolman named PARKER, greets him.  (CAMERA FOLLOWS them from
      the car straight into the station and eventually to THOMPSON'S
      OFFICE.)

                                      PARKER
                      Lieutenant Thompson.  Sorry to
                      wake you, but --

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      I'd've canned your ass if you
                      hadn't.  What you got?

      PARKER stumbles to open the door for THOMPSON as the man bulls
      into the station at a furious pace.

                                      PARKER
                      Her name was Tina Gray.  It
                      was her home.  Father abandoned
                      ten years ago, mother's in
                      Vegas with a boyfriend.  We're
                      trying to reach her now.

      LT THOMPSON grimaces as if he knows the story.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      What's the Coroner got to say?

                                      PARKER
                      Something like a razor was
                      the weapon, but nothing
                      found on the scene.

      THOMPSON is already to the desk officer SERGEANT GARCIA.  The big
      MAN shoves him a sheaf of papers --

                                      SERGEANT GARCIA
                              (wary)
                      Leautenant.  You know who --

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Where is she?

                                      SERGEANT GARCIA
                      I put her in your office...

      PARKER scurries after.

                                      PARKER
                      Looks like her boyfriend did
                      it.  Rod Lane.  Musician type,
                      arrests for brawling, dope --

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Terrific.  What the hell was
                      she doing there?

                                      PARKER
                      She lived there.

                                      LT THOMPSON
OMIT 37.              I don't mean her --                           OMIT 37.

38.   INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  38.

      THOMPSON enters his office and confronts NANCY and her mother,
      MARGE SIMSON.

                                      LT THOMPSON (CONTD)
                      I mean you.
                              (accusingly, to Marge)
                      What the hell was she doing there?

      MARGE SIMSON is in her middle thirties; a good-looking woman
      despite the hour and circumstances.

                                      MARGE
                      Hello to you, too, Donald.

      THOMPSON stops, the steam suddenly out of him.  The girl is a
      wreck and he winces to see it.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Marge.

      THOMPSON glances at PARKER and the other UNIFORMED COPS who are
      in the room.  As a man they head for the door.  There's no
      question who the boss is here.  THOMPSON turns to NANCY.  She
      fumbles a smile.

                                      LT THOMPSON (CONTD)
                      How you doing, pal?

                                      NANCY
                      Okay.  Hi, dad.

      NANCY's dress is dark with dried blood, her skin clammy and the
      color of paste.  MARGE shoots her ex-husband a worried glance.
      THOMPSON pulls a chair close to NANCY.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      I don't want to get into this now,
                      god knows you need time.
                              (hotter)
                      But I'd sure would like to know
                      what the hell you were doing
                      shacked up with three other kids
                      in the middle of the night --
                      especially a delinquent lunatic
                      like Lane.

      NANCY weaves.

                                      NANCY
                      Rod's not a lunatic.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      You got a sane explanation for
                      what he did?

      The girl is shredding a Kleenex, staring off.

                                      MARGE
                      Apparantly he was crazy jealous.
                      Nancy said they'd had a fight,
                      Rod and Tina.

                                      NANCY
                              (quietly)
                      It wasn't that serious...

                                      MARGE
                      Maybe you don't think murder's
                      serious --

      NANCY sits bolt upright in her chair, her eyes flashing.

                                      NANCY
                      She was my best friend!  Don't
                      you dare say I don't take her
                      death seriously!
                              (lower, near tears)
                      I just meant their fights
                      weren't that serious.

      The girl holds the woman's eyes a moment, then looks away.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                              (to herself)
                      She dreamed this would happen...

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      What?

                                      NANCY
                      She had a nightmare about somebody
                      trying to kill her, last night.
                      That's why we were there; she was
                      afraid to sleep alone.

      A tear splashes off the arm of her chair.

                                      MARGE
                      She's been through enough for one
                      night.  You have her statement.

      The mother and daughter rise; THOMPSON raps on the door and
      PARKER opens it.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                              (to MARGE)
                      I suggest you keep a little better
                      track on her -- she's still a kid,
                      y'know.

      MARGE wheels on him.

                                      MARGE
                      You think I knew there were boys
                      there!?  You try raising a
                      teenager alone.

      Then she and the girl are gone.  THOMPSON glares at PARKER.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                               (low to PARKER)
                      See they get home okay.

      PARKER shoves his hands in his pockets.  ON HIS FACE we

                                              FADE TO BLACK


39.   INT.  NANCY'S KITCHEN.  MORNING.                                   39.

                                              BURN ON

                              THE SECOND DAY

      FADE UP ON MARGE SIMSON opening a new bottle of gin, pouring
      herself a careful shot, drinking it, then chasing it with
      coffee.  Nearby a TV drones the morning news.  We can't yet see
      the SCREEN.

                                      TV NEWSCASTER (OS/FILTER)
                      In the headlines this morning --
                      a local teenage girl was brutally
                      murdered during an all-night party.

      MARGE TURNS, startled, seeing NANCY coming downstairs.

      The girl looks a little better than she did in the Police
      Station, but her eyes are still red-rimmed, and a vacant stress
      masks her face.  She looks to the TV.  Stops.

                                      TV NEWSCASTER (CONTD)
                      Police say the victim, fifteen-year
                      -old Christina Grey, had quarrelled
                      earlier with her boyfriend, Rod
                      Lane, a punk rocker with a history
                      of delinquency.  Lane is now the
                      subject of a city-wide manhunt.
                      According to --

39A.  The TV PICTURE has begun featuring a HANDHELD NEWSREEL SHOT of a
      dark rubber BODY BAG being carried to a CORONER'S VAN.  Just
      before the thing is lifted inside, TINA'S bloodied, white ARM
      slips from its zippered side and lolls into the dark night air.
      A man rudely shoves it back inside and pulls the zipper up the
      rest of the way.

39B.  WIDER -- as NANCY pales visible.  MARGE darts to the TV and slaps
      it off, then turning to NANCY.  She looks at the girl a moment,
      then goes to her and hugs her.

                                      MARGE
                              (kind)
                      Where you think you're going?

                                      NANCY
                      School.

                                      MARGE
                      I could hear you tossing and
                      turning all night, kiddo.  You've
                      no business going to school.

      NANCY pulls away, determined.

                                      NANCY
                      I gotta go to school, Mom.
                      Please.  Otherwise I'll just
                      sit up there and go crazy
                      or something.

      MARGE studies her face a moment.

                                      MARGE
                      Did you sleep?

                                      NANCY
                      I'll sleep in study hall, promise.
                      I'd rather keep busy, you know?

      She absently drains the woman's coffee cup -- then pecks her
      cheek.

                                      MARGE
                      Right home after.

                                      NANCY (cont'd)
                      Right home after.  See you.

      MARGE watches the girl disappear outside, then lights a cigarette
      from the one already burning in her fingers.


40.   EXT.  STREET.  DAY.                                                40.

      MUSIC slips back in, subtle but tense as we TRACK with NANCY as
      she walks alone down a sidewalk edged with thick flowering
      Oleander.  She cocks her head, puzzled, as if sensing something.
      MUSIC mounts.  NANCY looks across the street.

40A.  REVERSE IN HER POV.  A MAN is over there in dark clothes, reading  40A.
      a newspaper, but really watching her.

40B.  NANCY shrugs and continues on, then stops and looks back again.    40B.

40C.  IN HER POV we SEE the MAN is gone.                                 40C.

40D.  Next moment -- with a MUSIC STING -- a BLOODIED HAND jumps out     40D.
      from the opposite direction, clamps over NANCY'S mouth and drags
      her into the bushes.


41.   EXT.  BUSHES.  DAY.                                                41.

      NANCY struggles, twisting against the powerful assailant.

      A WIDER ANGLE REVEALS ROD LANE -- barefoot, clad only in jeans
      and leather jacket, still caked with dark blood.  The rest of his
      skin is pale as a ghost's.

                                      ROD
                      I'm not gonna hurt you.

      He releases her warily.  NANCY makes no move to run or scream,
      even though several STUDENTS pass on the nearby sidewalk.  This
      reassures ROD just a little.

                                      ROD
                      Your old man thinks I did it,
                      don't he?

                                      NANCY
                      He doesn't know you.
                              (eyeing the blood)
                      Couldn't you change?

                                      ROD
                      The cops were all over my house.
                              (shivers)
                      They'll kill me for sure.

                                      NANCY
                      Nobody's gonna kill you.

      He runs his hands down his face, trying to believe that.  The two
      study each other.

                                      ROD
                      I never touched her.

                                      NANCY
                      You were screaming like crazy.

      NANCY says this without accusation, just cool observation.

                                      ROD
                      Someone else was there.

                                      NANCY
                      The door was locked from your
                      side.

      ROD grabs her hard.  His muscular body tenses.

                                      ROD
                      Don't look at me like I'm some
                      kind of fucking fruitcake or
                      something, I'm warning you.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                      Morning, Mr. Lane.

42.   The boy jerks around.  NANCY's father, his .38 leveled right at    42.
      ROD's belly, eases out of the bushes.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Now just step away from her, son.
                      Like your ass depended on it.
                      I'm warning you.

      ROD backs away, looking once at NANCY with a look of terrible
      sadness.  Then he dives out of the bushes and runs like hell.

      THOMPSON snaps his revolver to fire -- but instinctively NANCY
      jumps between --

                                      NANCY
                      No!

      THOMPSON jerks his gun into the air, furious.

                                      THOMPSON
                      Jesus -- are you crazy!?

      He plunges past the girl.


42A.  EXT.  STREET.  DAY.                                                42A.

      ROD races like a frightened animal across the lawns -- but is
      soon cut off by the PLANECLOTHESMAN NANCY saw watching her before
      -- and then TWO UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, who close from another
      angle.  The chase is short and pitifully off-balance, and ROD is
      soon wrestled to the ground.  Next moment one of the cops is
      holding ROD'S knife into the air for THOMPSON to see.  THOMPSON
      looks at NANCY, as if to say 'I told you.' Background, ROD'S
      SHOUTS can be heard as he's shoved into a SQUAD CAR.

                                      ROD (O.S.)
                      I didn't do it -- !
                              (fading)
                      I didn't kill her, Nancy!

      The car's door slams and ROD is gone.  NANCY turns to her father,
      livid.

                                      NANCY
                      You used me, daddy!

                                      LT THOMPSON
                              (exasperated)
                      What the hell you doing going to
                      school today, anyway -- your
                      mother told me you didn't even
                      sleep last night!

      NANCY spins angrily and walks away.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Nancy!  Hey!

      But she just keeps going.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


43.   INT.  CLASSROOM.  DAY.                                             43.

      FADE UP ON an ENGLISH TEACHER and CLASS, NANCY among the kids,
      trying to concentrate.

                                      TEACHER
                      According to Shakespeare, there
                      was something operating in Nature,
                      perhaps inside human nature itself,
                      that was rotten -- a canker, as
                      he put it.

      The TEACHER'S eyes glance across the room.  ANGLE ON NANCY;
      yawning but listening.

                                      TEACHER (CONTD)
                      Of course Hamlet's response to
                      this, and to his mother's lies,
                      was to continually probe and
                      dig -- just like the gravediggers --
                      always trying to get beneath the
                      surface.  The same was true in a
                      different way in Julius Caesar.
                      Jon, go ahead...

      She nods to a SURFER who's been waiting uncomfortably in front of
      the class.  He squints at his book and begins, the recitation a
      struggle between baked and salted brain and the poetry of the
      Bard.

                                      SURFER
                              (reading aloud)
                      Uh, In the most high and palmy
                      state of Rome...

                                      WISEGUY STUDENT (O.S.)
                      California's the most high and
                      palmy state, man.

      The SURFER halts with a grin; KIDS snicker.

                                      ENGLISH TEACHER
                      Can it.

      She glares them back into silence.  The SURFER starts over, as we
      CUT TO NANCY.

      She's nodding off now, barely able to keep her eyes open in the
      warm, close boredom of the classroom.

                                      SURFER (O.S.)
                      In the most high and palmy state
                      of Rome, a little ere the mightiest
                      Julius fell...
                              (NANCY's head pitches
                               forward; she jerks it
                               back up, barely awake)
                      The graves stood tenantless, and
                      the sheeted dead did squeak and
                      gibber in the Roman street...

44.   NANCY's head has sunk again, eyelids drawn as if by enormous       44.
      weight.  By the time her cheek's against the desk, the SURFER'S
      VOICE is ECHOED and DISTANT.  But another voice, TINA'S, is very
      near, very much present.  A sad, thin plaint.

                                      TINA (O.S.)
                      Nancy.

      NANCY gives a start.  Her eyes lock onto something.

45.   REVERSE.  TILTED SIDEWAYS, IN HER HEAD'S POV, we look straight     45.
      out through the open doorway of the classroom into the hall.
      There, standing in a black pool of fluid, is a full-sized rubber
      body bag.  Dark red and yellow.  Weaving slightly, the merest
      suggesting of movement within it.

46.   BACK ON NANCY, sitting upright, wiping the sleep from her eyes,    46.
      shaking her head like a punchy prozefighter.  She looks back out
      the door.

47.   REVERSE IN 'NORMAL' POV -- the hallway is empty.  But there's a    47.
      dark smear on its floor tiles.

48.   NANCY looks nervously towards the rest of the class.  No one else  48.
      has noticed a thing outside the door.  All are dumbly spellbound
      by the SURFER, who now recites like a deep-voiced robot, his face
      wreathed by white hair.

                                      SURFER
                      O God, I could be bounded in a
                      nutshell and count myself a king
                      of infinite space, were it not
                      that I have bad dreams...

49.   ANGLE BACK ON NANCY.  She slips from her seat, eye warily on the   49.
      teacher and class.  But no one turns as she disappears through
      the doorway.


50.   INT.  SCHOOL HALLWAY.  DAY.                                        50.

      NANCY turns and looks both directions.  No sign of anybody.

                                      TINA (O.S.)
                              (distant)
                      Nancy.

      NANCY wheels and sees the bag, prone on the tiles at the far end
      of the hall, at the end of a long snail's trail of slime.  A pale
      hand thrusts out of it.  A moment later, as if pulled by
      invisible gravity, the bag slides out of sight into an
      intersecting corridor.

                                      NANCY
                      Tina!

      NANCY starts running for it.

51.   ANGLE AT THE CORNER as NANCY races blindly around the turn and     51.
      smashes straight into a BODY lunging at her from the opposite
      direction!  Both go down.

52.   ANGLE AT THE FLOOR.  A dazed freshman HALLGUARD cranks herself up  52.
      on one elbow.  She wears a plastic plaque on her red and yellow
      sweater that reads 'Hall Guard'.  Her nose is bleeding from the
      impact.

                                      HALLGUARD
                      Y-you're not supposed to run.
                      W-where's your pass -- you got a
                      pass?

      NANCY leaps up --

                                      NANCY
                      Screw your stupid pass!

53.   She turns -- sees the body bag halfway down this darker, narrower  53.
      hall, upright again.  But just as she sees it, it tips and
      pitches headlong through a doorway -- like some godawful rotten
      tree finally timbering down.  She can hear the sickening
      CRUNCHING of it falling down a long flight of stairs.

      NANCY runs for it again.  The HALLGUARD staggers up FOREGROUND,
      bleeding profusely from her eyes and ears.

                                      HALLGUARD
                      Hey, no running in the halls!

      The HALLGUARD raises her hand and we see it's tipped with long
      metal spikes.

      REVERSE ANGLE AT THE DOOR as NANCY runs up.  NANCY turns to check
      out the HALLGUARD.  She's vanished.  NANCY turns and looks down
      through the open door.  The MUSIC sweeps through a strange,
      brooding movement of strings, mounting towards the NIGHTMARE
      THEME.


54.   INT.  A STAIRWELL.                                                 54.

      NANCY edges into the stairwell and looks down.  Looks like
      there's a fire somewhere down there, from the way the orange
      light dances.  But there's only a low WHITE NOISE.

                                      NANCY
                      Tina?

      No answer.  NANCY starts down the stairs.


55.   INT.  BOILER ROOM.  DAY.                                           55.

      NANCY comes off the stairs into a dank boiler room.  The smear
      trail is there.  It runs behind a cracking, red-hot boiler the
      size of a diesel locomotive.  Everything about the place feels
      dreadfully wrong, and the MUSIC is deep into the NIGHTMARE THEME
      when it pauses.

      TIGHT ON NANCY.  Slow terror moves into her face.  There's a low,
      sinister GIGGLE.

56.   REVERSE IN HER POV -- we see a tangle of pipes, shadows, and the   56.
      tainted fire of the huge boiler.  Then from behind this, deeply
      shadowed but still identifiable, steps TINA's KILLER.  The same
      filthy red and yellow sweater and slouch hat, the same melted
      face twisting into a smile, the same GARBLED LAUGH as he slides
      the long blades from beneath his shirt and fans them on the ends
      of his bony fingers.

                                      NANCY
                      Who are you?

                                      MAN
                      Gonna get you.

57.   The leering MAN brings the bloodied scalpel-fingernails across     57.
      his own chest, splitting a nipple.  Yellow fluid pours out.
      MAGGOTS and WORMS.

      NANCY forgets the question -- jerks around and flees in blind
      panic into the first opening she sees -- a dark pipe tunnel.


58.   INT.  PIPE TUNNEL.                                                 58.

      ANGLE IN THE NARROW PASSAGEWAY.  In the BACKGROUND the killer
      shambles towards her; FOREGROUND NANCY breaks into a run.

      The killer sprints -- NANCY tears ahead into darkness.

      She flees deeper and deeper into the labyrinth of steaming,
      SIZZLING pipes, squeezing through smaller and smaller openings.
      The killer is just yards behind her, and soon she's trapped, just
      as TINA was before her.

      She presses her back to the wet bricks.  There's no hope of
      fighting him off, for NANCY is not as strong as TINA.  But she is
      smart as hell, and thinking even in this nightmare.  So by the
      time the creep has raised his knives to strike, NANCY has
      realized something.  She wheels and shoves her arm against one of
      the scalding steam pipes.  In the sme split second we HEAR her
      flesh scald, we

                                                      CUT TO:


59.   INT.  ENGLISH CLASS.  DAY.                                         59.

      NANCY lurches up SCREAMING, arm raised to ward off the invisible
      blow, books clattering to the floor -- other GIRLS nearby SCREAM
      in surprise as she stumbles over them.  Then she stops, confused
      and groggy from the nightmare.

      WIDER ANGLE.  EVERYBODY is staring at NANCY as if she's gone
      mad.  The ENGLISH TEACHER rushes over, herself frightened by the
      terror in the girl's eyes.

                                      TEACHER
                      Okay -- Okay, Thompson!  Every-
                      thing's all right now -- Nancy!.

60.   NANCY jerks around with panicked eyes, expecting the killer to     60.
      leap from any direction.  But there's only the sea of staring
      eyes.

      NANCY begins methodically picking up her books.

                                      TEACHER
                      I'll call your mother.

                                      NANCY
                      No!  No, really, I'm fine.  I'll go
                      straight home.  I'm okay.

      She marches for the door.

                                      TEACHER
                      You'll need a hall pass!

      But the girl's gone.


61.   EXT.  THE SCHOOL.  DAY.                                            61.

      NANCY walks out of the building, shaken.  Then she pauses at one
      of the big pine trees out front, stops and rests her head against
      its bark, teeth set.  NANCY starts to shake, and next second
      she's sobbing like a broken-hearted, frightened child.        OMIT 61A.
OMIT 61A.
62.   But she shakes herself silent.  Wipes the tears away with a slash  62.
      of sleeve.  She rubs her arm absently, lost in thought, then
      reacts in surprise and pain.  She lifts her arm and stares at the
      spot she's touched.

      INSERT ON HER ARM and the BURN there; about the size and shape of
      a half-dollar.

      WIDER ON NANCY.  Utterly, chillingly confused.

62A.  TINA, against the tree inches from NANCY, (SC 7) -- turns to her and
      says --

                                      TINA
                      Couldn't get back to sleep
                      at all.
                              (beat)
                      What you dream?


63.   EXT.  A BUSY STREET.  DAY.                                         63.

      NANCY is walking quickly, head erect, jaw set.  Then she enters
      her father's Police Station.


64.   INT.  VAN NUYS POLICE STATION.  DAY.                               64.

      NANCY crosses directly to the GARCIA.

                                      NANCY
                      My dad here?

      GARCIA looks up from his paperwork.

                                      SERGEANT GARCIA
                      Lieutenant.

      LT THOMPSON emerges from another room, uneasy to see NANCY.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Decide to take a day off after
                      all?

                                      NANCY
                      Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.

      THOMPSON doesn't miss a beat.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Only family allowed, Nancy.  You
                      know the drill.

                                      NANCY
                      Just want to talk to him a second.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      He's dangerous.

                                      NANCY
                      You don't know he did it.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      No, I know, thanks to your
                      own testimony, that he was
                      locked in a room with a girl
                      who went in alive and came
                      out in a rubber bag.

      NANCY flinches; her father shows the first signs of color in his
      neck.

                                      NANCY
                      I just want to talk to him.
                              (beat, lower)
                      Please, Dad.

      THOMPSON shifts almost imperceptibly towards GARCIA, then turns
      back to NANCY.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Make it fast.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


65.   INT.  CELL AREA.  DAY.                                             65.

      A GUARD exits pushing a cart of food trays.  NANCY waits warily
      until he's gone, then looks back to ROD LANE.  ROD looks more
      like a captured coyote than a human; haggard, ribbed, expecting
      poisoned bait.  His hair is wet, his clothes are borrowed jeans
      and work shirt.

                                      NANCY
                              (low)
                      And then what happened?

                                      ROD
                      I told you.
                              (reluctantly)
                      It was dark, but I'm sure there
                      was someone else IN there, under
                      the covers with her.

      NANCY reacts.

                                      NANCY
                      How could somebody get under
                      the covers with you guys
                      without you knowing it?

                                      ROD
                      How the fuck do I know?
                              (beat)
                      I don't expect you to believe
                      me.

      NANCY studies his encrypted eyes.  Surprisingly, she looks like
      she just might believe him.  She leans closer with a new
      thought.

                                      NANCY
                      What he look like?  You get
                      a look at him?

      He looks away.

                                      ROD
                      No.

                                      NANCY
                      Well then how can you say
                      somebody else was there?

                                      ROD
                      Because somebody cut her.  While
                      I watched.

      Now the place is so quiet you can hear heartbeats.

                                      NANCY
                      Somebody cut her while you watched
                      and you don't know what he looked
                      like?

      ROD smiles an insane smile, stuck with a reality no one will
      buy.

                                      ROD
                      You couldn't see the fucker.
                      You could just see the cuts
                      happening, all at once.

      NANCY gives a twitch.

                                      NANCY
                      What you mean 'all at once'?

                                      ROD
                              (low)
                      I mean, it was as if there were
                      four razors cutting her at the
                      same time.  But invisible razors.
                      She just... opened up...

      By now he's picking at a clot of dark blood on his jacket, as if
      it was a scab on his own body.  Then he catches NANCY watching
      and turns away to the back of the cell.  He smashes his fist into
      the wall -- bone-crushing blows that scare the wits out of
      NANCY.

                                      NANCY
                      Rod!

      He stops, and his fist is dripping blood as he says in a small,
      sad voice.

                                      ROD
                      I probably could've saved her
                      if I'd moved sooner...  But I
                      thought it was just another
                      nightmare, like the one I had
                      the night before.
                              (beat)
                      There... was this guy who had
                      knives for fingers...

      CLOSE ON NANCY, unable to swallow the gorge rising in her
      throat.  ROD turns to her, and to his surprise she's ashen.

                                      ROD (CONTD)
                      Do you think I did it?

                                      NANCY
                      No.

                                                FADE TO BLACK


66.   EXT.  ELM STREET / NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                           66.

      FADE UP ON ESTABLISHING SHOT as a spooky WIND sets a DOG BARKING
      down the block.  A CAR goes by, then this pleasant residential
      street falls into silence.  CAMERA has MOVED IN on NANCY's
      well-tended two-story home.


67.   INT.  NANCY'S KITCHEN.  NIGHT.                                     67.

      The house is in shadow.  Alone, MARGE scrapes the last of the
      evening's dishes and slips them into the dishwasher.  Neither she
      nor her daughter has touched the food.  But MARGE is well into a
      bottle of gin; her appetite for that is growing, right along with
      her dread.  She turns and looks up the stairs, calling.

                                      MARGE
                      Nancy, don't fall asleep in
                      there.

                                      NANCY (OS)
                      I won't.

                                      MARGE
                      Get into bed.


68.   INT.  UPSTAIRS BATHROOM.  NIGHT.                                   68.

                                      NANCY
                      I will.

      NANCY'S in the tub, so drowsy she can hardly rinse without
      falling asleep.  The water in the tub is opaque with suds.
      Luxurious.

      CLOSER ANGLE, AT WATER LEVEL ON NANCY.  Her eyes droop.  She
      slides closer to the surface of the water, letting its heat sooth
      her nerves.  Her eyes stare straight up, glazed; her breathing
      deepens.

      REVERSE, across to her legs, crooked, one knee on each side of
      the tub.  There's a ripple in the water between.  Then something
      tiny and shiny breaks the surface between them.  It pops up with
      a slithering MUSIC CUE and catches a sliver of light.  Then it
      begins to rise.

      Higher and higher it rises, soon accompanied by another, then two
      more shining, gleaming blades, and then the full glove and dark
      hairy hand and then the wrist and arm, straight up light an evil
      sapling between the girl's knees, the knives bloosoming into a
      bright flower of razor sharp steel in the air, moving over the
      girl's belly.  The hand rears back, the claws arch to strike.

                                      MARGE (OS/APPROACHING)
                      Nancy?

      MARGE raps on the door.  The instant she does NANCY jerks up,
      opening her eyes groggily.  The dark wet arm, hand and knifes are
      gone.

                                      NANCY
                      What?

                                      MARGE (OS)
                              (through the door)
                      You're not falling asleep,
                      are you?  You could drown,
                      you know.

                                      NANCY
                      Mother, for petesakes.

                                      MARGE (OS)
                      It happens all the time.
                              (brighter)
                      I've got some warm milk all
                      ready for you.  Why don't you
                      jump into bed?
                              (fading)
                      I'm gonna turn on your electric
                      blanket, too.  C'mon, now.
                              (then she's gone into
                               another room)

                                      NANCY
                              (low)
                      Warm milk.  Gross.

      She slides down to water level again, and sings softly,
      thoughtfully to herself.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      One, two, Freddie's coming for
                      you, three four, better lock
                      your door, five six, grab your
                      crucifix, seven eight gonna
                      stay up late, nine ten, never
                      sleep again...

      The next instant she's jerked with incredible violence straight
      down beneath the surface of the tub -- as if the bottom had
      suddenly dropped out and she was in a bottomless well!


68A.  EXT.  UNDERWATER SHOT.  NIGHT.                                     68A.

      LOOKING UP PAST HER ANKLES we SEE NANCY pulled sharply down into
      really deep water, the dim light of the surface and bathroom
      beyond receding with each yank.  And yet she somehow flails and
      gasps and struggles back towards the surface, managing by pure
      panic to break the surface with her hands!


68B.  INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM.                                    68B.

      MARGE rushes to the door and listens, alarmed at the wild
      SPLASHING audible through the locked door.

                                      MARGE
                      Nancy!  NANCY!


68C.  EXT.  UNDERWATER SHOT.  NIGHT.                                     68C.

      MARGE'S VOICE reaches to the girl, who thrusts up through main
      force and breaks the surface with her head and shoulders.


68D.  INT.  BATHTUB.                                                     68D.

      Gasping and choking, NANCY breaks the surface of her bathwater,
      like a drowning sailer getting one last chance.  Her mother's
      VOICE booms over her, ECHOED and frantic -- and the loud BANGING
      on the door finally opens her eyes.  She turns and calls gasping
      to her mother --

                                      NANCY
                      Mommy!

      REVERSE ON THE DOOR -- as MARGE, using the old hangar through the
      doorhandle truck, makes it into the room.  She rushes across to
      the tub.  NANCY is staggering up in the bathwater, again with
      solid porcelain beneath her feet.

                                      MARGE
                      I told you!  Hundreds of people
                      a year drown like that!

      The mother throws a towel around the gasping girl, helps her from
      the tub and begins drying her like a child.  NANCY looks like
      she's likes paralized with some sort of weird dread.

                                      MARGE
                      You okay?

                                      NANCY
                      Great

                                      MARGE
                              (not believing it for
                               a minute)
                      To bed with you, c'mon.

      MARGE rushes out to get the room ready.  NANCY turns and looks at
      herself in the cabinet mirror, then opens the medicine chest and
      begins a quick, furtive search.

      CLOSER as she takes out the box of No Doz and slips it into her
      robe.


OMIT SCS. 69 & 70-------------------------------          OMIT SCS. 69 & 70

71.   INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             71.

      NANCY emerges from the bathroom yawning.  MARGE follows as the
      girl plods obediently to her room.

                                      MARGE
                      No television, forget the
                      homework, no phone calls.

                                      NANCY
                      No, Mother.  Yes, Mother.
                      No, Mother.


72.   INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        72.

                                      MARGE
                      And no school tomorrow, either.
                      you take a little vacation, relax
                      and rest for a change.

                                      NANCY
                      Yes, Mother.  G'night.

      MARGE offers a smile, and a little yellow pill.

                                      MARGE
                      Take this, it'll help you sleep.

                                      NANCY
                      Right.

      NANCY pops it in her mouth and swallows obediently.  MARGE leans
      to her with a kiss.

                                      MARGE
                      Sleep tight, don't let the
                      bedbugs bite.

      MARGE goes out, relieved.  NANCY closes the door, leans against
      it and spits the pill into her hand.  She tosses it straight out
      her window and takes a NoDoz.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


73.   OMIT                                                          OMIT 73.

74.   FADE UP ON INSERT OF TELEVISION SCREEN.                            74.

      A MONSTER MOVIE in BLACK AND WHITE.  NO SOUND from the set.

75.   PULL BACK to REVEAL NANCY propped up in bed, furtively watching.  Or  75.
      is she just thinking?  A bedside CLOCK reads 12:45 pm.

      The girl YAWNS.  She shakes herself violently and sits up
      straighter, forcing herself to concentrate on the movie.

75A.  ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN.  A DIVER struggles to keep facing a      75A.
      large circling shark.

75B.  ON NANCY.  Her eyes droop shut -- then she jerks awake, rattling   75B.
      her head as if it were a radio drifting off station.  She tumbles
      out of bed, throws open the window and takes a deep breath of the
      cool night air.


76.   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE AND STREET.  NIGHT.                            76.

      HIGH ANGLE, AT SECOND-STORY LEVEL.  NANCY looks directly across
      the street to a lighted, open window.  Its curtains, sucked out
      and waving in the night breeze, give the only motion to the
      deserted street.

      Then someone pitches out of the dark at her.  NANCY gives a YELP
      -- then clamps her hand over her mouth as she recognizes GLEN,
      balanced precariously on the rose trellis outside her window.

                                      GLEN
                      Sorry!  Saw your light on.
                      Thought I'd see how you were.

      She gets herself together, barely.

                                      NANCY
                      Sometimes I wish you didn't live
                      right across the street.

                                      GLEN
                      Shut up and let me in.  You ever
                      stand on a rose trellis in your
                      bare feet?


76A.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        76A.

      NANCY looks over her shoulder to make sure her mother hasn't
      heard.  GLEN's already through her window and planted on her
      bed.  NANCY points to a chair.

                                      NANCY
                      If you don't mind.

      GLEN crosses to the chair and plops down.

                                      GLEN
                      So.  I heard you freaked out
                      in English class today.

      There's no maliciousness in his voice, and the familiar frankness
      is actually comforting to NANCY.

                                      NANCY
                      Guess I did.

                                      GLEN
                      Haven't slept, have you?

                                      NANCY
                      Not really.

      NANCY tries to smile, but can't fake it very well.  GLEN looks
      her over.

                                      GLEN
                      You look dead and rained on, if
                      you want the ugly truth.  And
                      what you do to your arm?

      She shrugs, trying to keep it casual.

                                      NANCY
                      Burned myself in Englsh class.

      She hazards a look in the mirror, and her jaw drops.

                                      NANCY
                      M'god, I look twenty years old.
                              (turning back to him)
                      You have any weird dreams last
                      night?

                                      GLEN
                      Slept like a rock.

                                      NANCY
                              (pleased)
                      Well at least I have an objective
                      wall to bounce this off.
                              (off)
                      You believe it's possible to dream
                      about what's going to happen?

                                      GLEN
                      No.

                                      NANCY
                      You believe in the Boogey Man?

                                      GLEN
                      One two, Freddie's coming
                      for you?  No.  Rod killed Tina.
                      he's a fruitcake and you know it.

                                      NANCY
                      You believe in anything?

                                      GLEN
                      I believe in you, me, and
                      Rock and Roll.  And I'm not
                      too sure about you lately.

      NANCY thinks.

                                      NANCY
                      Listen, I got a crazy favor
                      to ask.

                                      GLEN
                      Uh-oh...

                                      NANCY
                      It's nothing too hard or anything.
                              (beat)
                      I'm just going to... LOOK
                      for someone, and... I want
                      you to be sort of a ...guard.
                      Okay?

      GLEN makes the Twilight Zone sound.

                                      NANCY
                      Okay?

                                      GLEN
                      Okay, okay.
                              (beat)
                      I think.

      She comes very close to him.

                                      NANCY
                      You won't screw up, right?  I
                      mean, a whole lot might depend
                      on it.

      The way she's looking at him gives him the creeps.

                                      GLEN
                      Okay, I won't screw up.

77.   Nancy takes a deep breath.  Then without another word turns off    77.
      the TV and the light.

                                      GLEN (IN DARK)
                      Jesus, it's dark in here.

                                      NANCY
                      Shhh.  Now listen, here's what
                      we're gonna do...


78.   EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          78.

      FADE UP ON NANCY, still in her pajamas, walking through the
      shadowy streets near her home, listening for the slightest
      sound.  We MOVE with her.  But nothing, not even the dog barking
      earlier, is there now.  NANCY peers into the darkness of lawns
      and trees behind her.

                                      NANCY
                              (stage whisper)
                      You still there?

      Across the street and a distance away, GLEN steps from behind a
      tree.

                                      GLEN
                      Yeah.  So?

                                      NANCY
                      Just checking -- keep out of
                      sight!

      GLEN throws up his hands in exasperation and walks back out of
      sight.  NANCY turns and looks down between the houses, deep into
      a dark alleyway.  Then she forces herself to walk into it.


79.   EXT.  ALLEY.  NIGHT.                                               79.

      MOVING WITH HER as she makes herself go deeper and deeper into
      shadows.  Each time she pauses and waits, the MUSIC grows more
      threatening and expectant.  The feeling is of immense tension --
      we're sure the killer will come screaming out on her at any
      second.

      But he doesn't.  In fact absolutely nothing happens, and NANCY
      emerges from the far end of the alley unscathed.  The only thing
      strange is that she now finds her self looking across the mall to


80.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      80.

      The Police Station.  It takes her a little by surprise, it just
      seems to have appeared.

      MUSIC creeps into the NIGHTMARE THEME as NANCY whispers hoarsely
      back down the dark alley.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Still there?


81.   EXT.  ALLEY.  NIGHT.                                               81.

      We only HEAR the DISTANT VOICE, slightly ECHOED.

                                      GLEN'S VOICE (OS)
                              (yawning)
                      Still here!

                                      NANCY
                      On your toes, right?

      NANCY stares into the dark trying to see him, but she can't.  She
      turns back and makes up her mind to move without him in sight.


82.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      82.

      MUSIC MOUNTS as we MOVE WITH NANCY across the lawns to the police
      station, creeping to the first lighted window she sees.  It's a
      low, barred basement window, and NANCY reacts as soon as she
      looks through it.


83.   INT.  ROD'S CELL.  NIGHT.                                          83.

      NANCY'S POV down into ROD LANE's cell.  The boy is on his rough
      cot, twitching in disturbed sleep.  And a long SHADOW is sliding
      across the wall.

      A big SHAPE appears in the shadowed corridor outside the boy's
      cell, and as IT walks closer NANCY can barely see it's the
      shambling, grimly scarred man with the filthy red and yellow
      sweater and strange slouch hat pulled across his brow.  The
      KILLER from all of their nightmares.

      And this giant shadow of a man passes through the bars of the
      cell, like so much evil Jello.  Halfway through he pauses,
      turning to check over his shoulder.  We see the bars clearly
      penetrating his body, going in his head, passing out his ankles.
      Then he turns back to ROD and moves forward, and within another
      heartbeat is beside the boy.


84.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      84.

      NANCY draws back sharply, swallowing in terror.  She looks behind
      her for help.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Glen.

      No answer.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                              (louder)
                      Glen?!

      The street is absolutely deserted.  There is no motion, and no
      sound save one: the distant but unmistakeable sound of GLEN
      SNORING.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      GLEN!

      A beat of silence after the shout's echoes die, then the steady,
      boyish SNORES again.  NANCY swears under her breath and jerks
      back around, forcing herself to look again into ROD's cell.


85.   INT.  ROD'S CELL.                                                  85.

      IN HER POV -- the killer picks up ROD's bedsheet and tests it
      between his powerful hands.  Without thinking, NANCY bangs
      against the glass.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Rod!  Look out!

      The KILLER wheels around, locking eyes with NANCY.  The girl goes
      white.  The man's face is in the light, and it's horrible --
      seething with hatred and a twisted, insane intelligence.

      The hold of those eyes is only broken when ROD rolls up on an
      elbow with a deep, troubled GROAN.  The instant ROD does this,
      the KILLER fades into the shadows in the cell.  But even then his
      eyes hold on NANCY's until the last second he's visible.

      ROD looks around the cell groggily, runs his fingers through his
      matted hair, then collapses back on his pillow.  No matter how
      hard NANCY screams, ROD never once looks at the window.  He just
      pulls the twisted covers about his shoulders and succumbs once
      more to sleep.

	And now the bed sheet is no longer on the bed.  The KILLER,
      materializing out of the shadow again, is holding it between his
      hands like a garrote.  He looks up and leers at NANCY, then moves
      for ROD.


86.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      86.

	ANGLE BACK ON NANCY.  She pounds on the window, then turns in
      frustration and yells into the night.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen!!

      She turns back to the cell in desperation.


87.   OMIT                                                          OMIT 87.


88.   INT.  ROD'S CELL.                                                  88.

	IN NANCY'S POV we look into a cell that is quite deserted save
      for ROD.  Sleeping peacefully.


89.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      89.

	NANCY pulls back from the window, stunned.

                                      NANCY
                      I swear...

      Suddenly NANCY feels utterly exposed.  She shivers, chilled and
      vulnerable to the bone in her thin night clothes.  She can't
      move.  It's as if some great nerve between her instincts and body
      had been severed.  And she hears the SOUND behind her.  A sort of
      filling-vibrating Scrriiitchh.

      MUSIC sneaks in -- the unmistakeable NIGHTMARE THEME, creeping
      over her.  NANCY forces herself, by sheer will, to look.

90.   Ahead of her perhaps twenty-five feet, covered with a thick        90.
      plastic body bag through which we can barely see her face, is
      TINA.  Standing square in the middle of the street.  A dark ooze
      of BLACK EELS roil out of its bottom, and at its top, the zipper
      CHATTERS down and the greenish-white face of TINA lolls out.  She
      gestures, supplicating, her watery eyes desperate to convey some
      desperate message.

      The MUSIC FALLS TO A HUSH.

91.   NANCY backs away, eyes streaming tears.                            91.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen, where are you!  Wake up!
                      Glen!

                                      DEEP RAGGED VOICE
                      I'm here.

      NANCY twists around in horror at the same instant the KILLER
      grabs for her face with his knife-fingers!  The girl
      intinctively pitches back, then scrambles up and runs like
      hell!

                                      NANCY
                      Glen!  Glen!!!


92.   EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          92.

      MOVING WITH NANCY at full gallop, running blind.  She crashes
      through a sawhorse into a new sidewalk, sinking into the wet
      cement over her ankles.  The stuff sticks to her legs in long
      gluey globs and she can barely pull her feet loose.

      The KILLER looms nearby,
      mocking her -- his scalpel claws gleaming in the streetlight.  He
      just misses the girl as she wrenches free and flees again, now so
      winded she can only stagger.

      MOVING WITH THEM.  Time after time NANCY just barely manages to
      elude the shadowy form, leaping from his reach by inches and
      pouring on more steam.  It's too close to even bother screaming
      now; and besides, that would take breath she doesn't have.  The
      only SOUND is of RUNNING FOOTSTEPS, RASPING BREATH and the
      KNIFE-FINGERS WHISTLING through the air.


93.   EXT.  NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                                        93.

      NANCY tears across her front lawn and into the open front door of
      her home, SLAMMING it with all her might.  There's a tremendously
      satisfying CONCUSSION of wood against doorframe, and the LOCKS
      fall shut.


94.   INT.  NANCY'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                 94.

                                      NANCY
                      Glennn!!!

      But her voice is garbled as if she's under water, and there's no
      answer.  The only clue to Glen being there at all is his distant
      SNORING.  Innocent.  Persistent.  Deep.

      NANCY stops, breath in shreds, face smeared with dirt and tears.
      Something is clawing the window in the dark of the kitchen.
      NANCY looks and catches the MAN prying at the glass with his big
      knife-fingers, the sharp blades SIZZLING against the edges of the
      glass as they crack it away from the frame.  NANCY runs upstairs
      in blind panic.


95.   INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        95.

      NANCY darts into her unlit bedroom, slams the door and locks it.

      Safe at last.

      She listens at the door.  Nothing.  She crosses to her bed.  Next
      second the KILLER dives through her window and seizes her in a
      shower of shattered glass!

      NANCY twists and manages to grab the wrist of his knife hand with
      both of hers, barely keeping the blades from her throat.

      The two fall backwards in a terrible, gasping struggle, crashing
      onto NANCY's bed.  Her grip is broken -- the MAN stabs -- NANCY
      twists away, backed into a corner of bed and walls.  Defenseless,
      she snatches a pillow up; the KILLER lashes out -- disemboweling
      the pilow and sending a great gush of feathers flying.  NANCY
      dives for escape in a virtual blizzard.

      The KILLER manages to snare her with his other hand, and the two
      crash across the bedside table to the floor, the table and all
      its contents cascading around them in a whiteout of feathers.

      ANGLE AT FLOOR LEVEL -- CLOSE ON NANCY'S AND THE KILLER'S HEADS.
      The blades inch towards the girl's face -- the drool of the
      grizzled shadow with the horribly scarrred face spills into her
      eyes.  Feathers are everywhere; MUSIC is absolutely insane!

      But just when the points of steel are less than an inch from her
      eyes, the old fashioned alarm clock thrown to the floor next to
      NANCY's head goes off with a jarring RINGGGGGGG!

96.   Instantly the MUSIC STOPS.  And a moment later the room is         96.
      light.

      WIDER as NANCY reels up, blinded by the sudden light, SCREAMING
      AND FIGHTING on her bed.

      ANGLE ON GLEN, lurching from his own sleep at the frightening
      noise.  He discovers NANCY pressed in terror against her
      headboard, clutching a pillow like a drowning woman would a
      straw.

      It's an intact pillow, and there isn't a feather in sight.

      NANCY stares incredulously at GLEN, then around the room,
      untangling herself from her bedclothes.  Wary and furious, her
      voice hoarse.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen, you bastard...

      The boy looks at his friend in groggy alarm.  She's absolutely
      livid, more angry than he's ever seen her, and more strange.

                                      GLEN	
                      What I do?

      He reaches for her -- she flattens against the wall, eyes hard,
      and terribly hurt, too.

                                      NANCY
                              (low)
                      I asked you to do just one thing.
                      Just stay awake and watch me --
                      Just wake me if it looked like
                      I was having a bad dream.
                              (eyes wild)
                      But you.  You shit -- what do
                      you do -- you fall asleep!

      She stops herself, wiping a bit of spittle off her lip, alarmed
      at how out of control she's become.  And suddenly she breaks,
      sinking into her 	torn bedclothes and rubbing her head.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                              (mostly to herself)
                      I must be going nuts...

                                      MARGE (OS)
                      Nancy?

      Her mother's door opens OS.

                                      GLEN
                      Oh, shit.

      NANCY composes her voice as best she can.

                                      NANCY
                      Yes, mother?

      MARGE's flip-flops approach outside the door.  GLEN barrels out
      the window -- NANCY dives for the bed, jams off the light and
      disappears under the covers.  MARGE, bleary eyed herself, opens
      the door and flicks on the light.

                                      MARGE
                              (beat)
                      You okay?

                                      NANCY
                              (weakly)
                      Yeah.  Just had a little dream.
                      I'm falling right back to sleep.

                                      MARGE
                              (beat)
                      Okay... You need anything, just call.

                                      NANCY
                      Okay.

      MARGE closes the door.  NANCY immediately sits up and looks at
      the window.  A single bone-white feather floats down in the
      moonlight.  Then it's sucked outside and is gone.


97.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      97.

      GLEN's CADILLAC CONVERTABLE careens into the parking lot and
      SCREECHES to a stop.  GLEN and NANCY jump out and head for the
      station.

                                      GLEN
                      You mind telling me what's 
                      going on?

      NANCY's races into the station without answering.

                                      GLEN (CONTD)
                      Oh, I see.  That makes it all 
                      perfectly clear.


98.   INT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      98.

      NANCY goes straight to the SERGEANT's desk.

                                      NANCY
                      Garcia, I want to see Rod
                      Lane again.

      GARCIA winces.

                                      SGT GARCIA
                      I thought when I took the
                      night shift I'd have peace
                      and quiet for a change.

                                      NANCY
                      It's urgent, we've gotta see Rod.

                                      SGT GARCIA
                      It's three in the morning.
                      Your mother know you're out this 
                      late?

                                      NANCY
                              (faking it)
                      Of course -- look, at least go
                      back and look at him.  Just see
                      if he's okay.

      GARCIA glances at GLEN.

                                      GLEN
                              (faking it)
                      We have reason to think there
                      might be something weird going 
                      on.

                                      LT THOMPSON (OS)
                      Oh, no argument on that.

      NANCY jumps around at the sound of her father's voice.  LT
      THOMPSON emerges from his office, rumpled and yawning.

                                      NANCY
                      Dad -- what you doing here?

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      It so happens I work here, and
                      there's an unsolved murder.  I
                      don't like unsolved murders, 
                      especially ones my daughter's
                      mixed up in -- what are you
                      doing here at this hour?  You're
                      supposed to be getting some 
                      sleep.

                                      GLEN
                      Listen, sir, this is serious.
                      Nancy had a nightmare about Rod
                      being in danger, or something,
                      and so she thinks...

      He trails off, loosing it under LT THOMPSON's glare.  Besides, he
      doesn't know exactly what the hell's really going on himself.
      GARCIA puts his beefy hand on NANCY's shoulder.

                                      NANCY
                      I just want to see if he's okay!

                                      SGT GARCIA
                      Take my word for it, Nancy.  The
                      guy's sleeping like a baby.  He's
                      not going anywhere.


99.   INT.  CELL BLOCK.  NIGHT.                                          99.

      ANGLE ON ROD in his cell.  He's asleep, all right, but not safely
      so.  His bedsheet has come alive.  It twitches, pulsates, then
      snakes towards his throat.

      ROD stirs, the sheet falls still; ROD slips into deeper sleep,
      and the sheet moves again, completing the noose around his neck!


100.  INT.  BOOKING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        100.

      NANCY makes a move for the cell block --

                                      NANCY
                      This isn't your average nightmare,
                      Daddy -- damn it!

      The door's locked; she hauls on it in desperation.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Now look, Nancy, don't push
                      it.  You've already rubbed my nose
                      in sex, drugs and violence -- don't
                      start throwing in insanity!

      NANCY takes that one to heart.  She wheels on him and pleads, her
      intensity sobering even to him.

                                      NANCY
                      Just go back and check -- please!

      The man takes a beat, then shrugs and nods towards SGT GARCIA.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Okay, Garcia.  What the hell.

                                      SGT GARCIA
                      Right...
                              (feeling in his pockets)
                      Now where'd I put the key...

      He mumbles backs towards his desk.  MUSIC BUILDS as we HOLD ON
      NANCY'S FACE.


101.  INT.  ROD'S CELL.  NIGHT.                                          101.

      With a terrible SNAP ROD's sheet jerks tight around his neck.
      The startled teenager is hauled upright -- eyes popping, face
      purple.  He claws at the sheet, but despite his strength he can't
      get his fingers between the noose and his windpipe.  He's dragged
      backwards across the cot.


102.  INT.  BOOKING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        102.

      GARCIA finally has the keys.  Urged on by NANCY he fumbles with
      the lock.


103.  INT.  ROD'S CELL.  NIGHT.                                          103.

      ROD'S being dragged backwards, gasping and struggling in vain
      against the powerful pull -- right across his cell and up the
      wall, too.  He clutches blindly at his throat at the far end of
      the sheet coils around the bars of the high window.  Then there's
      a powerful wrench of the sheet, and ROD'S neck SNAPS.  The kid's
      body sags lifeless.

104.  ANGLE THROUGH THE BARS as NANY, GLEN, LT THOMPSON and GARCIA       104.
      appear in the corridor outside, the girl sprinting ahead.

                                      NANCY
                      Rod!

      But it's too late; NANCY sinks back in horror as her father and
      GARCIA rush into the cell.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Gimme a hand, dammit!

      GLEN, pale as the sheet that's killed ROD, climbs to the bars and
      unties the knot.  ROD slides down over the SERGEANT'S shoulders,
      limp as a marrionette with its strings slashed.

                                      SGT GARCIA
                      Goddamn loco kid -- he didn't
                      have t'do that -- Madre dios!

      They lay ROD at NANCY's feet; a strange Pieta.  NANCY's father
      looks at her in spooked suspicion.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      How'd you know he was gonna do
                      this?

      NANCY says nothing.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


105.  EXT.  FOREST LAWN CEMETERY.  DAY.                                  105.

                                              BURN ON:

                              THE FOURTH DAY

      FADE UP ON a stark afternoon.  On a hill of sere grass
      overlooking the valley, the casket of ROD LANE is lowered into
      its grave.

      A small group of FAMILY and FRIENDS watches soberly as the
      MINISTER raises his hand in benediction.

                                      MINISTER
                      Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
                      May God be with this young man's
                      soul.

      ON THE FACES of MARGE, LT THOMPSON, TINA'S MOTHER and ROD'S
      PARENTS.  Just for a second or two, in looks too rapid for an
      outsider to even notice, these adults exchange looks.  Furtive,
      quick glances that suggest an immense something that they all
      share, something beyond even this second death among their
      children.  Then they are all staring ahead again, as if the
      others weren't even there.

                                      MINISTER (CONTD OS)
                      His life and his death attest to
                      the Scripture's warning that he who
                      lives by the sword shall die by
                      the sword.

      ANGLE ON GLEN, watching --

      NANCY, standing alone, not believing it for a minute.

                                      MINISTER (CONTD OS)
                      But let us recall also our Lord's
                      admonition that we 'Judge not,
                      lest we be judged.'  Let us
                      attempt only to love.  And may
                      Rod Lane rest in peace.

                                      NANCY
                              (quietly)
                      Amen to that much.

      The mourners walk away from the grave, MARGE among them.  She
      pauses near a MAN and two WOMEN in black -- TINA'S MOTHER, ROD'S
      PARENTS.  They almost, it seems, speak.  Then MARGE hurries on.

      WE MOVE WITH HER as she's joined by LT THOMPSON.  Both are worn
      and on edge.  THOMPSON absently lights another cigarette,
      offering one to MARGE.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      How's Nancy doing?

                                      MARGE
                      I don't think she's slept since
                      Tina died.
                              (shakes her head)
                      She's always been a delicate
                      kid.

      THOMPSON lights her cigarette, attempting some sort of
      nonchalance.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      She's tougher than you think.
                      Any idea how she knew Rod was
                      gonna kill himself?

                                      MARGE
                      No.  All I know is, this reminds
                      me too much of ten years ago.

      THOMPSON blows a plume of smoke against the hard sky and looks
      away.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Yeah.  Well... Let's not start
                      digging up bodies just because 
                      we're in a cemetery.

      He gives her a look that could cut stone.  MARGE toses down her
      cigarete and crosses to NANCY.  The girl is simply staring off
      over the valley.

                                      MARGE
                              (very gently)
                      Time to go home, baby.

      She moves her away from the brink of the hill.


106.  EXT.  CEMETERY PARKING AREA.  DAY.                                 106.

      MARGE opens the door of the station wagon for NANCY.  NANCY turns
      to them both, speaking in a still, small voice.

                                      NANCY
                      The killer's still loose,
                      you know.

      She has a wild, Cassandra aspect that sends a chill right up
      MARGE'S spine.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      You saying somebody else killed
                      Tina?  Who?

      NANCY smiles a weird sort of smile.

                                      NANCY
                      I don't know who he is.  But he's
                      burned, he wears a weird hat, a
                      red and yellow sweater, real
                      dirty, and he uses some sort of
                      knifes he's got made into a sort
                      of... glove.  Like giant finger-
                      nails.

      As NANCY has described this monster from her dream, unseen by
      her, 	the faces of MARGE LT and THOMPSON have drained completely
      of color.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                              (low, even, to MARGE)
                      I think you should keep Nancy
                      at home a few days.  'Til she's
                      really over the shock.

                                      MARGE
                      I got something better...
                              (to NANCY)
                      I'm gonna get you help, baby.
                      So no one will threaten you
                      any more.

      She takes the girl by the arm and guides her into the car,
      locking the door from outside.  NANCY never taking her eyes from
      her father's as the car bears her away.

                                              FADE TO BLACK

                                              BURN ON:

                              THE FIFTH DAY


107.  EXT.  UCLA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE.  DAY.                               107.

      FADE UP ON UCLA's WESTWOOD CAMPUS and PAN TO SIGN:

                              UCLA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE
                                 INSTITUTE FOR THE
                             STUDY OF SLEEP DISORDERS


108.  INT.  A LABORATORY SLEEPING CHAMBER.                               108.

      A NURSE applies sencors to the head, breast, arms, and fingers of
      NANCY THOMPSON.  The girl is lying on a simple broad cot, in her
      pajamas.  The room is subdued in color and holds only this single
      bed.  A large mirror set into one wall hides an observation room
      beyond.

                                      NANCY
                      But I just don't feel... ready
                      to sleep yet.  Please, do I
                      have to?

109.  WIDER, REVEALING DR SAMUEL KING, a young, curly-haired internist;  109.
      intelligent and wry.  He treats NANCY at all times like a young
      adult, never patronizing.  He winks as the NURSE finishes.

                                      DR KING
                      Don't worry, you're not gonna
                      change into Bride of Frankenstein
                      or anything.

      NANCY manages a smile, but she's haggard and visibly thinner.
      MARGE, background, looks downright distraught.

                                      DR KING (CONTD)
                      Nancy have any severe childhood
                      illnesses?  Scarlet Fever?
                      High temperatures -- concussions?

                                      MARGE
                      No, nothing.

                                      NANCY
                      He means, did you ever drop me
                      on my head.

      The doctor and girl share a nervous laugh; MARGE doesn't even
      smile.

                                      DR KING
                      Nightmares are expected after
                      psychological trauma.  Don't
                      worry, they go away.

                                      MARGE
                      I sure as hell hope so.

                                      NANCY	
                      I don't see why you couldn't
                      just give me a pill to keep me
                      from dreaming...

                                      DR KING
                      Everyone's got to dream.  
                      If you don't dream, you go...
                              (he drills his finger
                               at his temple)
                      All set?

                                      NANCY
                      No.

                                      MARGE
                      They're just simple tests, 
                      Nan.  We'll both be right
                      here.

                                      DR KING
                      Look, I know it's been fright-
                      ening, I know your dreams have
                      seemed real.  But... it's 
                      okay.  Okay?

                                      MARGE
                      Please, Nancy.  Trust us.

      The girls gauges her mother, the doctor, the situation very
      carefully.  Then lowers her eyes.

                                      NANCY
                      It's not you I don't trust.
                      It's...
                              (gives up)
                      Okay.  Let's do it.

      Greatly relieved, MARGE gives NANCY a goodnight kiss, then
      follows the doctor through a doorway near the mirror.  As soon as
      her mother is out of sight, NANCY'S eyes drift to the mirror
      itself.  In its reflection she sees herself looking back, alone
      on the bed.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

	
110.  INT.  THE OBSERVATION ROOM.                                        110.

      MARGE and DR KING overlook NANCY's sleeping chamber through the
      one-way mirror.  And KING monitors the girl even more closely
      with a bank of instruments -- a mass of glowing dials, graphs and
      meters.  His manner with MARGE is slightly more sober.

                                      DR KING
                      How long's this been going on?

                                      MARGE
                      Since the murder.  She was fine
                      before that.

                                      DR KING
                      Not to worry.  No signs of path-
                      ology in Nancy's EEG or pulse
                      rate.  I'd guess what we've got
                      is a normal young girl who just
                      happens to have gone through
                      two days of hell.

                                      MARGE
                      It's just made her think...
                      her dreams are real...

      KING adjusts a dial, watching the EKG like a hawk.

                                      DR KING
                      Ever hear the old Buddhist tale
                      about the King who dreamed he 
                      was a beggar who dreamed he 
                      was a king?

      MARGE twitches.  Then there's a slight alteration in the sound of
      the EKG.  KING nods in satisfaction.

                                      DR KING (CONTD)
                      Okay, good.  She's asleep.

                                      MARGE
                              (immensely relieved)
                      Thank God.

      MUSIC RISES SOLEMNLY, MAJESTICALLY into a haunting transition as
      we

                                              DISSOLVE TO

111.  A MONTAGE OF SHOTS, of the EKG GRAPH, its inky needles calming,    111.
      of a METER tracing the quieting of NANCY's pulse, and of OTHER
      INSTRUMENTS, indicating life processes we can only guess.  All
      smoothing out.

112.  CLOSE ON NANCY on TV MONITOR, asleep like the child she is.        112.
      Innocent.

      MARGE lights a cigarette, angry at her helplessness.

                                      MARGE
                      What the hell are dreams, anyway?

                                      DR KING
                      Mysteries.  Incredible body
                      hookus pokus.  Truth is we
                      still don't know what they
                      are or where they come from.
                      As for nightmares...
                              (leans closer)
                      Did you know that in the last 
                      three years twenty Philipino
                      refugees in California died
                      in the middle of nightmares?
                      Not from heart attacks, either.
                      They just died.

      He gives a "Ah don' know" shrug.  MARGE looks out into the
      sleeping room.  NANCY is a motionless bundle in the middle of the
      bed.

113.  ANGLE ON A NEEDLE on an EKG dipping to a lower reading.            113.

114.  WIDER ANGLE -- the mother and DOCTOR watching.                     114.

                                      MARGE
                      What happened?  That needle
                      sank like a rock.

                                      DR KING
                              (quietly)
                      She's entering deep sleep now.
                      Heart rate's a little high due
                      to anxiety, but otherwise she's
                      nicely relaxed.  All normal.
                      She could dream at any time now.
                              (beat)
                      Right now she's like a diver
                      on the bottom of an ocean no
                      one's mapped yet.  Waiting to	
                      see what shows up.


115.  INT.  THE SLEEPING ROOM.                                           115.

      We can see NANCY drift from the initial stage, over the
      brink into deep sleep.  Her hair falls into her eyes; her face
      relaxes; her shoulders curl round her like comforters.  THE MUSIC
      DEEPENS, and begins to hint at the tones of the NIGHTMARE THEME.


116.  INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.                                          116.

      DR KING and MARGE watch the instruments' every move.

      One of the machines begins a slight CHIRPING.  KING scans it,
      liking what he sees.

                                      DR KING
                      Okay, she's started to dream.

      He leans forward in his chair, like a pilot starting an
      instrument approach.  MARGE THOMPSON licks her dry lips, fighting
      a turn of nausea.

                                      MARGE
                      How can you tell?

                                      DR KING
                      R.E.M.'s.  Rapid eye movements.
                      The eyes follow the
                      dream -- their movement picks
                      up on this --

      He prods a dial with his pencil and scribbles the time on a note
      pad.

                                      DR KING (CONTD)
                      Beta Waves are slowing, too.
                      She's dreaming, all right.
                      A good one, too.

      MARGE watches the TV MONITOR.  It's in extra-close on NANCY's
      eyes -- and they're darting beneath the lids, reacting to events
      lost behind a skein of flesh and neurons.

      KING points to a moving graph.  A needle's begun waving lazily
      between plus and minus three.  The DOCTOR nods, assured.

                                      DR KING (CONTD)
                      Typical dream parameter.  A
                      nightmare, now, would be plus or
                      minus five or six; she's just 
                      around three point --

      He stops.  Outside, visible through the glass, NANCY twists
      around.  Eyes still closed, she's nevertheless holding her head
      in the attitude of prey listening to the first faint sound of the
      predator's approach.

      MARGE looks from her daughter to the DOCTOR, color draining from
      her face.

                                      MARGE
                      What the hell's this?  She
                      awake or asleep?

      The needle of the graph gives a jagged pitch up, plunges, then
      surges well above the eight mark.  A strange MUSIC CUE --
      disonant and threatening, creeps in -- the NIGHTMARE THEME
      slurred into awful minors and weird disonance.  KING stares at
      the gauge in disbelief, rapping his finger on its glass.

                                      DR KING
                      Can't be.  It never gets
                      this high...

      The needle swings even higher, benind.

                                      DR KING (CONTD)
                      Jesus H. Christ.

      He's cut off by the high-pitched KEENING of the girl, the SOUND
      cutting through the double thickness of the glass like a lasar.
      A warning BEEPER has begun, the instruments light up like a
      Christmas tree -- and outside in the sleeping room, NANCY is
      contorting as if shot through with a thousand volts.  KING knocks
      over his chair in his sprint for the door.


117.  INT.  SLEEPING ROOM.                                               117.

      The DOCTOR and MARGE come in on the run -- NANCY's flailing and
      screaming as if the devil himself were after her.  KING grabs her
      to shake her awake;

      ANGLE ON NANCY (eyes open) -- looking in terror -- SOUND ECHOED
      STRANGELY.

      IN HER POV -- dressed in KING'S clothes -- the horribly scarred
      MAN reaches out.

      WIDER -- (NANCY'S eyes closed in sleep) as the girl's fist shoots
      out with incredible force and knocks DR KING flying!

      The NURSE and MARGE both descend on her --

      and again in her SLEEPING POV we see the MAN stagger for her.

      WIDER ON NANCY -- (still in her nightmare) -- fighting like a
      tiger with both MARGE and the NURSE -- sending the NURSE
      sprawling -- leaving MARGE hanging on for dear life.

      ANGLE on the stunned DOCTOR fumbling with a hyperdermic needle,
      spilling most of the stuff on himself with his shaking hands --
      the SCREAMS AND CURSES of NANCY are deafening and worthy of a
      stevador fighting off his worst enemy.  Stranger still, her hair
      is electrified, standing on end and greying before their very
      eyes!

      MARGE screams at the top of her lungs.

                                      MARGE
                      NANCY!!!  IT'S MOM -- NANCY!!!!

      Some deep bolt of psychic power smacks through the girl, and her
      eyes flap open -- they're glazed with terror and fury, but open.
      NANCY's awake.

      She stares around like a cornered animal in the middle of the
      bed, her purple face gasping out gut-wrenching SOBS.  The NURSE
      and MARGE dare to go back in and hold the sweat-drenched girl as
      DR KING comes for her with the needle.

                                      DR KING
                      Now, this is just going to let
                      you relax and sleep, Nan --

      With incredible swiftness, NANCY backhands the hypodermic into a
      far wall, shattering it into a million pieces.

                                      NANCY
                      No.  That's enough sleep.

      Her eyes are windows straight into white fire as she locks into
      KING'S face.  He dabs his split lip, swallowing painfully.

                                      DR KING
                      Okay, kid.  Okay.  Fair enough.

      He holds out his hand.  NANCY at last takes it, and sags back
      into her pillow, exhausted.  Then KING comes up with blood on his
      hand.

      He stares at it, dumbfounded, then at the girl.  Across her left
      forearm, a deep gash is bleeding freely, as if made by a very
      sharp instrument.

                                      MARGE
                      Oh my god, oh my god...

                                      DR KING
                              (to the NURSE)
                      Get the kit!

      The NURSE scrambles away as the DOCTOR claps his hand over the
      wounds.  He looks into NANCY's face.  What he sees frightens him
      even more: NANCY'S haunted, ghost-like eyes turn from him to her
      mother, and a terrible, chilling smile opens across NANCY's white
      lips.

                                      NANCY
                      You believe this?

      She pulls her free arm from beneath the sheets and reveals a
      strange hat, filthy and worn -- the KILLER'S hat.  The sight of
      it frightens MARGE more than anything that's come before.

                                      MARGE
                              (deathly pale)
                      Where the hell did you get that?

      NANCY fixes her with Xray eyes.

                                      NANCY
                      I grabbed it off his head.

      MARGE stares at the hat as if it held her whole future, and her
      future was a horror.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


118.  EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE.  DAY.                                         118.

                                                      BURN ON

                              THE SIXTH DAY

      FADE UP ON NANCY'S HOUSE, early morning.


119.  INT.  NANCY'S KITCHEN.  DAY.                                       119.

      MARGE is on the telephone, the dirty hat in her hand.  Nearby is
      a nearly empty bottle of gin.

                                      MARGE
                      She said she snatched it off
                      his head in a dream.
                              (listens)
                      No, I'm not crazy, I've got
                      the damn thing in my hand!
                              (listens)
                      I know we did, we all...
                              (hears NANCY 
                               approaching)
                      Gotta go.

      She hangs up and stuffs the hat and bottle into a drawer,
      screening the action with her body.  NANCY enters.

      By now the girl has an extraordinary look.  Her hair is ashen,
      her skin transluscent, and eyes dark-ringed.  Her right forearm
      is heavily bandaged over the slashes.  In short, instead of the
      girl next door, we now could be looking at the lunatic from the
      next cell.  MARGE, though she does her best to hide it, is
      downright frightened of her.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      You didn't sleep, did you?
                      The doctor says you have to 
                      sleep or you'll --

      NANCY pours herself a cup of black coffee.

                                      NANCY
                      Go even crazier?

                                      MARGE
                      I don't think you're going
                      crazy -- and stop drinking
                      that damn coffee!

                                      NANCY
                      Did you ask Daddy to have the 
                      hat examined?

                                      MARGE
                      I threw that filthy thing away --
                      I don't know what you're trying 
                      to prove with it, but --

      NANCY comes closer, her eyes shining with a new sureness.

                                      NANCY
                      What I learned at the dream
                      clinic, that's what I'm trying
                      to prove.  Rod didn't kill Tina, 
                      and he didn't hang himself.
                      It's this guy -- he's after
                      us in our dreams.

                                      MARGE
                      But that's just not reality,
                      Nancy!

120.  Furious, NANCY janks open the drawer before MARGE can stop her     120.
      and spills the bottle and hat onto the counter.

      MARGE grabs away the bottle protectively -- but it's the hat
      NANCY goes for.  She waves it triumphantly -- demonically. 

                                      NANCY
                      It's real, Mamma.  Feel it.

                                      MARGE
                              (horrified)
                      Put that damned thing down!

      MARGE lunges for it -- NANCY leaps out of reach --

                                      NANCY
                      His name is even in it -- written 
                      right in here -- Fred Krueger --
                      Fred Krueger!  You know who that
                      is, Mamma?  You better tell me,
                      cause now he's after me!

      MARGE swallows, then persists in the lie.

                                      MARGE
                      Nancy, trust your mother for 
                      once -- you'll feel better as 
                      soon as you sleep!

      NANCY shoots a hard humorless laugh, holding up her slashed arm.

                                      NANCY
                      You call this feeling better?
                      Or should I grab a bottle and
                      veg out with you -- avoid 
                      everything happening to me
                      by just getting good and loaded --

      MARGE slaps her hard.

                                      MARGE
                              (losing it)
                      Fred Krueger can't be after you,
                      Nancy -- he's dead!

      The room falls silent, both women staring at the other.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                              (low, raw)
                      Fred Krueger is dead.  Dead and
                      gone.  Believe me, I know.  Now
                      go to bed.  I order you, go to 
                      bed.

      MARGE snatches the hat away.  NANCY is furious, betrayed.

                                      NANCY
                      You knew about him all
                      this time, and you've been acting
                      like he was someone I made up!

      MARGE pulls away.

                                      MARGE
                      You're sick, Nancy.  Imagining 
                      things.  You need to sleep,
                      it's as simple as that.

      NANCY wheels and smashes MARGE'S bottle of gin in the sink.

                                      NANCY
                      Screw sleep!

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Nancy!

      But NANCY runs past her mother for the front door.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Nancy -- it's only a nightmare!

      NANCY turns in the doorway.

                                      NANCY
                      That's enough!

      On the door SLAM, we

                                              CUT TO


121.  EXT.  SHAKESPEARE BRIDGE.  DAY.                                    121.

      ANGLE ON A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET.  We hear GLEN's VOICE and PAN UP
      to REVEAL NANCY and GLEN high above, two tiny figures walking
      across this strange white bridge in old Los Angeles.  CAMERA
      BEGINS A SLOW ZOOM.

                                      GLEN
                      Whenever I get nervous I eat.

                                      NANCY
                      And if you can't do that, you
                      sleep.

                                      GLEN
                      Used to.  Not anymore.

      GLEN jams more Big Mack into his face.  By now our ZOOM reveals
      he's attacking a huge bag of Big Macks, and furtively eyeing
      NANCY.  The girl's hair is startlingly white in the sunlight.
      She's reading a book, hardly paying attention.

                                      GLEN (CONTD)
                      You ever read about the Balinese
                      way of dreaming?

                                      NANCY
                      No.

                                      GLEN
                      They got a whole system they
                      call 'dream skills'.  So, if
                      you have a nightmare, for 
                      instance like falling, right?

                                      NANCY
                      Yeah.

                                      GLEN
                      Instead of screaming and getting 
                      nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna
                      make up my mind that I fall
                      into a magic world where I can
                      get something special, like a 
                      poem or song.
                              (grins hopefully)
                      They get all their art literature
                      from dreams.  Just wake up and 
                      write it down.  Dreamskills.

      He stops, seeing the look on NANCY's face.  Our ZOOM is much
      closer now, a wide medium, and still coming in on the kids.

                                      NANCY
                      And what if they meet a monster
                      in their dream?  Then what?

                                      GLEN
                      They turn their back on it.
                              (grins hopefully)
                      Takes away its energy, and
                      it disappears.

                                      NANCY
                      What happens if they don't do
                      that?

                                      GLEN
                              (shrugs)
                      I guess those people don't
                      wake up to tell what happens.

                                      NANCY
                      Great.

      She leans over the railing, poking her face back into her book.
      GLEN tips its cover and reads its title.  OUR ZOOM IS STILL
      MOVING CLOSER, a MEDIUM CLOSE UP NOW.
 
                                      GLEN
                      'Booby Traps and Improvised 
                      Anti-personel Devices'!

                                      NANCY
                      I found it at this neat
                      survivalist bookstore on
                      Ventura.

                                      GLEN
                              (shocked)
                      Well what you reading it for?

      OUR ZOOM LOCKS IN ON A TIGHT TWO ON THEIR FACES, NANCY's grimly
      determined.

                                      NANCY
                      I'm into survival.

      She walks away, OUT OF FRAME, leaving GLEN watching after her in
      astonishment.

                                      GLEN
                      She's starting to scare the
                      living shit out of me.


122.  EXT. ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOME/EVENING                               122.

      ANGLE ACROSS NANCY'S "TREE LAWN", the grass between
      the sidewalk and the street, in the general direction
      of GLEN's home.  This ANGLE doesn't quite reveal
      Nancy's house.

      FOREGROUND is a utility truck in which a half dozen
      Hispanic WORKERS are loading tools, extension cords
      and hardware.  They
      look like they've put in one hell of a hard day's work.

      MARGE appears and hands a check to the FOREMAN of the crew, a
      white guy in clean coveralls and a gold chain.  He scrutinizes
      it.

                                      FOREMAN
                      And the other...

      MARGE forks over a wad of cash, hands trembling in her
      half-drunk, helpless rage.

                                      MARGE
                      Where's your mask and gun?

      The FOREMAN counts the money swiftly.

                                      FOREMAN
                      Don't bust my chops, lady.
                      If the city found out I put
                      'em in without inside releases
                      I'd loose my license.

      He shoves the money in his pocket and climbs in his truck.  MARGE
      EXITS FRAME for her house.

      PAN WITH THE TRUCK as it pulls away, THEN PICK UP NANCY, walking
      across the street from the corner.  Alone.  Dispirited.  She
      lifts her eyes to her home and stops in her tracks.

                                      NANCY
                      Oh gross...

123.  WIDENING TO REVEAL THE HOUSE as NANCY walks across her front       123.
      yard.  Every single window has been covered with brand-new
      ornamental iron bars, bolted deeply into their frames.

      CLOSER, AT A WINDOW.  NANCY gives a set of bars a powerful
      shake.  They don't budge.  Then girl looks up and sees even the
      window to her second floor bedroom is barred.  And the rose
      trellis has been ripped down and heaped at the foundation in a
      tangle of wood, thorns and broken flowers.


124.  INT.  MARGE'S ROOM.  EVENING.                                      124.

      ANGLE ON THE DOORWAY INTO THE HALL.  Easy listening MUSIC wafts
      through the air.  NANCY appears in the doorway.

                                      NANCY (OS)
                      Mom, what's with the bars!?

125.  REVERSE to MARGE, propped against the headboard of her bed, a      125.
      crooked shadow in the gloom.  A fresh bottle of Gin glints in her
      hand.

                                      NANCY
                      Oh, Mom...

      The girl crosses and reaches gently for the bottle.  MARGE
      snatches it away.

                                      MARGE
                      'S'mine...

      She rocks the bottle in her arms.

                                      NANCY
                      What's with the bars?

                                      MARGE
                      S'curity.

      NANCY sits on the bed, a surprising compassion entering her
      voice.

                                      NANCY
                      Mom, I want to know what you
                      know about Fred Krueger.

                                      MARGE
                      Dead and gone.

                                      NANCY
                      I want to know how, where --
                      if you don't tell me, I'm going
                      to call daddy.

      MARGE gives a laugh -- a rasping chachination from deep in her
      chest.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Your father the cop.  That's a
                      good one.
                              (colder)
                      Forget Fred Krueger.  You don't
                      want to know, believe me.

                                      NANCY
                      I do want to know.  He's not
                      dead and gone -- he's after me
                      and if I sleep he'll get me!
                      I've got to know!

      MARGE blinks at her a moment, then cracks a terrible, crooked
      grin.

                                      MARGE
                      All right.


126.  INT. NANCY'S CELLAR/NIGHT                                          126.

      MARGE drags NANCY headlong down the cellar stairs and across the
      room with a crazy fury, twisting her down near the foundation.
      And she thrusts her face so close to her daughter's that NANCY
      reels from the alcohol.

                                      MARGE
                      You want to know who Fred
                      Krueger was?  He was a filthy
                      child killer who got at least
                      twenty kids, kids from our
                      area, kids we all knew.  It
                      drove us all crazy when we
                      didn't know who was doing it --
                      but it was even worse when
                      they caught him.

      MARGE draws herself up with a shake.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Oh lawyers got fat and the judge
                      got famous, but someone forgot to
                      sign the search warrant in the 
                      right place, and Fred Krueger
                      was free, just like that.

                                      NANCY
                      So he's alive?

      MARGE smiles grimly.

                                      MARGE
                      He wouldn've stopped.  The 
                      bastard would've got more
                      kids first chance he got --
                      they found nearly ten bodies
                      in his boiler room as it
                      was.  But the law couldn't
                      touch him.

      At the mention of "boiler room", NANCY gives a shake.  MARGE
      misses this, too busy taking a pull on the bottle that's never
      left her hand.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      What was needed were some private
                      citizens willing to do what had
                      to be done.

      She reels slowly, looking at NANCY is defiance.

                                      NANCY
                              (hushed)
                      What did you do, mother?

      MARGE cradles the bottle.

                                      MARGE
                      Bunch of us parents tracked him
                      down after they let him go.  Found
                      him in an old boiler room, just
                      like before.  Saw him lying there
                      in that caked red and yellow sweater
                      he always wore, drunk an' asleep
                      with his weird knives by his side...

                                      NANCY
                              (dreading it)
                      Go on...

      MARGE reaches over and taps a dusty two-gallon jug of gasoline
      near the lawn mower.

                                      MARGE
                      We poured gasoline all around
                      the place, left a trail out the 
                      door, locked the door, then...

      She mimes striking a match --

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      WHOOSH!!!

      Her arms shoot up and her eyes go wide with the light of that
      fire.  There's awe in her voice.  Then she drops her arms.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                              (hushed, remembering)
                      But just when it seemed not
                      even the devil could live
                      in there any more -- he crashed
                      out like a banshee, all on fire
                      -- swinging those fingerknives
                      every which direction and 
                      screaming he... he was going
                      to get us by killing all our
                      kids...

      She stops with a sudden quake and drinks for a long moment.  But
      the intake doesn't hide the image.  Her face bathed in tears, she
      looks at her daughter and shakes her head.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      There were all those men, Nancy,
                      even your father, oh yes, even
                      him.  But none could do what
                      had to be done -- Krueger rolling 
                      and screaming so loud the whole
                      state could hear -- no one could
                      take your father's gun and kill 
                      him good and proper except me.

      She sweeps her hand across the air in a terrific slash, then
      stops, her hand shaking, her voice hoarse and terrified.  She
      looks at her daughter, begging.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      So he's dead Nan.  He can't
                      get you.  Mommy killed him.

	For someone who started this film at a very young seventeen,
      NANCY's now the battle-tempered veteran as she takes her mother
      in her arms and rocks her.

                                      NANCY
                      Who was there?  Were Tina's 
                      parents there?  Were Rod's?

      MARGE sags back.

                                      MARGE
                      Sure, and Glen's.  All of us.
                      But that's in the past now,
                      baby.  Really.  It's over.
                              (slyly)
                      We even took his knives.

      The woman twists around and opens the door on an old furnace -- a
      furnace unused since the newer gas one nearby was put in.  She
      fishes inside the cavity -- as then we hear a touch of the
      familiar 'SCRRIITCH'.  Next moment she pulls out an object
      wrapped in rags, opens it and displays the long, rusted blades
      and their glove-like apparatus.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      See?

      NANCY stares at the damn things, chilled.

                                      NANCY
                      All these years you've kept those
                      things buried down here?  In our
                      own house?

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Proof he's declawed.  As for him,
                      we buried him good and deep.

      MARGE shoves the knives into their hiding place, closes the
      little iron door.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      So's okay, you can sleep.

      She lurches up and staggers upstairs.

      NANCY shivers and looks down at her arm.  The cut beneath her
      bandage has begun to bleed again.  And from inside the furnace,
      as if from deep below, the PULSING of the boundless
      nightmare-boiler room can be faintly heard.


127.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          127.

      WIDE ON THE STREET AND BOTH HOUSES, GLEN's on the right, NANCY's
      on the left.  A TELEPHONE RINGS.  ZOOM IN ON GLEN'S UPSTAIRS
      BEDROOM WINDOW.


128.  INT.  GLEN'S & NANCY'S BEDROOMS - INTERCUT.  NIGHT.                128.

129.  GLEN, yawning, crosses and picks up his telephone.                 129.

                                      GLEN
                      Hello?

                                      NANCY (telephone)
                      Hi.

                                      GLEN
                      Oh.  Hi, how y'doing?

      NANCY looks out the window and touches her hair.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Fine.  Stand by your window
                      so I can see you.  You sound
                      a million miles away.

      In the lighted window across the way, she can SEE GLEN move into
      sight.  In his shot, we can SEE NANCY step into her window behind
      the bars.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Much better.

                                      GLEN
                      I heard your ma went ape at the 
                      security store today.  You look
                      like the Prisoner of Zenda or
                      something.  How long's it been 
                      since you slept?

                                      NANCY
                      Coming up on the seventh day.  It's
                      okay, I checked Guiness.  The 
                      record's eleven, and I'll beat 
                      that if I have to.
                              (beat)
                      Listen, I... I know who he is.

                                      GLEN
                      Who?

                                      NANCY
                      The killer.

                                      GLEN
                      You do?

                                      NANCY
                      Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm
                      pretty sure you're next.

      GLEN is appalled.

                                      GLEN
                      Me!?  Why would anyone want to
                      kill me?!

                                      NANCY
                      Don't ask -- just give me some
                      help nailing this guy when I
                      bring him out.

      GLEN pales.

                                      GLEN
                      Bring him out of what?

                                      NANCY
                      My dream.

                                      GLEN
                      How you plan to do that?

                                      NANCY
                      Just like I did the hat.  Have
                      a hold of the sucker when you
                      wake me up.

                                      GLEN
                      Me?
                              (switching back to a more
                               comfortable reality)
                      Wait a minute, you can't bring
                      someone out of a dream!

                                      NANCY
                      If I can't, then you all can
                      relax, because it'll just be a
                      simple case of me being nuts.

                                      GLEN
                      I can save you the trouble.
                      You're nutty as a fruitcake.
                      I love you anyway.

                                      NANCY
                      Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking
                      this guy when I bring him out.

                                      GLEN
                      What!?

                                      NANCY
                              (simplicity itself)
                      You heard me.  I grab him in the
                      dream -- you see me struggling 
                      so you wake me up.  We both come
                      out, you cold cock the fucker,
                      and we got him.  Clever, huh?

                                      GLEN
                      You crazy?  Hit him with what?

                                      NANCY
                      You're a jock.  You must have
                      a baseball bat or something.
                      Come to my window at midnight.
                      And meanwhile...

                                      GLEN
                              (weakly)
                      Meanwhile..?

                                      NANCY
                      Meanwhile whatever you do
                      don't fall asleep.  Midnight.

      She hangs up.  GLEN's eyes bug out.

                                      GLEN
                      Holy shit!  Midnight.  Baseball
                      bats and boogemen.  Unfucking
                      real.


130.  OMIT                                                          OMIT 130.

131.  EXT.  THE VALLEY AND HILLS.  NIGHT.                                131.

      HIGH, WIDE SHOT.  The moon is above the horizon.  A cool wind
      slides a bank of white fog inland.  The valley and its lights
      stretch forever, an endless net of illumination and darkness.  A
      coyote HOWLS on the dark hill.


132.  EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      132.

      A palm frond scuttles across the center of the parking lot.  LT
      THOMPSON arrives in an unmarked car.

                                      COP (passing)
                      Lieutenant Thompson -- what
                      you doing in at this time?

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Can't sleep, thought I'd come
                      break up the poker game.

      The COP laughs and goes his way.  THOMPSON's smile evaporates.

	
133.  INT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      133.

      THOMPSON enters and checks the log.  Nearby, SGT GARCIA pours
      coffee.

                                      SERGEANT GARCIA
                      If it was any more quiet we
                      could hear owls farting.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Is quiet, isn't it?

                                      SERGEANT GARCIA
                              (too casually)
                      How's your girl?

      THOMPSON looks at the Desk sergeant a moment, then tosses down
      the log.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      She's sensible.  She'll sleep
                      sooner or later.


134.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          134.

      The neighborhood is utterly still, most of the homes already
      dark.  But not NANCY's.  Or GLEN's.

      ZOOM TO GLEN'S LIGHTED LIVING ROOM WINDOW.


135.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  135.

      GLEN's father watches eleven o'clocks news, a dreary FILM CLIP
      (STOCK) of war and refugees in a far-away land.

      MR LANTZ takes a pull on his Bud.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      You'd think they'd have some-
                      thing 'bout the Lane kid hanging
                      himself.

      MRS LANTZ walks through the room, drying her hands on a
      dishtowel.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Maybe we're all making more out
                      of it than we should.

      She heads upstairs.  MR LANTZ pops the automatic tuner.  CARSON
      blinks ON.

                                      CARSON (TV)
                      I wouldn't touch that line with
                      a ten foot pole.

      ED MCMAHON and the AUDIENCE laugh in delight.


136.  INT.  GLEN'S HOUSE/UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR.  NIGHT.                      136.

      MRS LANTZ comes along the upstairs hall and knocks gently at a
      closed door.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Glen?  you all right?

      She puts her ear to the door and listens.

                                      MRS LANTZ (CONTD)
                      Glen honey?

      No answer.


137.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         137.

      GLEN lies sprawled across the bed, long legs flung over the end,
      head not visible.

      His mother enters.  She looks at the boy, turns off the TV.
                                                   Looks at him again.
      From this angle she can see his head, earphones crammed over it
      rasping their tinny noise.  But no movement from the kid at all.
      MRS LANTZ crosses and pokes him in the ribs.  GLEN lurches up,
      arms windmilling.

                                      GLEN
                      Whuu?

      He refocuses his eyes, takes off his earphones.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      How can you listen to Carson and
                      a record at the same time?

      GLEN swings his legs over the edge of the bed and shakes his head
      to clear the cobwebs.

                                      GLEN
                      Wasn't listening to the tube,
                      just watching.  Miss Nude
                      America's supposed to be on
                      tonight.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Well how you gonna hear what
                      she says?

                                      GLEN
                      Who cares what she says?

      The mother gives up.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      You should get to sleep soon, 
                      Glen.  It's almost midnight.
                      Goodness knows we've all had
                      enough of a time the last few
                      days...

                                      GLEN
                      I will, Mom...in a while.
                      You guys turning in?

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Pretty soon.

      His MOTHER sighs and goes out, closing the door behind her.  GLEN
      flips the TV back on and glances at the clock.

138.  INSERT OF CLOCK.  It's 11:42.                                      138.

139.  TIGHT ON GLEN's face.  He clamps the earphones back on, and turns  139.
      the volume up high.  The MUSIC is so loud we can hear it
      resonating inside his skull.

      CAMERA MOVES PAST GLEN to his window, then ZOOMS through to:


140.  EXT.  ELM STREET / NANCY'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                          140.

      CONTINUE ZOOMING into the LIGHTED window of NANCY's barred second
      floor bedroom and

                                                      CUT TO:

141.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT                                         141.

      CLOSE ON MARGE, weaving on the edge of NANCY's bed, stroking
      the girl's hair.  NANCY's still something of a wreck, but less
      than 	MARGE.

                                      MARGE
                      We'll go away, take a vacation.
                      Get your hair colored nice, the
                      way it was.  No one will ever
                      know.
                              (sniffs)
                      This whole room smells of coffee,
                      y'know?

      She gathers up NANCY's coffee cups and empty NoDoz boxes, leans
      down and kisses her.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      It's all over now, baby.  The
                      nightmare's over.  Please.

      NANCY nods her head, half stubborn, half sadly.  She can barely
      keep her eyes open now.

                                      NANCY
                      Okay.

      She scrunches into her pillow.  MARGE smiles haggardly and shuts
      off the light, taking the coffee pot with her as she leaves.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Night-night.

      MARGE smiles, relieved.  The girl pulls the blanket around her
      shoulders.  Her eyes flutter closed, her breathing becomes regular
      and deep.  Once again she's the litle girl MARGE fantasizes she
      is.

      The mother tiptoes out of the room, closing the door behind her.
      HOLD ON NANCY's sleeping face as the DOOR CLOSES.  Her eyes
      remain closed another beat, then open wide.

      She quietly jumps out of bed and shakes herself savagely to
      scatter the sleep settling so quickly.

      Still in the dark, she fishes a full electric coffepot from under
      her bed and pours herself a fresh fix into a mug she digs from
      beneath her pillow.  The face illuminated by the neon light on the
      pot is set in absolute determination.

      NANCY drains the cup, then crosses to her closet, retrieves a
      pitcher of ice water from behind a heap of clothes and splashes
      her eyes and the back of her neck.  That done she eases open her
      window and presses her face to the bars, sucking in cool night
      air until every shred of sleep is gone from her brain.

      Then she starts pulling on clothes.


142.  INT.  NANCY'S HOUSE/DOWNSTAIRS.  NIGHT.                            142.

      ANGLE ON MARGE as she checks the lock on the backdoor.  Firm.

143.  ANGLE IN THE LIVING ROOM as she pads through the darkened house,   143.
      feels her way to a wall of shelves and takes down a book.  Then
      another, and a third.  Then reaches in and fishes out a bottle of
      gin.


144.  EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE AND ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                        144.

      The sky has gathered in greater darkness.  LOW, DISTANT THUNDER
      rolls around the horizon like a great drum.

      ANGLE ON NANCY'S HOUSE from across the street.  The moon glints
      off the barred windows. CAMERA ZOOMS to NANCY's window.  The
      imprisoned girl hovers in the darkness behind the grill like a
      ghost, her eyes turned towards GLEN's.  Then she switches to
      something much CLOSER TO CAMERA ANGLE, and she draws back.

145.  REVERSE ON GLEN's father, standing on the front porch of his       145.
      home, also in the shadows, looking straight across and up at
      NANCY.  He 	draws on his cigarette; his face glows red.

146.  NANCY pulls down the shade.                                        146.

147.  GLEN's father grinds the cigarette beneath his shoe.               147.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Shouldn't stare.

      As the man turns our SHOT WIDENS TO REVEAL MRS LANTZ.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Know what I think?  I think 
                      that kid's some kinda lunatic.

      The woman spoons more sweetness into her mouth and rubs her
      forehead.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Shouldn't say such a thing about
                      the poor child.  If you mean the 
                      bars, Marge's just being cautious,
                      her being alone and Nancy acting
                      so nervous lately.

      The woman rises and pulls him gently towards the living room.  As
      he goes inside he takes one last look.

                                      MR LANTZ (CONTD)
                      Well, she ain't gonna hang around
                      our boy no more.

      Once the two are inside, the door is locked.


148.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        148.

      CLOSE ON NANCY's face.  VERY CLOSE.  Her eyes stare ahead,
      red-rimmed, anxious.  She picks absently at the thick bandage
      covering her forearm.  The long cuts from Fred Krueger's fingers
      are bleeding again, but she doesn't even care anymore.  Too late
      to sweat the small stuff.  She crosses the room.

      On the bedside table with the nearly empty Pyrex coffee maker,
      the empty cup and the empty box of No-Doz, is her old fashioned
      alarm clock, and a phone.

      NANCY pours herself the last of the coffee and drinks it to the
      dregs, then looks to the clock.

      INSERT CLOCK -- ten minutes to midnight.

      NANCY'S eyes go to the door.

      WIDER.  Fully clothed and in a jacket now, she creeps to the door
      and cracks it, just to make sure.  Then freezes.


149.  INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE NANCY'S DOOR.                                149.

      IN NANCY'S POV through the door we see MARGE, rummaging around in
      the linen closet not fifteen feet away.  There's no way NANCY can
      get past her.  The woman pulls out a full bottle of gin in
      satisfaction and begins fumbling with its cap.


150.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        150.

      NANCY eases the door closed again and sinks to the key hole,
      watching through it with a sinking heart.

                                      NANCY
                              (very quiet, very intense)
                      Hang on GLEN...


151.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         151.

      GLEN, coat now on, goes to his window, checking.


152.  INT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          152.

      GLEN'S POV -- NANCY'S porch is deserted; front door closed,
      lights out.  No sign of NANCY.


153.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         153.

      GLEN shrugs, takes off his jacket and plops back onto his bed.

                                      GLEN
                      Well, I'm not gonna risk
                      sneaking out until she does.

      He puts the earphones back on.


154.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        154.

      Absolutely frustrated, NANCY turns from the keyhole to the
      window. She opens the blind and eases back the curtain.


155.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.

      IN NANCY'S POV THROUGH THE BARS we ZOOM directly across to GLEN's
      window.


156.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         156.

      GLEN lies on his bed, fully clothed, earphones over his ears,
      CARSON droning from the TV.  And the boy's eyes begin to droop.


157.  INT.  NANCY'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     157.

      NANCY picks up her phone, bites her lip, then begins dialing.


158.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         158.

      TIGHT ON PHONE as it begins RINGING loudly.

      WIDER SHOT, revealing GLEN asleep BACKGROUND, the MUSIC still
      LOUD in his earphones.


159.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  159.

      RINGING here, too, just as MR LANTZ is turning out the lights for
      bed.  He stops in the dark, scowling.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Who at this hour?

      He refuses to turn the light back on.  His wife picks her way to
      the telephone.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Hello?
                              (listens, frowns
                               slightly)
                      Oh... Hold on.
                              (covers the mouthpiece)
                      It's her.  She wants to talk to
                      Glen.

      The father crosses to the telephone, suspicious.

                                      MR LANTZ
                              (whispering)
                      About what?

                                      MRS LANTZ
                              (into phone)
                      What's this about, Nancy?

      She listens, covers up again.

                                      MRS LANTZ (CONTD)
                      She says it's private.  Very 
                      private and very important.

      MR LANTZ grabs the telephone from his wife and barks into it.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Glen's asleep.  Talk to him
                      tomorrow!

      He SLAMS down the telephone with a grunt of satisfaction to his
      wife.

                                      MR LANTZ (CONTD)
                      Just got to be firm with kids,
                      is all.

      Then as a refinement he takes the phone off the hook and lays it
      on the table.


160.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        160.

      NANCY dials again.  This time she gets a BUSY SIGNAL.  She slams
      the phone down in frustration and looks out the window.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen.  Don't fall asleep...

      She goes and sits on the bed, propping her chin on her fists.
161.  Yawns.  The TELEPHONE RINGS.                                       161.

      NANCY snatches it up.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen?

      TIGHT ON HER, ZOOMING EVEN CLOSER ON HER EAR AND THE EARPIECE as
      we HEAR the awful SCRITCHING SCRAPE of STEEL FINGERKNIVES.

      NANCY slaps the phone down as if it were diseased -- then, in
      pure rage, rips the thing's cord from the wall.

      Spent instantly, she puts the receiver back on the cradle and
      lays it on her bed, chiding herself.

                                      NANCY
                      Brilliant.  Now what if Glen
                      calls?

      She wraps the phone cord around the useless machine and puts it
      on her bed, then sneaks back to the door.  This time she gives an
      expression of relief, and opens the door.  MARGE is gone.

      Then the TELEPHONE RINGS again.

      CAMERA MOVES IN ON NANCY as she turns slowly.

162.  REVERSE IN HER POV.  THE TELEPHONE RINGS again, despite the fact   162.
      that the end of its janked-out cord is clearly visible.  The
      NIGHTMARE MUSIC THEME slips right up our spines.

      BACK ON NANCY.  She starts to shake.  She goes to the telephone
      as we WIDEN, unwraps it as it RINGS even louder.  She's shaking
      so hard by now she can barely manage to lift the receiver.  MOVE
      IN CLOSE ON HER, so close we can HEAR her teeth chattering as she
      brings the phone to her ear.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Hello?

      The unmistakeable VOICE of FRED KRUEGER comes over the phone,
      garbled by time and unknown dimensions, but clear enough.

                                      KRUEGER (FILTER)
                              (triumphant)
                      I'm your boyfriend now...

      CLOSE ON THE MOUTHPIECE.  It's changed from a normal telephone
      mouthpiece to an actual mouth -- Fred Krueger's mouth -- and his
      long, slick tongue flicks out and darts into the startled girl's
      mouth!

      WIDER -- as NANCY explodes from her micro-dream -- absolutely
      mad.  She jerks the telephone away from her and smashes it
      against her wall, then attacks it with her feet and hands,
      smashing it to smithereens.

      ANGLE ON THE TELEPHONE PIECES.  Normal pieces of a normal
      telephone.

      She pinches herself hard -- until tears come and her flesh is
      nearly bleeding.

                                      NANCY
                      I'm awake, I am awake.  This is
                      not a dream!  I am --

      She stops, realizing what Krueger meant.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      My boyfriend...!


163.  INT.  NANCY'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                 163.

      NANCY barrels down the stairs and across the darkened living room
      to the front door.

      It takes her a moment of tugging and fumbling to realize the
      deadbolt is locked from inside.  And there's no key in it now.

      She races to a porch window and throws it open, shaking and
      banging on the bars like a mad woman.  But there's no getting
      through.  She staggers back, stymied and furious.  Then somebody
      moves behind her in the dark.

                                      VOICE (OS)
                      Locked.

      NANCY jumps around in shock.  Her mother has posted herself on
      the couch with her bottle.

                                      NANCY
                              (furious)
                      Give me the key, mother.

                                      MARGE
                      I don't even have it on me,
                      so forget it.

      The word is final.  NANCY runs past the woman to the back door,
      to one window after the other, shaking bars and slamming locks
      and SCREAMING in teenage fury.  But it's no good.  The house is
      her prison.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                              (drunk satisfaction)
                      Paid the guy damn good to make
                      sure you stayed put.  You ain't
                      goin' nowhere, kid.  You're
                      gonna sleep tonight if it kills
                      me.

      NANCY clenches her fists and screams at the top of her lungs, a
      heart-wrenching, eardrum-breaking cry of love in despair --

                                      NANCY
                      GLEEENNNNNN!

                                                SMASH CUT TO:

164.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         164.

      CLOSE ON GLEN'S FROM DIRECTLY ABOVE.  The MUSIC is tinny from the
      earphones, the TV SOUND DISTANT AND ECHOED.  The boy is breathing
      deeply now, slowly and gently.  Then, unmistakeably, he begins to
      SNORE.  Very faintly, far in the background, we can hear NANCY.

                                      NANCY (OS)
                      Glen!!  Don't fall asleeeeeep!

      CAMERA PULLS BACK AND STRAIGHT UP as the SNORES merge with a
      weird, unsettling MUSIC CUE.  The boy lies sprawled, still
      clothed, in the middle of his bed.  Save for the bedside lamp,
      the room is dark.

      FULL WIDE ANGLE FROM THIS HIGH SPOT looking down at him as from
      the eyes of some great fly hung on the ceiling.  THE MUSIC
      REACHES A TERRIFYING PITCH OF ANTICIPATION -- THEN STOPS
      ABRUPTLY.

      There's a heartbeat's pause.  Then with tremendous force, two
      powerful arms shoot up beneath the red and yellow bedspread and
      grab GLEN around the waist!

      Next moment the young man's body is dragged straight down into
      the bed, as if some huge beast had grabbed him and heaved him
      down!  His feet and his arms shoot up -- there's another hauling
      yank -- and the boy disappears except for his hands and fingers
      -- down into the pit in the middle of the bed!  His hands are
      last to go, clawing for a hold.  But soon they vanish as well,
      dragging blankets and bedsheets, wires and stereo across the
      caved-in bed and into the abyss.

      There's HIDEOUS SCREECHING of MUSIC jamming in with GLEN's
      ECHOING SCREAMS -- then an unholy, sudden silence.

      Next moment what's left of GLEN is vomited up from the pit of the
      nightmare bed...a horrible mess of blood and bone and hair and
      wires...streaming out and over the bed.  Then the pit in the bed
      is gone as if it were never there.

      Drawn by the terribly screams and struggle, GLEN's mother bursts
      into the room.  The women stares for one moment of horrified
      disbelief, then reels back and lets out the most god-awful SCREAM
      imaginable.  The cry splits the night.


165.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          165.

      The SOUND of the SCREAM CROSS-FADES WITH the WAIL of the
      AMBULANCE as it screeches to a halt at the curb, followed by two
      BLACK AND WHITES and an UNMARKED CAR.  Uniformed POLICEMEN spill
      out FOREGROUND.

      LT THOMPSON and PARKER exit the unmarked car.  By habit or by
      premonition THOMPSON glances at the house that was his home.  His
      eye is caught by a movement; his daughter is at her upstairs
      window, white-haired, hollow-eyed, looking down on him through
      her bars.  She gives a little wave.

      Unnerved, THOMPSON waves back, then walks rapidly for GLEN's
      home.  MR LANTZ, pale as a ghost himself, waits on the porch; we
      can hear the mother's WAILING inside.


166.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        166.

      CLOSE ON NANCY'S BIG OLD WINDUP ALARM CLOCK.  Its big and little
      hands sweep together at midnight.

                                              BURN ON:

                              THE NINTH DAY

      There's a BABBLE of POLICE RADIOS, SIRENS WINDING DOWN, RUNNING
      FOOT-STEPS, SHOUTS, NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS and DOGS BARKING as CAMERA
      LIFTS TO NANCY'S FACE.  Set.  Unafraid.  Ruthless.

      The girl pulls the window shade on it all, then looks at her
      bed.

                                      NANCY
                      Okay, Krueger, you bastard.
                      We play in your court.


167.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM/NANCY'S KITCHEN -- INTERCUT.  NIGHT.      167.

168.  LT THOMPSON is halfway across the living room when he stops.       168.
      Something dark and red is welling from a crack in the ceiling.
      One of his men is rigging a bucket beneah to catch the leaking.
      The telephone rings and PARKER picks it up.

                                      PARKER
                      Lieutenant.  It's your daughter.
                      Says it's urgent.

      THOMPSON turns away from the dripping.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                              (low)
                      Tell her I'm not here, tell
                      her...

                                      PARKER
                      Uh, she just saw you, sir...

      THOMPSON nods, crosses and picks up the telephone.  SCREEN
      SPLITS; we see both.

                                      LT THOMPSON (CONTD)
                      Hello Nancy.

                                      NANCY
                      Hi daddy.  I know what happened.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Then you know more than I do --
                      I haven't even been upstairs.

                                      NANCY
                              (guessing)
                      You know he's dead though, right?

      THOMPSON debates, then admits it.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Yeah, apparantly he's dead.
                      How the hell'd you know?

      A tear coarses down NANCY's cheek, but her voice remains firm.

                                      NANCY
                      I've got a proposition for
                      you.  Listen very carefully,
                      please.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Nan, I --

                                      NANCY
                      Please.  I'm gonna go get
                      the guy who did it and bring
                      him to you.  I just need you
                      be right there to arrest him.
                      Okay?

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Just tell me who did it and
                      I'll go get him, baby.

                                      NANCY
                      Fred Krueger did it, Daddy,
                      and only I can get him.  It's
                      my nightmare he comes to.

      The detective flinches at the name.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Where'd you hear about Krueger --

      NANCY presses, very firm, very rational.

                                      NANCY
                      -- I want you to come over here
                      and break the door down exactly
                      twenty minutes from now -- can 
                      you do that?

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Sure, but...

                                      NANCY
                      That'll be exactly half past 
                      midnight.  Time for me to fall
                      asleep and find him.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Sure, sure, honey.  You just 
                      do that -- get yourself some 
                      sleep -- that's what I've been
                      saying all along.

                                      NANCY
                      And you'll be here to catch
                      him, right?

                                      PARKER
                      Lieutenant -- they're waiting
                      upstairs.

      THOMPSON waves curtly, still speaking to NANCY.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Sure, okay, I'll be there.
                      Now you just turn in and get
                      some rest, sweetheart.  Please.
                      Deal?

                                      NANCY
                      Deal.

      NANCY hangs up.  LT THOMPSON starts upstairs.  But then he stops,
      and as an afterthought he could never really explain, turns to
      PARKER.

                                      LT THOMPSON (CONTD)
                      Get outside and watch her house.
                      If you see anything funny call
                      me.

                                      PARKER
                      'Anything funny' like what?

      THOMPSON shakes his head, embarassed.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      I don't know -- but one thing
                      for sure, I don't want her 
                      coming over here.  She's way 
                      too far gone to be able to
                      to handle this.

      As PARKER exits, ANGLE CUTS TO NANCY'S KITCHEN as the girl hangs
      up and sinks back agiainst the wall, trapped by her own
      resolution.  She looks at her watch.

169.  INSERT -- five past midnight.  NANCY switches modes to stopwatch   169.
      and sets the COUNTDOWN going at twenty-five minutes.


170.  INT.  GLEN'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      170.

      LT THOMPSON steps into GLEN's room, anxious to be done with it.
      He hits a wall of stench and horror even before he takes it in
      with his eyes, and as soon as he sees the bed he claps his hand
      over his mouth, pivots and walks right back into the hallway.


171.  INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             171.

      He sags against the wall, unable to look at the COPS who hover
      there.

                                      COP
                              (faint)
                      What the hell did that,
                      Lieutenant?  There ain't even
                      a head left.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Goddamed if I know.
                              (tries to straighten)
                      What's the Coronor say?

                                      COP
                      He's in the john puking since 
                      he saw it.


172.  INT.  CELLAR.  NIGHT.                                              172.

      NANCY pulls tools and hardware out with grim resolution.  Hammer,
      nails, spools of wire, an old square of heavy fishneting, some
      old shot gun shells, a file -- referring only once to the booklet
      in her hand.


173.  INT.  NANCY'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                 173.

      Barely able to control her shaking hands, NANCY starts stringing
      off the spool of wire across the living room, crying and swearing
      at the same time.

      DISSOLVE TO HER HANDS wrapping bare lamp wire around two
      thumbtacks stuck into the insides of the pinchers of a common
      wooden clothespin.  The wire goes OFF SCREEN.

      ANOTHER ANGLE as she inserts a Lifesaver between the two prongs.
      One end of the fishline is tied to the lifesaver.  The whole now
      is stretched taut about three inches off the living room carpet.

      ON NANCY carefully filing a hole in a LIGHTBULB.

      OH HER pouring powder and shot from shotgun shells into the
      opening in the bulb until it's full, then sealing it with tape.

      DISSOLVE TO HER screwing the bulb back into the floor lamp, and
      placing the thing near the foot of the stairs.

175.  INT.  NANCY'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                            175.

      -- NANCY completes installing a sturdy sliding bolt to the
      outside of her own bedroom door.

      -- NANCY screws a hinge into the wall directly above her door.
      Attached to the hinge is the shank of something -- some kind of
      tool.  We can't see what it is because CAMERA never quite frames
      the whole thing.

      -- NANCY tiptoes to her mother's door and peeks in.

	
176.  INT.  MARGE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     176.

      MARGE lies propped in her bed looking back at NANCY.  Her
      drunkeness has been altered by the SIRENS and BABBLE outside into
      a sort of comatose clarity.

                                      MARGE
                      Guess I should'n'a done it.

                                      NANCY
                      Just sleep now, Mom.

                                      MARGE
                      Just wanted to protect you,
                      Nan.  Just wanted to protect
                      you...

      MARGE slides over on her side.  NANCY smooths her hair, covers her
      as she would a child, then exits the room.

178.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        178.

      The girl enters, turns out her bedside light, slips out of her
      dress and puts on her nightgown.  Then she kneels by her bed.

                                      NANCY (quietly)
                      Now I lay me down to sleep,
                      I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
                      If I should die before I wake,
                      I pray the Lord my soul to take.

      She gets into bed and pulls the blankets to her chin.

      CLOSE ON NANCY's face.  She stares straight up at the ceiling for
      a long moment, then closes her eyes.

                                                 CUT TO:


179.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  179.

      LT THOMPSON trudges down the stais and confronts GLEN'S FATHER.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      I know it's hard to think at
                      a time like this, Walter, but
                      can you think of anyone who
                      could've done such a thing?

      The father stares away, his voice low and dull.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      He done it.

      THOMPSON looks at the man, baffled.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Who?  Who did that?

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Krueger.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Krueger?

      The father gives him the strangest look.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Had to've done it.  No one
                      else was in there.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      How you know that?

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Cause I thought Glen was 
                      gonna sneak out to see your
                      lunatic daughter, that's why.
                      So I locked him in his room!
                              (getting control)
                      Sorry.  Anyways, the door was
                      still locked when we heard the
                      screams.

      He blinks.

                                      MR LANTZ (CONTD)
                      Maybe god's punishing us all...

                                      LT THOMPSON
                              (much lower and hard)
                      Keep your head -- this is a
                      fucking flesh and blood killer
                      we're talking about.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Like Rod Lane?

      A voice calls down from upstairs.

                                      COP (OS)
                      Lieutenant Thompson.  Coronor
                      wants to show you something.

      THOMPSON gives MR LANTZ one final look, then heads upstairs.

                                              CUT TO:


      NOTE: These rewrites of scenes 180 and 180 A replace NANCY
      walking through the 'dream streets' at night, and NANCY
      approaching the huge deserted building at night, prior to her
      entering the Boiler Room the final time.


180.  INT.  DOWNSTAIRS, NANCY'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                           180.

      LOW ANGLE UP STAIRS as NANCY appears at head.  As she comes
      downstairs, CAMERA MOVES WITH HER through the hallway to the
      cellar door.  She opens the door.


180A. INT.  NANCY'S CELLAR.  NIGHT.                                      180A.

      NANCY appears at top of these stairs, hesitates, then comes down.

      WIDER as NANCY approaches center of room, stops in CU, then turns
      eyes.  We HEAR the distant SOUND of the boiler room now, faint
      but unmistakeable.  NANCY MOVES, and CAMERA PANS HER to the
      cellar's side WALL, where another, new doorway is REVEALED.
      NANCY opens this door and looks down.  FIRELIGHT is on NANCY'S
      face now, and the SOUND of the Boiler Room is very clear.  NANCY
      goes through the door.


180B. INT.  BOILER ROOM.                                                 180B.

      NANCY decends like Orpheus into hell, but without weapon save her
      wits.

      She decends a steel stair to the lowest level, then hears the
      SOUND of the knives from down another shaft.  She sees there's an
      even deeper place down there.  She starts down.

      Again, and then again, NANCY decends, each ladder narrower or
      more twisting, each level deeper, wetter, darker, more airless.
      Soon she's gasping for air, but still she pushes herself on. She
      doesn't stop until she breaks out at last at the very bottom of
      the place, a wet, firelit sump deep in the bowels of the place.

      CAMERA NOW PANS AROUND WITH HER, and for the first time we SEE
      the vast maul of the empty boiler behind her.

      She stares at it.  It's seething with some dark WIND that soughs
      and whines like a huge dying dog.

      NANCY crosses to it, touching the pile of old, coal-dusted dirt
      at its base.  It looks almost like an old grave.

      She turns suddenly, listening.  Then, hearing nothing, she looks
      down.

      NANCY'S POV as she picks up GLEN's earphones.

      WIDER as she suddenly drops them, staring at her fingers.
      They're dripping blood.

      There's another BEEP.

180C. INSERT ON NANCY'S WATCH -- the COUNT-DOWN a blur of black digits   180C.
      counting down to zero.  They've just crossed the ten minute
      warning.

180D. CLOSE ON NANCY'S FACE.  She speaks into the night.                 180D.

                                      NANCY
                              (quietly)
                      Come out and show yourself,
                      you bastard.

      No sooner are these words off her lips than the huge bulk of FRED
      KRUEGER lurches up behind her!  The man is even more hideous
      hatless, his bald head and tormented face veiled in skeins of
      ruined flesh, his ragged teeth barred, the great spider of
      razor-blades flashing from his fingertips.

      He leaps, but the girl leaps just as fast, a fierce jump,
      that sends her out over black space and down into a huge, dark
      sump of blackness.


180E. EXT.  THE HEAVENS.  NIGHT.                                         180E.

      CLOSE ANGLE ON NANCY as she curves like a swan though her
      apogee, and begins falling, diving, planing through black air,
      the wind ripping at her hair and eyes.  Suddenly the complex,
      glittering skein of light that is the San Fernando Valley seen
      from the air slides INTO FRAME, and we see she's falling from
      high, high over the earth.

      NANCY falls, falls in slow motion against the spinning lights,
      free as a sky diver freefalling -- a giddy, acrophobic plunge.


181,182,183,184 OMIT                                    OMIT 181,182,183,184

185.  EXT.  ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                            185.

      NANCY crashes suddenly out of the night and into a hedge just
      outside her own front door, rolling out at its bottom scratched
      and bloodied.  If she were in any normal reality she'd be a mass
      of broken bones -- but somehow she's able to claw her way up and
      look at her watch once more.

      INSERT.  Just a few seconds from zero.

      She staggers for her house's front door -- but a moment later
      KRUEGER crashes down atop her!  NANCY struggles to her knees just
      as the man lunges with that godawful handful of blades.  But
      instead of running, she ducks inside the deadly grab and seizes
      him in a desperate bearhug!

      The surprise move sends him pitching backwards, her still on him
      --and they fall into the jumble of torn-down trellis of roses
      beneath her window.  Almost at that very second we HEAR the
      jarring, deafening RINGING of NANCY's alarm clock!

                                              SMASH CUT TO:


186.  INT.  NANCY'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     186.

      NANCY sprawls out of her bed onto the floor, twisting from the
      jabs of the already vanished thorns, briars and brush.  Gasping,
      she takes a second to get her bearings

      ANGLE ON THE BED as she recovers quick as she can, snatching up
      the net, ready for an assault from any direction.

      But the room is empty.

      Hardly able to catch her breath, her hair tangled, her nightgown
      torn, she drops the net.  She sits on the bed, turns on the
      bedside lamp and re-examines her room.  No one there but herself.

      It's a terrible blow, despite the fact that she's safe.  Her face
      is covered with tears, she's shaking and breathless.  She rattles
      her head in confusion and despair, realizing her own madness.

                                      NANCY
                      I'm crazy after all...

      At that very instant FRED KRUEGER leaps up from the far side of
      the bed with an EXPLOSIVE SHOUT of rage!

      He lunges across the table for her, missing by inches as NANCY
      pitches backwards and scrambles for the window.  But she's
      stopped by the bars.

      KRUEGER, incredibly fast, regains his feet and leaps again -- the
      girl wheels and shatters the coffeepot over his head.  As he
      crashes backwards NANCY flings open the door of her room and
      dives through -- only to rebound off someone on the other side --


187.  INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             187.

      MARGE, knocked flying by NANCY'S charge, hits the floor hard,
      knocking the wind out of herself.  NANCY sees what she's done,
      jumps over the body and slams the door and throws the new bolt
      home.  Next instant she gingerly ties a string to the door's
      knob, a string that trails down from the ceiling, attached to
      something up there that's still just barely out of sight.

      Next instant she's dragging her MOTHER towards the woman's
      bedroom as fast as she can.

      KRUEGER is already splintering the doorway behind her as NANCY
      dips and makes it into MARGE's room, SLAMMING the DOOR behind her
      and locking it in a flash.

      The MANIAC breaks the bolt and rips open the door.

      But the in the very act of doing this he of course unknowingly
      pulls the string attached to the outside doorknob with terrific
      force.

      CLOSE ANGLE ON THE CEILING.  The string jerks against a
      single-edged razor, which in turn cuts a tight wind of cord
      holding a heavy wedge of steel to the ceiling.

      WIDER as the thing falls free, pivoting at the hinge at the far
      end of its handle, and drives straight into KRUEGER'S groin with
      a terrific blow.  As he catapaults backwards with an incredulous
      shriek, the twenty pound sledge hammer swings back and reveals to
      camera just what it is!

      ANGLE DOWN ON KRUEGER, clawwing his way up despite his agony,
      lurching and cursing forward like an enraged bull.

      WIDER ANGLE IN THE HALLWAY as KRUEGER roars out -- only to
      immediately strike the length of WIRE strung across the hallway,
      catching it just above the thigh.  He cartwheels head-over-heels
      and lands flat on his back!

      Instantly the DOOR to NANCY's MOTHER's bedroom flies open and
      NANCY brings a brass lamp down over KRUEGER's head with all her
      might!  It sounds like a line-drive caroming off a metal
      flagpole.

      NANCY SLAMS the DOOR as KRUEGER struggles up, clutching his
      head.

      Enraged, the huge man CRASHES against the door with terrific
      force, and rears back and starts smashing against the door like
      the utter homicidal lunatic that he is.

                                                   CUT TO:


188.  EXT.  ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                             188.

      HIGH ANGLE at the second floor level.  NANCY jerks open the
      window to her MOTHER's bedroom and jams her face to the bars.
      The AMBULANCE is pulling away with a tremendous WAIL of its SIREN
      as NANCY SCREAMS down, trying to make herself heard.

                                      NANCY
                      Help!  Hey -- Daddy -- I got
                      him trapped!  Where are you!?

189.  ANGLE ON the street.  PARKER, assigned to guard the house, sees    189.
      NANCY -- hair white, eyes wide -- pounding on the bars and
      screaming like a lunatic.  But her meaning is utterly lost in the
      noise of the ambulance next to him.

                                      PARKER
                              (yelling up at her)
                      Everything's going to be all
                      right!  Everything's under
                      control!

      ANGLE at the window.  Close on NANCY's face, incredulous at his
      response.

                                      NANCY
                      Get my father, you asshole!

      PARKER does a little take.  That almost sounded sane.

                                      PARKER (OS)
                      You heard what I said!  Now get
                      back inside or I'll tell your
                      dad!

191.  Behind her the DOOR SPLINTERS.  NANCY whirls around just in time   191.
      to see KRUEGER bull in!  NANCY's eyes go wide -- she's trapped
      against the bars and has nowhere to go.  The man bunches his
      knives into a single thick blade and rushes her, stabbing.  NANCY
      closes her eyes --

      Then from OUT OF FRAME Marge leaps between the two.

                                      MARGE
                      No!

      She blocks the charge perfectly -- blocking the knives.
      Both she and NANCY are slammed backwards against the bars
      behind.
      Drunk though she is, is hanging onto KRUEGER'S weapon hand,
      keeping the knives inside herself, away from her daughter!

                                      MARGE
                      Nancy -- for god's sake's run!

      But NANCY turns to the window instead, screaming for her father.

                                      NANCY
                      Daddy!  Where are you!


192.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          192.

      PARKER, just about to turn back to the business at GLEN's house,
      sees NANCY and SOMEONE else fall just inside the window.
      Something begins to dawn on the man.  Just a little.

                                      PARKER
                      Poor woman's got her hands full 
                      with that kid.  Maybe I better 
                      tell the lieutenant.

      He turns and jogs towards GLEN's house.


193.  INT.  MARGE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     193.

      ANGLE ON KRUEGER, hauling MARGE up in rage, knocking her
      senseless across her bed and climbing after her with his knives
      raised.  NANCY wheels behind him and whams him in the kidneys
      with her fists, spilling him back off the bed, then running past
      him for the door.  She makes it to safety,
      then turning back.  She flips the monster the bird, her eyes wild
      with pain and fury.

                                      NANCY
                      Hey fuckface -- can't catch me!

      The bait works -- KRUEGER leaves MARGE and howls after NANCY.


194.  INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                    194.

      As NANCY clears the hall and makes the stairs, KRUEGER lurches
      through the shattered doorway after her.


195.  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         195.

      The girl careens down the stairs, across the room and to the
      front door, banging against it with terrified fury.

                                      NANCY
                              (screaming)
                      Come on -- he's in here!
                      Daddy!  Don't let him kill
                      me too!

      Behind her the huge MAN is thumping down the stairs, KNOCKING
      THINGS OVER, SCRAPING his LONG STEEL FINGERNAILS along the wall
      with a horrible sound!

      NANCY flings a heavy ash tray through the porch window and
      screams through the bars.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      HEELLLPPP!!!  Daddyyyyyyy!!!!

      KRUEGER, bloody and spewwing threats, staggers for her -- NANCY
      dives behind the couch.

      CLOSE ON KRUEGER'S FEET as they hit another wire.

      CLOSE ON the Lifesaver jerking out -- the clothespin snapping
      together, completing the circuit with a CRACKLING SPARK.

      WIDER ON THE EXPLOSION that rips out of the floor lamp next to
      KRUEGER and knocks him sprawling across the room.

      NANCY peeks out from behind the couch.  The man lies in a smoking
      heap.  NANCY runs to the windows and screams out again.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Hey -- Daddy!  Hey!  I got the
                      bastard!

      KRUEGER roars up behind her -- she throws herself sideways -- he
      crashes into the window frame, smashing glass and wood to bits.

      NANCY turns SCREAMING and runs deeper into the house.


196.  OMIT                                                               196.

197.  INT.  CELLAR.  NIGHT.                                              197.

      She careens down the stairs, throwing on the lights, the man
      thundering after her.

      ANGLE AT THE FAR END OF THE CELLAR.  NANCY brakes at the wall.
      Nowhere left to hide.

      THE SCRAPPING of the blades against brick turns her to see the
      huge killer holding his knife-laden fingers up for her.

                                      KRUEGER
                      Ready for these?

198.  ON NANCY -- she ducks behind the furnace -- comes out the other    198.
      side with the big jug of gasoline and lets KRUEGER have it
      straight over the head.  The heavy container shatters, showering
      its contents over every square inch of the man.

      He staggers backwards with a ROAR of fury, NANCY screaming after
      him with a box of kitchen matches.  Before the man can realize
      what she's up to, she ignites the whole box and throws it in
      KRUEGER's face.

      There's a blinding WHOOSH -- and KRUEGER goes up in a terrific
      BALL OF FIRE.  Faster than a flash the girl runs past the howling
      maniac and makes for the stairs, KRUEGER after her in full
      pyrrhic rage.


199.  INT.  NANCY'S KITCHEN.  NIGHT.                                     199.

      NANCY holds the heavy door until the precisely right moment.
      Just as the burning, blind monster tops the stairs, NANCY brings
      the heavy oak door round with all her might and catches him in a
      great RINGING CONCUSSION.  It sends him windmilling backwards and
      down the stairs in an ass-over-teakettle sprawl of sparks and
      flames.

      NANCY slams the door and throws the deadbolt home.

      No sooner does she accomplish this than the man is SLAMMING again
      and again against the door from the cellar.
                           The terrible SCREAMS and CURSES PEAK,
      THEN GROW WEAKER AND MORE GARBLED.  Then there's just silence.

      NANCY staggers, half blind, from the kitchen.

      As the room begins seething SMOKE from every pore, we

                                              CUT TO:


200.  INT.  GLEN'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                             200.

      The CORONER steps out of the bathroom peeling bloody rubber
      gloves.  Pale and sweating.

                                      CORONER
                      Found you something, Donald.
                      Should remind you of something...

      The man shoves out his hand to LT THOMPSON.  THOMPSON stares at
      it without touching it.  A long, thin steel blade, razor sharp,
      attached to some sort of ring and armature -- broken off...

	The CORONER gives a sweaty, grim smile.

                                      CORONER (CONTD)
                      Only place I ever heard of such
                      a thing before was ten years
                      ago.  Remember that fucker
                      Fred Krueger?

      LT THOMPSON has just knocked PARKER sprawling in his race to the
      stairs.

                                      PARKER
                      Hey -- your daughter's acting 
                      kinda -- !
                              (THOMPSON'S gone)
                      Strange...


201.  EXT.  NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                                        201.

      CRASH as NANCY breaks another window and presses against the
      bars.  The house shudders and glows orange behind her.  She sees
      her father bursting out the front door of Glen's house!

                                      NANCY
                      DAD!  GET US OUTTA HERE!

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!
                              (to his men)
                      Hey!  We got a fire!

202.  ANGLE ON NANCY'S FRONT DOOR.  Many MEN batter the door down as     202.
      black smoke pours from the windows and NANCY's SCREAMS and SHOUTS
      fill the air.  Within moments they've destroyed the door and LT
      THOMPSON has pulled his daughter into the safety of his arms.
      But NANCY immediately fights free and darts right back to the
      front door -- beckoning him to follow -- gesturing like a wild
      woman.

                                      NANCY 
                      I got him -- I got Fred Krueger!

      THOMPSON stares at his wild little girl in astonishment, then
      runs in after her.  The others follow, coughing and choking.


203.  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         203.

      THOMPSON collides with NANCY as she brakes, frozen.  THE SMOKE IS
      BELCHING OUT OF THE CELLAR, but whoever was locked in there
      certainly isn't now.  The door is flat on the kitchen floor.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      What the hell are you talking about,
                      Nancy?

      NANCY wheels without answering.  A series of tiny, isolated fires
      burn across the living room and up the stairs.  Firesteps.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      He's after Mom!  Come on!

      She darts across the living room, following the flaming
      footprints of FRED KRUEGER up the stairs before THOMPSON can stop
      her.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      NANCY!


204.  INT.  MARGE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     204.

      NANCY STOPS IN THE SPLINTERED DOORWAY -- a ragged gold-red light
      splashing her horrified face.

205.  REVERSE IN HER POV -- FRED KRUEGER, literally a man of fire, has   205.
      a screaming MARGE pinned to the bed and is crawling all over
      her!  NANCY gives a banshee's howl, snatches up a chair and
      brings it down over the back of the firey beast, stunning him.

      By the time LT THOMPSON races into the room NANCY'S seized a
      heavy blanket has thrown over both of them, fighting the flames.
      The father joins his daughter without a second thought, heaving
      another blanket over the bed and smothering the last of the
      flames.

                                      NANCY
                      He's under there!  Watch it!

206.  THOMPSON pushes the girl back -- yanks out his .38 and pulls off   206.
      the first cover.  No movement.  He pulls back a second one,
      ready to fire.  But the only thing he sees is the blackened
      half-skeleton of his ex-wife, smoking and seething and sinking
      into the fluid-like mattress, sinking right down through it as if
      she were sinking into a lake.  A blackened, gnarled hand goes
      last, then the bed solidifies over the place she's disappeared.
      And it's as if no one was ever there.
 
      NANCY turns and looks at LT THOMPSON, her face white as her
      ghostly hair.  THOMPSON shoves his .38 back in its holster and
      finds a cigarette, his hands shaking so badly he can barely
      manage.

                                      NANCY
                      Now do you believe me?

      PARKER barges in.  The room is filled with smoke, the bed is
      stripped, but other than that, the place seems normal.

                                      PARKER
                      You find him?
                              (looking closer
                               at THOMPSON)
                      Sir?

      LT THOMPSON just walks by him.  PARKER chases after.

                                      PARKER (CONTD OS)
                              (fading)
                      Sir -- here, let me light that
                      for you -- Lieutenant?  What 
                      happened?
                              (gone)

      WIDER, ON NANCY alone in the room.  She turns and looks at the
      bed.  MUSIC slips in and builds.  The bed has changed color.
      It's now an ash-darkened red and yellow.

207.  CLOSER ON NANCY from the direction of the bed.  MUSIC SUDDENLY     207.
      STOPS, and the surface of the red and yellow bed gets a bump in
      its center that keeps raising, raising until it's a hump that's a
      head and shoulders, still raising until it looms over NANCY.

      Then FRED KRUEGER's entire shape sweeps up into the yellow and
      red mass -- and the garish head, smoking and seething, pops
      through.

      NEW ANGLE -- KRUEGER, a burned, sizzling black hump of a killer,
      clumps onto the floor between NANCY and the door.

      NANCY falls absoltely still, and her face goes through a
      strange, almost sublime transformation.

                                      NANCY
                              (quietly)
                      I know you're there, Krueger.

      She turns and faces him.

                                      FREDDIE
                      You think you was gonna get
                      away from me?

      NANCY shakes her head.

                                      NANCY
                      I know you too well now,
                      Freddie.

      KRUEGER smiles bitterly.  Coming closer.

                                      FREDDY
                      And now you die...

      There's a SLICKERING RATTLE at his side, and he raises the only
      thing on him not charred -- the gleaming steel talons.

208.  NANCY simply shakes her head again, as if seeing a light at the    208.
      end of her long, long tunnel.  And the way she says the words,
      they might be appearing on the inside of her eyes.

                                      NANCY
                      It's too late, Krueger.  I
                      know the secret now -- this
                      is just a dream, too -- you're
                      not alive -- the whole thing
                      is a dream -- so fuck off!
                      I want my mother and friends
                      again.

      KRUEGER grins insanely, confused and amused at the same time.

                                      FREDDIE
                      You what?

                                      NANCY
                              (even, firm)
                      I take back every bit of
                      energy I ever gave you.
                      You're nothing.  You're
                      shit.

      And then she turns her back on him.  KRUEGER bunches his
      fingers, producing a single ragged bundle of razor talons and
      raises his hand over the back of her head and neck.

      NANCY closes her eyes and steps to the door.

      CLOSE ON HER HAND, touching the door knob.

      CLOSE ON KRUEGER'S KNIFE-FINGERS poised.

      MUSIC BUILDS then SHRIEKS as KRUEGER stabs down, right through
      NANCY -- as if she were an optical illusion -- loosing his
      balance and falling down, down, down...  And he's gone.

                                              CUT TO:


209.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  DAY.                                            209.

      CLOSE ON NANCY'S FRONT DOOR AS NANCY jerks it open and blinks in
      the bright, diffused light.  The MUSIC FADES on a transitional
      note, into light.

      We hear BIRDS.

      CHILDREN playing.

      Early morning SOUNDS.

                                      NANCY
                              (to herself)
                      God, it's bright.

      MARGE sticks her head out, squinting, and nods.  Sober.

                                      MARGE
                      Gonna burn off soon or it
                      wouldn't be so bright.

      NANCY turns and looks her mother over.

                                      NANCY
                      Feeling better?

                                      MARGE
                      They say you've bottomed out
                      when you can't remember the
                      night before.
                              (shakes her head)
                      No more drinking, Baby, suddenly
                      I just don't feel like it
                      any more.

      She touches NANCY.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Didn't keep you up last night,
                      did I?  You look a little 
                      peeked.

      NANCY smiles.

                                      NANCY
                      Nah.  Just slept heavy.

      The girl gives a wave and goes off.  MARGE calls after.

                                      MARGE
                      See ya.

      NANCY turns and waves.

                                      NANCY
                      See ya.

210.  WIDER ON NANCY as she walks to the curb.  The whole scene is       210.
      wrapped in an unseasonal tule fog, bright yet diffuse.  We notice
      that NANCY's house no longer has bars on its windows.  Then we
      see a familiar convertible pull up at the curb, top down.  TINA
      and ROD are in the back seat.  They all wave to MARGE as NANCY
      climbs in.

                                      GLEN
                              (calling)
                      You believe this fog?

                                      MARGE
                              (laughs)
                      I believe anything's possible.

      TINA slaps five with NANCY.

                                      TINA
                      Lookin' good, girl!

      ANGLE INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE.  GLEN slips into the seat next to
      NANCY.  Someone else is driving, it seems.  NANCY looks up to the
      DRIVER.  The big MAN turns and grins at NANCY, a terrible,
      scarred, hideous leer of a grin -- FRED KRUEGER'S grin!

      ANGLE BACK OUTSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE as its top clamps over the
      kids within -- a bright red and yellow top that closes as fast
      and hard as a beartrap!  NANCY'S frightened face flies to the
      window, pressing against the thick glass as the car roars away
      from the curb and into the thick fog.

211.  CAMERA PANS TO a group of LITTLE GIRLS, half-hidden by the fog,    211.
      jumping rope and singing gayly.

                                      GIRLS
                      One two --
                      Freddy's coming for you!
                      Three four --
                      Better lock your door!
                      Five six --
                      Get your Crucifix
                      Seven eight --
                      Gonna stay up late!
                      Nine ten --
                      Never sleep again!

      MUSIC CROSSFADES WITH THIS SONG, expanding the simple tune to
      symphonic, boundless dimensions as the little girls fade into
      thin air, and we

                      A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET












1A.   INT.  (MONTAGE).                                                   1A.

      NIGHTMARE MUSIC THEME begins as we FADE UP on a SERIES OF SHOTS,
      all CLOSE and teasing.

              -- A man's FEET, in shabby work shoes, stalking
                 through a junk bin in a dark, fire-lit, ash-
                 dusted place.  A huge BOILER ROOM is what it
                 is, although we only glimpse it piecemeal.
                 Then we SEE a MAN'S HAND, dirty and nail-bitten,
                 reach INTO FRAME and pick up a piece of METAL.

              -- ANOTHER ANGLE as the HAND grabs a grimey
                 WORKGLOVE and slashes at it with a straight
                 razor, until its fingertips are off.

              -- CLOSE ON SAME HANDS dumping four fishing knives
                 out of a filthy bag.  Their blades are thin,
                 curved, gleaming sharp.

              -- MORE ANGLES, EVEN CLOSER.  We can HEAR the MAN's
                 wheezing BREATHING, but we still haven't seen
                 his face.  We never will.  We just SEE more metal
                 being assembled with crude tools, into some sort
                 of linkage -- a splayed, spidery sort of apparatus,
                 against a background light of FIRE, and a deep
                 rushing of STEAM and HEAVY, DARK ENERGY.

              -- And then we see this linkage attached to the glove.

              -- Then the BLADES attached to all of it.

              -- Then the MAN'S HAND slips into this glove-like
                 apparatus, filling it out and transforming
                 it into an awesome, deadly claw-hand with
                 four razor/talons gleaming at its blackened
                 fingertips.  Suddenly the HAND arches and STRIKES
                 FORWARD, SLASHING THROUGH a DARK CANVAS, tearing
                 it to shreds.


1.    EXT.  LOS ANGELES.  NIGHT.  (2nd Unit)                             1.

      A PULSATION OF LIGHT AND SHADOW.  MUSIC DROPS AWAY to a hushed
      RUSHING OF WIND and DISTANT SIRENS.  CAMERA RACKS INTO FOCUS on a
      HIGH PANORAMA of the San Fernando Valley, its night sky lit from
      within by a strange GREENISH LIGHT.  TITLES BEGIN.

      CAMERA TILTS DOWN and ZOOMS SWIFTLY into the valley's web of
      light.

                                                CUT TO:

     
2.    INT.  CONCRETE PASSAGEWAY.                                         2.

      TITLES CONTINUE as TINA GRAY, a strong girl of fifteen in a thin
      night shift, moves towards us down a dark concrete corridor.  Her
      steps quicken as TITLES appear in the portion of frame she leaves
      free.

      A subliminal COLLAGE of SOUND threads in and out of the MUSIC.
      Distant insane LAUGHTER.  Slamming iron DOORS.  A bleating animal
      CRY.  A LAMB, white and blank-faced, skitters across her path and
      on into the dark.  No reason why it's there.

      Then another SOUND, much nearer -- the slithering SCRAPE of
      something like fingernails across slate.  It sets our teeth on
      edge, twists the MUSIC, and sends TINA running.


3.    INT.  BOILER ROOM.                                                 3.

      Suddenly TINA's a tiny figure running among huge boilers steam
      pipes and catwalks -- a shadowed forest of iron and stone.  She
      stops, listening intently as the SOUND of tiny hooves suddenly
      turns into the rattle of DISTANT RAIN.

      Then she hears RIPPING FABRIC.

      Someone is shouldering behind a ragged screen of dirty canvas,
      approaching TINA.

      CLOSER ON THE CANVAS.  The long curved fingerblades suddenly
      punch through, flashing in the firelight, and begin ripping
      through the thick fabric, as easily as scalpels through flesh.
      They make a hideous, extended RIPPING SOUND.

      TINA rushes away, hands over her ears.

      ANOTHER ANGLE -- as the blinded girl stumbles backwards.  Then
      the canvas flaps free.  The blades are gone.  The TITLES END, and
      everything goes silent.

      CAMERA CIRCLES until TINA's looking right into our eyes.  The
      light from a nearby boiler pours through her thin night dress,
      leaving her naked and vulnerable.  Then a deep, ragged VOICE
      whispers at her as CAMERA CLOSES IN ON HER FACE.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                      One two, Freddie's coming for
                      you...

      TINA opens her mouth to scream but only a dry, yellow dust pours
      out.  And at that precise moment a huge shadowy MAN with a grimey
      red and yellow sweater and a weird hat pulled over his scarred
      face lunges at her.  And it's his fingers that are tipped with
      the long blades of steel, glinting in the boney light and giving
      the hulk the look of an otherworldly predator.

      TINA dodges away, her legs suddenly elephantine and slow.  The
      MAN seizes the trailing hem of her nightgown and hauls her back.

      The MUSIC shrieks as TINA manages to tear free -- the MAN lurches
      after her with a hoarse SHOUT as we --

                                              SMASH CUT TO:


4.    INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      4.

      TINA convulses in bed with a SCREAM, looking around wildly.
      Someone is KNOCKING on her door.

                                      WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                      You okay, Tina?

      TINA'S MOTHER sticks her head in with a worried look.  TINA sits
      up and blows out a breath, groggy.

                                      TINA
                      Just a dream, Ma...
                              (more to herself)
                      Damn dream, is all...

      The woman, once attractive, ventures a step into the room.  A MAN
      hovers BACKGROUND.  TINA'S mother waves him away without looking,
      shoving a strand of bleached hair from her eyes.  She appraises
      her daughter.

                                      TINA'S MOTHER
                      Some dream, judging from that.

      She nods at TINA's nightshift.

      TINA looks down at her nightgown, only now aware of the chill
      penetrating it from the room.  There are four long slashes up its
      middle, cleanly cut as if by scalpels.

                                      MAN (OS)
                              (distant, annoyed)
                      You coming back to the sack or
                      what?

                                      TINA'S MOTHER
                      Hold your horses.
                              (lower, to Tina as she
                               stands to leave)
                      You gotta cut your nails or stop
                      that kind of dreaming, Tina.  One
                      or the other.

      The woman shuts the door behind her.  TINA looks back to her
      nightgown.

                                      TINA
                              (low)
                      Oh, shit.

      She suddenly snatches up the cross that hangs over her head, her
      face white as her sheet.

                                              FADE TO BLACK

                                              BURN ON

5.                            THE FIRST DAY                              5.

                                      CHILDREN (OS)
                              (singing)
                      One two, Freddie's coming for you...
                      Three four better lock your door
                      Five six grab your crucifix...


6.    EXT.  HIGH SCHOOL.  DAY.                                           6.

      FADE UP ON SHOT OF this large highschool and its crowds of
      STUDENTS.  FOREGROUND, TINA climbs out of a cherry-red 1959
      Cadillac convertible with two other students, best friend NANCY
      WILSON, and Nancy's boyfriend and owner of the car, GLEN LANTZ.

      FOREGROUND several GRADESCHOOLERS are playing jump-rope, and the
      old ditty they sing continues unbroken from TINA's bedroom.

                                      ROPE JUMPERS
                      Seven eight, gonna stay up late!
                      Nine ten -- never sleep again!

7.    MOVING ANGLE FAVORING NANCY.  She's a pretty girl in a letter      7.
      sweater, with an easy, athletic stride and the look of a natural
      leader.  GLEN, holding her hand, wears one of the school's
      football jerseys; a good-natured, bright kid.  Tina's in
      mid-conversation.

                                      TINA
                              (referring to kids' song)
                      That's what it reminded me of --
                      that old jump rope song.
                              (shudders)
                      Worst nightmare I ever had.
                      You wouldn't believe it.

      Nancy nods.

                                      NANCY
                      Matter of fact I had a bad dream
                      last night myself...

      TINA turns to NANCY, but before either can say more, ROD LANE, a
      lean, Richard Gere sort in black leather and New Wave studs joins
      up with them and interupts.

                                      ROD
                              (to Tina)
                      Had a hardon this morning when
                      I woke up, Tina.  Had your name
                      written all over it.

      Tina cracks her gum with a look of withering indifference.

                                      TINA
                      There's four letters in my name,
                      Rod.  How could there be room
                      on your joint for four letters?

      The guy's stopped in his tracks.

                                      ROD
                      Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn
                      mower!

      He cuts off across the lawn.

                                      TINA
                      Rod says the sweetest things.

                                      NANCY
                      He's nuts about you.

                                      TINA
                      Yeah, nuts.

      TINA makes a face and rakes her fingernails across a tree as she
      passes.

                                      TINA (CONTD)
                              (yawns)
                      Anyway, I'm too tired to worry
                      about the creep.  Couldn't get
                      back to sleep at all.
                              (beat)
                      So what you dream?

                                      NANCY
                      Forget it, the point is, every-
                      body has nightmares once in a while.
                      No biggy.

                                      GLEN
                      Next time you have one, just
                      tell yourself that's just all
                      it is, right while you're having
                      it, y'know?  That's the trick.
                      Once you do that, you wake right
                      up.  At least it works for me.

      TINA looks at GLEN sharply.  He kisses NANCY and darts off for
      class.

                                      TINA
                      Hey!  You have a nightmare too?

      But GLEN's gone.

                                      TINA (CONTD)
                      Maybe we're gonna have the Big
                      Earthquake.  They say things get
                      weird just before that...

      BELLS ARE RINGING, and STUDENTS crowding; TINA and NANCY are
      drawn into the crush.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


8.    EXT.  A VALLEY STREET.  NIGHT.                                     8.

      ANGLE ON A MODEST HOME; no car, just a couple of BIKES in the
      drive.  Every light in the house and yard is turned on.  We HEAR
      the rock group MADNESS played at a 'No adults home' volume.


9.    INT.  TINA'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  9.

      ON GLEN, dialing.  Nancy and TINA are watching, giggling.

                                      TINA
                      I can't believe his mother let him
                      come over here.

                                      NANCY
                      Right.  Well, she didn't, exactly...

      GLEN shoves a cassette into TINA's Ghetto Blaster.

                                      GLEN
                              (to TINA)
                      See, I got this cousin who lives
                      near the airport, that it's okay
                      for me to stay with, right?  So I
                      found this sound effects tape at
                      Licorice Pizza, and...

      The phone is answered.  GLEN jerks the tone arm off the record
      with a SCRUUPT!!

                                      GLEN (CONTD)
                      Hello, Mom?
                              (pushes the 'play' button)
                      Yeah, out here at Barry's.

      A JET PLANE begins to make itself heard on the tape.  GLEN moves
      the machine closer to the phone.  It's a big plane -- sounds like
      a 747 coming in for a landing.

                                      GLEN (CONT)
                      Huh?  Yeah, noisy as usual.  Glad
                      we don't live here -- huh?  Yeah,
                      Aunt Eunice says hello.

      The Jet is SCREAMING IN now, full flaps and howling like a
      monstrous banshee.  NANCY and TINA dissolve into muffled
      giggles.

                                      GLEN (CONT)
                              (shouting over the din)
                      Right, right -- I'll call you in the
                      morning!  Right!  Huh?  Yeah, sure,
                      I, huh?...

      Suddenly the tape goes silent.  GLEN blanches.  Next moment
      another ENGINE is heard, but this one is a FORD LOTUS screaming
      by at 180 mph.

                                      GLEN (CONT)
                              (reacting to his mother's
                               reaction)
                      Uh... some kid's drag racing
                      outside, I think...

      The sound effect changes abruptly to a SPEEDING SEDAN -- and the
      ages-old SCREECH of BRAKES, last-second SCREAM and horrible
      COLLISION.  NANCY gamely tries to find the right button to turn
      it off, but misses.  There's a loud SCREEK of fast-forward mayhem
      -- Glen improvises desperately.

                                      GLEN (CONT)
                      Listen, Mom, I got to go -- I
                      think there's been an accident out
                      front -- I --

      NANCY jumps back from the cassette player -- WORLD WAR II bursts
      out at top volume -- MACHINE GUNS, HAND GRENADES, DIVING BEARCATS
      and SHOUTS of charging Huns.  GLEN makes a last-ditch dive and
      flings the cassette out of the machine.

      Blessed silence at last.

                                      GLEN (CONT)
                      Right.  I'll call the police.  No,
                      just some neighbors having a fight,
                      I guess.  I'm fine, I'm fine!
                      Call you in the morning!

      He hangs up and sags back.

                                      NANCY
                      Worked like a charm.

                                      GLEN
                      Jesus.

      TINA shoves another cassette in, and MICHAEL JACKSON'S 'THRILLER'
      blasts from the STEREO.  The kids relax, the CAMERA GLIDES PAST
      THEM TO THE WINDOW.

      The WIND is moving the bare TREE BRANCH outside.  CAMERA PANS
      BACK to the comfortably threadbare room, uneasy.  We see NANCY
      poking at a flame in the hearth as TINA comes FOREGROUND to draw
      the drapes.

                                      NANCY
                      Nice to have a fire.

                                      TINA
                      Really.  Turn 'er up a little.

      NANCY turns a nearby valve handle, and the gas fire climbs
      brightly over its artificial log.  TINA joins her, heartened.

                                      NANCY
                      Maybe we should call Rod, have him
                      come over too.  He might get jealous.

                                      TINA
                      Rod and I are done.  He's too much
                      of a maniac.

                                      GLEN
                      He should join the Marines, they
                      could make something out of him.
                      Like a hand grenade.

      TINA laughs despite herself.  NANCY brightens.

                                      NANCY
                      See?  You've forgotten the bad
                      dream.  Didn't I tell you?

      TINA shakes her head, wishing she had forgotten.

                                      TINA
                      All day long I been seeing that
                      guy's weird face, and hearing
                      those fingernails...

      NANCY looks up with a flinch.

                                      NANCY
                      Fingernails?
                              (blinks, laughing)
                      That's amazing, you saying that.
                      It made me remember the dream I
                      had last night.

      TINA looks up.

                                      TINA
                      What you dream?

                                      NANCY
                      I dreamed about this guy in a
                      dirty red and yellow sweater;
                      I dream in color, y'know; he
                      walked into the room I was in,
                      right, right through the wall,
                      like it was smoke or something,
                      and just stared at me.  Sort of
                      ...obscenely.  Then he walked
                      out through the wall on the
                      other side.  Like he'd just
                      come to check me out...

      The story has left the room deathly quiet.  Especially TINA seems
      effected.

                                     TINA
                              (quietly)
                      So what about the fingernails?

      NANCY remembers, imitating the frightful coincidence.

                                      NANCY
                      He scraped his fingernails
                      along things -- actually, they
                      were more like fingerknives or
                      something, like he'd made them
                      himself?  Anyway, they made
                      this horrible nose --
                              (imitates)
                      sssssccrrrtttt....

      TINA pales.

                                      TINA
                      Nancy.  You dreamed about the
                      same creep I did, Nancy...

      The girls stare at each other.

                                      GLEN
                      That's impossible.

      They look at him.  He looks away, as if suddenly listening.

                                      TINA
                      What?

                                      GLEN
                      Nothing.

                                      TINA
                      There's somebody out there,
                      isn't there...

                                      NANCY
                      I didn't hear anything...

      Then there's an unmistakeable SOUND.  A distinct SCRAPING against
      the house, just outside the window.  Something multiple, thin and
      sharp.  Something like metal fingernails.  NANCY's mouth opens a
      fraction of an inch.


10.   EXT.  FRONT OF HOUSE.  NIGHT.                                      10.

      CLOSE ON FRONT DOOR as a BOLT UNLOCKS, a KEY TURNS, a CHAIN is
      REMOVED.  At last the door swings open and GLEN swaggers out.

                                      GLEN
                      I'm gonna punch out your ugly
                      lights, whoever you are.

      No answer but a slight RUSTLE in the bushes.  GLEN does a 180 and
      walks right back inside.  The girls prod him right back out,
      giddy with giggling fear.

                                      GLEN
                      It's just a stupid cat.

                                      NANCY
                      Then bring us back its tail
                      and whiskers.

      The girls push him farther.  GLEN edges towards the shadows.
      Then the SCRITCHING again.  GLEN stops; TINA edges back into the
      house.

                                      TINA
                      Anyway, I don't have a cat...

      ANGLE INTO THE SHADOWS.  Turned from the girls, GLEN sobers,
      listening.  IN HIS POV we see the street.  Silent houses.
      Motionless trees on empty lawns.

                                      GLEN
                      Kitty-kitty?  Chow chow chow?

      Not a living, or dead, soul.  GLEN turns back to the girls with a
      shrug.  Instantly, a large FIGURE pounces and throws him to the
      ground with a shout.

      The girls SCREAM in panic and run for the house.

11.   REVERSE -- ROD leaps up and shouts like a sportscaster --          11.

                                      ROD
                      And it's number thirty-six, Rod
                      Lane, bringing Lantz down just
                      three yards from the goal with a
                      brilliant tackle!  And the fans
                      go wild!

      ROD dances into the light, flashing a wild gypsy's grin at TINA.
      The girl's relieved and frightened at the same time.

                                      TINA
                      What the hell you doing here?

                                      ROD
                      Came to make up, no big deal.
                      Your ma home?

                                      TINA
                      Of course.  What's that?

      ROD takes the spindly hand rake he's found and scraps the house's
      wall.  It makes a terrible SCRIIITCHING SOUND.  He grins and
      tosses it aside.

                                      ROD
                      Intense, huh?
                              (sizes up the three)
                      So what's happening, an orgy or
                      something?

                                      GLEN
                      Maybe a funeral, you dickhead.

      ROD wheels, a knife suddenly in his hand, as if ready to take
      Glen's throat out.  NANCY breaks between --

                                      NANCY
                      -- Just a sleep-over date, Rod.
                      Just Tina and me.  Glen was just
                      leaving.

      ROD eyes GLEN, laughs and flips the knife closed and away,
      putting his arm around TINA's shoulder and laughing as if it's
      all a great joke.

                                      ROD
                      You see his face?
                              (lower)
                      Your ma ain't home, is she?
                              (to Nancy & Glen)
                      Me and Tina got stuff to discuss.

      He pulls TINA inside without further ceremony.

                                      NANCY
                      Rod...

      But ROD's already got himself and TINA halfway through the living
      room, heading into the darker part of the house.

                                      ROD
                      We got her mother's bed.
                      You two got the rest.

      ANGLE BACK ON GLEN AND NANCY.

                                      NANCY
                      We should get her out of here...

      TINA darts to the front door, her blouse half out.

                                      TINA
                      Hey -- you guys're hanging around --
                      right?
                              (fake laughing/whine)
                      Don't leave me alone with this
                      lunatic -- Pleeeeze, NANCY!

      She disappears.  GLEN looks at NANCY.  Too innocent.

                                      GLEN
                      So we'll guard her together.
                      Through the night.
                              (moving closer)
                      In each others' arms like
                      we always said.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen.  Not now.  I mean,
                      we're here for Tina now,
                      not for ourselves.

      She kisses him lightly, then pushes him back.

                                      GLEN
                              (frustrated)
                      Why's she so bothered by a
                      stupid nightmare, anyway?

                                     NANCY
                      Because he was scary, that's
                      why.

                                     GLEN
                      Who was scary?

      NANCY turns and looks at him.

                                     NANCY
                      Don't you think it's weird, her
                      and me dreaming about the same
                      guy?
                              (GLEN looks away;
                               NANCY stares closer)
                      You didn't have a bad dream
                      last night, did you?

      GLEN gives her a funny look.

                                      GLEN
                      Me?  I don't dream.

      He takes her inside.  Over the SOUNDS of locks falling shut we

                                              FADE TO BLACK


13.   INT.  TINA'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  13.

      FADE UP ON an old 50's CLOCK, one of those set into the black
      plaster body of a stalking panther.  It's just past 2 AM.

      PAN the cold hearth and darkened living room to REVEAL GLEN on
      the couch, cacooned in sheets.  He's listening miserably to the
      SOUNDS OF LOVEMAKING coming from the next room.  TINA peaks, ROD
      howls.  Then silence.

                                      GLEN
                      Morality sucks.

                                                      CUT TO:


14.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                             14.

      This is a slightly larger room than TINA's.  Adult.  Female.
      Spare in its appointments.  The streetlight throws the narrow bed
      into broken shadow and light.  TINA AND ROD lie in each other's
      arms in the middle of the big bed.  Satiated.

                                      TINA
                      I knew there was sometihng
                      about you I liked...

      ROD yawns into the pillows, happy.

                                      ROD
                      You feel better now, right?

                                      TINA
                      Jungle man fix Jane.

                                      ROD
                      No more fights?

                                      TINA
                      No more fights.

                                      ROD
                              (sleepily)
                      Good.  No more nightmares for
                      either of us then.

      He pulls the covers over his head.  He's almost out already.

                                      TINA
                              (beat)
                      When did you have a nightmare?

                                      ROD
                              (under the blankets)
                      Guys can have nightmares too,
                      y'know.  You ain't got a corner
                      on the fucking market or something.

      He rolls over, practically snoring, and pulls another cover over
      his head.  A dirty red and yellow cover.

                                      TINA
                              (sleepily)
                      Where'd you get this snotty old
                      thing?

      SNORES from ROD.  TINA yawns, turns off the light and snuggles
      against ROD, pulling the cover gingerly over herself, too.


15.   INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT                                       15.

      CAMERA MOVES across the room of the original nightmare to find
      NANCY alone in TINA's bed, staring at the slanting ceiling above
      the bed.  Thinking.  We can just hear her HEART beating.  She
      sighs and turns on her side.

      Immediately the wall above her head turns a faint reddish hue,
      with a broad yellow smear across its center.  All unseen by
      NANCY, the wall begins to pulse in exact time with her heart's
      beat.

      CLOSE ON NANCY'S FACE.  She closes her eyes.

      ANGLE BACK UP ON THE CEILING JUST ABOVE HER HEAD.  SOMETHING
      presses against the surface from the inside.  The plaster buldges
      out as if suddenly elastic, taking the shape of the thing
      pressing from inside -- taking the shape of a man's face.  The
      face opens its mouth.  The knives rake through the surface.

      ANGLE ON NANCY -- as plaster dust snows down on her.

      She jerks awake, sitting bolt upright.  The face retracts
      suddenly -- the wall is normal.

      ANGLE DOWN ON NANCY as she looks up to the ceiling, touching her
      hair and feeling the plaster dust.

      REVERSE IN HER POV TO THE CEILING.  There are three parallel cuts
      in the plaster there.  About eight inches long.  As if cut by
      sharp knives.  Nothing else.

      Back on NANCY.  She draws the covers around her and shivers.
      Eyes wide open.


16.   EXT.  TINA'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                                        16.

      Not a car or person in sight.  A stricken breeze dies in the
      trees.

17.   ZOOM IN on the window of the room where TINA sleeps.  By the time  17.
      we're FULL IN CLOSE on it, the air is again still as death.  A
      moment later a PEBBLE bounces off the pane.  The NIGHTMARE THEME
      appears in the lower registers and holds its breath.

      Another PEBBLE strikes, with a sharper RAP.


18.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                             18.

      CLOSE ON TINA'S FACE as her eyes open.

19.   REVERSE IN HER POV.  Another PEBBLE clatters off the glass.        19.

20.   TINA raises slowly.                                                20.

                                      TINA
                      ROD...

      SNORES FROM ROD.  TINA sits up.

      PAST HER TO THE WINDOW.  The WIND MOVES AGAIN; the trees brush
      the window with their shadows.  Then another pebble.  RAP!  TINA
      slips to the window.


21.   EXT.  TINA'S BACKYARD.  NIGHT.                                     21.

      She looks out on an old yard with a patch of bananna trees
      rattling in the Santa Ana winds.  It seems deserted, though the
      welling dark won't let her be sure.  Then another pebble -- PAP!

      -- hitting with a sharp RACK FOCUS.

22.   A LOW ANGLE TO WINDOW as TINA jumps back, startled.  She hadn't    22.
      seen that one coming.  But she's drawn back to the glass out of
      curiousity, straining to see in the dark.  It's as if the stones
      are materializing out of thin air.


23.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                23.

      WHAP!  This time a heavier stone, and a thin crack bristles
      across the glass.

                                      TINA
                              (low)
                      Who the fuck you think you are,
                      whoever you are?


24.   EXT.  TINA'S BACK YARD.  NIGHT.                                    24.

      WIDE ANGLE ON THE REAR OF THE HOUSE.  A LIGHT COMES ON.  TINA
      appears in the doorway.

                                      TINA
                              (listening)
                      Somebody there?

      She can see through the backward to a yawning gate and the back
      alley.  No one there.  But a word is spoken, as if by wind.

                                      VOICE
                              (garbled)
                      Tina.

      TINA straightens, unable to swallow.  There's a ragged, obscene
      GIGGLE.  Deep in the throat.  Phlegmy.

                                      TINA
                      Who the hell is that?

      TINA charges across the yard and through the gate, the MUSIC
      chasing after.


25.   EXT.  A SERVICE ALLEY.  NIGHT.                                     25.

      She brakes in the middle of the alley and whirls around.
      Listening.  Shivering in the same thin slashed nightgown.

      A sharp crank of METAL, and fifty feet down the alley the lid of
      an ash can rolls from the dark like a huge tin coin and spirals
      noisily down.

26.   LOW REVERSE ACROSS LID TO TINA.  Despite herself she comes over    26.
      and touches it.  She comes up with long worms on her fingers.

      Next moment the exact same shambling MAN from her nightmare
      staggers into view fifty feet behind her.  TINA falls back into
      the shadows, shaking the worms off her fingers in repulsion.  The
      MAN turns and starts directly for her, something shining on his
      right hand as he spreads his arms wide.  He starts scraping the
      steel FINGERNAILS along a cinderblock wall.  Orange sparks spurt
      out -- his arms elongate until they reach from one side of the
      alley to the other -- and TINA is cut off from her home!

      CLOSE ON HER as the SCRAPING of the blades gets louder and
      closer.  She begins to shake uncontrollably.

                                      TINA
                      Oh, shit, please God...

                                      KILLER
                              (softly, approaching)
                      This is God...

      He holds up his steel-tipped hand like a surgical-steel spider.
      TINA runs for her life.

27.   WIDER ANGLE IN THE ALLEY -- a terrifying, all-out footrace         27.
      between the girl and her pursuer.  The MAN is fast; the distance
      between them closes with each heartbeat.  TINA overturns ashcans
      -- claws her way through a rotten back fence, hammers against a
      window.  Ashen FACES appear, recoil, pull curtains closed and
      disappear in fright.


28.   EXT.  TINA'S STREET.  NIGHT.                                       28.

      TINA runs out onto front lawns, SCREAMING for help.  No help
      comes.  In fact, the only response is for all the porch lights on
      the block to be turned off.  The MAN roars out from behind a tree
      -- a tree too narrow to have hidden him -- nearly upon the girl!
      TINA runs in panic -- at last making her own home, only to be
      trapped against its locked front door.

      She hammers against its thick wood.

                                      TINA
                      Nancy!  Open the door -- Nancy!

      The MAN slows.  He has TINA now and knows it.

                                      MAN
                      She's still awake.  Nancy can't
                      hear you.

      TINA turns and looks full at the approaching MAN.  Smudged by
      deep shadow, he's big and hideous.  He wears the same dirty
      yellow sweater from the first nightmare -- from the wall-hanging
      and blanket too -- and has the same sagging hat and leering grin
      over his misshapen face.  And on his fingers are the steel
      talons.

29.   CLOSE ON HIM as he takes the blade on the end of his right index   29.
      finger and lopes off one of the fingers of his left hand.  Then
      another.  We SEE the PIECES OF FINGERS fall past TINA'S face in
      SLOW MOTION.

      ANGLE ON THE GROUND of the FINGERS squirming on the ground, one
      flopping onto TINA's naked foot.

      TINA leaps back, sickened, and begins stamping on then as if they
      were huge bugs.

      The MAN snaps up his arm and the FINGERS fly back into place on
      his hand.  He leers at TINA -- then suddenly lunges at her,
      sweeping with his cutting hand!

      TINA's no weak sister -- blocks his arm, deflecting the spines,
      and grabs the MAN's ugly face with her other hand.  But the face
      only slides off to the bone.  The MAN presses in, and TINA
      contorts in horror as the knives slash across her shoulder --
      cutting her deeply.

29A.  TINA staggers backward, GROANING, her foot now inexplicably        29A.
      caught in bedclothes!  She falls over her bed's conformter, twists
      away from the man and, like a child, pulls the cover over her!
      The skull-faced MAN crushes down, and there's a fierce grappling
      -- punctuated by his GRUNTS and the girl's DEAFENING SCREAMS --
      and they both become totally wrapped in the comforter -- until
      they're beneath it, fighting for life and death.


30.   INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      30.

      ROD lurches up into CLOSE UP in the lightless bedroom,
      half-awakened by the tremendous struggle somewhere, somehow
      inside the dark bed.  ROD grabs groggily, lifting the blanket.

30A.  IN HIS POV we glimpse the dark underside of the blanket -- see     30A.
      TWO SHADOWY FIGURES flailing and clawing under the bedspread --
      TINA and the MAN -- or a shape that could be a man -- raging
      against each other.

      ROD drops the blanket and leaps from the bed, scared full awake
      and terrified.  Then the horrible TINA's GASPS change to the
      CRIES of a terribly wounded victim.  ROD instantly jerks back the
      bedspread.

      IN HIS POV we SEE TINA struggling and flailing along on the
      sheets, the MAN nowhere in sight.

                                      ROD
                      T-tina!?

      Suddenly TINA -- eyes turned inward to her tormentor -- give an
      awful jolt -- her arms and legs are spraddled as if by
      overwhelming force and pinned to the bed.  Next instant, her
      nightgown flies apart and four long gashes chase across her
      torso.  From no visible instruments!  A huge irrigation of blood
      floods the bed.

      Terrified, ROD dives for the light -- but at the same moment
      something invisible grabs TINA, wielding her body in the air and
      bringing it around in a swift blow that knocks ROD crashing into
      the light -- smashing it to bits.

31.   CLOSER ON HIM as he struggles around.  In the blue FLASHES OF      31.
      ELECTRICITY ROD sees TINA sliding up the bedroom wall in a dark
      smear, dragged feet first!

      ANGLE ON ROD -- paralized by terror!

      ANGLE ON TINA'S DYING EYES -- moving with her up the wall and
      bumping around the corner onto the ceiling.  She's just looking
      at who's dragging her, eyes glazing.

      REVERSE IN HER POV -- to the shadowy, horrendously ugly MAN,
      dragging her with fierce glee across the ceiling, literally
      swabbing the ceiling with her bloody body.  SEEN in FORCED
      PERSPECTIVE, the SHOT carries her across a great distance without
      seeming to get anywhere -- as if the ceiling is an endless
      plane.

      ANGLE DOWN ON ROD -- on his hands and knees -- the lamp next to
      him blurting blue SPARKS and STROBING the nightmare room.  ROD'S
      screaming up at TINA'S invisible tormentor.

                                      ROD
                      What the hell's going ON here!
                      Tina!

      ANGLE ON TINA -- upside down, clawing at the hanging swag lamp
      above her mother's dressing table -- desperate for some anchor.
      But she's dragged away from it.  The lamp swings back, it's wires
      gushing more SPARKS.

      CLOSER along the ceiling as TINA rakes a long furrow in the
      ceiling with her fingernails.  But her eyes are glazing,
      glazing.  And then they fall closed.

      WIDE, UP ON THE CEILING, as her body suddenly flops loose,
      hanging for an awful moment by the feet over the bed.

      REVERSE ON ROD -- staring like a terrified child.

                                      ROD
                      Tina --

      REVERSE IN HIS POV -- as the body falls like a sack of rocks onto
      the devastated bed, in SLOW MOTION, striking with a huge splash
      of blood.  A sick, awful GIGGLE floats around the room, then
      ECHOES off into infinity.  ROD staggers up, staring around as if
      hoping to see this phantom.

                                      ROD
                      You motherfucker!  I'll kill you
                      for that!


32.   INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      32.

      NANCY is sitting straight up in bed, terrified.  The CRIES of ROD
      are ringing through the whole house.  She forces herself to move
      -- bolting from the bed despite her terror and sense of dread.


33.   INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             33.

      NANCY flies into the dark hall -- crashing directly into SOMEONE
      who lurches out of the dark before her.  She SCREAMS and jumps
      back --

                                      GLEN
                      What the hell's going on!?

                                      NANCY
                      Oh -- jeez -- Glen!  Rod's
                      gone ape!

                                      ROD (OS)
                              (sobbing)
                      I'll kill you!

      NANCY grabs the door; it's locked; she pounds on it.  BAM! BAM!
      BAM!

      Things fall into sudden, awful silence on the other side.  GLEN's
      voice cracks with fear.

                                      GLEN
                      Rod?
                              (silence)
                      Rod, you better not hurt Tina...

      ROD erupts into terrible HOARSE LAUGHTER AND SOBBING.  Then they
      hear BREAKING GLASS.

      GLEN barrels into the door like the football player he is.  The
      frame splinters and they're in.


34.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                             34.

      Just inside the door NANCY slips and goes down hard.  GLEN finds
      her in the dark more by touch than sight.

                                      GLEN
                      You okay?

                                      NANCY
                      Yeah.  Something slippering all
                      over here...
                              (feeling)
                      Tina?

      No answer.  The room is quiet as a tomb.  Except for a stead
      DRIPPING, from all over.  Then GLEN finds a LIGHT SWITCH.

      On the CLICK the devastation is revealed.  There's BLOOD
      everywhere: up the walls, over the clawed ceiling, soaking the
      killing floor of the bed, and pooling in the dark red puddle
      where NANCY has slipped and fallen.

                                      GLEN
                      Oh, shit...

      NANCY wobbles up and sees TINA in the center of the ravaged bed.
      Unmistakeably and utterly dead.  NANCY presses against the wall,
      then contorts and chokes.

                                      GLEN (CONTD)
                              (numb)
                      I...I'm gonna call the cops --

      He bursts from the room.

35.   TIGHT ON NANCY.  She turns away from the body in repulsion,        35.
      sticking her head through the shattered window ROD LANE used for
      his escape, sucking in the cold night air and moaning.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


36.   EXT/INT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                  36.

      FADE UP ON RED LIGHTS and SIREN as an unmarked POLICE CAR speeds
      to the curb.

      LT DON THOMPSON, a decent-looking man in his mid-40's, exits and
      punches a cigarette from his pack.  His shaken aide, a uniformed
      patrolman named PARKER, greets him.  (CAMERA FOLLOWS them from
      the car straight into the station and eventually to THOMPSON'S
      OFFICE.)

                                      PARKER
                      Lieutenant Thompson.  Sorry to
                      wake you, but --

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      I'd've canned your ass if you
                      hadn't.  What you got?

      PARKER stumbles to open the door for THOMPSON as the man bulls
      into the station at a furious pace.

                                      PARKER
                      Her name was Tina Gray.  It
                      was her home.  Father abandoned
                      ten years ago, mother's in
                      Vegas with a boyfriend.  We're
                      trying to reach her now.

      LT THOMPSON grimaces as if he knows the story.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      What's the Coroner got to say?

                                      PARKER
                      Something like a razor was
                      the weapon, but nothing
                      found on the scene.

      THOMPSON is already to the desk officer SERGEANT GARCIA.  The big
      MAN shoves him a sheaf of papers --

                                      SERGEANT GARCIA
                              (wary)
                      Leautenant.  You know who --

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Where is she?

                                      SERGEANT GARCIA
                      I put her in your office...

      PARKER scurries after.

                                      PARKER
                      Looks like her boyfriend did
                      it.  Rod Lane.  Musician type,
                      arrests for brawling, dope --

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Terrific.  What the hell was
                      she doing there?

                                      PARKER
                      She lived there.

                                      LT THOMPSON
OMIT 37.              I don't mean her --                           OMIT 37.

38.   INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  38.

      THOMPSON enters his office and confronts NANCY and her mother,
      MARGE SIMSON.

                                      LT THOMPSON (CONTD)
                      I mean you.
                              (accusingly, to Marge)
                      What the hell was she doing there?

      MARGE SIMSON is in her middle thirties; a good-looking woman
      despite the hour and circumstances.

                                      MARGE
                      Hello to you, too, Donald.

      THOMPSON stops, the steam suddenly out of him.  The girl is a
      wreck and he winces to see it.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Marge.

      THOMPSON glances at PARKER and the other UNIFORMED COPS who are
      in the room.  As a man they head for the door.  There's no
      question who the boss is here.  THOMPSON turns to NANCY.  She
      fumbles a smile.

                                      LT THOMPSON (CONTD)
                      How you doing, pal?

                                      NANCY
                      Okay.  Hi, dad.

      NANCY's dress is dark with dried blood, her skin clammy and the
      color of paste.  MARGE shoots her ex-husband a worried glance.
      THOMPSON pulls a chair close to NANCY.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      I don't want to get into this now,
                      god knows you need time.
                              (hotter)
                      But I'd sure would like to know
                      what the hell you were doing
                      shacked up with three other kids
                      in the middle of the night --
                      especially a delinquent lunatic
                      like Lane.

      NANCY weaves.

                                      NANCY
                      Rod's not a lunatic.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      You got a sane explanation for
                      what he did?

      The girl is shredding a Kleenex, staring off.

                                      MARGE
                      Apparantly he was crazy jealous.
                      Nancy said they'd had a fight,
                      Rod and Tina.

                                      NANCY
                              (quietly)
                      It wasn't that serious...

                                      MARGE
                      Maybe you don't think murder's
                      serious --

      NANCY sits bolt upright in her chair, her eyes flashing.

                                      NANCY
                      She was my best friend!  Don't
                      you dare say I don't take her
                      death seriously!
                              (lower, near tears)
                      I just meant their fights
                      weren't that serious.

      The girl holds the woman's eyes a moment, then looks away.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                              (to herself)
                      She dreamed this would happen...

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      What?

                                      NANCY
                      She had a nightmare about somebody
                      trying to kill her, last night.
                      That's why we were there; she was
                      afraid to sleep alone.

      A tear splashes off the arm of her chair.

                                      MARGE
                      She's been through enough for one
                      night.  You have her statement.

      The mother and daughter rise; THOMPSON raps on the door and
      PARKER opens it.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                              (to MARGE)
                      I suggest you keep a little better
                      track on her -- she's still a kid,
                      y'know.

      MARGE wheels on him.

                                      MARGE
                      You think I knew there were boys
                      there!?  You try raising a
                      teenager alone.

      Then she and the girl are gone.  THOMPSON glares at PARKER.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                               (low to PARKER)
                      See they get home okay.

      PARKER shoves his hands in his pockets.  ON HIS FACE we

                              THE SECOND DAY

      FADE UP ON MARGE SIMSON opening a new bottle of gin, pouring
      herself a careful shot, drinking it, then chasing it with
      coffee.  Nearby a TV drones the morning news.  We can't yet see
      the SCREEN.

                                      TV NEWSCASTER (OS/FILTER)
                      In the headlines this morning --
                      a local teenage girl was brutally
                      murdered during an all-night party.

      MARGE TURNS, startled, seeing NANCY coming downstairs.

      The girl looks a little better than she did in the Police
      Station, but her eyes are still red-rimmed, and a vacant stress
      masks her face.  She looks to the TV.  Stops.

                      Police say the victim, fifteen-year
                      -old Christina Grey, had quarrelled
                      earlier with her boyfriend, Rod
                      Lane, a punk rocker with a history
                      of delinquency.  Lane is now the
                      subject of a city-wide manhunt.
                      According to --

39A.  The TV PICTURE has begun featuring a HANDHELD NEWSREEL SHOT of a
      dark rubber BODY BAG being carried to a CORONER'S VAN.  Just
      before the thing is lifted inside, TINA'S bloodied, white ARM
      slips from its zippered side and lolls into the dark night air.
      A man rudely shoves it back inside and pulls the zipper up the
      rest of the way.

39B.  WIDER -- as NANCY pales visible.  MARGE darts to the TV and slaps
      it off, then turning to NANCY.  She looks at the girl a moment,
      then goes to her and hugs her.

                                      MARGE
                              (kind)
                      Where you think you're going?

                                      NANCY
                      School.

                                      MARGE
                      I could hear you tossing and
                      turning all night, kiddo.  You've
                      no business going to school.

      NANCY pulls away, determined.

                                      NANCY
                      I gotta go to school, Mom.
                      Please.  Otherwise I'll just
                      sit up there and go crazy
                      or something.

      MARGE studies her face a moment.

                                      MARGE
                      Did you sleep?

                                      NANCY
                      I'll sleep in study hall, promise.
                      I'd rather keep busy, you know?

      She absently drains the woman's coffee cup -- then pecks her
      cheek.

                                      MARGE
                      Right home after.

                                      NANCY (cont'd)
                      Right home after.  See you.

      MARGE watches the girl disappear outside, then lights a cigarette
      from the one already burning in her fingers.


40.   EXT.  STREET.  DAY.                                                40.

      MUSIC slips back in, subtle but tense as we TRACK with NANCY as
      she walks alone down a sidewalk edged with thick flowering
      Oleander.  She cocks her head, puzzled, as if sensing something.
      MUSIC mounts.  NANCY looks across the street.

40A.  REVERSE IN HER POV.  A MAN is over there in dark clothes, reading  40A.
      a newspaper, but really watching her.

40B.  NANCY shrugs and continues on, then stops and looks back again.    40B.

40C.  IN HER POV we SEE the MAN is gone.                                 40C.

40D.  Next moment -- with a MUSIC STING -- a BLOODIED HAND jumps out     40D.
      from the opposite direction, clamps over NANCY'S mouth and drags
      her into the bushes.


41.   EXT.  BUSHES.  DAY.                                                41.

      NANCY struggles, twisting against the powerful assailant.

      A WIDER ANGLE REVEALS ROD LANE -- barefoot, clad only in jeans
      and leather jacket, still caked with dark blood.  The rest of his
      skin is pale as a ghost's.

                                      ROD
                      I'm not gonna hurt you.

      He releases her warily.  NANCY makes no move to run or scream,
      even though several STUDENTS pass on the nearby sidewalk.  This
      reassures ROD just a little.

                                      ROD
                      Your old man thinks I did it,
                      don't he?

                                      NANCY
                      He doesn't know you.
                              (eyeing the blood)
                      Couldn't you change?

                                      ROD
                      The cops were all over my house.
                              (shivers)
                      They'll kill me for sure.

                                      NANCY
                      Nobody's gonna kill you.

      He runs his hands down his face, trying to believe that.  The two
      study each other.

                                      ROD
                      I never touched her.

                                      NANCY
                      You were screaming like crazy.

      NANCY says this without accusation, just cool observation.

                                      ROD
                      Someone else was there.

                                      NANCY
                      The door was locked from your
                      side.

      ROD grabs her hard.  His muscular body tenses.

                                      ROD
                      Don't look at me like I'm some
                      kind of fucking fruitcake or
                      something, I'm warning you.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                      Morning, Mr. Lane.

42.   The boy jerks around.  NANCY's father, his .38 leveled right at    42.
      ROD's belly, eases out of the bushes.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Now just step away from her, son.
                      Like your ass depended on it.
                      I'm warning you.

      ROD backs away, looking once at NANCY with a look of terrible
      sadness.  Then he dives out of the bushes and runs like hell.

      THOMPSON snaps his revolver to fire -- but instinctively NANCY
      jumps between --

                                      NANCY
                      No!

      THOMPSON jerks his gun into the air, furious.

                                      THOMPSON
                      Jesus -- are you crazy!?

      He plunges past the girl.


42A.  EXT.  STREET.  DAY.                                                42A.

      ROD races like a frightened animal across the lawns -- but is
      soon cut off by the PLANECLOTHESMAN NANCY saw watching her before
      -- and then TWO UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, who close from another
      angle.  The chase is short and pitifully off-balance, and ROD is
      soon wrestled to the ground.  Next moment one of the cops is
      holding ROD'S knife into the air for THOMPSON to see.  THOMPSON
      looks at NANCY, as if to say 'I told you.' Background, ROD'S
      SHOUTS can be heard as he's shoved into a SQUAD CAR.

                                      ROD (O.S.)
                      I didn't do it -- !
                              (fading)
                      I didn't kill her, Nancy!

      The car's door slams and ROD is gone.  NANCY turns to her father,
      livid.

                                      NANCY
                      You used me, daddy!

                                      LT THOMPSON
                              (exasperated)
                      What the hell you doing going to
                      school today, anyway -- your
                      mother told me you didn't even
                      sleep last night!

      NANCY spins angrily and walks away.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Nancy!  Hey!

      But she just keeps going.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


43.   INT.  CLASSROOM.  DAY.                                             43.

      FADE UP ON an ENGLISH TEACHER and CLASS, NANCY among the kids,
      trying to concentrate.

                                      TEACHER
                      According to Shakespeare, there
                      was something operating in Nature,
                      perhaps inside human nature itself,
                      that was rotten -- a canker, as
                      he put it.

      The TEACHER'S eyes glance across the room.  ANGLE ON NANCY;
      yawning but listening.

                                      TEACHER (CONTD)
                      Of course Hamlet's response to
                      this, and to his mother's lies,
                      was to continually probe and
                      dig -- just like the gravediggers --
                      always trying to get beneath the
                      surface.  The same was true in a
                      different way in Julius Caesar.
                      Jon, go ahead...

      She nods to a SURFER who's been waiting uncomfortably in front of
      the class.  He squints at his book and begins, the recitation a
      struggle between baked and salted brain and the poetry of the
      Bard.

                                      SURFER
                              (reading aloud)
                      Uh, In the most high and palmy
                      state of Rome...

                                      WISEGUY STUDENT (O.S.)
                      California's the most high and
                      palmy state, man.

      The SURFER halts with a grin; KIDS snicker.

                                      ENGLISH TEACHER
                      Can it.

      She glares them back into silence.  The SURFER starts over, as we
      CUT TO NANCY.

      She's nodding off now, barely able to keep her eyes open in the
      warm, close boredom of the classroom.

                                      SURFER (O.S.)
                      In the most high and palmy state
                      of Rome, a little ere the mightiest
                      Julius fell...
                              (NANCY's head pitches
                               forward; she jerks it
                               back up, barely awake)
                      The graves stood tenantless, and
                      the sheeted dead did squeak and
                      gibber in the Roman street...

44.   NANCY's head has sunk again, eyelids drawn as if by enormous       44.
      weight.  By the time her cheek's against the desk, the SURFER'S
      VOICE is ECHOED and DISTANT.  But another voice, TINA'S, is very
      near, very much present.  A sad, thin plaint.

                                      TINA (O.S.)
                      Nancy.

      NANCY gives a start.  Her eyes lock onto something.

45.   REVERSE.  TILTED SIDEWAYS, IN HER HEAD'S POV, we look straight     45.
      out through the open doorway of the classroom into the hall.
      There, standing in a black pool of fluid, is a full-sized rubber
      body bag.  Dark red and yellow.  Weaving slightly, the merest
      suggesting of movement within it.

46.   BACK ON NANCY, sitting upright, wiping the sleep from her eyes,    46.
      shaking her head like a punchy prozefighter.  She looks back out
      the door.

47.   REVERSE IN 'NORMAL' POV -- the hallway is empty.  But there's a    47.
      dark smear on its floor tiles.

48.   NANCY looks nervously towards the rest of the class.  No one else  48.
      has noticed a thing outside the door.  All are dumbly spellbound
      by the SURFER, who now recites like a deep-voiced robot, his face
      wreathed by white hair.

                                      SURFER
                      O God, I could be bounded in a
                      nutshell and count myself a king
                      of infinite space, were it not
                      that I have bad dreams...

49.   ANGLE BACK ON NANCY.  She slips from her seat, eye warily on the   49.
      teacher and class.  But no one turns as she disappears through
      the doorway.


50.   INT.  SCHOOL HALLWAY.  DAY.                                        50.

      NANCY turns and looks both directions.  No sign of anybody.

                                      TINA (O.S.)
                              (distant)
                      Nancy.

      NANCY wheels and sees the bag, prone on the tiles at the far end
      of the hall, at the end of a long snail's trail of slime.  A pale
      hand thrusts out of it.  A moment later, as if pulled by
      invisible gravity, the bag slides out of sight into an
      intersecting corridor.

                                      NANCY
                      Tina!

      NANCY starts running for it.

51.   ANGLE AT THE CORNER as NANCY races blindly around the turn and     51.
      smashes straight into a BODY lunging at her from the opposite
      direction!  Both go down.

52.   ANGLE AT THE FLOOR.  A dazed freshman HALLGUARD cranks herself up  52.
      on one elbow.  She wears a plastic plaque on her red and yellow
      sweater that reads 'Hall Guard'.  Her nose is bleeding from the
      impact.

                                      HALLGUARD
                      Y-you're not supposed to run.
                      W-where's your pass -- you got a
                      pass?

      NANCY leaps up --

                                      NANCY
                      Screw your stupid pass!

53.   She turns -- sees the body bag halfway down this darker, narrower  53.
      hall, upright again.  But just as she sees it, it tips and
      pitches headlong through a doorway -- like some godawful rotten
      tree finally timbering down.  She can hear the sickening
      CRUNCHING of it falling down a long flight of stairs.

      NANCY runs for it again.  The HALLGUARD staggers up FOREGROUND,
      bleeding profusely from her eyes and ears.

                                      HALLGUARD
                      Hey, no running in the halls!

      The HALLGUARD raises her hand and we see it's tipped with long
      metal spikes.

      REVERSE ANGLE AT THE DOOR as NANCY runs up.  NANCY turns to check
      out the HALLGUARD.  She's vanished.  NANCY turns and looks down
      through the open door.  The MUSIC sweeps through a strange,
      brooding movement of strings, mounting towards the NIGHTMARE
      THEME.


54.   INT.  A STAIRWELL.                                                 54.

      NANCY edges into the stairwell and looks down.  Looks like
      there's a fire somewhere down there, from the way the orange
      light dances.  But there's only a low WHITE NOISE.

                                      NANCY
                      Tina?

      No answer.  NANCY starts down the stairs.


55.   INT.  BOILER ROOM.  DAY.                                           55.

      NANCY comes off the stairs into a dank boiler room.  The smear
      trail is there.  It runs behind a cracking, red-hot boiler the
      size of a diesel locomotive.  Everything about the place feels
      dreadfully wrong, and the MUSIC is deep into the NIGHTMARE THEME
      when it pauses.

      TIGHT ON NANCY.  Slow terror moves into her face.  There's a low,
      sinister GIGGLE.

56.   REVERSE IN HER POV -- we see a tangle of pipes, shadows, and the   56.
      tainted fire of the huge boiler.  Then from behind this, deeply
      shadowed but still identifiable, steps TINA's KILLER.  The same
      filthy red and yellow sweater and slouch hat, the same melted
      face twisting into a smile, the same GARBLED LAUGH as he slides
      the long blades from beneath his shirt and fans them on the ends
      of his bony fingers.

                                      NANCY
                      Who are you?

                                      MAN
                      Gonna get you.

57.   The leering MAN brings the bloodied scalpel-fingernails across     57.
      his own chest, splitting a nipple.  Yellow fluid pours out.
      MAGGOTS and WORMS.

      NANCY forgets the question -- jerks around and flees in blind
      panic into the first opening she sees -- a dark pipe tunnel.


58.   INT.  PIPE TUNNEL.                                                 58.

      ANGLE IN THE NARROW PASSAGEWAY.  In the BACKGROUND the killer
      shambles towards her; FOREGROUND NANCY breaks into a run.

      The killer sprints -- NANCY tears ahead into darkness.

      She flees deeper and deeper into the labyrinth of steaming,
      SIZZLING pipes, squeezing through smaller and smaller openings.
      The killer is just yards behind her, and soon she's trapped, just
      as TINA was before her.

      She presses her back to the wet bricks.  There's no hope of
      fighting him off, for NANCY is not as strong as TINA.  But she is
      smart as hell, and thinking even in this nightmare.  So by the
      time the creep has raised his knives to strike, NANCY has
      realized something.  She wheels and shoves her arm against one of
      the scalding steam pipes.  In the sme split second we HEAR her
      flesh scald, we

                                                      CUT TO:


59.   INT.  ENGLISH CLASS.  DAY.                                         59.

      NANCY lurches up SCREAMING, arm raised to ward off the invisible
      blow, books clattering to the floor -- other GIRLS nearby SCREAM
      in surprise as she stumbles over them.  Then she stops, confused
      and groggy from the nightmare.

      WIDER ANGLE.  EVERYBODY is staring at NANCY as if she's gone
      mad.  The ENGLISH TEACHER rushes over, herself frightened by the
      terror in the girl's eyes.

                                      TEACHER
                      Okay -- Okay, Thompson!  Every-
                      thing's all right now -- Nancy!.

60.   NANCY jerks around with panicked eyes, expecting the killer to     60.
      leap from any direction.  But there's only the sea of staring
      eyes.

      NANCY begins methodically picking up her books.

                                      TEACHER
                      I'll call your mother.

                                      NANCY
                      No!  No, really, I'm fine.  I'll go
                      straight home.  I'm okay.

      She marches for the door.

                                      TEACHER
                      You'll need a hall pass!

      But the girl's gone.


61.   EXT.  THE SCHOOL.  DAY.                                            61.

      NANCY walks out of the building, shaken.  Then she pauses at one
      of the big pine trees out front, stops and rests her head against
      its bark, teeth set.  NANCY starts to shake, and next second
      she's sobbing like a broken-hearted, frightened child.        OMIT 61A.
OMIT 61A.
62.   But she shakes herself silent.  Wipes the tears away with a slash  62.
      of sleeve.  She rubs her arm absently, lost in thought, then
      reacts in surprise and pain.  She lifts her arm and stares at the
      spot she's touched.

      INSERT ON HER ARM and the BURN there; about the size and shape of
      a half-dollar.

      WIDER ON NANCY.  Utterly, chillingly confused.

62A.  TINA, against the tree inches from NANCY, (SC 7) -- turns to her and
      says --

                                      TINA
                      Couldn't get back to sleep
                      at all.
                              (beat)
                      What you dream?


63.   EXT.  A BUSY STREET.  DAY.                                         63.

      NANCY is walking quickly, head erect, jaw set.  Then she enters
      her father's Police Station.


64.   INT.  VAN NUYS POLICE STATION.  DAY.                               64.

      NANCY crosses directly to the GARCIA.

                                      NANCY
                      My dad here?

      GARCIA looks up from his paperwork.

                                      SERGEANT GARCIA
                      Lieutenant.

      LT THOMPSON emerges from another room, uneasy to see NANCY.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Decide to take a day off after
                      all?

                                      NANCY
                      Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.

      THOMPSON doesn't miss a beat.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Only family allowed, Nancy.  You
                      know the drill.

                                      NANCY
                      Just want to talk to him a second.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      He's dangerous.

                                      NANCY
                      You don't know he did it.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      No, I know, thanks to your
                      own testimony, that he was
                      locked in a room with a girl
                      who went in alive and came
                      out in a rubber bag.

      NANCY flinches; her father shows the first signs of color in his
      neck.

                                      NANCY
                      I just want to talk to him.
                              (beat, lower)
                      Please, Dad.

      THOMPSON shifts almost imperceptibly towards GARCIA, then turns
      back to NANCY.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Make it fast.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


65.   INT.  CELL AREA.  DAY.                                             65.

      A GUARD exits pushing a cart of food trays.  NANCY waits warily
      until he's gone, then looks back to ROD LANE.  ROD looks more
      like a captured coyote than a human; haggard, ribbed, expecting
      poisoned bait.  His hair is wet, his clothes are borrowed jeans
      and work shirt.

                                      NANCY
                              (low)
                      And then what happened?

                                      ROD
                      I told you.
                              (reluctantly)
                      It was dark, but I'm sure there
                      was someone else IN there, under
                      the covers with her.

      NANCY reacts.

                                      NANCY
                      How could somebody get under
                      the covers with you guys
                      without you knowing it?

                                      ROD
                      How the fuck do I know?
                              (beat)
                      I don't expect you to believe
                      me.

      NANCY studies his encrypted eyes.  Surprisingly, she looks like
      she just might believe him.  She leans closer with a new
      thought.

                                      NANCY
                      What he look like?  You get
                      a look at him?

      He looks away.

                                      ROD
                      No.

                                      NANCY
                      Well then how can you say
                      somebody else was there?

                                      ROD
                      Because somebody cut her.  While
                      I watched.

      Now the place is so quiet you can hear heartbeats.

                                      NANCY
                      Somebody cut her while you watched
                      and you don't know what he looked
                      like?

      ROD smiles an insane smile, stuck with a reality no one will
      buy.

                                      ROD
                      You couldn't see the fucker.
                      You could just see the cuts
                      happening, all at once.

      NANCY gives a twitch.

                                      NANCY
                      What you mean 'all at once'?

                                      ROD
                              (low)
                      I mean, it was as if there were
                      four razors cutting her at the
                      same time.  But invisible razors.
                      She just... opened up...

      By now he's picking at a clot of dark blood on his jacket, as if
      it was a scab on his own body.  Then he catches NANCY watching
      and turns away to the back of the cell.  He smashes his fist into
      the wall -- bone-crushing blows that scare the wits out of
      NANCY.

                                      NANCY
                      Rod!

      He stops, and his fist is dripping blood as he says in a small,
      sad voice.

                                      ROD
                      I probably could've saved her
                      if I'd moved sooner...  But I
                      thought it was just another
                      nightmare, like the one I had
                      the night before.
                              (beat)
                      There... was this guy who had
                      knives for fingers...

      CLOSE ON NANCY, unable to swallow the gorge rising in her
      throat.  ROD turns to her, and to his surprise she's ashen.

                                      ROD (CONTD)
                      Do you think I did it?

                                      NANCY
                      No.

                                                FADE TO BLACK


66.   EXT.  ELM STREET / NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                           66.

      FADE UP ON ESTABLISHING SHOT as a spooky WIND sets a DOG BARKING
      down the block.  A CAR goes by, then this pleasant residential
      street falls into silence.  CAMERA has MOVED IN on NANCY's
      well-tended two-story home.


67.   INT.  NANCY'S KITCHEN.  NIGHT.                                     67.

      The house is in shadow.  Alone, MARGE scrapes the last of the
      evening's dishes and slips them into the dishwasher.  Neither she
      nor her daughter has touched the food.  But MARGE is well into a
      bottle of gin; her appetite for that is growing, right along with
      her dread.  She turns and looks up the stairs, calling.

                                      MARGE
                      Nancy, don't fall asleep in
                      there.

                                      NANCY (OS)
                      I won't.

                                      MARGE
                      Get into bed.


68.   INT.  UPSTAIRS BATHROOM.  NIGHT.                                   68.

                                      NANCY
                      I will.

      NANCY'S in the tub, so drowsy she can hardly rinse without
      falling asleep.  The water in the tub is opaque with suds.
      Luxurious.

      CLOSER ANGLE, AT WATER LEVEL ON NANCY.  Her eyes droop.  She
      slides closer to the surface of the water, letting its heat sooth
      her nerves.  Her eyes stare straight up, glazed; her breathing
      deepens.

      REVERSE, across to her legs, crooked, one knee on each side of
      the tub.  There's a ripple in the water between.  Then something
      tiny and shiny breaks the surface between them.  It pops up with
      a slithering MUSIC CUE and catches a sliver of light.  Then it
      begins to rise.

      Higher and higher it rises, soon accompanied by another, then two
      more shining, gleaming blades, and then the full glove and dark
      hairy hand and then the wrist and arm, straight up light an evil
      sapling between the girl's knees, the knives bloosoming into a
      bright flower of razor sharp steel in the air, moving over the
      girl's belly.  The hand rears back, the claws arch to strike.

                                      MARGE (OS/APPROACHING)
                      Nancy?

      MARGE raps on the door.  The instant she does NANCY jerks up,
      opening her eyes groggily.  The dark wet arm, hand and knifes are
      gone.

                                      NANCY
                      What?

                                      MARGE (OS)
                              (through the door)
                      You're not falling asleep,
                      are you?  You could drown,
                      you know.

                                      NANCY
                      Mother, for petesakes.

                                      MARGE (OS)
                      It happens all the time.
                              (brighter)
                      I've got some warm milk all
                      ready for you.  Why don't you
                      jump into bed?
                              (fading)
                      I'm gonna turn on your electric
                      blanket, too.  C'mon, now.
                              (then she's gone into
                               another room)

                                      NANCY
                              (low)
                      Warm milk.  Gross.

      She slides down to water level again, and sings softly,
      thoughtfully to herself.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      One, two, Freddie's coming for
                      you, three four, better lock
                      your door, five six, grab your
                      crucifix, seven eight gonna
                      stay up late, nine ten, never
                      sleep again...

      The next instant she's jerked with incredible violence straight
      down beneath the surface of the tub -- as if the bottom had
      suddenly dropped out and she was in a bottomless well!


68A.  EXT.  UNDERWATER SHOT.  NIGHT.                                     68A.

      LOOKING UP PAST HER ANKLES we SEE NANCY pulled sharply down into
      really deep water, the dim light of the surface and bathroom
      beyond receding with each yank.  And yet she somehow flails and
      gasps and struggles back towards the surface, managing by pure
      panic to break the surface with her hands!


68B.  INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM.                                    68B.

      MARGE rushes to the door and listens, alarmed at the wild
      SPLASHING audible through the locked door.

                                      MARGE
                      Nancy!  NANCY!


68C.  EXT.  UNDERWATER SHOT.  NIGHT.                                     68C.

      MARGE'S VOICE reaches to the girl, who thrusts up through main
      force and breaks the surface with her head and shoulders.


68D.  INT.  BATHTUB.                                                     68D.

      Gasping and choking, NANCY breaks the surface of her bathwater,
      like a drowning sailer getting one last chance.  Her mother's
      VOICE booms over her, ECHOED and frantic -- and the loud BANGING
      on the door finally opens her eyes.  She turns and calls gasping
      to her mother --

                                      NANCY
                      Mommy!

      REVERSE ON THE DOOR -- as MARGE, using the old hangar through the
      doorhandle truck, makes it into the room.  She rushes across to
      the tub.  NANCY is staggering up in the bathwater, again with
      solid porcelain beneath her feet.

                                      MARGE
                      I told you!  Hundreds of people
                      a year drown like that!

      The mother throws a towel around the gasping girl, helps her from
      the tub and begins drying her like a child.  NANCY looks like
      she's likes paralized with some sort of weird dread.

                                      MARGE
                      You okay?

                                      NANCY
                      Great

                                      MARGE
                              (not believing it for
                               a minute)
                      To bed with you, c'mon.

      MARGE rushes out to get the room ready.  NANCY turns and looks at
      herself in the cabinet mirror, then opens the medicine chest and
      begins a quick, furtive search.

      CLOSER as she takes out the box of No Doz and slips it into her
      robe.


OMIT SCS. 69 & 70-------------------------------          OMIT SCS. 69 & 70

71.   INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             71.

      NANCY emerges from the bathroom yawning.  MARGE follows as the
      girl plods obediently to her room.

                                      MARGE
                      No television, forget the
                      homework, no phone calls.

                                      NANCY
                      No, Mother.  Yes, Mother.
                      No, Mother.


72.   INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        72.

                                      MARGE
                      And no school tomorrow, either.
                      you take a little vacation, relax
                      and rest for a change.

                                      NANCY
                      Yes, Mother.  G'night.

      MARGE offers a smile, and a little yellow pill.

                                      MARGE
                      Take this, it'll help you sleep.

                                      NANCY
                      Right.

      NANCY pops it in her mouth and swallows obediently.  MARGE leans
      to her with a kiss.

                                      MARGE
                      Sleep tight, don't let the
                      bedbugs bite.

      MARGE goes out, relieved.  NANCY closes the door, leans against
      it and spits the pill into her hand.  She tosses it straight out
      her window and takes a NoDoz.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


73.   OMIT                                                          OMIT 73.

74.   FADE UP ON INSERT OF TELEVISION SCREEN.                            74.

      A MONSTER MOVIE in BLACK AND WHITE.  NO SOUND from the set.

75.   PULL BACK to REVEAL NANCY propped up in bed, furtively watching.  Or  75.
      is she just thinking?  A bedside CLOCK reads 12:45 pm.

      The girl YAWNS.  She shakes herself violently and sits up
      straighter, forcing herself to concentrate on the movie.

75A.  ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN.  A DIVER struggles to keep facing a      75A.
      large circling shark.

75B.  ON NANCY.  Her eyes droop shut -- then she jerks awake, rattling   75B.
      her head as if it were a radio drifting off station.  She tumbles
      out of bed, throws open the window and takes a deep breath of the
      cool night air.


76.   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE AND STREET.  NIGHT.                            76.

      HIGH ANGLE, AT SECOND-STORY LEVEL.  NANCY looks directly across
      the street to a lighted, open window.  Its curtains, sucked out
      and waving in the night breeze, give the only motion to the
      deserted street.

      Then someone pitches out of the dark at her.  NANCY gives a YELP
      -- then clamps her hand over her mouth as she recognizes GLEN,
      balanced precariously on the rose trellis outside her window.

                                      GLEN
                      Sorry!  Saw your light on.
                      Thought I'd see how you were.

      She gets herself together, barely.

                                      NANCY
                      Sometimes I wish you didn't live
                      right across the street.

                                      GLEN
                      Shut up and let me in.  You ever
                      stand on a rose trellis in your
                      bare feet?


76A.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        76A.

      NANCY looks over her shoulder to make sure her mother hasn't
      heard.  GLEN's already through her window and planted on her
      bed.  NANCY points to a chair.

                                      NANCY
                      If you don't mind.

      GLEN crosses to the chair and plops down.

                                      GLEN
                      So.  I heard you freaked out
                      in English class today.

      There's no maliciousness in his voice, and the familiar frankness
      is actually comforting to NANCY.

                                      NANCY
                      Guess I did.

                                      GLEN
                      Haven't slept, have you?

                                      NANCY
                      Not really.

      NANCY tries to smile, but can't fake it very well.  GLEN looks
      her over.

                                      GLEN
                      You look dead and rained on, if
                      you want the ugly truth.  And
                      what you do to your arm?

      She shrugs, trying to keep it casual.

                                      NANCY
                      Burned myself in Englsh class.

      She hazards a look in the mirror, and her jaw drops.

                                      NANCY
                      M'god, I look twenty years old.
                              (turning back to him)
                      You have any weird dreams last
                      night?

                                      GLEN
                      Slept like a rock.

                                      NANCY
                              (pleased)
                      Well at least I have an objective
                      wall to bounce this off.
                              (off)
                      You believe it's possible to dream
                      about what's going to happen?

                                      GLEN
                      No.

                                      NANCY
                      You believe in the Boogey Man?

                                      GLEN
                      One two, Freddie's coming
                      for you?  No.  Rod killed Tina.
                      he's a fruitcake and you know it.

                                      NANCY
                      You believe in anything?

                                      GLEN
                      I believe in you, me, and
                      Rock and Roll.  And I'm not
                      too sure about you lately.

      NANCY thinks.

                                      NANCY
                      Listen, I got a crazy favor
                      to ask.

                                      GLEN
                      Uh-oh...

                                      NANCY
                      It's nothing too hard or anything.
                              (beat)
                      I'm just going to... LOOK
                      for someone, and... I want
                      you to be sort of a ...guard.
                      Okay?

      GLEN makes the Twilight Zone sound.

                                      NANCY
                      Okay?

                                      GLEN
                      Okay, okay.
                              (beat)
                      I think.

      She comes very close to him.

                                      NANCY
                      You won't screw up, right?  I
                      mean, a whole lot might depend
                      on it.

      The way she's looking at him gives him the creeps.

                                      GLEN
                      Okay, I won't screw up.

77.   Nancy takes a deep breath.  Then without another word turns off    77.
      the TV and the light.

                                      GLEN (IN DARK)
                      Jesus, it's dark in here.

                                      NANCY
                      Shhh.  Now listen, here's what
                      we're gonna do...


78.   EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          78.

      FADE UP ON NANCY, still in her pajamas, walking through the
      shadowy streets near her home, listening for the slightest
      sound.  We MOVE with her.  But nothing, not even the dog barking
      earlier, is there now.  NANCY peers into the darkness of lawns
      and trees behind her.

                                      NANCY
                              (stage whisper)
                      You still there?

      Across the street and a distance away, GLEN steps from behind a
      tree.

                                      GLEN
                      Yeah.  So?

                                      NANCY
                      Just checking -- keep out of
                      sight!

      GLEN throws up his hands in exasperation and walks back out of
      sight.  NANCY turns and looks down between the houses, deep into
      a dark alleyway.  Then she forces herself to walk into it.


79.   EXT.  ALLEY.  NIGHT.                                               79.

      MOVING WITH HER as she makes herself go deeper and deeper into
      shadows.  Each time she pauses and waits, the MUSIC grows more
      threatening and expectant.  The feeling is of immense tension --
      we're sure the killer will come screaming out on her at any
      second.

      But he doesn't.  In fact absolutely nothing happens, and NANCY
      emerges from the far end of the alley unscathed.  The only thing
      strange is that she now finds her self looking across the mall to


80.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      80.

      The Police Station.  It takes her a little by surprise, it just
      seems to have appeared.

      MUSIC creeps into the NIGHTMARE THEME as NANCY whispers hoarsely
      back down the dark alley.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Still there?


81.   EXT.  ALLEY.  NIGHT.                                               81.

      We only HEAR the DISTANT VOICE, slightly ECHOED.

                                      GLEN'S VOICE (OS)
                              (yawning)
                      Still here!

                                      NANCY
                      On your toes, right?

      NANCY stares into the dark trying to see him, but she can't.  She
      turns back and makes up her mind to move without him in sight.


82.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      82.

      MUSIC MOUNTS as we MOVE WITH NANCY across the lawns to the police
      station, creeping to the first lighted window she sees.  It's a
      low, barred basement window, and NANCY reacts as soon as she
      looks through it.


83.   INT.  ROD'S CELL.  NIGHT.                                          83.

      NANCY'S POV down into ROD LANE's cell.  The boy is on his rough
      cot, twitching in disturbed sleep.  And a long SHADOW is sliding
      across the wall.

      A big SHAPE appears in the shadowed corridor outside the boy's
      cell, and as IT walks closer NANCY can barely see it's the
      shambling, grimly scarred man with the filthy red and yellow
      sweater and strange slouch hat pulled across his brow.  The
      KILLER from all of their nightmares.

      And this giant shadow of a man passes through the bars of the
      cell, like so much evil Jello.  Halfway through he pauses,
      turning to check over his shoulder.  We see the bars clearly
      penetrating his body, going in his head, passing out his ankles.
      Then he turns back to ROD and moves forward, and within another
      heartbeat is beside the boy.


84.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      84.

      NANCY draws back sharply, swallowing in terror.  She looks behind
      her for help.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Glen.

      No answer.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                              (louder)
                      Glen?!

      The street is absolutely deserted.  There is no motion, and no
      sound save one: the distant but unmistakeable sound of GLEN
      SNORING.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      GLEN!

      A beat of silence after the shout's echoes die, then the steady,
      boyish SNORES again.  NANCY swears under her breath and jerks
      back around, forcing herself to look again into ROD's cell.


85.   INT.  ROD'S CELL.                                                  85.

      IN HER POV -- the killer picks up ROD's bedsheet and tests it
      between his powerful hands.  Without thinking, NANCY bangs
      against the glass.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Rod!  Look out!

      The KILLER wheels around, locking eyes with NANCY.  The girl goes
      white.  The man's face is in the light, and it's horrible --
      seething with hatred and a twisted, insane intelligence.

      The hold of those eyes is only broken when ROD rolls up on an
      elbow with a deep, troubled GROAN.  The instant ROD does this,
      the KILLER fades into the shadows in the cell.  But even then his
      eyes hold on NANCY's until the last second he's visible.

      ROD looks around the cell groggily, runs his fingers through his
      matted hair, then collapses back on his pillow.  No matter how
      hard NANCY screams, ROD never once looks at the window.  He just
      pulls the twisted covers about his shoulders and succumbs once
      more to sleep.

	And now the bed sheet is no longer on the bed.  The KILLER,
      materializing out of the shadow again, is holding it between his
      hands like a garrote.  He looks up and leers at NANCY, then moves
      for ROD.


86.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      86.

	ANGLE BACK ON NANCY.  She pounds on the window, then turns in
      frustration and yells into the night.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen!!

      She turns back to the cell in desperation.


87.   OMIT                                                          OMIT 87.


88.   INT.  ROD'S CELL.                                                  88.

	IN NANCY'S POV we look into a cell that is quite deserted save
      for ROD.  Sleeping peacefully.


89.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      89.

	NANCY pulls back from the window, stunned.

                                      NANCY
                      I swear...

      Suddenly NANCY feels utterly exposed.  She shivers, chilled and
      vulnerable to the bone in her thin night clothes.  She can't
      move.  It's as if some great nerve between her instincts and body
      had been severed.  And she hears the SOUND behind her.  A sort of
      filling-vibrating Scrriiitchh.

      MUSIC sneaks in -- the unmistakeable NIGHTMARE THEME, creeping
      over her.  NANCY forces herself, by sheer will, to look.

90.   Ahead of her perhaps twenty-five feet, covered with a thick        90.
      plastic body bag through which we can barely see her face, is
      TINA.  Standing square in the middle of the street.  A dark ooze
      of BLACK EELS roil out of its bottom, and at its top, the zipper
      CHATTERS down and the greenish-white face of TINA lolls out.  She
      gestures, supplicating, her watery eyes desperate to convey some
      desperate message.

      The MUSIC FALLS TO A HUSH.

91.   NANCY backs away, eyes streaming tears.                            91.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen, where are you!  Wake up!
                      Glen!

                                      DEEP RAGGED VOICE
                      I'm here.

      NANCY twists around in horror at the same instant the KILLER
      grabs for her face with his knife-fingers!  The girl
      intinctively pitches back, then scrambles up and runs like
      hell!

                                      NANCY
                      Glen!  Glen!!!


92.   EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          92.

      MOVING WITH NANCY at full gallop, running blind.  She crashes
      through a sawhorse into a new sidewalk, sinking into the wet
      cement over her ankles.  The stuff sticks to her legs in long
      gluey globs and she can barely pull her feet loose.

      The KILLER looms nearby,
      mocking her -- his scalpel claws gleaming in the streetlight.  He
      just misses the girl as she wrenches free and flees again, now so
      winded she can only stagger.

      MOVING WITH THEM.  Time after time NANCY just barely manages to
      elude the shadowy form, leaping from his reach by inches and
      pouring on more steam.  It's too close to even bother screaming
      now; and besides, that would take breath she doesn't have.  The
      only SOUND is of RUNNING FOOTSTEPS, RASPING BREATH and the
      KNIFE-FINGERS WHISTLING through the air.


93.   EXT.  NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                                        93.

      NANCY tears across her front lawn and into the open front door of
      her home, SLAMMING it with all her might.  There's a tremendously
      satisfying CONCUSSION of wood against doorframe, and the LOCKS
      fall shut.


94.   INT.  NANCY'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                 94.

                                      NANCY
                      Glennn!!!

      But her voice is garbled as if she's under water, and there's no
      answer.  The only clue to Glen being there at all is his distant
      SNORING.  Innocent.  Persistent.  Deep.

      NANCY stops, breath in shreds, face smeared with dirt and tears.
      Something is clawing the window in the dark of the kitchen.
      NANCY looks and catches the MAN prying at the glass with his big
      knife-fingers, the sharp blades SIZZLING against the edges of the
      glass as they crack it away from the frame.  NANCY runs upstairs
      in blind panic.


95.   INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        95.

      NANCY darts into her unlit bedroom, slams the door and locks it.

      Safe at last.

      She listens at the door.  Nothing.  She crosses to her bed.  Next
      second the KILLER dives through her window and seizes her in a
      shower of shattered glass!

      NANCY twists and manages to grab the wrist of his knife hand with
      both of hers, barely keeping the blades from her throat.

      The two fall backwards in a terrible, gasping struggle, crashing
      onto NANCY's bed.  Her grip is broken -- the MAN stabs -- NANCY
      twists away, backed into a corner of bed and walls.  Defenseless,
      she snatches a pillow up; the KILLER lashes out -- disemboweling
      the pilow and sending a great gush of feathers flying.  NANCY
      dives for escape in a virtual blizzard.

      The KILLER manages to snare her with his other hand, and the two
      crash across the bedside table to the floor, the table and all
      its contents cascading around them in a whiteout of feathers.

      ANGLE AT FLOOR LEVEL -- CLOSE ON NANCY'S AND THE KILLER'S HEADS.
      The blades inch towards the girl's face -- the drool of the
      grizzled shadow with the horribly scarrred face spills into her
      eyes.  Feathers are everywhere; MUSIC is absolutely insane!

      But just when the points of steel are less than an inch from her
      eyes, the old fashioned alarm clock thrown to the floor next to
      NANCY's head goes off with a jarring RINGGGGGGG!

96.   Instantly the MUSIC STOPS.  And a moment later the room is         96.
      light.

      WIDER as NANCY reels up, blinded by the sudden light, SCREAMING
      AND FIGHTING on her bed.

      ANGLE ON GLEN, lurching from his own sleep at the frightening
      noise.  He discovers NANCY pressed in terror against her
      headboard, clutching a pillow like a drowning woman would a
      straw.

      It's an intact pillow, and there isn't a feather in sight.

      NANCY stares incredulously at GLEN, then around the room,
      untangling herself from her bedclothes.  Wary and furious, her
      voice hoarse.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen, you bastard...

      The boy looks at his friend in groggy alarm.  She's absolutely
      livid, more angry than he's ever seen her, and more strange.

                                      GLEN	
                      What I do?

      He reaches for her -- she flattens against the wall, eyes hard,
      and terribly hurt, too.

                                      NANCY
                              (low)
                      I asked you to do just one thing.
                      Just stay awake and watch me --
                      Just wake me if it looked like
                      I was having a bad dream.
                              (eyes wild)
                      But you.  You shit -- what do
                      you do -- you fall asleep!

      She stops herself, wiping a bit of spittle off her lip, alarmed
      at how out of control she's become.  And suddenly she breaks,
      sinking into her 	torn bedclothes and rubbing her head.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                              (mostly to herself)
                      I must be going nuts...

                                      MARGE (OS)
                      Nancy?

      Her mother's door opens OS.

                                      GLEN
                      Oh, shit.

      NANCY composes her voice as best she can.

                                      NANCY
                      Yes, mother?

      MARGE's flip-flops approach outside the door.  GLEN barrels out
      the window -- NANCY dives for the bed, jams off the light and
      disappears under the covers.  MARGE, bleary eyed herself, opens
      the door and flicks on the light.

                                      MARGE
                              (beat)
                      You okay?

                                      NANCY
                              (weakly)
                      Yeah.  Just had a little dream.
                      I'm falling right back to sleep.

                                      MARGE
                              (beat)
                      Okay... You need anything, just call.

                                      NANCY
                      Okay.

      MARGE closes the door.  NANCY immediately sits up and looks at
      the window.  A single bone-white feather floats down in the
      moonlight.  Then it's sucked outside and is gone.


97.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      97.

      GLEN's CADILLAC CONVERTABLE careens into the parking lot and
      SCREECHES to a stop.  GLEN and NANCY jump out and head for the
      station.

                                      GLEN
                      You mind telling me what's 
                      going on?

      NANCY's races into the station without answering.

                                      GLEN (CONTD)
                      Oh, I see.  That makes it all 
                      perfectly clear.


98.   INT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      98.

      NANCY goes straight to the SERGEANT's desk.

                                      NANCY
                      Garcia, I want to see Rod
                      Lane again.

      GARCIA winces.

                                      SGT GARCIA
                      I thought when I took the
                      night shift I'd have peace
                      and quiet for a change.

                                      NANCY
                      It's urgent, we've gotta see Rod.

                                      SGT GARCIA
                      It's three in the morning.
                      Your mother know you're out this 
                      late?

                                      NANCY
                              (faking it)
                      Of course -- look, at least go
                      back and look at him.  Just see
                      if he's okay.

      GARCIA glances at GLEN.

                                      GLEN
                              (faking it)
                      We have reason to think there
                      might be something weird going 
                      on.

                                      LT THOMPSON (OS)
                      Oh, no argument on that.

      NANCY jumps around at the sound of her father's voice.  LT
      THOMPSON emerges from his office, rumpled and yawning.

                                      NANCY
                      Dad -- what you doing here?

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      It so happens I work here, and
                      there's an unsolved murder.  I
                      don't like unsolved murders, 
                      especially ones my daughter's
                      mixed up in -- what are you
                      doing here at this hour?  You're
                      supposed to be getting some 
                      sleep.

                                      GLEN
                      Listen, sir, this is serious.
                      Nancy had a nightmare about Rod
                      being in danger, or something,
                      and so she thinks...

      He trails off, loosing it under LT THOMPSON's glare.  Besides, he
      doesn't know exactly what the hell's really going on himself.
      GARCIA puts his beefy hand on NANCY's shoulder.

                                      NANCY
                      I just want to see if he's okay!

                                      SGT GARCIA
                      Take my word for it, Nancy.  The
                      guy's sleeping like a baby.  He's
                      not going anywhere.


99.   INT.  CELL BLOCK.  NIGHT.                                          99.

      ANGLE ON ROD in his cell.  He's asleep, all right, but not safely
      so.  His bedsheet has come alive.  It twitches, pulsates, then
      snakes towards his throat.

      ROD stirs, the sheet falls still; ROD slips into deeper sleep,
      and the sheet moves again, completing the noose around his neck!


100.  INT.  BOOKING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        100.

      NANCY makes a move for the cell block --

                                      NANCY
                      This isn't your average nightmare,
                      Daddy -- damn it!

      The door's locked; she hauls on it in desperation.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Now look, Nancy, don't push
                      it.  You've already rubbed my nose
                      in sex, drugs and violence -- don't
                      start throwing in insanity!

      NANCY takes that one to heart.  She wheels on him and pleads, her
      intensity sobering even to him.

                                      NANCY
                      Just go back and check -- please!

      The man takes a beat, then shrugs and nods towards SGT GARCIA.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Okay, Garcia.  What the hell.

                                      SGT GARCIA
                      Right...
                              (feeling in his pockets)
                      Now where'd I put the key...

      He mumbles backs towards his desk.  MUSIC BUILDS as we HOLD ON
      NANCY'S FACE.


101.  INT.  ROD'S CELL.  NIGHT.                                          101.

      With a terrible SNAP ROD's sheet jerks tight around his neck.
      The startled teenager is hauled upright -- eyes popping, face
      purple.  He claws at the sheet, but despite his strength he can't
      get his fingers between the noose and his windpipe.  He's dragged
      backwards across the cot.


102.  INT.  BOOKING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        102.

      GARCIA finally has the keys.  Urged on by NANCY he fumbles with
      the lock.


103.  INT.  ROD'S CELL.  NIGHT.                                          103.

      ROD'S being dragged backwards, gasping and struggling in vain
      against the powerful pull -- right across his cell and up the
      wall, too.  He clutches blindly at his throat at the far end of
      the sheet coils around the bars of the high window.  Then there's
      a powerful wrench of the sheet, and ROD'S neck SNAPS.  The kid's
      body sags lifeless.

104.  ANGLE THROUGH THE BARS as NANY, GLEN, LT THOMPSON and GARCIA       104.
      appear in the corridor outside, the girl sprinting ahead.

                                      NANCY
                      Rod!

      But it's too late; NANCY sinks back in horror as her father and
      GARCIA rush into the cell.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Gimme a hand, dammit!

      GLEN, pale as the sheet that's killed ROD, climbs to the bars and
      unties the knot.  ROD slides down over the SERGEANT'S shoulders,
      limp as a marrionette with its strings slashed.

                                      SGT GARCIA
                      Goddamn loco kid -- he didn't
                      have t'do that -- Madre dios!

      They lay ROD at NANCY's feet; a strange Pieta.  NANCY's father
      looks at her in spooked suspicion.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      How'd you know he was gonna do
                      this?

      NANCY says nothing.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


105.  EXT.  FOREST LAWN CEMETERY.  DAY.                                  105.

                                              BURN ON:

                              THE FOURTH DAY

      FADE UP ON a stark afternoon.  On a hill of sere grass
      overlooking the valley, the casket of ROD LANE is lowered into
      its grave.

      A small group of FAMILY and FRIENDS watches soberly as the
      MINISTER raises his hand in benediction.

                                      MINISTER
                      Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
                      May God be with this young man's
                      soul.

      ON THE FACES of MARGE, LT THOMPSON, TINA'S MOTHER and ROD'S
      PARENTS.  Just for a second or two, in looks too rapid for an
      outsider to even notice, these adults exchange looks.  Furtive,
      quick glances that suggest an immense something that they all
      share, something beyond even this second death among their
      children.  Then they are all staring ahead again, as if the
      others weren't even there.

                                      MINISTER (CONTD OS)
                      His life and his death attest to
                      the Scripture's warning that he who
                      lives by the sword shall die by
                      the sword.

      ANGLE ON GLEN, watching --

      NANCY, standing alone, not believing it for a minute.

                                      MINISTER (CONTD OS)
                      But let us recall also our Lord's
                      admonition that we 'Judge not,
                      lest we be judged.'  Let us
                      attempt only to love.  And may
                      Rod Lane rest in peace.

                                      NANCY
                              (quietly)
                      Amen to that much.

      The mourners walk away from the grave, MARGE among them.  She
      pauses near a MAN and two WOMEN in black -- TINA'S MOTHER, ROD'S
      PARENTS.  They almost, it seems, speak.  Then MARGE hurries on.

      WE MOVE WITH HER as she's joined by LT THOMPSON.  Both are worn
      and on edge.  THOMPSON absently lights another cigarette,
      offering one to MARGE.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      How's Nancy doing?

                                      MARGE
                      I don't think she's slept since
                      Tina died.
                              (shakes her head)
                      She's always been a delicate
                      kid.

      THOMPSON lights her cigarette, attempting some sort of
      nonchalance.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      She's tougher than you think.
                      Any idea how she knew Rod was
                      gonna kill himself?

                                      MARGE
                      No.  All I know is, this reminds
                      me too much of ten years ago.

      THOMPSON blows a plume of smoke against the hard sky and looks
      away.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Yeah.  Well... Let's not start
                      digging up bodies just because 
                      we're in a cemetery.

      He gives her a look that could cut stone.  MARGE toses down her
      cigarete and crosses to NANCY.  The girl is simply staring off
      over the valley.

                                      MARGE
                              (very gently)
                      Time to go home, baby.

      She moves her away from the brink of the hill.


106.  EXT.  CEMETERY PARKING AREA.  DAY.                                 106.

      MARGE opens the door of the station wagon for NANCY.  NANCY turns
      to them both, speaking in a still, small voice.

                                      NANCY
                      The killer's still loose,
                      you know.

      She has a wild, Cassandra aspect that sends a chill right up
      MARGE'S spine.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      You saying somebody else killed
                      Tina?  Who?

      NANCY smiles a weird sort of smile.

                                      NANCY
                      I don't know who he is.  But he's
                      burned, he wears a weird hat, a
                      red and yellow sweater, real
                      dirty, and he uses some sort of
                      knifes he's got made into a sort
                      of... glove.  Like giant finger-
                      nails.

      As NANCY has described this monster from her dream, unseen by
      her, 	the faces of MARGE LT and THOMPSON have drained completely
      of color.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                              (low, even, to MARGE)
                      I think you should keep Nancy
                      at home a few days.  'Til she's
                      really over the shock.

                                      MARGE
                      I got something better...
                              (to NANCY)
                      I'm gonna get you help, baby.
                      So no one will threaten you
                      any more.

      She takes the girl by the arm and guides her into the car,
      locking the door from outside.  NANCY never taking her eyes from
      her father's as the car bears her away.

                                              FADE TO BLACK

107.  EXT.  UCLA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE.  DAY.                               107.

      FADE UP ON UCLA's WESTWOOD CAMPUS and PAN TO SIGN:

                              UCLA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE
                                 INSTITUTE FOR THE
                             STUDY OF SLEEP DISORDERS


108.  INT.  A LABORATORY SLEEPING CHAMBER.                               108.

      A NURSE applies sencors to the head, breast, arms, and fingers of
      NANCY THOMPSON.  The girl is lying on a simple broad cot, in her
      pajamas.  The room is subdued in color and holds only this single
      bed.  A large mirror set into one wall hides an observation room
      beyond.

                                      NANCY
                      But I just don't feel... ready
                      to sleep yet.  Please, do I
                      have to?

109.  WIDER, REVEALING DR SAMUEL KING, a young, curly-haired internist;  109.
      intelligent and wry.  He treats NANCY at all times like a young
      adult, never patronizing.  He winks as the NURSE finishes.

                                      DR KING
                      Don't worry, you're not gonna
                      change into Bride of Frankenstein
                      or anything.

      NANCY manages a smile, but she's haggard and visibly thinner.
      MARGE, background, looks downright distraught.

                                      DR KING (CONTD)
                      Nancy have any severe childhood
                      illnesses?  Scarlet Fever?
                      High temperatures -- concussions?

                                      MARGE
                      No, nothing.

                                      NANCY
                      He means, did you ever drop me
                      on my head.

      The doctor and girl share a nervous laugh; MARGE doesn't even
      smile.

                                      DR KING
                      Nightmares are expected after
                      psychological trauma.  Don't
                      worry, they go away.

                                      MARGE
                      I sure as hell hope so.

                                      NANCY	
                      I don't see why you couldn't
                      just give me a pill to keep me
                      from dreaming...

                                      DR KING
                      Everyone's got to dream.  
                      If you don't dream, you go...
                              (he drills his finger
                               at his temple)
                      All set?

                                      NANCY
                      No.

                                      MARGE
                      They're just simple tests, 
                      Nan.  We'll both be right
                      here.

                                      DR KING
                      Look, I know it's been fright-
                      ening, I know your dreams have
                      seemed real.  But... it's 
                      okay.  Okay?

                                      MARGE
                      Please, Nancy.  Trust us.

      The girls gauges her mother, the doctor, the situation very
      carefully.  Then lowers her eyes.

                                      NANCY
                      It's not you I don't trust.
                      It's...
                              (gives up)
                      Okay.  Let's do it.

      Greatly relieved, MARGE gives NANCY a goodnight kiss, then
      follows the doctor through a doorway near the mirror.  As soon as
      her mother is out of sight, NANCY'S eyes drift to the mirror
      itself.  In its reflection she sees herself looking back, alone
      on the bed.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

	
110.  INT.  THE OBSERVATION ROOM.                                        110.

      MARGE and DR KING overlook NANCY's sleeping chamber through the
      one-way mirror.  And KING monitors the girl even more closely
      with a bank of instruments -- a mass of glowing dials, graphs and
      meters.  His manner with MARGE is slightly more sober.

                                      DR KING
                      How long's this been going on?

                                      MARGE
                      Since the murder.  She was fine
                      before that.

                                      DR KING
                      Not to worry.  No signs of path-
                      ology in Nancy's EEG or pulse
                      rate.  I'd guess what we've got
                      is a normal young girl who just
                      happens to have gone through
                      two days of hell.

                                      MARGE
                      It's just made her think...
                      her dreams are real...

      KING adjusts a dial, watching the EKG like a hawk.

                                      DR KING
                      Ever hear the old Buddhist tale
                      about the King who dreamed he 
                      was a beggar who dreamed he 
                      was a king?

      MARGE twitches.  Then there's a slight alteration in the sound of
      the EKG.  KING nods in satisfaction.

                                      DR KING (CONTD)
                      Okay, good.  She's asleep.

                                      MARGE
                              (immensely relieved)
                      Thank God.

      MUSIC RISES SOLEMNLY, MAJESTICALLY into a haunting transition as
      we

                                              DISSOLVE TO

111.  A MONTAGE OF SHOTS, of the EKG GRAPH, its inky needles calming,    111.
      of a METER tracing the quieting of NANCY's pulse, and of OTHER
      INSTRUMENTS, indicating life processes we can only guess.  All
      smoothing out.

112.  CLOSE ON NANCY on TV MONITOR, asleep like the child she is.        112.
      Innocent.

      MARGE lights a cigarette, angry at her helplessness.

                                      MARGE
                      What the hell are dreams, anyway?

                                      DR KING
                      Mysteries.  Incredible body
                      hookus pokus.  Truth is we
                      still don't know what they
                      are or where they come from.
                      As for nightmares...
                              (leans closer)
                      Did you know that in the last 
                      three years twenty Philipino
                      refugees in California died
                      in the middle of nightmares?
                      Not from heart attacks, either.
                      They just died.

      He gives a "Ah don' know" shrug.  MARGE looks out into the
      sleeping room.  NANCY is a motionless bundle in the middle of the
      bed.

113.  ANGLE ON A NEEDLE on an EKG dipping to a lower reading.            113.

114.  WIDER ANGLE -- the mother and DOCTOR watching.                     114.

                                      MARGE
                      What happened?  That needle
                      sank like a rock.

                                      DR KING
                              (quietly)
                      She's entering deep sleep now.
                      Heart rate's a little high due
                      to anxiety, but otherwise she's
                      nicely relaxed.  All normal.
                      She could dream at any time now.
                              (beat)
                      Right now she's like a diver
                      on the bottom of an ocean no
                      one's mapped yet.  Waiting to	
                      see what shows up.


115.  INT.  THE SLEEPING ROOM.                                           115.

      We can see NANCY drift from the initial stage, over the
      brink into deep sleep.  Her hair falls into her eyes; her face
      relaxes; her shoulders curl round her like comforters.  THE MUSIC
      DEEPENS, and begins to hint at the tones of the NIGHTMARE THEME.


116.  INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.                                          116.

      DR KING and MARGE watch the instruments' every move.

      One of the machines begins a slight CHIRPING.  KING scans it,
      liking what he sees.

                                      DR KING
                      Okay, she's started to dream.

      He leans forward in his chair, like a pilot starting an
      instrument approach.  MARGE THOMPSON licks her dry lips, fighting
      a turn of nausea.

                                      MARGE
                      How can you tell?

                                      DR KING
                      R.E.M.'s.  Rapid eye movements.
                      The eyes follow the
                      dream -- their movement picks
                      up on this --

      He prods a dial with his pencil and scribbles the time on a note
      pad.

                                      DR KING (CONTD)
                      Beta Waves are slowing, too.
                      She's dreaming, all right.
                      A good one, too.

      MARGE watches the TV MONITOR.  It's in extra-close on NANCY's
      eyes -- and they're darting beneath the lids, reacting to events
      lost behind a skein of flesh and neurons.

      KING points to a moving graph.  A needle's begun waving lazily
      between plus and minus three.  The DOCTOR nods, assured.

                                      DR KING (CONTD)
                      Typical dream parameter.  A
                      nightmare, now, would be plus or
                      minus five or six; she's just 
                      around three point --

      He stops.  Outside, visible through the glass, NANCY twists
      around.  Eyes still closed, she's nevertheless holding her head
      in the attitude of prey listening to the first faint sound of the
      predator's approach.

      MARGE looks from her daughter to the DOCTOR, color draining from
      her face.

                                      MARGE
                      What the hell's this?  She
                      awake or asleep?

      The needle of the graph gives a jagged pitch up, plunges, then
      surges well above the eight mark.  A strange MUSIC CUE --
      disonant and threatening, creeps in -- the NIGHTMARE THEME
      slurred into awful minors and weird disonance.  KING stares at
      the gauge in disbelief, rapping his finger on its glass.

                                      DR KING
                      Can't be.  It never gets
                      this high...

      The needle swings even higher, benind.

                                      DR KING (CONTD)
                      Jesus H. Christ.

      He's cut off by the high-pitched KEENING of the girl, the SOUND
      cutting through the double thickness of the glass like a lasar.
      A warning BEEPER has begun, the instruments light up like a
      Christmas tree -- and outside in the sleeping room, NANCY is
      contorting as if shot through with a thousand volts.  KING knocks
      over his chair in his sprint for the door.


117.  INT.  SLEEPING ROOM.                                               117.

      The DOCTOR and MARGE come in on the run -- NANCY's flailing and
      screaming as if the devil himself were after her.  KING grabs her
      to shake her awake;

      ANGLE ON NANCY (eyes open) -- looking in terror -- SOUND ECHOED
      STRANGELY.

      IN HER POV -- dressed in KING'S clothes -- the horribly scarred
      MAN reaches out.

      WIDER -- (NANCY'S eyes closed in sleep) as the girl's fist shoots
      out with incredible force and knocks DR KING flying!

      The NURSE and MARGE both descend on her --

      and again in her SLEEPING POV we see the MAN stagger for her.

      WIDER ON NANCY -- (still in her nightmare) -- fighting like a
      tiger with both MARGE and the NURSE -- sending the NURSE
      sprawling -- leaving MARGE hanging on for dear life.

      ANGLE on the stunned DOCTOR fumbling with a hyperdermic needle,
      spilling most of the stuff on himself with his shaking hands --
      the SCREAMS AND CURSES of NANCY are deafening and worthy of a
      stevador fighting off his worst enemy.  Stranger still, her hair
      is electrified, standing on end and greying before their very
      eyes!

      MARGE screams at the top of her lungs.

                                      MARGE
                      NANCY!!!  IT'S MOM -- NANCY!!!!

      Some deep bolt of psychic power smacks through the girl, and her
      eyes flap open -- they're glazed with terror and fury, but open.
      NANCY's awake.

      She stares around like a cornered animal in the middle of the
      bed, her purple face gasping out gut-wrenching SOBS.  The NURSE
      and MARGE dare to go back in and hold the sweat-drenched girl as
      DR KING comes for her with the needle.

                                      DR KING
                      Now, this is just going to let
                      you relax and sleep, Nan --

      With incredible swiftness, NANCY backhands the hypodermic into a
      far wall, shattering it into a million pieces.

                                      NANCY
                      No.  That's enough sleep.

      Her eyes are windows straight into white fire as she locks into
      KING'S face.  He dabs his split lip, swallowing painfully.

                                      DR KING
                      Okay, kid.  Okay.  Fair enough.

      He holds out his hand.  NANCY at last takes it, and sags back
      into her pillow, exhausted.  Then KING comes up with blood on his
      hand.

      He stares at it, dumbfounded, then at the girl.  Across her left
      forearm, a deep gash is bleeding freely, as if made by a very
      sharp instrument.

                                      MARGE
                      Oh my god, oh my god...

                                      DR KING
                              (to the NURSE)
                      Get the kit!

      The NURSE scrambles away as the DOCTOR claps his hand over the
      wounds.  He looks into NANCY's face.  What he sees frightens him
      even more: NANCY'S haunted, ghost-like eyes turn from him to her
      mother, and a terrible, chilling smile opens across NANCY's white
      lips.

                                      NANCY
                      You believe this?

      She pulls her free arm from beneath the sheets and reveals a
      strange hat, filthy and worn -- the KILLER'S hat.  The sight of
      it frightens MARGE more than anything that's come before.

                                      MARGE
                              (deathly pale)
                      Where the hell did you get that?

      NANCY fixes her with Xray eyes.

                                      NANCY
                      I grabbed it off his head.

      MARGE stares at the hat as if it held her whole future, and her
      future was a horror.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


118.  EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE.  DAY.                                         118.

                                                      BURN ON

                              THE SIXTH DAY

      FADE UP ON NANCY'S HOUSE, early morning.


119.  INT.  NANCY'S KITCHEN.  DAY.                                       119.

      MARGE is on the telephone, the dirty hat in her hand.  Nearby is
      a nearly empty bottle of gin.

                                      MARGE
                      She said she snatched it off
                      his head in a dream.
                              (listens)
                      No, I'm not crazy, I've got
                      the damn thing in my hand!
                              (listens)
                      I know we did, we all...
                              (hears NANCY 
                               approaching)
                      Gotta go.

      She hangs up and stuffs the hat and bottle into a drawer,
      screening the action with her body.  NANCY enters.

      By now the girl has an extraordinary look.  Her hair is ashen,
      her skin transluscent, and eyes dark-ringed.  Her right forearm
      is heavily bandaged over the slashes.  In short, instead of the
      girl next door, we now could be looking at the lunatic from the
      next cell.  MARGE, though she does her best to hide it, is
      downright frightened of her.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      You didn't sleep, did you?
                      The doctor says you have to 
                      sleep or you'll --

      NANCY pours herself a cup of black coffee.

                                      NANCY
                      Go even crazier?

                                      MARGE
                      I don't think you're going
                      crazy -- and stop drinking
                      that damn coffee!

                                      NANCY
                      Did you ask Daddy to have the 
                      hat examined?

                                      MARGE
                      I threw that filthy thing away --
                      I don't know what you're trying 
                      to prove with it, but --

      NANCY comes closer, her eyes shining with a new sureness.

                                      NANCY
                      What I learned at the dream
                      clinic, that's what I'm trying
                      to prove.  Rod didn't kill Tina, 
                      and he didn't hang himself.
                      It's this guy -- he's after
                      us in our dreams.

                                      MARGE
                      But that's just not reality,
                      Nancy!

120.  Furious, NANCY janks open the drawer before MARGE can stop her     120.
      and spills the bottle and hat onto the counter.

      MARGE grabs away the bottle protectively -- but it's the hat
      NANCY goes for.  She waves it triumphantly -- demonically. 

                                      NANCY
                      It's real, Mamma.  Feel it.

                                      MARGE
                              (horrified)
                      Put that damned thing down!

      MARGE lunges for it -- NANCY leaps out of reach --

                                      NANCY
                      His name is even in it -- written 
                      right in here -- Fred Krueger --
                      Fred Krueger!  You know who that
                      is, Mamma?  You better tell me,
                      cause now he's after me!

      MARGE swallows, then persists in the lie.

                                      MARGE
                      Nancy, trust your mother for 
                      once -- you'll feel better as 
                      soon as you sleep!

      NANCY shoots a hard humorless laugh, holding up her slashed arm.

                                      NANCY
                      You call this feeling better?
                      Or should I grab a bottle and
                      veg out with you -- avoid 
                      everything happening to me
                      by just getting good and loaded --

      MARGE slaps her hard.

                                      MARGE
                              (losing it)
                      Fred Krueger can't be after you,
                      Nancy -- he's dead!

      The room falls silent, both women staring at the other.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                              (low, raw)
                      Fred Krueger is dead.  Dead and
                      gone.  Believe me, I know.  Now
                      go to bed.  I order you, go to 
                      bed.

      MARGE snatches the hat away.  NANCY is furious, betrayed.

                                      NANCY
                      You knew about him all
                      this time, and you've been acting
                      like he was someone I made up!

      MARGE pulls away.

                                      MARGE
                      You're sick, Nancy.  Imagining 
                      things.  You need to sleep,
                      it's as simple as that.

      NANCY wheels and smashes MARGE'S bottle of gin in the sink.

                                      NANCY
                      Screw sleep!

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Nancy!

      But NANCY runs past her mother for the front door.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Nancy -- it's only a nightmare!

      NANCY turns in the doorway.

                                      NANCY
                      That's enough!

      On the door SLAM, we

                                              CUT TO


121.  EXT.  SHAKESPEARE BRIDGE.  DAY.                                    121.

      ANGLE ON A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET.  We hear GLEN's VOICE and PAN UP
      to REVEAL NANCY and GLEN high above, two tiny figures walking
      across this strange white bridge in old Los Angeles.  CAMERA
      BEGINS A SLOW ZOOM.

                                      GLEN
                      Whenever I get nervous I eat.

                                      NANCY
                      And if you can't do that, you
                      sleep.

                                      GLEN
                      Used to.  Not anymore.

      GLEN jams more Big Mack into his face.  By now our ZOOM reveals
      he's attacking a huge bag of Big Macks, and furtively eyeing
      NANCY.  The girl's hair is startlingly white in the sunlight.
      She's reading a book, hardly paying attention.

                                      GLEN (CONTD)
                      You ever read about the Balinese
                      way of dreaming?

                                      NANCY
                      No.

                                      GLEN
                      They got a whole system they
                      call 'dream skills'.  So, if
                      you have a nightmare, for 
                      instance like falling, right?

                                      NANCY
                      Yeah.

                                      GLEN
                      Instead of screaming and getting 
                      nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna
                      make up my mind that I fall
                      into a magic world where I can
                      get something special, like a 
                      poem or song.
                              (grins hopefully)
                      They get all their art literature
                      from dreams.  Just wake up and 
                      write it down.  Dreamskills.

      He stops, seeing the look on NANCY's face.  Our ZOOM is much
      closer now, a wide medium, and still coming in on the kids.

                                      NANCY
                      And what if they meet a monster
                      in their dream?  Then what?

                                      GLEN
                      They turn their back on it.
                              (grins hopefully)
                      Takes away its energy, and
                      it disappears.

                                      NANCY
                      What happens if they don't do
                      that?

                                      GLEN
                              (shrugs)
                      I guess those people don't
                      wake up to tell what happens.

                                      NANCY
                      Great.

      She leans over the railing, poking her face back into her book.
      GLEN tips its cover and reads its title.  OUR ZOOM IS STILL
      MOVING CLOSER, a MEDIUM CLOSE UP NOW.
 
                                      GLEN
                      'Booby Traps and Improvised 
                      Anti-personel Devices'!

                                      NANCY
                      I found it at this neat
                      survivalist bookstore on
                      Ventura.

                                      GLEN
                              (shocked)
                      Well what you reading it for?

      OUR ZOOM LOCKS IN ON A TIGHT TWO ON THEIR FACES, NANCY's grimly
      determined.

                                      NANCY
                      I'm into survival.

      She walks away, OUT OF FRAME, leaving GLEN watching after her in
      astonishment.

                                      GLEN
                      She's starting to scare the
                      living shit out of me.


122.  EXT. ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOME/EVENING                               122.

      ANGLE ACROSS NANCY'S "TREE LAWN", the grass between
      the sidewalk and the street, in the general direction
      of GLEN's home.  This ANGLE doesn't quite reveal
      Nancy's house.

      FOREGROUND is a utility truck in which a half dozen
      Hispanic WORKERS are loading tools, extension cords
      and hardware.  They
      look like they've put in one hell of a hard day's work.

      MARGE appears and hands a check to the FOREMAN of the crew, a
      white guy in clean coveralls and a gold chain.  He scrutinizes
      it.

                                      FOREMAN
                      And the other...

      MARGE forks over a wad of cash, hands trembling in her
      half-drunk, helpless rage.

                                      MARGE
                      Where's your mask and gun?

      The FOREMAN counts the money swiftly.

                                      FOREMAN
                      Don't bust my chops, lady.
                      If the city found out I put
                      'em in without inside releases
                      I'd loose my license.

      He shoves the money in his pocket and climbs in his truck.  MARGE
      EXITS FRAME for her house.

      PAN WITH THE TRUCK as it pulls away, THEN PICK UP NANCY, walking
      across the street from the corner.  Alone.  Dispirited.  She
      lifts her eyes to her home and stops in her tracks.

                                      NANCY
                      Oh gross...

123.  WIDENING TO REVEAL THE HOUSE as NANCY walks across her front       123.
      yard.  Every single window has been covered with brand-new
      ornamental iron bars, bolted deeply into their frames.

      CLOSER, AT A WINDOW.  NANCY gives a set of bars a powerful
      shake.  They don't budge.  Then girl looks up and sees even the
      window to her second floor bedroom is barred.  And the rose
      trellis has been ripped down and heaped at the foundation in a
      tangle of wood, thorns and broken flowers.


124.  INT.  MARGE'S ROOM.  EVENING.                                      124.

      ANGLE ON THE DOORWAY INTO THE HALL.  Easy listening MUSIC wafts
      through the air.  NANCY appears in the doorway.

                                      NANCY (OS)
                      Mom, what's with the bars!?

125.  REVERSE to MARGE, propped against the headboard of her bed, a      125.
      crooked shadow in the gloom.  A fresh bottle of Gin glints in her
      hand.

                                      NANCY
                      Oh, Mom...

      The girl crosses and reaches gently for the bottle.  MARGE
      snatches it away.

                                      MARGE
                      'S'mine...

      She rocks the bottle in her arms.

                                      NANCY
                      What's with the bars?

                                      MARGE
                      S'curity.

      NANCY sits on the bed, a surprising compassion entering her
      voice.

                                      NANCY
                      Mom, I want to know what you
                      know about Fred Krueger.

                                      MARGE
                      Dead and gone.

                                      NANCY
                      I want to know how, where --
                      if you don't tell me, I'm going
                      to call daddy.

      MARGE gives a laugh -- a rasping chachination from deep in her
      chest.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Your father the cop.  That's a
                      good one.
                              (colder)
                      Forget Fred Krueger.  You don't
                      want to know, believe me.

                                      NANCY
                      I do want to know.  He's not
                      dead and gone -- he's after me
                      and if I sleep he'll get me!
                      I've got to know!

      MARGE blinks at her a moment, then cracks a terrible, crooked
      grin.

                                      MARGE
                      All right.


126.  INT. NANCY'S CELLAR/NIGHT                                          126.

      MARGE drags NANCY headlong down the cellar stairs and across the
      room with a crazy fury, twisting her down near the foundation.
      And she thrusts her face so close to her daughter's that NANCY
      reels from the alcohol.

                                      MARGE
                      You want to know who Fred
                      Krueger was?  He was a filthy
                      child killer who got at least
                      twenty kids, kids from our
                      area, kids we all knew.  It
                      drove us all crazy when we
                      didn't know who was doing it --
                      but it was even worse when
                      they caught him.

      MARGE draws herself up with a shake.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Oh lawyers got fat and the judge
                      got famous, but someone forgot to
                      sign the search warrant in the 
                      right place, and Fred Krueger
                      was free, just like that.

                                      NANCY
                      So he's alive?

      MARGE smiles grimly.

                                      MARGE
                      He wouldn've stopped.  The 
                      bastard would've got more
                      kids first chance he got --
                      they found nearly ten bodies
                      in his boiler room as it
                      was.  But the law couldn't
                      touch him.

      At the mention of "boiler room", NANCY gives a shake.  MARGE
      misses this, too busy taking a pull on the bottle that's never
      left her hand.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      What was needed were some private
                      citizens willing to do what had
                      to be done.

      She reels slowly, looking at NANCY is defiance.

                                      NANCY
                              (hushed)
                      What did you do, mother?

      MARGE cradles the bottle.

                                      MARGE
                      Bunch of us parents tracked him
                      down after they let him go.  Found
                      him in an old boiler room, just
                      like before.  Saw him lying there
                      in that caked red and yellow sweater
                      he always wore, drunk an' asleep
                      with his weird knives by his side...

                                      NANCY
                              (dreading it)
                      Go on...

      MARGE reaches over and taps a dusty two-gallon jug of gasoline
      near the lawn mower.

                                      MARGE
                      We poured gasoline all around
                      the place, left a trail out the 
                      door, locked the door, then...

      She mimes striking a match --

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      WHOOSH!!!

      Her arms shoot up and her eyes go wide with the light of that
      fire.  There's awe in her voice.  Then she drops her arms.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                              (hushed, remembering)
                      But just when it seemed not
                      even the devil could live
                      in there any more -- he crashed
                      out like a banshee, all on fire
                      -- swinging those fingerknives
                      every which direction and 
                      screaming he... he was going
                      to get us by killing all our
                      kids...

      She stops with a sudden quake and drinks for a long moment.  But
      the intake doesn't hide the image.  Her face bathed in tears, she
      looks at her daughter and shakes her head.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      There were all those men, Nancy,
                      even your father, oh yes, even
                      him.  But none could do what
                      had to be done -- Krueger rolling 
                      and screaming so loud the whole
                      state could hear -- no one could
                      take your father's gun and kill 
                      him good and proper except me.

      She sweeps her hand across the air in a terrific slash, then
      stops, her hand shaking, her voice hoarse and terrified.  She
      looks at her daughter, begging.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      So he's dead Nan.  He can't
                      get you.  Mommy killed him.

	For someone who started this film at a very young seventeen,
      NANCY's now the battle-tempered veteran as she takes her mother
      in her arms and rocks her.

                                      NANCY
                      Who was there?  Were Tina's 
                      parents there?  Were Rod's?

      MARGE sags back.

                                      MARGE
                      Sure, and Glen's.  All of us.
                      But that's in the past now,
                      baby.  Really.  It's over.
                              (slyly)
                      We even took his knives.

      The woman twists around and opens the door on an old furnace -- a
      furnace unused since the newer gas one nearby was put in.  She
      fishes inside the cavity -- as then we hear a touch of the
      familiar 'SCRRIITCH'.  Next moment she pulls out an object
      wrapped in rags, opens it and displays the long, rusted blades
      and their glove-like apparatus.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      See?

      NANCY stares at the damn things, chilled.

                                      NANCY
                      All these years you've kept those
                      things buried down here?  In our
                      own house?

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Proof he's declawed.  As for him,
                      we buried him good and deep.

      MARGE shoves the knives into their hiding place, closes the
      little iron door.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      So's okay, you can sleep.

      She lurches up and staggers upstairs.

      NANCY shivers and looks down at her arm.  The cut beneath her
      bandage has begun to bleed again.  And from inside the furnace,
      as if from deep below, the PULSING of the boundless
      nightmare-boiler room can be faintly heard.

                      Hello?

                                      NANCY (telephone)
                      Hi.

                                      GLEN
                      Oh.  Hi, how y'doing?

      NANCY looks out the window and touches her hair.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Fine.  Stand by your window
                      so I can see you.  You sound
                      a million miles away.

      In the lighted window across the way, she can SEE GLEN move into
      sight.  In his shot, we can SEE NANCY step into her window behind
      the bars.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Much better.

                                      GLEN
                      I heard your ma went ape at the 
                      security store today.  You look
                      like the Prisoner of Zenda or
                      something.  How long's it been 
                      since you slept?

                                      NANCY
                      Coming up on the seventh day.  It's
                      okay, I checked Guiness.  The 
                      record's eleven, and I'll beat 
                      that if I have to.
                              (beat)
                      Listen, I... I know who he is.

                                      GLEN
                      Who?

                                      NANCY
                      The killer.

                                      GLEN
                      You do?

                                      NANCY
                      Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm
                      pretty sure you're next.

      GLEN is appalled.

                                      GLEN
                      Me!?  Why would anyone want to
                      kill me?!

                                      NANCY
                      Don't ask -- just give me some
                      help nailing this guy when I
                      bring him out.

      GLEN pales.

                                      GLEN
                      Bring him out of what?

                                      NANCY
                      My dream.

                                      GLEN
                      How you plan to do that?

                                      NANCY
                      Just like I did the hat.  Have
                      a hold of the sucker when you
                      wake me up.

                                      GLEN
                      Me?
                              (switching back to a more
                               comfortable reality)
                      Wait a minute, you can't bring
                      someone out of a dream!

                                      NANCY
                      If I can't, then you all can
                      relax, because it'll just be a
                      simple case of me being nuts.

                                      GLEN
                      I can save you the trouble.
                      You're nutty as a fruitcake.
                      I love you anyway.

                                      NANCY
                      Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking
                      this guy when I bring him out.

                                      GLEN
                      What!?

                                      NANCY
                              (simplicity itself)
                      You heard me.  I grab him in the
                      dream -- you see me struggling 
                      so you wake me up.  We both come
                      out, you cold cock the fucker,
                      and we got him.  Clever, huh?

                                      GLEN
                      You crazy?  Hit him with what?

                                      NANCY
                      You're a jock.  You must have
                      a baseball bat or something.
                      Come to my window at midnight.
                      And meanwhile...

                                      GLEN
                              (weakly)
                      Meanwhile..?

                                      NANCY
                      Meanwhile whatever you do
                      don't fall asleep.  Midnight.

      She hangs up.  GLEN's eyes bug out.

                                      GLEN
                      Holy shit!  Midnight.  Baseball
                      bats and boogemen.  Unfucking
                      real.


130.  OMIT                                                          OMIT 130.

131.  EXT.  THE VALLEY AND HILLS.  NIGHT.                                131.

      HIGH, WIDE SHOT.  The moon is above the horizon.  A cool wind
      slides a bank of white fog inland.  The valley and its lights
      stretch forever, an endless net of illumination and darkness.  A
      coyote HOWLS on the dark hill.


132.  EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      132.

      A palm frond scuttles across the center of the parking lot.  LT
      THOMPSON arrives in an unmarked car.

                                      COP (passing)
                      Lieutenant Thompson -- what
                      you doing in at this time?

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Can't sleep, thought I'd come
                      break up the poker game.

      The COP laughs and goes his way.  THOMPSON's smile evaporates.

	
133.  INT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      133.

      THOMPSON enters and checks the log.  Nearby, SGT GARCIA pours
      coffee.

                                      SERGEANT GARCIA
                      If it was any more quiet we
                      could hear owls farting.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Is quiet, isn't it?

                                      SERGEANT GARCIA
                              (too casually)
                      How's your girl?

      THOMPSON looks at the Desk sergeant a moment, then tosses down
      the log.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      She's sensible.  She'll sleep
                      sooner or later.


134.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          134.

      The neighborhood is utterly still, most of the homes already
      dark.  But not NANCY's.  Or GLEN's.

      ZOOM TO GLEN'S LIGHTED LIVING ROOM WINDOW.


135.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  135.

      GLEN's father watches eleven o'clocks news, a dreary FILM CLIP
      (STOCK) of war and refugees in a far-away land.

      MR LANTZ takes a pull on his Bud.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      You'd think they'd have some-
                      thing 'bout the Lane kid hanging
                      himself.

      MRS LANTZ walks through the room, drying her hands on a
      dishtowel.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Maybe we're all making more out
                      of it than we should.

      She heads upstairs.  MR LANTZ pops the automatic tuner.  CARSON
      blinks ON.

                                      CARSON (TV)
                      I wouldn't touch that line with
                      a ten foot pole.

      ED MCMAHON and the AUDIENCE laugh in delight.


136.  INT.  GLEN'S HOUSE/UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR.  NIGHT.                      136.

      MRS LANTZ comes along the upstairs hall and knocks gently at a
      closed door.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Glen?  you all right?

      She puts her ear to the door and listens.

                                      MRS LANTZ (CONTD)
                      Glen honey?

      No answer.


137.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         137.

      GLEN lies sprawled across the bed, long legs flung over the end,
      head not visible.

      His mother enters.  She looks at the boy, turns off the TV.
                                                   Looks at him again.
      From this angle she can see his head, earphones crammed over it
      rasping their tinny noise.  But no movement from the kid at all.
      MRS LANTZ crosses and pokes him in the ribs.  GLEN lurches up,
      arms windmilling.

                                      GLEN
                      Whuu?

      He refocuses his eyes, takes off his earphones.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      How can you listen to Carson and
                      a record at the same time?

      GLEN swings his legs over the edge of the bed and shakes his head
      to clear the cobwebs.

                                      GLEN
                      Wasn't listening to the tube,
                      just watching.  Miss Nude
                      America's supposed to be on
                      tonight.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Well how you gonna hear what
                      she says?

                                      GLEN
                      Who cares what she says?

      The mother gives up.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      You should get to sleep soon, 
                      Glen.  It's almost midnight.
                      Goodness knows we've all had
                      enough of a time the last few
                      days...

                                      GLEN
                      I will, Mom...in a while.
                      You guys turning in?

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Pretty soon.

      His MOTHER sighs and goes out, closing the door behind her.  GLEN
      flips the TV back on and glances at the clock.

138.  INSERT OF CLOCK.  It's 11:42.                                      138.

139.  TIGHT ON GLEN's face.  He clamps the earphones back on, and turns  139.
      the volume up high.  The MUSIC is so loud we can hear it
      resonating inside his skull.

      CAMERA MOVES PAST GLEN to his window, then ZOOMS through to:


140.  EXT.  ELM STREET / NANCY'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                          140.

      CONTINUE ZOOMING into the LIGHTED window of NANCY's barred second
      floor bedroom and

                                                      CUT TO:

141.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT                                         141.

      CLOSE ON MARGE, weaving on the edge of NANCY's bed, stroking
      the girl's hair.  NANCY's still something of a wreck, but less
      than 	MARGE.

                                      MARGE
                      We'll go away, take a vacation.
                      Get your hair colored nice, the
                      way it was.  No one will ever
                      know.
                              (sniffs)
                      This whole room smells of coffee,
                      y'know?

      She gathers up NANCY's coffee cups and empty NoDoz boxes, leans
      down and kisses her.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      It's all over now, baby.  The
                      nightmare's over.  Please.

      NANCY nods her head, half stubborn, half sadly.  She can barely
      keep her eyes open now.

                                      NANCY
                      Okay.

      She scrunches into her pillow.  MARGE smiles haggardly and shuts
      off the light, taking the coffee pot with her as she leaves.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Night-night.

      MARGE smiles, relieved.  The girl pulls the blanket around her
      shoulders.  Her eyes flutter closed, her breathing becomes regular
      and deep.  Once again she's the litle girl MARGE fantasizes she
      is.

      The mother tiptoes out of the room, closing the door behind her.
      HOLD ON NANCY's sleeping face as the DOOR CLOSES.  Her eyes
      remain closed another beat, then open wide.

      She quietly jumps out of bed and shakes herself savagely to
      scatter the sleep settling so quickly.

      Still in the dark, she fishes a full electric coffepot from under
      her bed and pours herself a fresh fix into a mug she digs from
      beneath her pillow.  The face illuminated by the neon light on the
      pot is set in absolute determination.

      NANCY drains the cup, then crosses to her closet, retrieves a
      pitcher of ice water from behind a heap of clothes and splashes
      her eyes and the back of her neck.  That done she eases open her
      window and presses her face to the bars, sucking in cool night
      air until every shred of sleep is gone from her brain.

      Then she starts pulling on clothes.


142.  INT.  NANCY'S HOUSE/DOWNSTAIRS.  NIGHT.                            142.

      ANGLE ON MARGE as she checks the lock on the backdoor.  Firm.

143.  ANGLE IN THE LIVING ROOM as she pads through the darkened house,   143.
      feels her way to a wall of shelves and takes down a book.  Then
      another, and a third.  Then reaches in and fishes out a bottle of
      gin.


144.  EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE AND ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                        144.

      The sky has gathered in greater darkness.  LOW, DISTANT THUNDER
      rolls around the horizon like a great drum.

      ANGLE ON NANCY'S HOUSE from across the street.  The moon glints
      off the barred windows. CAMERA ZOOMS to NANCY's window.  The
      imprisoned girl hovers in the darkness behind the grill like a
      ghost, her eyes turned towards GLEN's.  Then she switches to
      something much CLOSER TO CAMERA ANGLE, and she draws back.

145.  REVERSE ON GLEN's father, standing on the front porch of his       145.
      home, also in the shadows, looking straight across and up at
      NANCY.  He 	draws on his cigarette; his face glows red.

146.  NANCY pulls down the shade.                                        146.

147.  GLEN's father grinds the cigarette beneath his shoe.               147.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Shouldn't stare.

      As the man turns our SHOT WIDENS TO REVEAL MRS LANTZ.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Know what I think?  I think 
                      that kid's some kinda lunatic.

      The woman spoons more sweetness into her mouth and rubs her
      forehead.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Shouldn't say such a thing about
                      the poor child.  If you mean the 
                      bars, Marge's just being cautious,
                      her being alone and Nancy acting
                      so nervous lately.

      The woman rises and pulls him gently towards the living room.  As
      he goes inside he takes one last look.

                                      MR LANTZ (CONTD)
                      Well, she ain't gonna hang around
                      our boy no more.

      Once the two are inside, the door is locked.


148.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        148.

      CLOSE ON NANCY's face.  VERY CLOSE.  Her eyes stare ahead,
      red-rimmed, anxious.  She picks absently at the thick bandage
      covering her forearm.  The long cuts from Fred Krueger's fingers
      are bleeding again, but she doesn't even care anymore.  Too late
      to sweat the small stuff.  She crosses the room.

      On the bedside table with the nearly empty Pyrex coffee maker,
      the empty cup and the empty box of No-Doz, is her old fashioned
      alarm clock, and a phone.

      NANCY pours herself the last of the coffee and drinks it to the
      dregs, then looks to the clock.

      INSERT CLOCK -- ten minutes to midnight.

      NANCY'S eyes go to the door.

      WIDER.  Fully clothed and in a jacket now, she creeps to the door
      and cracks it, just to make sure.  Then freezes.


149.  INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE NANCY'S DOOR.                                149.

      IN NANCY'S POV through the door we see MARGE, rummaging around in
      the linen closet not fifteen feet away.  There's no way NANCY can
      get past her.  The woman pulls out a full bottle of gin in
      satisfaction and begins fumbling with its cap.


150.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        150.

      NANCY eases the door closed again and sinks to the key hole,
      watching through it with a sinking heart.

                                      NANCY
                              (very quiet, very intense)
                      Hang on GLEN...


151.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         151.

      GLEN, coat now on, goes to his window, checking.


152.  INT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          152.

      GLEN'S POV -- NANCY'S porch is deserted; front door closed,
      lights out.  No sign of NANCY.


153.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         153.

      GLEN shrugs, takes off his jacket and plops back onto his bed.

                                      GLEN
                      Well, I'm not gonna risk
                      sneaking out until she does.

      He puts the earphones back on.


154.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        154.

      Absolutely frustrated, NANCY turns from the keyhole to the
      window. She opens the blind and eases back the curtain.


155.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.

      IN NANCY'S POV THROUGH THE BARS we ZOOM directly across to GLEN's
      window.


156.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         156.

      GLEN lies on his bed, fully clothed, earphones over his ears,
      CARSON droning from the TV.  And the boy's eyes begin to droop.


157.  INT.  NANCY'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     157.

      NANCY picks up her phone, bites her lip, then begins dialing.


158.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         158.

      TIGHT ON PHONE as it begins RINGING loudly.

      WIDER SHOT, revealing GLEN asleep BACKGROUND, the MUSIC still
      LOUD in his earphones.


159.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  159.

      RINGING here, too, just as MR LANTZ is turning out the lights for
      bed.  He stops in the dark, scowling.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Who at this hour?

      He refuses to turn the light back on.  His wife picks her way to
      the telephone.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Hello?
                              (listens, frowns
                               slightly)
                      Oh... Hold on.
                              (covers the mouthpiece)
                      It's her.  She wants to talk to
                      Glen.

      The father crosses to the telephone, suspicious.

                                      MR LANTZ
                              (whispering)
                      About what?

                                      MRS LANTZ
                              (into phone)
                      What's this about, Nancy?

      She listens, covers up again.

                                      MRS LANTZ (CONTD)
                      She says it's private.  Very 
                      private and very important.

      MR LANTZ grabs the telephone from his wife and barks into it.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Glen's asleep.  Talk to him
                      tomorrow!

      He SLAMS down the telephone with a grunt of satisfaction to his
      wife.

                                      MR LANTZ (CONTD)
                      Just got to be firm with kids,
                      is all.

      Then as a refinement he takes the phone off the hook and lays it
      on the table.


160.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        160.

      NANCY dials again.  This time she gets a BUSY SIGNAL.  She slams
      the phone down in frustration and looks out the window.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen.  Don't fall asleep...

      She goes and sits on the bed, propping her chin on her fists.
161.  Yawns.  The TELEPHONE RINGS.                                       161.

      NANCY snatches it up.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen?

      TIGHT ON HER, ZOOMING EVEN CLOSER ON HER EAR AND THE EARPIECE as
      we HEAR the awful SCRITCHING SCRAPE of STEEL FINGERKNIVES.

      NANCY slaps the phone down as if it were diseased -- then, in
      pure rage, rips the thing's cord from the wall.

      Spent instantly, she puts the receiver back on the cradle and
      lays it on her bed, chiding herself.

                                      NANCY
                      Brilliant.  Now what if Glen
                      calls?

      She wraps the phone cord around the useless machine and puts it
      on her bed, then sneaks back to the door.  This time she gives an
      expression of relief, and opens the door.  MARGE is gone.

      Then the TELEPHONE RINGS again.

      CAMERA MOVES IN ON NANCY as she turns slowly.

162.  REVERSE IN HER POV.  THE TELEPHONE RINGS again, despite the fact   162.
      that the end of its janked-out cord is clearly visible.  The
      NIGHTMARE MUSIC THEME slips right up our spines.

      BACK ON NANCY.  She starts to shake.  She goes to the telephone
      as we WIDEN, unwraps it as it RINGS even louder.  She's shaking
      so hard by now she can barely manage to lift the receiver.  MOVE
      IN CLOSE ON HER, so close we can HEAR her teeth chattering as she
      brings the phone to her ear.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Hello?

      The unmistakeable VOICE of FRED KRUEGER comes over the phone,
      garbled by time and unknown dimensions, but clear enough.

                                      KRUEGER (FILTER)
                              (triumphant)
                      I'm your boyfriend now...

      CLOSE ON THE MOUTHPIECE.  It's changed from a normal telephone
      mouthpiece to an actual mouth -- Fred Krueger's mouth -- and his
      long, slick tongue flicks out and darts into the startled girl's
      mouth!

      WIDER -- as NANCY explodes from her micro-dream -- absolutely
      mad.  She jerks the telephone away from her and smashes it
      against her wall, then attacks it with her feet and hands,
      smashing it to smithereens.

      ANGLE ON THE TELEPHONE PIECES.  Normal pieces of a normal
      telephone.

      She pinches herself hard -- until tears come and her flesh is
      nearly bleeding.

                                      NANCY
                      I'm awake, I am awake.  This is
                      not a dream!  I am --

      She stops, realizing what Krueger meant.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      My boyfriend...!


163.  INT.  NANCY'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                 163.

      NANCY barrels down the stairs and across the darkened living room
      to the front door.

      It takes her a moment of tugging and fumbling to realize the
      deadbolt is locked from inside.  And there's no key in it now.

      She races to a porch window and throws it open, shaking and
      banging on the bars like a mad woman.  But there's no getting
      through.  She staggers back, stymied and furious.  Then somebody
      moves behind her in the dark.

                                      VOICE (OS)
                      Locked.

      NANCY jumps around in shock.  Her mother has posted herself on
      the couch with her bottle.

                                      NANCY
                              (furious)
                      Give me the key, mother.

                                      MARGE
                      I don't even have it on me,
                      so forget it.

      The word is final.  NANCY runs past the woman to the back door,
      to one window after the other, shaking bars and slamming locks
      and SCREAMING in teenage fury.  But it's no good.  The house is
      her prison.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                              (drunk satisfaction)
                      Paid the guy damn good to make
                      sure you stayed put.  You ain't
                      goin' nowhere, kid.  You're
                      gonna sleep tonight if it kills
                      me.

      NANCY clenches her fists and screams at the top of her lungs, a
      heart-wrenching, eardrum-breaking cry of love in despair --

                                      NANCY
                      GLEEENNNNNN!

                                                SMASH CUT TO:

164.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         164.

      CLOSE ON GLEN'S FROM DIRECTLY ABOVE.  The MUSIC is tinny from the
      earphones, the TV SOUND DISTANT AND ECHOED.  The boy is breathing
      deeply now, slowly and gently.  Then, unmistakeably, he begins to
      SNORE.  Very faintly, far in the background, we can hear NANCY.

                                      NANCY (OS)
                      Glen!!  Don't fall asleeeeeep!

      CAMERA PULLS BACK AND STRAIGHT UP as the SNORES merge with a
      weird, unsettling MUSIC CUE.  The boy lies sprawled, still
      clothed, in the middle of his bed.  Save for the bedside lamp,
      the room is dark.

      FULL WIDE ANGLE FROM THIS HIGH SPOT looking down at him as from
      the eyes of some great fly hung on the ceiling.  THE MUSIC
      REACHES A TERRIFYING PITCH OF ANTICIPATION -- THEN STOPS
      ABRUPTLY.

      There's a heartbeat's pause.  Then with tremendous force, two
      powerful arms shoot up beneath the red and yellow bedspread and
      grab GLEN around the waist!

      Next moment the young man's body is dragged straight down into
      the bed, as if some huge beast had grabbed him and heaved him
      down!  His feet and his arms shoot up -- there's another hauling
      yank -- and the boy disappears except for his hands and fingers
      -- down into the pit in the middle of the bed!  His hands are
      last to go, clawing for a hold.  But soon they vanish as well,
      dragging blankets and bedsheets, wires and stereo across the
      caved-in bed and into the abyss.

      There's HIDEOUS SCREECHING of MUSIC jamming in with GLEN's
      ECHOING SCREAMS -- then an unholy, sudden silence.

      Next moment what's left of GLEN is vomited up from the pit of the
      nightmare bed...a horrible mess of blood and bone and hair and
      wires...streaming out and over the bed.  Then the pit in the bed
      is gone as if it were never there.

      Drawn by the terribly screams and struggle, GLEN's mother bursts
      into the room.  The women stares for one moment of horrified
      disbelief, then reels back and lets out the most god-awful SCREAM
      imaginable.  The cry splits the night.


165.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          165.

      The SOUND of the SCREAM CROSS-FADES WITH the WAIL of the
      AMBULANCE as it screeches to a halt at the curb, followed by two
      BLACK AND WHITES and an UNMARKED CAR.  Uniformed POLICEMEN spill
      out FOREGROUND.

      LT THOMPSON and PARKER exit the unmarked car.  By habit or by
      premonition THOMPSON glances at the house that was his home.  His
      eye is caught by a movement; his daughter is at her upstairs
      window, white-haired, hollow-eyed, looking down on him through
      her bars.  She gives a little wave.

      Unnerved, THOMPSON waves back, then walks rapidly for GLEN's
      home.  MR LANTZ, pale as a ghost himself, waits on the porch; we
      can hear the mother's WAILING inside.


166.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        166.

      CLOSE ON NANCY'S BIG OLD WINDUP ALARM CLOCK.  Its big and little
      hands sweep together at midnight.

                                              BURN ON:

                              THE NINTH DAY

      There's a BABBLE of POLICE RADIOS, SIRENS WINDING DOWN, RUNNING
      FOOT-STEPS, SHOUTS, NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS and DOGS BARKING as CAMERA
      LIFTS TO NANCY'S FACE.  Set.  Unafraid.  Ruthless.

      The girl pulls the window shade on it all, then looks at her
      bed.

                                      NANCY
                      Okay, Krueger, you bastard.
                      We play in your court.


167.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM/NANCY'S KITCHEN -- INTERCUT.  NIGHT.      167.

168.  LT THOMPSON is halfway across the living room when he stops.       168.
      Something dark and red is welling from a crack in the ceiling.
      One of his men is rigging a bucket beneah to catch the leaking.
      The telephone rings and PARKER picks it up.

                                      PARKER
                      Lieutenant.  It's your daughter.
                      Says it's urgent.

      THOMPSON turns away from the dripping.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                              (low)
                      Tell her I'm not here, tell
                      her...

                                      PARKER
                      Uh, she just saw you, sir...

      THOMPSON nods, crosses and picks up the telephone.  SCREEN
      SPLITS; we see both.

                                      LT THOMPSON (CONTD)
                      Hello Nancy.

                                      NANCY
                      Hi daddy.  I know what happened.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Then you know more than I do --
                      I haven't even been upstairs.

                                      NANCY
                              (guessing)
                      You know he's dead though, right?

      THOMPSON debates, then admits it.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Yeah, apparantly he's dead.
                      How the hell'd you know?

      A tear coarses down NANCY's cheek, but her voice remains firm.

                                      NANCY
                      I've got a proposition for
                      you.  Listen very carefully,
                      please.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Nan, I --

                                      NANCY
                      Please.  I'm gonna go get
                      the guy who did it and bring
                      him to you.  I just need you
                      be right there to arrest him.
                      Okay?

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Just tell me who did it and
                      I'll go get him, baby.

                                      NANCY
                      Fred Krueger did it, Daddy,
                      and only I can get him.  It's
                      my nightmare he comes to.

      The detective flinches at the name.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Where'd you hear about Krueger --

      NANCY presses, very firm, very rational.

                                      NANCY
                      -- I want you to come over here
                      and break the door down exactly
                      twenty minutes from now -- can 
                      you do that?

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Sure, but...

                                      NANCY
                      That'll be exactly half past 
                      midnight.  Time for me to fall
                      asleep and find him.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Sure, sure, honey.  You just 
                      do that -- get yourself some 
                      sleep -- that's what I've been
                      saying all along.

                                      NANCY
                      And you'll be here to catch
                      him, right?

                                      PARKER
                      Lieutenant -- they're waiting
                      upstairs.

      THOMPSON waves curtly, still speaking to NANCY.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Sure, okay, I'll be there.
                      Now you just turn in and get
                      some rest, sweetheart.  Please.
                      Deal?

                                      NANCY
                      Deal.

      NANCY hangs up.  LT THOMPSON starts upstairs.  But then he stops,
      and as an afterthought he could never really explain, turns to
      PARKER.

                                      LT THOMPSON (CONTD)
                      Get outside and watch her house.
                      If you see anything funny call
                      me.

                                      PARKER
                      'Anything funny' like what?

      THOMPSON shakes his head, embarassed.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      I don't know -- but one thing
                      for sure, I don't want her 
                      coming over here.  She's way 
                      too far gone to be able to
                      to handle this.

      As PARKER exits, ANGLE CUTS TO NANCY'S KITCHEN as the girl hangs
      up and sinks back agiainst the wall, trapped by her own
      resolution.  She looks at her watch.

169.  INSERT -- five past midnight.  NANCY switches modes to stopwatch   169.
      and sets the COUNTDOWN going at twenty-five minutes.


170.  INT.  GLEN'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      170.

      LT THOMPSON steps into GLEN's room, anxious to be done with it.
      He hits a wall of stench and horror even before he takes it in
      with his eyes, and as soon as he sees the bed he claps his hand
      over his mouth, pivots and walks right back into the hallway.


171.  INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             171.

      He sags against the wall, unable to look at the COPS who hover
      there.

                                      COP
                              (faint)
                      What the hell did that,
                      Lieutenant?  There ain't even
                      a head left.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Goddamed if I know.
                              (tries to straighten)
                      What's the Coronor say?

                                      COP
                      He's in the john puking since 
                      he saw it.


172.  INT.  CELLAR.  NIGHT.                                              172.

      NANCY pulls tools and hardware out with grim resolution.  Hammer,
      nails, spools of wire, an old square of heavy fishneting, some
      old shot gun shells, a file -- referring only once to the booklet
      in her hand.


173.  INT.  NANCY'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                 173.

      Barely able to control her shaking hands, NANCY starts stringing
      off the spool of wire across the living room, crying and swearing
      at the same time.

      DISSOLVE TO HER HANDS wrapping bare lamp wire around two
      thumbtacks stuck into the insides of the pinchers of a common
      wooden clothespin.  The wire goes OFF SCREEN.

      ANOTHER ANGLE as she inserts a Lifesaver between the two prongs.
      One end of the fishline is tied to the lifesaver.  The whole now
      is stretched taut about three inches off the living room carpet.

      ON NANCY carefully filing a hole in a LIGHTBULB.

      OH HER pouring powder and shot from shotgun shells into the
      opening in the bulb until it's full, then sealing it with tape.

      DISSOLVE TO HER screwing the bulb back into the floor lamp, and
      placing the thing near the foot of the stairs.

175.  INT.  NANCY'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                            175.

      -- NANCY completes installing a sturdy sliding bolt to the
      outside of her own bedroom door.

      -- NANCY screws a hinge into the wall directly above her door.
      Attached to the hinge is the shank of something -- some kind of
      tool.  We can't see what it is because CAMERA never quite frames
      the whole thing.

      -- NANCY tiptoes to her mother's door and peeks in.

	
176.  INT.  MARGE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     176.

      MARGE lies propped in her bed looking back at NANCY.  Her
      drunkeness has been altered by the SIRENS and BABBLE outside into
      a sort of comatose clarity.

                                      MARGE
                      Guess I should'n'a done it.

                                      NANCY
                      Just sleep now, Mom.

                                      MARGE
                      Just wanted to protect you,
                      Nan.  Just wanted to protect
                      you...

      MARGE slides over on her side.  NANCY smooths her hair, covers her
      as she would a child, then exits the room.

178.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        178.

      The girl enters, turns out her bedside light, slips out of her
      dress and puts on her nightgown.  Then she kneels by her bed.

                                      NANCY (quietly)
                      Now I lay me down to sleep,
                      I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
                      If I should die before I wake,
                      I pray the Lord my soul to take.

      She gets into bed and pulls the blankets to her chin.

      CLOSE ON NANCY's face.  She stares straight up at the ceiling for
      a long moment, then closes her eyes.

                                                 CUT TO:


179.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  179.

      LT THOMPSON trudges down the stais and confronts GLEN'S FATHER.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      I know it's hard to think at
                      a time like this, Walter, but
                      can you think of anyone who
                      could've done such a thing?

      The father stares away, his voice low and dull.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      He done it.

      THOMPSON looks at the man, baffled.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Who?  Who did that?

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Krueger.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Krueger?

      The father gives him the strangest look.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Had to've done it.  No one
                      else was in there.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      How you know that?

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Cause I thought Glen was 
                      gonna sneak out to see your
                      lunatic daughter, that's why.
                      So I locked him in his room!
                              (getting control)
                      Sorry.  Anyways, the door was
                      still locked when we heard the
                      screams.

      He blinks.

                                      MR LANTZ (CONTD)
                      Maybe god's punishing us all...

                                      LT THOMPSON
                              (much lower and hard)
                      Keep your head -- this is a
                      fucking flesh and blood killer
                      we're talking about.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Like Rod Lane?

      A voice calls down from upstairs.

                                      COP (OS)
                      Lieutenant Thompson.  Coronor
                      wants to show you something.

      THOMPSON gives MR LANTZ one final look, then heads upstairs.

                                              CUT TO:


      NOTE: These rewrites of scenes 180 and 180 A replace NANCY
      walking through the 'dream streets' at night, and NANCY
      approaching the huge deserted building at night, prior to her
      entering the Boiler Room the final time.


180.  INT.  DOWNSTAIRS, NANCY'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                           180.

      LOW ANGLE UP STAIRS as NANCY appears at head.  As she comes
      downstairs, CAMERA MOVES WITH HER through the hallway to the
      cellar door.  She opens the door.


180A. INT.  NANCY'S CELLAR.  NIGHT.                                      180A.

      NANCY appears at top of these stairs, hesitates, then comes down.

      WIDER as NANCY approaches center of room, stops in CU, then turns
      eyes.  We HEAR the distant SOUND of the boiler room now, faint
      but unmistakeable.  NANCY MOVES, and CAMERA PANS HER to the
      cellar's side WALL, where another, new doorway is REVEALED.
      NANCY opens this door and looks down.  FIRELIGHT is on NANCY'S
      face now, and the SOUND of the Boiler Room is very clear.  NANCY
      goes through the door.


180B. INT.  BOILER ROOM.                                                 180B.

      NANCY decends like Orpheus into hell, but without weapon save her
      wits.

      She decends a steel stair to the lowest level, then hears the
      SOUND of the knives from down another shaft.  She sees there's an
      even deeper place down there.  She starts down.

      Again, and then again, NANCY decends, each ladder narrower or
      more twisting, each level deeper, wetter, darker, more airless.
      Soon she's gasping for air, but still she pushes herself on. She
      doesn't stop until she breaks out at last at the very bottom of
      the place, a wet, firelit sump deep in the bowels of the place.

      CAMERA NOW PANS AROUND WITH HER, and for the first time we SEE
      the vast maul of the empty boiler behind her.

      She stares at it.  It's seething with some dark WIND that soughs
      and whines like a huge dying dog.

      NANCY crosses to it, touching the pile of old, coal-dusted dirt
      at its base.  It looks almost like an old grave.

      She turns suddenly, listening.  Then, hearing nothing, she looks
      down.

      NANCY'S POV as she picks up GLEN's earphones.

      WIDER as she suddenly drops them, staring at her fingers.
      They're dripping blood.

      There's another BEEP.

180C. INSERT ON NANCY'S WATCH -- the COUNT-DOWN a blur of black digits   180C.
      counting down to zero.  They've just crossed the ten minute
      warning.

180D. CLOSE ON NANCY'S FACE.  She speaks into the night.                 180D.

                                      NANCY
                              (quietly)
                      Come out and show yourself,
                      you bastard.

      No sooner are these words off her lips than the huge bulk of FRED
      KRUEGER lurches up behind her!  The man is even more hideous
      hatless, his bald head and tormented face veiled in skeins of
      ruined flesh, his ragged teeth barred, the great spider of
      razor-blades flashing from his fingertips.

      He leaps, but the girl leaps just as fast, a fierce jump,
      that sends her out over black space and down into a huge, dark
      sump of blackness.


180E. EXT.  THE HEAVENS.  NIGHT.                                         180E.

      CLOSE ANGLE ON NANCY as she curves like a swan though her
      apogee, and begins falling, diving, planing through black air,
      the wind ripping at her hair and eyes.  Suddenly the complex,
      glittering skein of light that is the San Fernando Valley seen
      from the air slides INTO FRAME, and we see she's falling from
      high, high over the earth.

      NANCY falls, falls in slow motion against the spinning lights,
      free as a sky diver freefalling -- a giddy, acrophobic plunge.


181,182,183,184 OMIT                                    OMIT 181,182,183,184

185.  EXT.  ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                            185.

      NANCY crashes suddenly out of the night and into a hedge just
      outside her own front door, rolling out at its bottom scratched
      and bloodied.  If she were in any normal reality she'd be a mass
      of broken bones -- but somehow she's able to claw her way up and
      look at her watch once more.

      INSERT.  Just a few seconds from zero.

      She staggers for her house's front door -- but a moment later
      KRUEGER crashes down atop her!  NANCY struggles to her knees just
      as the man lunges with that godawful handful of blades.  But
      instead of running, she ducks inside the deadly grab and seizes
      him in a desperate bearhug!

      The surprise move sends him pitching backwards, her still on him
      --and they fall into the jumble of torn-down trellis of roses
      beneath her window.  Almost at that very second we HEAR the
      jarring, deafening RINGING of NANCY's alarm clock!

                                              SMASH CUT TO:


186.  INT.  NANCY'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     186.

      NANCY sprawls out of her bed onto the floor, twisting from the
      jabs of the already vanished thorns, briars and brush.  Gasping,
      she takes a second to get her bearings

      ANGLE ON THE BED as she recovers quick as she can, snatching up
      the net, ready for an assault from any direction.

      But the room is empty.

      Hardly able to catch her breath, her hair tangled, her nightgown
      torn, she drops the net.  She sits on the bed, turns on the
      bedside lamp and re-examines her room.  No one there but herself.

      It's a terrible blow, despite the fact that she's safe.  Her face
      is covered with tears, she's shaking and breathless.  She rattles
      her head in confusion and despair, realizing her own madness.

                                      NANCY
                      I'm crazy after all...

      At that very instant FRED KRUEGER leaps up from the far side of
      the bed with an EXPLOSIVE SHOUT of rage!

      He lunges across the table for her, missing by inches as NANCY
      pitches backwards and scrambles for the window.  But she's
      stopped by the bars.

      KRUEGER, incredibly fast, regains his feet and leaps again -- the
      girl wheels and shatters the coffeepot over his head.  As he
      crashes backwards NANCY flings open the door of her room and
      dives through -- only to rebound off someone on the other side --


187.  INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             187.

      MARGE, knocked flying by NANCY'S charge, hits the floor hard,
      knocking the wind out of herself.  NANCY sees what she's done,
      jumps over the body and slams the door and throws the new bolt
      home.  Next instant she gingerly ties a string to the door's
      knob, a string that trails down from the ceiling, attached to
      something up there that's still just barely out of sight.

      Next instant she's dragging her MOTHER towards the woman's
      bedroom as fast as she can.

      KRUEGER is already splintering the doorway behind her as NANCY
      dips and makes it into MARGE's room, SLAMMING the DOOR behind her
      and locking it in a flash.

      The MANIAC breaks the bolt and rips open the door.

      But the in the very act of doing this he of course unknowingly
      pulls the string attached to the outside doorknob with terrific
      force.

      CLOSE ANGLE ON THE CEILING.  The string jerks against a
      single-edged razor, which in turn cuts a tight wind of cord
      holding a heavy wedge of steel to the ceiling.

      WIDER as the thing falls free, pivoting at the hinge at the far
      end of its handle, and drives straight into KRUEGER'S groin with
      a terrific blow.  As he catapaults backwards with an incredulous
      shriek, the twenty pound sledge hammer swings back and reveals to
      camera just what it is!

      ANGLE DOWN ON KRUEGER, clawwing his way up despite his agony,
      lurching and cursing forward like an enraged bull.

      WIDER ANGLE IN THE HALLWAY as KRUEGER roars out -- only to
      immediately strike the length of WIRE strung across the hallway,
      catching it just above the thigh.  He cartwheels head-over-heels
      and lands flat on his back!

      Instantly the DOOR to NANCY's MOTHER's bedroom flies open and
      NANCY brings a brass lamp down over KRUEGER's head with all her
      might!  It sounds like a line-drive caroming off a metal
      flagpole.

      NANCY SLAMS the DOOR as KRUEGER struggles up, clutching his
      head.

      Enraged, the huge man CRASHES against the door with terrific
      force, and rears back and starts smashing against the door like
      the utter homicidal lunatic that he is.

                                                   CUT TO:


188.  EXT.  ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                             188.

      HIGH ANGLE at the second floor level.  NANCY jerks open the
      window to her MOTHER's bedroom and jams her face to the bars.
      The AMBULANCE is pulling away with a tremendous WAIL of its SIREN
      as NANCY SCREAMS down, trying to make herself heard.

                                      NANCY
                      Help!  Hey -- Daddy -- I got
                      him trapped!  Where are you!?

189.  ANGLE ON the street.  PARKER, assigned to guard the house, sees    189.
      NANCY -- hair white, eyes wide -- pounding on the bars and
      screaming like a lunatic.  But her meaning is utterly lost in the
      noise of the ambulance next to him.

                                      PARKER
                              (yelling up at her)
                      Everything's going to be all
                      right!  Everything's under
                      control!

      ANGLE at the window.  Close on NANCY's face, incredulous at his
      response.

                                      NANCY
                      Get my father, you asshole!

      PARKER does a little take.  That almost sounded sane.

                                      PARKER (OS)
                      You heard what I said!  Now get
                      back inside or I'll tell your
                      dad!

191.  Behind her the DOOR SPLINTERS.  NANCY whirls around just in time   191.
      to see KRUEGER bull in!  NANCY's eyes go wide -- she's trapped
      against the bars and has nowhere to go.  The man bunches his
      knives into a single thick blade and rushes her, stabbing.  NANCY
      closes her eyes --

      Then from OUT OF FRAME Marge leaps between the two.

                                      MARGE
                      No!

      She blocks the charge perfectly -- blocking the knives.
      Both she and NANCY are slammed backwards against the bars
      behind.
      Drunk though she is, is hanging onto KRUEGER'S weapon hand,
      keeping the knives inside herself, away from her daughter!

                                      MARGE
                      Nancy -- for god's sake's run!

      But NANCY turns to the window instead, screaming for her father.

                                      NANCY
                      Daddy!  Where are you!


192.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          192.

      PARKER, just about to turn back to the business at GLEN's house,
      sees NANCY and SOMEONE else fall just inside the window.
      Something begins to dawn on the man.  Just a little.

                                      PARKER
                      Poor woman's got her hands full 
                      with that kid.  Maybe I better 
                      tell the lieutenant.

      He turns and jogs towards GLEN's house.


193.  INT.  MARGE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     193.

      ANGLE ON KRUEGER, hauling MARGE up in rage, knocking her
      senseless across her bed and climbing after her with his knives
      raised.  NANCY wheels behind him and whams him in the kidneys
      with her fists, spilling him back off the bed, then running past
      him for the door.  She makes it to safety,
      then turning back.  She flips the monster the bird, her eyes wild
      with pain and fury.

                                      NANCY
                      Hey fuckface -- can't catch me!

      The bait works -- KRUEGER leaves MARGE and howls after NANCY.


194.  INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                    194.

      As NANCY clears the hall and makes the stairs, KRUEGER lurches
      through the shattered doorway after her.


195.  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         195.

      The girl careens down the stairs, across the room and to the
      front door, banging against it with terrified fury.

                                      NANCY
                              (screaming)
                      Come on -- he's in here!
                      Daddy!  Don't let him kill
                      me too!

      Behind her the huge MAN is thumping down the stairs, KNOCKING
      THINGS OVER, SCRAPING his LONG STEEL FINGERNAILS along the wall
      with a horrible sound!

      NANCY flings a heavy ash tray through the porch window and
      screams through the bars.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      HEELLLPPP!!!  Daddyyyyyyy!!!!

      KRUEGER, bloody and spewwing threats, staggers for her -- NANCY
      dives behind the couch.

      CLOSE ON KRUEGER'S FEET as they hit another wire.

      CLOSE ON the Lifesaver jerking out -- the clothespin snapping
      together, completing the circuit with a CRACKLING SPARK.

      WIDER ON THE EXPLOSION that rips out of the floor lamp next to
      KRUEGER and knocks him sprawling across the room.

      NANCY peeks out from behind the couch.  The man lies in a smoking
      heap.  NANCY runs to the windows and screams out again.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Hey -- Daddy!  Hey!  I got the
                      bastard!

      KRUEGER roars up behind her -- she throws herself sideways -- he
      crashes into the window frame, smashing glass and wood to bits.

      NANCY turns SCREAMING and runs deeper into the house.


196.  OMIT                                                               196.

197.  INT.  CELLAR.  NIGHT.                                              197.

      She careens down the stairs, throwing on the lights, the man
      thundering after her.

      ANGLE AT THE FAR END OF THE CELLAR.  NANCY brakes at the wall.
      Nowhere left to hide.

      THE SCRAPPING of the blades against brick turns her to see the
      huge killer holding his knife-laden fingers up for her.

                                      KRUEGER
                      Ready for these?

198.  ON NANCY -- she ducks behind the furnace -- comes out the other    198.
      side with the big jug of gasoline and lets KRUEGER have it
      straight over the head.  The heavy container shatters, showering
      its contents over every square inch of the man.

      He staggers backwards with a ROAR of fury, NANCY screaming after
      him with a box of kitchen matches.  Before the man can realize
      what she's up to, she ignites the whole box and throws it in
      KRUEGER's face.

      There's a blinding WHOOSH -- and KRUEGER goes up in a terrific
      BALL OF FIRE.  Faster than a flash the girl runs past the howling
      maniac and makes for the stairs, KRUEGER after her in full
      pyrrhic rage.


199.  INT.  NANCY'S KITCHEN.  NIGHT.                                     199.

      NANCY holds the heavy door until the precisely right moment.
      Just as the burning, blind monster tops the stairs, NANCY brings
      the heavy oak door round with all her might and catches him in a
      great RINGING CONCUSSION.  It sends him windmilling backwards and
      down the stairs in an ass-over-teakettle sprawl of sparks and
      flames.

      NANCY slams the door and throws the deadbolt home.

      No sooner does she accomplish this than the man is SLAMMING again
      and again against the door from the cellar.
                           The terrible SCREAMS and CURSES PEAK,
      THEN GROW WEAKER AND MORE GARBLED.  Then there's just silence.

      NANCY staggers, half blind, from the kitchen.

      As the room begins seething SMOKE from every pore, we

                                              CUT TO:


200.  INT.  GLEN'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                             200.

      The CORONER steps out of the bathroom peeling bloody rubber
      gloves.  Pale and sweating.

                                      CORONER
                      Found you something, Donald.
                      Should remind you of something...

      The man shoves out his hand to LT THOMPSON.  THOMPSON stares at
      it without touching it.  A long, thin steel blade, razor sharp,
      attached to some sort of ring and armature -- broken off...

	The CORONER gives a sweaty, grim smile.

                                      CORONER (CONTD)
                      Only place I ever heard of such
                      a thing before was ten years
                      ago.  Remember that fucker
                      Fred Krueger?

      LT THOMPSON has just knocked PARKER sprawling in his race to the
      stairs.

                                      PARKER
                      Hey -- your daughter's acting 
                      kinda -- !
                              (THOMPSON'S gone)
                      Strange...


201.  EXT.  NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                                        201.

      CRASH as NANCY breaks another window and presses against the
      bars.  The house shudders and glows orange behind her.  She sees
      her father bursting out the front door of Glen's house!

                                      NANCY
                      DAD!  GET US OUTTA HERE!

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!
                              (to his men)
                      Hey!  We got a fire!

202.  ANGLE ON NANCY'S FRONT DOOR.  Many MEN batter the door down as     202.
      black smoke pours from the windows and NANCY's SCREAMS and SHOUTS
      fill the air.  Within moments they've destroyed the door and LT
      THOMPSON has pulled his daughter into the safety of his arms.
      But NANCY immediately fights free and darts right back to the
      front door -- beckoning him to follow -- gesturing like a wild
      woman.

                                      NANCY 
                      I got him -- I got Fred Krueger!

      THOMPSON stares at his wild little girl in astonishment, then
      runs in after her.  The others follow, coughing and choking.


203.  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         203.

      THOMPSON collides with NANCY as she brakes, frozen.  THE SMOKE IS
      BELCHING OUT OF THE CELLAR, but whoever was locked in there
      certainly isn't now.  The door is flat on the kitchen floor.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      What the hell are you talking about,
                      Nancy?

      NANCY wheels without answering.  A series of tiny, isolated fires
      burn across the living room and up the stairs.  Firesteps.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      He's after Mom!  Come on!

      She darts across the living room, following the flaming
      footprints of FRED KRUEGER up the stairs before THOMPSON can stop
      her.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      NANCY!


204.  INT.  MARGE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     204.

      NANCY STOPS IN THE SPLINTERED DOORWAY -- a ragged gold-red light
      splashing her horrified face.

205.  REVERSE IN HER POV -- FRED KRUEGER, literally a man of fire, has   205.
      a screaming MARGE pinned to the bed and is crawling all over
      her!  NANCY gives a banshee's howl, snatches up a chair and
      brings it down over the back of the firey beast, stunning him.

      By the time LT THOMPSON races into the room NANCY'S seized a
      heavy blanket has thrown over both of them, fighting the flames.
      The father joins his daughter without a second thought, heaving
      another blanket over the bed and smothering the last of the
      flames.

                                      NANCY
                      He's under there!  Watch it!

206.  THOMPSON pushes the girl back -- yanks out his .38 and pulls off   206.
      the first cover.  No movement.  He pulls back a second one,
      ready to fire.  But the only thing he sees is the blackened
      half-skeleton of his ex-wife, smoking and seething and sinking
      into the fluid-like mattress, sinking right down through it as if
      she were sinking into a lake.  A blackened, gnarled hand goes
      last, then the bed solidifies over the place she's disappeared.
      And it's as if no one was ever there.
 
      NANCY turns and looks at LT THOMPSON, her face white as her
      ghostly hair.  THOMPSON shoves his .38 back in its holster and
      finds a cigarette, his hands shaking so badly he can barely
      manage.

                                      NANCY
                      Now do you believe me?

      PARKER barges in.  The room is filled with smoke, the bed is
      stripped, but other than that, the place seems normal.

                                      PARKER
                      You find him?
                              (looking closer
                               at THOMPSON)
                      Sir?

      LT THOMPSON just walks by him.  PARKER chases after.

                                      PARKER (CONTD OS)
                              (fading)
                      Sir -- here, let me light that
                      for you -- Lieutenant?  What 
                      happened?
                              (gone)

      WIDER, ON NANCY alone in the room.  She turns and looks at the
      bed.  MUSIC slips in and builds.  The bed has changed color.
      It's now an ash-darkened red and yellow.

207.  CLOSER ON NANCY from the direction of the bed.  MUSIC SUDDENLY     207.
      STOPS, and the surface of the red and yellow bed gets a bump in
      its center that keeps raising, raising until it's a hump that's a
      head and shoulders, still raising until it looms over NANCY.

      Then FRED KRUEGER's entire shape sweeps up into the yellow and
      red mass -- and the garish head, smoking and seething, pops
      through.

      NEW ANGLE -- KRUEGER, a burned, sizzling black hump of a killer,
      clumps onto the floor between NANCY and the door.

      NANCY falls absoltely still, and her face goes through a
      strange, almost sublime transformation.

                                      NANCY
                              (quietly)
                      I know you're there, Krueger.

      She turns and faces him.

                                      FREDDIE
                      You think you was gonna get
                      away from me?

      NANCY shakes her head.

                                      NANCY
                      I know you too well now,
                      Freddie.

      KRUEGER smiles bitterly.  Coming closer.

                                      FREDDY
                      And now you die...

      There's a SLICKERING RATTLE at his side, and he raises the only
      thing on him not charred -- the gleaming steel talons.

208.  NANCY simply shakes her head again, as if seeing a light at the    208.
      end of her long, long tunnel.  And the way she says the words,
      they might be appearing on the inside of her eyes.

                                      NANCY
                      It's too late, Krueger.  I
                      know the secret now -- this
                      is just a dream, too -- you're
                      not alive -- the whole thing
                      is a dream -- so fuck off!
                      I want my mother and friends
                      again.

      KRUEGER grins insanely, confused and amused at the same time.

                                      FREDDIE
                      You what?

                                      NANCY
                              (even, firm)
                      I take back every bit of
                      energy I ever gave you.
                      You're nothing.  You're
                      shit.

      And then she turns her back on him.  KRUEGER bunches his
      fingers, producing a single ragged bundle of razor talons and
      raises his hand over the back of her head and neck.

      NANCY closes her eyes and steps to the door.

      CLOSE ON HER HAND, touching the door knob.

      CLOSE ON KRUEGER'S KNIFE-FINGERS poised.

      MUSIC BUILDS then SHRIEKS as KRUEGER stabs down, right through
      NANCY -- as if she were an optical illusion -- loosing his
      balance and falling down, down, down...  And he's gone.

                                              CUT TO:


209.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  DAY.                                            209.

      CLOSE ON NANCY'S FRONT DOOR AS NANCY jerks it open and blinks in
      the bright, diffused light.  The MUSIC FADES on a transitional
      note, into light.

      We hear BIRDS.

      CHILDREN playing.

      Early morning SOUNDS.

                                      NANCY
                              (to herself)
                      God, it's bright.

      MARGE sticks her head out, squinting, and nods.  Sober.

                                      MARGE
                      Gonna burn off soon or it
                      wouldn't be so bright.

      NANCY turns and looks her mother over.

                                      NANCY
                      Feeling better?

                                      MARGE
                      They say you've bottomed out
                      when you can't remember the
                      night before.
                              (shakes her head)
                      No more drinking, Baby, suddenly
                      I just don't feel like it
                      any more.

      She touches NANCY.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Didn't keep you up last night,
                      did I?  You look a little 
                      peeked.

      NANCY smiles.

                                      NANCY
                      Nah.  Just slept heavy.

      The girl gives a wave and goes off.  MARGE calls after.

                                      MARGE
                      See ya.

      NANCY turns and waves.

                                      NANCY
                      See ya.

210.  WIDER ON NANCY as she walks to the curb.  The whole scene is       210.
      wrapped in an unseasonal tule fog, bright yet diffuse.  We notice
      that NANCY's house no longer has bars on its windows.  Then we
      see a familiar convertible pull up at the curb, top down.  TINA
      and ROD are in the back seat.  They all wave to MARGE as NANCY
      climbs in.

                                      GLEN
                              (calling)
                      You believe this fog?

                                      MARGE
                              (laughs)
                      I believe anything's possible.

      TINA slaps five with NANCY.

                                      TINA
                      Lookin' good, girl!

      ANGLE INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE.  GLEN slips into the seat next to
      NANCY.  Someone else is driving, it seems.  NANCY looks up to the
      DRIVER.  The big MAN turns and grins at NANCY, a terrible,
      scarred, hideous leer of a grin -- FRED KRUEGER'S grin!

      ANGLE BACK OUTSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE as its top clamps over the
      kids within -- a bright red and yellow top that closes as fast
      and hard as a beartrap!  NANCY'S frightened face flies to the
      window, pressing against the thick glass as the car roars away
      from the curb and into the thick fog.

211.  CAMERA PANS TO a group of LITTLE GIRLS, half-hidden by the fog,    211.
      jumping rope and singing gayly.

                                      GIRLS
                      One two --
                      Freddy's coming for you!
                      Three four --
                      Better lock your door!
                      Five six --
                      Get your Crucifix
                      Seven eight --
                      Gonna stay up late!
                      Nine ten --
                      Never sleep again!

      MUSIC CROSSFADES WITH THIS SONG, expanding the simple tune to
      symphonic, boundless dimensions as the little girls fade into
      thin air, and we

                                      FADE TO BLACK
					
                              ROLL END TITLES.
Nightmare on Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare

 
       FADE IN:

       INT. DC-10 AIRLINER - NIGHT

       JACOB JOHNSON is sleeping.  It doesn't look like a pleasant 
       experience.  He is sixteen, dirty blonde, his eyes visibly 
       moving under closed lids as he sits huddle under a blanket in 
       his window seat.  The lights are dim -- the shade on the 
       window closed -- a bead of sweat dribbles down his forehead.  
       The HUMMING of the jet's engines vibrates through the cabin.

       The boy's eyes snap open.

       Jacob glances around nervously.  He looks like an escaped 
       convict who just accidentally walked into the Policemen's 
       Ball.  A GREYHAIRED MAN two seats away from him gives the 
       teenager a cursory glance, then goes back to his book.  Jacob 
       lays his head back and tries to relax.  The engines continue 
       to drone.

       Until a new noise starts.  A WHOOSHING NOISE.

       The sound is very faint.  But distinct from everything else.  
       Jacob frowns.

       The noise gets LOUDER.  Jacob's sure he's hearing it now.  He 
       looks at the Greyhaired Man.  The man catches his eye and the 
       two of them stare at each other for a heartbeat - then Jacob 
       turns away.  The Man returns to his book.  And Jacob 
       immediately turns back to him.

                           JACOB
                 Do you hear that?

       The man gives him an annoyed look as the WHOOSHING gets 
       louder.

                           GREYHAIRED MAN
                 Hear what?

                           JACOB
                 That noise.

                           GREYHAIRED MAN
                 I don't hear anything.

       The man turns back to the book as the sound gets even LOUDER -
       - like it's coming closer.  Jacob squirms in his seat -- 
       sneaks a look at the man again.  How can he not hear that?  A 
       STEWARDESS walks by and Jacob catches her attention.

                           JACOB
                 Excuse me.

                           STEWARDESS
                 Yes?

       The WHOOSHING is completely obvious now.  The greyhaired man 
       tries to ignore the two people talking over him.

                           JACOB
                 What is that sound?

                           STEWARDESS
                 That's just the engines, sir.

                           JACOB
                 No, it's different.  It's not the 
                 engines.  It's getting louder.

       The man sighs -- the stewardess smiles patronizingly.

                           STEWARDESS
                 We're just gaining altitude to get above 
                 some rough weather.  That's the sound of 
                 the engines speeding up a bit.  
                 Everything's fine.

                           JACOB
                 Um...okay.

       The stewardess walks away as Jacob sits back and starts to 
       bite his nails.  The whooshing is really starting to BLARE 
       now.  He looks between the seats in front of him -- twists 
       around to look behind.  He snaps back to the greyhaired man.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Can't you hear that?

                           GREYHAIRED MAN
                     (losing patience)
                 Look, kid.  Will you relax?  It's just 
                 the damn engines, okay?

       The man glares at him, and Jacob backs off.  The sound has 
       grown DEAFENING.  Jacob grinds his seat like he's going mad.  
       He looks at the closed window.  He reaches out his hand, 
       grabs the handle then rips up the shade for all to see:

       A 747 coming RIGHT AT US.

       Jacob SCREAMS.  The planes CRASH.

       Impact - decompression - explosion.  The hull of the cabin 
       buckles violently - moaning like a dying elephant - peeling 
       inward revealing RED AND GREEN STRIPING on the outside.

       A huge wing section RIPS through the structure - barely 
       missing Jacob - taking the greyhaired man's head clean off - 
       nailing the stewardess in the gut and shoving her body across 
       and out the other side of the cabin.

       And Jacob's seat drops down - sending him and us into:

       EXT. SKY - NIGHT

       Like an intricate ballet, Jacob, his body strapped to his 
       chair, tumbles away from the DC-10 and 747 as they seem to 
       merge and bend into some kind of mutant DC-47 - wings and 
       tails wrapping around each other as debris blooms out like a 
       flower and together they EXPLODE - a fiery ball lighting the 
       nighttime clouds and Jacob's shrieking face.  

       And Jacob falls and falls and falls, his hair sticking 
       straight up from the blasting wind.

       That's when CORPSES start falling past him.  The captain of 
       the plane - the stewardess, her body bent in half - the 
       greyhaired man, his head gone but his book still in his hand.  
       More men, women, crew people - and CHILDREN.

       But these children aren't dead bodies.  Two LITTLE GIRLS and 
       one LITTLE BOY, all dressed in white, plummet down next to 
       Jacob, head first, like high divers.  And they're singing:

                           THE CHILDREN
                 One two, Freddy's coming for you...

       The children turn around in the sky so that they are 
       travelling feet first.  The Little Boy's pants puff up and 
       the Girls' skirts poof out and RIP UPWARD - the wind taking 
       away their clothes and their skin and their bodies and their 
       hair...

                           THE CHILDREN (cont'd)
                 Three four, better lock your door...

       Leaving three tiny SKELETONS - taunting and laughing as Jacob 
       screams and covers his eyes.

                           THE CHILDREN (cont'd)
                 Five six, grab your crucifix...

       And the Skeletons sprout wings - leathery and veiny - the 
       wind catching them and sending them up and away as their 
       voices echo in the sky.

                           THE CHILDREN (cont'd)
                 Seven eight, gonna stay up late...

       Jacob takes his hands away from his face and starts to 
       frantically pull on his seat belt.  SNAP - it flies off his 
       back and miraculously turns into a PARACHUTE.  Rope swirls 
       into the air - the wind grabs the canvas - and Jacob's body 
       slows with a violent jerk.

       But at least he's not falling anymore.  Jacob catches his 
       breath as he starts gently floating through the sky.  He 
       smiles.  This isn't so bad.  This is actually kind of fun.  
       Not for long, though, because his new upward momentum carries 
       him back up to:

       The winged children's Skeletons.  Jacob's eyes bug out as he 
       rises into them and they start to circle.  They move closer 
       and we can see something in their hands:

       SCISSORS

       Jacob twists his body, trying to steer his parachute away 
       from the demons.  One of the Skeletons swoops up to his face 
       and pokes its scissors inches away from Jacob's eyes.  It 
       sings alone:

                           CHILD
                 Nine ten, never sleep again!

       The Skeleton cranks its arm back - ready to plunge the 
       scissor's blades into Jacob's sockets.  The arms swings 
       toward him - then suddenly diverts up past his head, heading 
       for:

       THE CHUTE'S STRINGS

       The Skeleton flaps its wings and poises its scissors at one 
       of the ropes.  The other two Skeletons join it over Jacob's 
       head.  The three of them look down at Jacob, their boney jaws 
       in a perpetual smile.

                           JACOB
                 No!

       The Skeletons nod "yes".  SNIP - SNIP - SNIP - they cut away 
       at Jacob's parachute as he swings underneath them, trying to 
       pull away - SNIP - SNIP.

       The parachute flutters away - the Skeletons cackle - and 
       Jacob plummets.

       ON JACOB

       We stay with him as he screams and shrieks and yells and the 
       clouds part and the ground rises quickly up to meet him.  The 
       ground becomes a town, the town becomes a block, the block 
       becomes a house, the house becomes a roof, and...

       INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

       KA-BLAM!  The ceiling explodes as Jacob's body plows through, 
       slams down, shatters the bed, and we immediately:

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - MORNING

       Jacob's eyes blast open as he sits up from bed in a cold 
       sweat.  A dream.  The worst fucking dream from hell anyone 
       would ever want to have -- but still just a dream.  He takes 
       a few deep breaths as a soft KNOCK is heard at the door.

                           JACOB
                 Yeah..

       ALICE JOHNSON opens the door and sticks her head in.  She's 
       thirty-two, blonde, with a caring smile.

                           ALICE
                 You okay, honey?

                           JACOB
                 Yeah, Mom.  I'm fine.

                           ALICE
                 Alright.  Better get cooking or you'll be 
                 late for school.

                           JACOB
                 On my way.

       Alice closes the door as Jacob gets out of bed and stretches.  
       Sunlight is leaking through the bedroom window shade and 
       Jacob walks over to it.  He reaches out and pulls up the 
       shade.

       And there's nothing buy sky.  Jacob frowns and pokes his head 
       out the window.

       JACOB'S POV - THE GROUND

       is once again racing up towards us at seven-thousand miles an 
       hour.  The entire house is falling.

       BACK IN THE BEDROOM

       Jacob leaps away from the window.  The WINGED SKELETONS 
       reappear outside -- dancing in the air -- cackling with glee.

       The bedroom starts to SHAKE violently as Jacob stumbles into 
       the center.  The roof starts caving in and the walls begins 
       to crumble.

       ANGLE STRAIGHT DOWN ON JACOB.

       Jacob grabs his head, looks up at us, and SCREAMS.  We 
       suddenly stay where we are as the house drops down and we 
       punch out through the roof and our shot becomes an:

       ANGLE STRAIGHT DOWN ON THE HOUSE

       as it falls away towards the ground.  We watch as it becomes 
       a small dot - and finally impacts on the surface.  A mushroom 
       cloud of smoke silently puffs out in the distance below

       EXT. TOWN - NIGHT - AT THE CRATER

       Smoke and dust whirl around a huge hole in the earth.  
       Splintered shreds of lumber stick up in the air like giant 
       toothpicks.  Some of the toothpicks start to move.

       Jacob rises out of the destruction, charred, scraped, 
       battered and, unfortunately, alive.  He climbs up to the edge 
       of the crater.  He looks back a the remnants of his home.

       Then something starts to happen.

       Something his growing from the crater - spreading out.  It's 
       not a cloud, it's not smoke - it's a DARKNESS.  Even though 
       it's night, this darkness is darker.  It creeps out from the 
       hole - fingers of blackness reaching out.  What it covers 
       doesn't disappear.  It becomes GLOOMY.  The shroud is getting 
       bigger.

       And it's getting faster.  Jacob runs.

       WITH JACOB - RUNNING

       He bolts down the streets of the small town in a blind panic.  
       He looks behind him and sees the darkness getting bigger, its 
       gloominess covering houses.  Then whole blocks.

       Everything it touches seems to fall deeper into SHADOW.

       AT THE STREET CORNER

       Jacob comes across a WOMAN walking her dog.  He stops and 
       yells at her.

                           JACOB
                 Get the hell out of here!  It's coming!

                           WOMAN
                 What's coming?

       Jacob points down the street.  The shroud is swooping down 
       the road - browning out street lights in its wake.  And the 
       woman doesn't find anything threatening about this.  Jacob 
       screams at her.

                           JACOB
                 Don't you see it?

                           WOMAN
                 See what?

       And it's obvious now: she doesn't see anything.  The Woman is 
       totally oblivious to the danger.  Jacob shakes his head -- 
       stumbles away.

       The woman watches him go as the darkness PASSES OVER HER.  
       She sighs.

       And begins to MUTATE.  Her hair gets scraggly, her skin 
       bursts out in sores, her back grows a hump -- all of which 
       she DOESN'T seem to notice.

       She just shrugs her twisted shoulders.

                           WOMAN (cont'd)
                 Kids...watcha gonna do?

       She hobbles away with her dog - which now has six legs and 
       two heads.

       BACK WITH JACOB - RUNNING

       Like a bat running from hell, he tears through the streets 
       passing buildings that turn creepy and people that become 
       passively accepting monsters.

       A VOICE booms out from nowhere.

                           FREDDY (O.S.)
                 Jacob!  You're too old to run away from 
                 home!

       Jacob covers his ears and races out of town.

       EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

       Jacob falls onto the deserted road just outside of town.  He 
       rolls on the asphalt and looks behind him.  most of the town 
       is covered in an opaque gloom.  

       Suddenly a CACKLING sound is heard and Jacob turns to its 
       source:

       HIS POV: THE SPRINGWOOD SIGN

       The town can still be seen behind it -- the darkness over 
       almost all of it now.  The sign reads: WELCOME TO SPRINGWOOD.  
       POPULATION...

       And the numbers after the word "population" are changing.  
       They're counting BACKWARDS, clattering away like an old-time 
       gas pump in reverse - faster and faster - blurring as the 
       "thousands" digit disappears, then the "hundreds", then 
       "tens", then...

       CLINK - the count stops at "1".  Springwood is entirely 
       engulfed in the shroud.  There is a pause.

       CRASH - the sign is violently YANKED into the ground.  It 
       vanishes into the earth and a CRACK APPEARS at the edge of 
       the road. The crack grows - moving out to the center of the 
       highway.

       BACK ON THE STREET

       Jacob watches the crack as it splits wider in the middle of 
       the street and a GURGLING sound starts to build.  The tar in 
       front of Jacob becomes molten.  It bubbles and pops.

       Jacob scrambles backwards as something begins to rise from 
       boiling asphalt.

       It's a hat.

       The hat, a fedora to be precise, pushes itself up. A left 
       hand - burned and scarred - pokes out next to it.  Four sharp 
       blades jut out of the muck on the other side.  A head is up 
       now - a curtain of tar dripping from the rim of the hat - 
       hiding the face.  The body beneath the head ascends.  The 
       veil of asphalt parts:

       It's FREDDY KRUEGER.  Jacob SCREAMS.

       Freddy LAUGHS.  He shakes off his layer of tar and looks 
       towards the clouded town of Springwood.  A look of pure 
       hatred appears on his ragged face.

                           FREDDY
                 Payback time...

       Freddy opens his mouth - lets out a large breath - and then 
       INHALES an even larger one.

       A WINDSTORM starts, the source being Krueger's own lungs.  
       The gale force begins to yank at the shroud surrounding 
       Springwood.  Fingers of darkness pull up from the town and 
       towards Freddy's mouth -- and houses begin to DISSOLVE.  
       Freddy continues to inhale like he's never going to stop.

       Krueger is sucking the black gloom into his body - and the 
       entire town of Springwood is going with it.  Trees, 
       buildings, cars, picket fences.  It's all crumbling and 
       fusing, becoming a part of t cloud that itself is caught in 
       the nightmarish wind tunnel, all piling into Freddy's mouth.

       The vortex swirls into Krueger.  Then it's gone.  Nothing but 
       a vacant lot the size of a town remains.  Freddy turns to 
       Jacob and BURPS, it sounds like a THUNDERCLAP.

                           JACOB
                 No!

                           FREDDY
                 Don't worry, I have a strong stomach.

       Freddy reaches down and yanks up his red and green sweater.  
       He pulls apart his putrid abdomen to reveal his guts - and a 
       transparent stomach.

       Inside the stomach: a black swirling mass.  Flashes of 
       houses, people, homes, couples, all trapped in horrible 
       anguish.  Freddy drops down his sweater.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Springwood is mine, boy!

                           JACOB
                 I dreamed you away before I was born!  
                 Mom said you couldn't come back!

                           FREDDY
                 Is that true?  Then she told you all 
                 about me, huh? Let's see what else she 
                 has to say.

       Freddy reaches his left hand into the bubbling tar at his 
       feet, digs around a bit, then pulls out:

       ALICE.  Jacob's mother.  Tar dripping down her body.  Krueger 
       has her by the neck, waves his blades in front of her.  Jacob 
       gets up and runs toward him.

       Freddy pulls a foot up from the asphalt pit and KICKS Jacob 
       back a good fifteen feet.

                           ALICE
                 Run, Jacob!

       The boy rolls painful on the hard road.  He sits up and 
       screams:

                           JACOB
                 Leave her alone!

                           FREDDY
                 You're such a momma's boy!

       Freddy swings his knives out, pauses for a terrifying beat, 
       then swoops the daggers towards Alice.

       CLOSE ON JACOB

       as OFF SCREEN we hear a horrible multiple GLITCH!  Jacob 
       shrieks in gut-wrenching anguish.

       WIDE ON SCENE

       We're far enough away so that we don't barf at the sight but 
       close enough to see that Freddy has impaled Alice's body on 
       his blades.  He lifts her up effortlessly and raises her limp 
       figure RIGHT OVER HIS HEAD.

       Krueger swings his arm out, shaking off Alice, sending her 
       flying over Jacob's head.  The body lands behind him.

       ON JACOB

       as he runs to his mother.  She VANISHES just as he reaches 
       out to touch her bloody body.  He turns to Krueger and raises 
       his fists.  A look of sheer rage is growing in him, blind, 
       insane anger.  He bellows:

                           JACOB
                 You fucker!

                           FREDDY
                 Springwood is only the beginning.  All I 
                 need from you is a ride!

       Suddenly, between Jacob and Freddy, three SHAFTS OF LIGHT 
       burst up from the road.  Three FIGURES appear as the light 
       dissipates.

       They're dressed in metallic black, heavy boots, helmets with 
       dark visors covering their faces.  One is large and muscular.  
       The one in the center has an obviously feminine figure under 
       her skin-tight outfit.  The third is a little smaller than 
       the other two with a slightly different face  that allows us 
       to see his mouth.

       They're the DREAM POLICE.  Jacob doesn't know this yet, but 
       Freddy seems to.  The bastard son of a hundred maniacs frowns 
       at the sight of these new apparitions.

       Then he looks past them and smiles at Jacob.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 See ya later!

       Freddy violently DROPS down into the bubbling asphalt pit.  
       Two of the black figures start after him.  The third one 
       turns to Jacob as his partners leap into the hole after 
       Freddy.  The sound from his exposed mouth is DEAFENING!

                           SOUND COP
                 WAKE UP!

       Jacob grabs his ears in pain as we suddenly:

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

       Jacob's eyes snap open so fast his sockets suffer whiplash.  
       He's lying smack in the middle of the road tucked in a fetal 
       position.  Jacob slowly uncurls his body and sits up.  He 
       shivers and wipes his sweaty forehead - and that's when he 
       notices something in his hand.

       INSERT: JACOB'S HAND

       it's a bracelet, a simple band of gold with a larger plate in 
       the middle, like an ID band.  Jacob's fingers turn the plate 
       over. Printed on the other side is the name of the bracelet's 
       former owner: ALICE.  Jacob has a souvenir.

       BACK TO JACOB

       He raises his face and looks at the road in front of him.  It 
       goes off into the distance surrounded on both sides by empty 
       fields. 

       This is where Springwood used to be.  A look of anguish 
       crosses Jacob's face as he stares at the desolation.

                           JACOB
                 Mom...

       HONK!  SCREECH!

       Jacob whips his head around in time to see a huge moving van 
       blasting right at him.  He rolls off to the side of the road.  
       The truck barely misses him, kicking up a cloud of dust in 
       its wake.

       Jacob chokes on the dust.  He slowly recovers and looks back 
       down at the bracelet in his hand. He clenches his fist around 
       it as a wild-eyed angry look starts to grow on him.  He takes 
       a few deep breaths, then stands up and walks OUT OF FRAME.

       ANGLE DOWN THE HIGHWAY

       We can see a pickup truck in the distance. Jacob's HAND 
       ENTERS FRAME, thumb sticking out, his mother's bracelet 
       dangling from his wrist.

       The pickup truck starts to slow down.

       EXT. ROSEDALE - DAY

       A sprawling little community with pleasant streets and 
       cheerful houses.  It looks a lot like Springwood, the only 
       real difference being that it actually exists.  It also has a 
       sign: WELCOME TO ROSEDALE.  POPULATION: 8,786

       A Volkswagon bus drives past the sign and stops a couple of 
       blocks down the road from us.  Jacob steps out of the 
       passenger side and wearily waves his ride goodbye.  He 
       shuffles into town.

       CLOSE ON YET ANOTHER SIGN

       It reads: DRUG ADDICTS NOT WELCOME TO ROSEDALE!

       The sign pulls away to reveal a middle-aged man with an angry 
       expression: MR. HOPKINS

                           MR. HOPKINS
                 Clean up your act somewhere else!

       He walks along as we PULL BACK TO SEE

       EXT. ROSEDALE FOSTER HOME - DAY

       It's a nice-looking two-story house in the middle of a 
       usually quiet neighborhood.  Today the home is surrounded by 
       about a dozen townsfolk carrying picket signs: NO HALFWAY 
       HOUSES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD!, DON'T LOWER OUR PROPERTY 
       VALUES!, and GO BACK TO JUVENILE HALL!  The crowd mumbles 
       amongst itself, occasionally bursting out with a chant in 
       protest.

       ON JACOB

       We catch him walking down the sidewalk.  He tramps along with 
       his hands stuffed in his pockets and his eyes on the 
       pavement.  He looks like he hasn't slept in days.  The sound 
       of the crowd ahead of him finally grabs his attention.

       Jacob approaches the disturbance and comes across a young 
       girl standing behind a bush holding a BAG OF GROCERIES.  She 
       is KAREN MILLER, dark hair, sixteen, very pretty, but with a 
       faraway look in her eyes.

       Jacob stands next to her and stares at the crowd like a 
       zombie.  She doesn't turn to look at him as he speaks:

                           JACOB
                 What's going on?

                           KAREN
                 Free speech.  The right of assembly.

                           JACOB
                 What is this place?

                           KAREN
                 It's a home.  A foster home.  For 
                 teenagers.  It's where you go when things 
                 get bad.  It's the place to figure out 
                 what to do next.  It's a home for kids 
                 that no one else wants.
                     (beat)
                 It's MY home.

       Karen hasn't looked at Jacob once.  She suddenly seems to 
       steel herself and walks away from the bush, towards the 
       house.  Jacob is befuddled.

                           JACOB
                 Oh...

       He stands there and watches.

       IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE

       Karen quickly makes her way into the crowd of people, head 
       up, eyes staring forward.  The crowd parts ever so slightly 
       as the irked townsfolk start to heat up.  They have an actual 
       human to vent their anger on now.  Mr. Hopkins lays in on her 
       as she passes him.

                           MR. HOPKINS
                 Why can't you find somewhere else to 
                 shack up?

       Karen turns to him, still walking, flustered and hurt.

                           KAREN
                 What have we ever done to you?

                           MR. HOPKINS
                 Nothing...YET.

       Karen turns quickly away from him and trips over a sprinkler 
       head.  Her groceries tumble onto the grass.  A hand reaches 
       down to help her.  It's Jacob's.

       He quietly helps her re-bag her groceries as Mr. Hopkins 
       looms above them.  Both angry and embarrassed now.

                           MR. HOPKINS (cont'd)
                 Look, we've been here for years.  This is 
                 a quiet street.  We'd just like to keep 
                 it that way.

       Jacob can't take this guy anymore.  He stands up and faces 
       the older man with a scowl.

                           JACOB
                 Lighten up, mister.

                           MR. HOPKINS
                     (smirks)
                 And what gutter did you crawl out from, 
                 kid?
                     (frowns)
                 We don't want your kind here.

                           JACOB
                 My kind?  What kind is that?

                           MR. HOPKINS
                 Drug addicts.  Dope pushers.  We have 
                 stand up and take charge.

                           JACOB
                 Swell.  I've just got a couple of 
                 questions for you...Do you love your 
                 parents?

                           MR. HOPKINS
                 Of course I do...

                           JACOB
                 Are they alive?

                           MR. HOPKINS
                 My mother is.

                           JACOB
                 What's it like?

       Jacob stares at Hopkins.  He doesn't answer.  He just huffs 
       and puffs as Karen grabs Jacob and pulls him up to the front 
       porch of the home, then into the floor.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - FRONT HALLWAY - DAY

       Karen slams the door and takes a deep breath.

                           KAREN
                 Assholes.

                           JACOB
                 I can think of a stronger word.  Are you 
                 okay?

                           KAREN
                 Yeah.  Thanks.  I'm Karen.

                           JACOB
                 Jacob.

       Jacob suddenly gets a little light-headed and has to use a 
       wall to hold himself up.  Karen looks concerned.

                           KAREN
                 Are YOU okay?

                           JACOB
                 Yeah.  I just haven't had much to eat 
                 lately.

                           KAREN
                 Then come help me unpack.

       She smiles and leads him further into the house.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

       Jacob is feverishly eating a sandwich at the table while 
       Karen finishes putting the rest of the food away.

                           KAREN
                 I guess the sandwich is alright, huh?

                           JACOB
                 It's incredible.  Best I've ever had.

                           KAREN
                 You're not from around here, are you?

                           JACOB
                 No.  I've been on the road for a couple 
                 of days.

                           KAREN
                 Do you need a place to stay?

       FOOTSTEPS are heard from below and a couple in their mid-
       thirties enter from the basement door.  They're DAVID and 
       MARY ROSS, both greasy and frustrated.

                           MARY
                 So, we have to get it fixed.

                           DAVID
                 We don't have the money to get it fixed.

       They both start washing up at the sink, not really noticing 
       the teenagers in the room.  Karen speaks up.

                           KAREN
                 What's wrong?

                           DAVID
                 Our plumbing has a bad case of hardening 
                 of the arteries.  Who's your friend?

       David gives Jacob a wary glance as the boy stands shakily.

                           KAREN
                 This is Jacob.

                           JACOB
                 Jacob Johnson.

                           DAVID
                 David Ross.  My wife, Mary.

                           KAREN
                 They run this house.  They're helping me 
                 and three other ids get a footing in 
                 reality before they kick us out of the 
                 nest to make room for the next batch.

       David is looking out the window at the now dissipating crowd.  
       He lets out a weary sigh.

                           DAVID
                 If there is a next batch.  I see the 
                 welcome wagon is back.  Was there any 
                 trouble?

                           KAREN
                 A little.  Jacob came to my rescue.

                           MARY
                     (pleasant)
                 Where you from, Jacob?

                           JACOB
                 Springwood.

                           MARY
                 Springwood?  Where's that?

                           JACOB
                 Upstate about a hundred miles.

                           DAVID
                     (suspicious)
                 I know this state like the back of my 
                 hand.  I've never heard of Springwood.

       There is an uncomfortable pause.  Then Karen suddenly breaks 
       in.

                           KAREN
                 Jacob's a little down on his luck.  I 
                 told him he could stay here a few days.

       Jacob gives here a surprised look.

                           MARY
                 Are your parents in Springwood?

                           JACOB
                 My father died before I was born.  My 
                 mother, she's dead, too.

                           DAVID
                 You have a legal guardian?

                           JACOB
                 No.

                           DAVID
                 Been in any state or federal program?

                           JACOB
                 No.

                           KAREN
                 Just for a little while.  So he can get 
                 his bearings.

                           DAVID
                 Got any ID?

       Jacob reaches for his back pocket - it's empty.  He shakes 
       his head "no".

                           MARY
                     (to David)
                 I think we can help him out, honey.  The 
                 budget's tight, but we can't turn down 
                 someone in need.

       David doesn't acknowledge his wife, he just stares at Jacob 
       sternly.  Karen bites her nails.  Then David sits down and 
       starts to lecture.

                           DAVID
                 Okay.  You got three, maybe four days to 
                 rest up while we try and find a more 
                 permanent arrangement for you.  But his 
                 isn't going to be a free ride.  We're 
                 part of a community summer work project 
                 and eighty percent of the money you make 
                 goes to the house.  Everybody works - and 
                 that includes you.  Are you on drugs?

                           JACOB
                 No.

                           DAVID
                 Good.  If I catch anything stronger then 
                 an aspirin on you, you're outta here.  No 
                 arguments.  You got that straight?

                           JACOB
                 Yes, sir.

                           DAVID
                 Okay.  Dinner in two hours.  Why don't 
                 you go meet the rest of the gang.

                           KAREN
                 Thanks, David.

                           MARY
                 I'll go fix up the spare bed in Wesley's 
                 room.

       David gets up.  He gives Jacob a final once-over.

                           DAVID
                 And take a shower, for chrissakes.

       David leaves the room.  Karen gives Jacob a huge grin.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - THE TV ROOM - DAY

       Karen leads Jacob into the room.  There are two teenagers on 
       the couch: WESLEY is a fifteen-year old, curly hair, kind of 
       small.  GINA is also fifteen, brunette hair, seems pretty 
       happy.

                           KAREN
                 Hey, guys, I got someone for you to meet.  
                 This is Jacob.  Jacob, this is Wesley and 
                 Gina.

                           JACOB
                 Hi.

                           WESLEY
                 Welcome to fun central.

                           KAREN
                 He's going to be staying with us for a 
                 while.

                           GINA
                 Oh yeah?  How'd you get through the 
                 blockade?

       Another kid, SCOTT, pops into the room.  He's sixteen, dark 
       hair, with a tough-guy I could give a shit attitude.  He 
       doesn't seem to care about anybody in the room, except for 
       Karen.

                           SCOTT
                 Hey, beautiful.  How's it going?

                           KAREN
                 Hi, Scott.

       Scott notices Jacob and frowns.  Karen is a little annoyed.

                           SCOTT
                 Who's Barney Rubble?

                           KAREN
                 This is Jacob Johnson.  He's a new 
                 resident.  At least temporarily.

                           SCOTT
                 He better not be rooming with me.  I 
                 value my privacy.

                           KAREN
                 No, I believe that honor goes to Wesley.

                           WESLEY
                 Good.  I could use the company.

                           SCOTT
                 So what's your story?  Divorce?  Custody 
                 battle?  Your parents just plain 
                 assholes?

                           JACOB
                 They're dead.

                           KAREN
                 Mellow out, Scott.  Give him a chance to 
                 settle in.

                           SCOTT
                 Just curious.

       Scott reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out a pack of 
       cigarettes.  As he lights one up, Wesley's cheerful attitude 
       suddenly turns grim.  He gets up from the couch and quickly 
       leaves the room.  Karen gives Scott an angry look.

                           JACOB
                 Is he alright?

                           SCOTT
                 He'll be fine.  He just has a problem 
                 with cigarettes.

                           GINA
                 His parents used to use them as a sick 
                 kind of discipline.  That's why he's 
                 here.

                           JACOB
                 If you know that, then why do you smoke 
                 in front of him?

                           SCOTT
                 It's not my problem.

       This really pisses Jacob off.  These two are not going to get 
       along very well.

                           JACOB
                 Just what is YOUR problem, then?

                           SCOTT
                 I took care of my problem.  That's why 
                 I'M here.

       Scott lets out an aloof puff of smoke and leaves.  Jacob 
       gives Karen a confused glance.

                           KAREN
                 His dad used to beat him.  One day he 
                 couldn't take it any more.

                           JACOB
                 What happened?

                           KAREN
                 He killed him with his father's gun.  
                 Self-defense.

       Jacob sits down on the couch and lets that sink in.  Gina 
       scootches away from him on the couch, then gives him a glum 
       look.

                           GINA
                 Everyone here has a fun tale to tell.  
                 Isn't that right, Karen?

       Karen is staring out the window.  She has that spaced-out 
       expression we saw before when she was hiding behind the bush.

                           KAREN
                 Yeah.  Right.

       No one has anything left to say.  Gina turns the sound on the 
       TV back up as the three sad kids start to watch cartoons.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - THE TV ROOM - NIGHT

       Jacob is alone in the dark watching some kind of NICK AT 
       NIGHT b&w sit-com re-run.  A cheerful family lovingly banters 
       away on the flickering tube.  Jacob just stares blankly.

       Karen sleepily shows up at the doorway in a long tee-shirt 
       with a glass of milk.

                           KAREN
                 Why don't you go to bed?

                           JACOB
                 I can't sleep.

                           KAREN
                 You need to talk?

                           JACOB
                 No.  I'm fine.  Thanks.

       Karen gives him a worried look and heads off to bed.  Jacob 
       continues watching TV with a creepy glean in his tired eyes.

       INT. OLD WAREHOUSE - DAY

       The kids are here cleaning up the building.  The guys throw 
       rotted lumber into trash bins while the girls sweep up.  We 
       catch Jacob and Scott tossing some debris into a wheelbarrow.  
       Jacob looks pretty ragged.

                           SCOTT
                 Come on.  Let's hop to it.  Gotta make 
                 way for those new indoor tennis courts.  
                 The fate of the world lies in the 
                 balance.  Okay, this load's full.

       Jacob grabs the handles of the wheelbarrow and shakily picks 
       it up.  Scott sneers.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 You got that?

                           JACOB
                 Yeah, no problem.

                           SCOTT
                 I don't know.  Maybe you should think 
                 about switching to de-caf or something.

       Jacob ignores him and pushes the wheelbarrow along.  Scott 
       takes some time off to smoke a cigarette.  He spots Karen 
       across the room bending over with a dustbin.  Scott lingers 
       on this view for a long time.

       AT A DUMPSTER

       Jacob pulls up with the wheelbarrow and starts to unload the 
       junk.  Gina is next to the dumpster sweeping.  She tries to 
       push a large crate aside by herself, but slips and falls.

       Jacob jumps over to her, reaches out, and grabs her arm to 
       help her up.

                           JACOB
                 You okay?

       Gina SCREAMS.

                           GINA
                 No!  Yes!  Let go of me!

       She shakes off his grip and he jumps back.  She runs away 
       with a wild look in her eyes as Karen steps up to a confused 
       Jacob.

                           KAREN
                 She doesn't like to be touched.

                           JACOB
                 No shit!

                           KAREN
                 Don't take it personally.  It's not her 
                 fault.

                           JACOB
                 What happened to her?

                           KAREN
                 Her mother was a hooker.  She forced Gina 
                 to carry on the tradition.  When she was 
                 thirteen...

                           JACOB
                 Jesus.

       Jacob looks off at Gina with genuine concern.  Karen gives 
       him the same expression.

                           KAREN
                 You look terrible.

                           JACOB
                     (smiling)
                 Thanks.

                           KAREN
                 I'm sorry...I just wish you'd tell me 
                 what happened to you, that's all.

                           JACOB
                 I can't talk about it right now.  I'll 
                 tell you later.  I promise.

                           KAREN
                 Okay.  Why don't you sit and rest for a 
                 bit.  The supervisor's not around.  You 
                 look like you could use it.

                           JACOB
                 I think I will.

       He gives her a gentle squeeze on the forearm, and Karen likes 
       it.  Jacob spots a pile of wood next to a wall and heads off 
       for it.

       ON SCOTT

       He's watched the entire interchange between Jacob and Karen, 
       and he DOESN'T like it.

       WITH JACOB

       as he goes around the stack of lumber and sits down facing 
       the brick wall.  He lets out a heavy sigh and stares at the 
       inside of the building.

       JACOB'S POV - THE BRICK WALL

       sits there quietly for a few beats until:

       IT EXPLODES

       Bricks fly out at us as a gaping hole blows into the wall 
       revealing nothing but BLACKNESS and our shot MOVES through:

       DREAM FLASHES - NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD

       Horrifying apparitions and images ZOOM by us.  Gloomy 
       buildings under a pitch black sky.  MUTANTS and twisted 
       MONSTERS.  Shadowy streets and dark alleyways.  And FIVE 
       RAZOR-BLADE FINGERS suddenly ripping right through the sky 
       and down upon us as a VOICE rings out.

                           VOICE
                 Hey, you!

       INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - ON JACOB

       Jacob's eyes are closed as a SUPERVISOR looms above him.

                           SUPERVISOR
                 No slacking off.  Back to work.

       The boy's eyes snap open and he jumps to his feet like a 
       babbling crazy man.

                           JACOB
                 What!  Jesus fucking...Oh, shit!

                           SUPERVISOR
                 Whoa!  Get a grip, boy.

       The supervisor backs off from Jacob as he slowly gets used to 
       reality again.

                           JACOB
                 Huh?  What's going on?

                           SUPERVISOR
                 Nothing.  That's the problem.  Now that 
                 you've gotten your beauty rest, let's see 
                 if you can change it, okay?

       Jacob calms down and nods.  He walks away, snatching a 
       nervous glance at the perfectly normal brick wall.

       EXT. FOSTER HOME - NIGHT

       We watch as various lit windows go dark and the residents of 
       the house go to bed.

       INT. WESLEY & JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

       Wesley is getting in bed.  Jacob is sitting in a chair 
       staring out the window.  Wes switches off the lights and 
       turns to Jacob.

                           WESLEY
                 Aren't you going to bed?

                           JACOB
                 I'm not tired.

                           WESLEY
                 Bullshit.  If you looked any more tired, 
                 you'd be dead.

       Jacob cracks a weary smile in the darkness.

                           JACOB
                 That's right.

                           WESLEY
                 You gotta sleep, man.

                           JACOB
                 Why?  Who says?  You know, people don't 
                 even really know why we sleep.  They 
                 haven't found any physical reason for it.

                           WESLEY
                 But they do know that you go nuts if you 
                 don't.

                           JACOB
                 Sharks don't sleep.  They can't pump 
                 water through their gills on their own.  
                 They have to always keep moving.  If they 
                 stop, they can't breath.  If they go to 
                 sleep, they die.

                           WESLEY
                 You're not a shark.

                           JACOB
                 I know.  I'm just a kid.  Don't worry 
                 about me, Wes.  Go to sleep.

       Wesley shakes his head and gets under the covers.  Jacob 
       continues to stare out the window, desperately trying to keep 
       his eyes open.

       JACOB'S POV - THROUGH WINDOW

       the trees sway quietly in the breeze outside.  There is a 
       pause.  Then we are suddenly PULLED THROUGH THE WINDOW, 
       SMASHING glass, careening back into:

       DREAM FLASH - NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD

       We SAIL through the gloomy air, over the creepy buildings.  
       And suddenly DIP DOWN, right for the street, and end up 
       CRUISING three inches off the asphalt, really ripping down 
       the road until we grind to a SUDDEN HALT.  Right in front of:

       FREDDY'S FEET.  Our shot TILTS UP.  Freddy looms above us and 
       grins.

                           FREDDY
                 You can't stay awake forever, boy!

       He LAUGHS, his mouth gaping wide, and then splitting open 
       impossibly wider.  Something starts pouring out of his mouth, 
       right at us.

       Hundreds of GIANT BUGS spew down upon us, covering us 
       completely as everything goes to BLACK and we:

       INT. WESLEY & JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

       ON JACOB

       his eyes are open, his mouth is hanging in a SILENT SCREAM.  
       It looks like his head is about to explode.  He lifts his 
       hand up to his face.  He's holding an eight-inch long MONSTER 
       BUG.

       Jacob SCREAMS out loud this time, tosses the mutant insect 
       away.  It lands on a windowsill and escapes out the opening. 

       Jacob jumps to his feet, sending his chair tumbling backwards 
       with a CRASH.  He shakes and moans, a little drool dripping 
       down his chin.

       Wesley sits up with a start and stares at Jacob.

                           WESLEY
                 I told you you'd go nuts!

       Jacob catches his breath, gives Wes a dead serious look.

                           JACOB
                 Get everybody else.  I have to tell them 
                 something.

                           WESLEY
                 In the middle of the night?

                           JACOB
                 I MEAN it!

       Wesley is shocked by Jacob's manic state and jumps out of 
       bed.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM - NIGHT

       Five kids are gathered around the room in various stages of 
       sleepy grumpiness and annoyed disbelief.  Jacob paces back 
       and forth.

                           SCOTT
                 I don't get it.  Is this guy alive or 
                 dead?

                           JACOB
                 He's neither.  He haunts your dreams and 
                 if he kills you, you die for real.

       Wesley, the most gullible of the group, looks pretty scared.

                           WESLEY
                 I haven't dreamed of him. I have 
                 nightmares like you wouldn't believe, but 
                 never of this guy.

                           SCOTT
                 That's because this all rates an eleven 
                 on the bullshit meter!  I don't know why 
                 we have to listen to this crap.  You're 
                 scaring the hell out of Wes here.

                           GINA
                 Keep your voice down.

                           SCOTT
                 It doesn't matter.  The Ross's sleep like 
                 rocks, which is what we all should be 
                 doing.

                           JACOB
                 I know this sounds crazy, but I swear 
                 it's true.  I went to bed one night and 
                 woke up in the middle of the road.  
                 Freddy Krueger killed my mother, blasted 
                 my whole town into his nightmare, and, 
                 worst of all, I think he wants to use me 
                 to kill more kids and bring more towns 
                 into his world.

                           KAREN
                 How?

                           JACOB
                 I'm not sure.  I think I'm some kind of 
                 carrier.  He's somehow inside me and as 
                 soon as I fall deep enough into sleep 
                 he'll be let loose.  You guys were great 
                 to take me in.  I just don't want to 
                 thank you by getting you all killed.

       Scott gets up and goes to a desk.  He pulls out a map and 
       shows it to Jacob.

                           SCOTT
                 Okay.  Show me Springwood.

       Jacob looks at the map and points.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 There's nothing there.

                           JACOB
                 That's what I've been trying to tell you.

                           SCOTT
                 There's NEVER been a town there.  

                           JACOB
                 That's how YOU see it.  I was part of the 
                 nightmare, so I'm the only one who 
                 notices the difference.

       Scott stares at Jacob.  He actually grows sympathetic.

                           SCOTT
                 Look, Jacob.  You don't have to convince 
                 us that nightmares are real.  Everybody 
                 in this room has been through one.  And 
                 some of us are still living it.  But the 
                 thing is, we know it's just in our heads 
                 now.  It can be just as bad as the real 
                 thing was, but it's still only a memory.  
                 It can't hurt us physically, unless we do 
                 the hurting ourselves.

                           GINA
                 And we don't want to see you get hurt.

                           WESLEY
                 We know it gets crazy.  And we'll help 
                 out the best we can.

                           SCOTT
                 But this is just too hard to believe.

       Jacob plops down on the couch, defeated.  He hangs his head 
       while the kids start to get up.  Wesley gives him a pat on 
       the back as he, Scott, and Gina leave.  But Karen is still 
       here.

       She sits next to a window with a faraway look in her eyes.  
       Jacob looks up at her.

                           JACOB
                 You don't believe me, either, do you?

                           KAREN
                 I don't know.

                           JACOB
                 Why are you still here?

                           KAREN
                 I'm not sure.  I guess, I guess I see a 
                 lot of me in you.

                           JACOB
                 Feels good to see someone more fucked up 
                 than yourself, huh?

       Karen smiles and sits down next to him.

                           KAREN
                 Yeah.  That must be it.

                           JACOB
                 But you haven't told me why you're here 
                 at this place.

                           KAREN
                 I can't talk about it right now.  Maybe 
                 later.  Do you want me to stay with you?

                           JACOB
                 Yeah, that'd be great.  Don't let me 
                 sleep, okay?

                           KAREN
                 I'll do my best.

       She reaches for the remote control and flicks on the TV, 
       moving a little closer to Jacob when she sits back into the 
       couch.  The two of them watch the screen with glassy eyes.

                           KAREN (cont'd)
                 Thank God for cable TV.

                           JACOB
                 Yeah.  Thank God.

       They continue to watch in silence as Karen takes hold of 
       Jacob's hand.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - THE TV ROOM - MORNING

       We are ON KAREN as she sleeps curled up on the couch.  Jacob 
       is in the background putting on his shoes.  He has a brown 
       paper bag with him.

       Jacob gets up, grabs his bag, and steps over to Karen.  He 
       gently pulls a lock of hair away from her face.  Then he 
       heads for the front door.

       EXT. FOSTER HOME - FRONT PORCH - DAY

       Jacob walks out the door and closes it behind him.  He 
       crosses to the porch steps and stops.  He has to hold onto a 
       porch column just to keep standing.

       Karen appears behind him.  Jacob jumps a bit.

                           KAREN
                 Where are you going?

                           JACOB
                 I'm leaving.

                           KAREN
                 Why?

                           JACOB
                 He can't hurt you if I'm gone.  Maybe 
                 I'll go to the desert or something.  I'll 
                 lie down in the middle of nowhere and 
                 finally get some sleep.  Krueger can feed 
                 of the dreams of snakes and vultures.

                           KAREN
                 Fine.  You're just going to take off 
                 then...

       Karen has an angry expression on his face.  Jacob gives her a 
       pained look.

                           JACOB
                 Don't do this to me.  I'm just trying to 
                 protect you and the others.

                           KAREN
                 Right.  You blow into town and then blow 
                 right out.  Terrific.

                           JACOB
                 I don't understand why you're so mad at 
                 me.

                           KAREN
                 You just don't get it, do you?

                           JACOB
                 Get what?

       Karen, though still very angry, looks like she's about to 
       cry.  Jacob, confused, sits down on the porch steps.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Maybe I'm crazy.

                           KAREN
                 Running away doesn't help.

       He sighs and smiles a bit.

                           JACOB
                 And you're going to convince me, huh?

                           KAREN
                 Maybe.

       This time Karen smiles.  Jacob looks at her and sighs.  Then 
       he yawns.

                           KAREN (cont'd)
                 I'm going to make some coffee.  You 
                 promise not to move?

                           JACOB
                 Yeah.  Sure.

       Karen jumps and heads back into the house.  Jacob stares at 
       the grass in front of him, his eyes heavy.

       JACOB'S POV - THE LAWN

       A bush sits there doing nothing.  Until it suddenly comes TO 
       LIFE.  Its leaves start to shrivel, the lawn turns brown, the 
       sky turns dark.  Everything changes and turns into

       DREAM FLASH - NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD

       We're in a different front yard in a different town, in a 
       different dimension.

       The mutant bush starts to change, sprout legs, grow arms, 
       become human.  

       ALICE

       Her body takes shape as she reaches out a pleading arm to us.

                           ALICE
                 Jacob!  Help me!

       She's fully formed now.  And Freddy bursts out from the 
       ground behind her.  He grabs Alice, reaches his knife arm 
       around

                           ALICE (cont'd)
                 No-o-o-o-o!

       Her words are cut off as Krueger jams his blades in her gut 
       and we re-live her death once more.  But it's even worse this 
       time.

       Blood POURS from Alice like a burst fire hydrant, spraying 
       and showering the entire nightmare lawn like a human 
       sprinkler.  Freddy LAUGHS.

                           FREDDY
                 Say it, don't spray it, huh, Jacob?  Come 
                 and join the fun!

                           JACOB (O.S.)
                 NOOOOOOO!

       Jacob's voice rips through the scene as everything starts to 
       BLUR RED.

       EXT. FOSTER HOME - FRONT LAWN - DAY

       Jacob is lying in the grass, violently shaking.  Karen drops 
       down next to him.

                           KAREN
                 Jacob!

                           JACOB
                 Nooooo!

       His body jerks around as if caught in the throes of an 
       epileptic seizure.  He SHRIEKS, ignoring Karen completely, 
       and continues to shriek and scream and yell and shake.  Like 
       he's never going to stop.

       EXT. MR. HOPKINS' FRONT DOOR - DAY

       We're directly across the street from the Foster Home as 
       Jacob's cries echo through the neighborhood.  Mr. Hopkins 
       opens the front door.  He sees what's going on, scowls, and 
       yells into his house.

                           MR. HOPKINS
                 I told you!  It's an overdose!  Jesus 
                 Christ, I saw this coming.  Call 9-1-1!

       He watches the commotion growing across the street, and never 
       once moves to help.

       EXT. FOSTER HOME - MOMENTS LATER

       Jacob is being strapped into a stretcher, babbling 
       incoherently.  The residents of the Foster Home stand off to 
       the side while neighbors gawk from the street.  Karen is next 
       to the AMBULANCE GUYS looking frantic.

                           JACOB
                 No!  Don't let them take me!

                           KAREN
                 Jacob, it'll be alright.

                           AMBULANCE GUY #1
                 Calm down, kid.  We'll take care of you.

       Jacob grabs the Ambulance Guy.

                           JACOB
                 You don't understand!  Let me go!

       The ambulance guy straps Jacob's arm down.  Mr. Ross grabs 
       Karen and pulls her away as they start loading the crazed 
       teenager into the ambulance.  Scott shakes his head.  Wesley 
       looks terrified.  Gina keeps her distance from any human.  
       Karen can't take it and runs into the house.  Mr. Ross 
       frowns.

                           DAVID
                 This is just what we need.

       The ambulance drives away as the gathered crowd stares at the 
       kids angrily.

       INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

       Jacob yells and struggles as an Ambulance Guy prepares a 
       syringe for injection.

                           JACOB
                 Don't fucking put me under!  You'll set 
                 him free!

       The ambulance guy holds Jacob down and slams the needle home. 
       Jacob screams and his eyes start to glass over.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 He'll kill them all...

       Jacob's head starts to go limp.  A VOICE rings out in the 
       van, a voice only Jacob hears:

                           FREDDY (O.S.)
                 Every town as an Elm Street!

       LAUGHTER echoes as Jacob turns his head towards a window.

       EXT. A STREET CORNER - DAY

       The ambulance zooms by.  All is quiet for a second until 
       CRASH! A twisted rusty sign post erupts out of the sidewalk 
       and settles at an ugly angle.

       It's an ELM ST. sign.

       INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

       We PULL BACK from a wide awake Jacob, who is now suddenly 
       alone in the van.  Outside the window there is only darkness.  
       Jacob twists and struggles on the stretcher as

       CLANG! the ambulance doors crash open revealing BLACKNESS and 
       KA-BOOM!  the stretcher is shot out of the van like a 
       cannonball.

       INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

       The stretcher with Jacob BLASTS through a wall and starts to 
       race across the floor of the building that Jacob had been 
       sweeping up the day before.

       It careens along, actually taking a few turns, like it has a 
       mind of its own, heading for a shallow pit in the middle of 
       the warehouse.

       The stretcher hits the pit, drops a bit, swings up violently, 
       and stops in a vertical position like a rake that has been 
       stepped on AND A BLACK HUMAN SHAPE shoots out of Jacob's body 
       from intertial force, staying upright as it slides across the 
       floor, spins, stops, then changes into:

       FREDDY KRUEGER

       Freddy has his hands on his hips and a grin on his face.

                           FREDDY
                 Thanks for the lift, kid!

       He saunters up to Jacob who is still strapped to the vertical 
       stretcher.  Krueger waves his knives and wiggles his tongue.

                           JACOB
                 What do you want from me?

                           FREDDY
                 I already got it!  The rest I'm going to 
                 get from your new little friends.

                           JACOB
                 Leave them alone!

                           FREDDY
                 It's my duty to clean up the 
                 neighborhood!

                           JACOB
                 What have you done with my town?

                           FREDDY
                 Aw, poor baby's homesick, isn't he?  
                 Don't worry.  We'll all be one happy 
                 family soon.  Wanna be the first recruit?

       Freddy raises his blades and SWINGS.  The straps around Jacob 
       drop away as his body falls to the floor.  He scrambles to 
       his feet and starts to RUN.

       Freddy laughs

       WITH JACOB - RUNNING

       as he heads for a door.  Before he gets there, the door 
       swings open and Freddy leans casually in his way.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 What's the matter?  Don't want to be part 
                 of my expansion project?

       Jacob turns right around and races back across the warehouse.

       AT THE DUMPSTER

       Jacob races around to the other side and there's Krueger 
       again.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Today, Rosedale.  Tomorrow, the world!

                           JACOB
                 Over my dead body!

                           FREDDY
                 As you wish.

       Freddy cranks up his knives and looms over Jacob.  And three 
       FLASHES OF LIGHT blast out behind the boy.  Jacob rolls away 
       as Freddy holds up an arm to block the blinding glare.  The 
       light fades.  The DREAM POLICE have arrived.

       We'll call the small one SOUND COP.  He stands there 
       motionless as a loud and horrible GROWING noise emanates from 
       his clenched teeth.  This guy's bark is worse than his bite.

       The female in black is BLADE COP.  From nowhere she produces 
       two nasty-looking knives, one in each hand.  She spins the 
       blades in the air like an expert Samurai.

       The large one we'll call POWER COP.  He reaches out for the 
       dumpster, and with one hand sends it tumbling away with a 
       CRASH.  Freddy frowns.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Uh oh. Too many parking tickets.

       The Dream Police fan out around Krueger, surrounding him.  
       Power Cop leaps at Freddy, grabs him and TOSSES him in the 
       air.  Freddy tumbles, rolls and bounces right back up on his 
       feet.  Right next to BLADE.

       She swings her knives.  Freddy dodges.  Swings hi own blades 
       at her.  She ducks.  Freddy spins again.  Right towards:

       SOUND COP.  The short man in black opens his mouth and a 
       sound like a foghorn at a rock concert BLARES OUT.  The force 
       of it hitting Freddy like a fist.

       Freddy bounces back.  And once again he nimbly pops up.  He 
       glares at the Dream Police.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Don't interfere!

                           BLADE COP
                 We have to.

                           SOUND COP
                 It's our job.

                           FREDDY
                 Get a new one.

       And Freddy starts to SPIN.  Slowly at first, then faster and 
       faster, until his image starts to BLUR.

       The Police circle the whirling image, holding back to see 
       what will happen next.  Krueger stops spinning.  And his 
       clothes are different.  His red and green stripes have been 
       replaced by black and white ones.  There is a number printed 
       across his chest.  He's dressed like a CONVICT.  Freddy 
       grins.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Time to blow this joint.

       BOOM!  A hole is suddenly blown in the high ceiling above 
       Krueger.  The building is suddenly filled with the beams of 
       moving SPOTLIGHTS and the sound of blasting SIRENS.

       A rope falls down through the hole.  Freddy grabs it and 
       WHOOSH! he's yanked up.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 You'll never get me, coppers!

       and away he's gone.  After a few seconds the spotlights fade 
       away and the sirens die.  The Dream Police look up seemingly 
       unsure of their next action.  Then Power Cop kicks a pile of 
       lumber, sending wood flying dozens of yards away.

                           POWER COP
                 Goddamnit!

       Sound Cop shakes his head.  Blade looks frustrated.  Jacob 
       steps up behind them.

                           JACOB
                 Alright...just who the hell are you guys?

       The black-clad trio turn around in unison and look at Jacob.  
       There is a pause.  Then:

                           BLADE COP
                 We're the Dream Police.

       Jacob almost laughs.

                           JACOB
                 The what?

                           POWER COP
                 The Dream Police.  Didn't you hear her, 
                 man?

       Power Cop turns to Sound Cop and flips up his visor revealing 
       his face.  He's a sixteen-year old black boy.  Heavyset 
       features, sweat dripping down his cheeks.  He's KINCAID from 
       NIGHTMARE 3.  And he's pissed.

                           POWER COP (cont'd)
                 We try and save this guy's ass and then 
                 he goes off and cops an attitude.

       Sound Cop flips up his helmet.  He's JOEY, the former mute 
       boy.

                           SOUND COP
                 I think you're the wrong guy to talk 
                 about attitudes.

                           BLADE COP
                 Guys, guys.  This is getting us nowhere.

       She takes her helmet completely off, long dark hair tumbling 
       over her shoulders.  It's TARYN, the ex-junkie.  These three, 
       they're the Dream Warriors.  Or at least they used to be. 

                           JACOB
                 Hello?  May I butt in here and ask some 
                 more stupid questions?

       The three of them stop bickering and turn to Jacob.  Blade 
       walks up to Jacob.  Her two partners assume position behind 
       her.

                           BLADE COP
                 We don't know much more than you do.  
                 What we do know is that we've been 
                 recruited...

                           JACOB
                 By who?

                           SOUND COP
                 We don't know.

                           JACOB
                 Why?

                           BLADE COP
                 I think that's obvious.

                           POWER COP
                 The shit's about to hit the fan.

                           SOUND COP
                 Krueger's discovered new powers.

                           BLADE COP
                 He's ripped a hole between dreams and 
                 reality.

                           POWER COP
                 Our own powers have been amplified.

                           SOUND COP
                 We only hope it will be enough.

                           BLADE COP
                 But we're going to need your help.

                           JACOB
                 Me?  What can I do?  Just who are you 
                 guys...really?

       Blade puts her helmet back on.  Her face turns grim.

                           BLADE COP
                 We were like you.  We fought Freddy 
                 Krueger many years ago.  Our souls were 
                 released from his grip.  No we're back to 
                 try again.

       All three of them drop their visors down at the same time.

                           JACOB
                 I still don't understand what...

       Jacob's voice starts to GARBLE. He keeps trying to talk but 
       the words come out twisted and clipped.  He raises a hand to 
       his throat.  The hand is transparent.  Jacob looks at his 
       body as it slowly starts to disappear and now he's completely 
       mute.

                           SOUND COP
                 Freddy Krueger can't hurt us anymore.

                           POWER COP
                 Because we're already dead.

       Jacob vanishes completely.

       INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

       Jacob opens his eyes.  He's in bed, dressed in a white smock.  
       A DOCTOR stands next to him with a clipboard in hand.

                           JACOB
                 What's going on?

                           DOCTOR
                 Just relax, everything's fine.

                           JACOB
                 That's what you say...

                           DOCTOR
                 You're lucky you're here instead of 
                 juvenile hall.  You put up quite a fight.  
                 But you're clean.  No traces of drugs or 
                 alcohol in your blood.

                           JACOB
                 I could've told you that.

       Jacob starts getting out of bed.

                           DOCTOR
                 Hold on there.

                           JACOB
                 You said I was fine.  I have to get back.  
                 My friends are in trouble.

                           DOCTOR
                 I said you weren't on drugs, but I never 
                 said you were fine.  You're suffering 
                 from extreme fatigue and stress that 
                 manifested itself into one hell of an 
                 anxiety attack.  At least that's what we 
                 hope it is.  You had a major seizure, 
                 Jacob.

                           JACOB
                 You don't understand.  This whole town is 
                 in danger.

                           DOCTOR
                 We're keeping you here for observation.  
                 You're not going anywhere tonight.

                           JACOB
                 You can't do that.  You don't have the 
                 right!

                           DOCTOR
                 Yes we do.  Your temporary guardian, Mr. 
                 Ross, signed all the papers.  If you're 
                 okay in the morning we might let you go 
                 home.  Until then, you're bed bound.

                           JACOB
                 But...

                           DOCTOR
                 We took off the restraints.  Do you want 
                 us to put them back on?

       Jacob drops back in bed.  The doctor goes to the door and 
       turns out the lights.

                           DAVID
                 Sleep.

       He closes the door behind him...

                           JACOB
                 Shit...

       and we hear it LOCK

                                                            CUT TO:

       A CRAZED LUNATIC

       suddenly SCREAMING into the lens with desperation.  Dark 
       circles under bloodshot eyes, hair matted with sweat.  A guy 
       not having a good day.  WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

       The man is tightly bound in a regulation straight-jacket in a 
       tiny, claustrophobic holding cell.  We can now tell that the 
       image is in BLACK AND WHITE.  We continue PULLING BACK

       INT. FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM - NIGHT

       Gina sits on the couch with a stark white blanket on her lap, 
       watching a b&w 1940's potboiler with something less than 
       enthusiasm.  Wesley appears in the doorway, checking out the 
       source of the screaming.  He looks at Gina, who tosses the 
       blanket aside and rises, frowning.  The lunatic on television 
       continues his blood-curdling SHRIEKS.

                           GINA
                 Nice movie, huh?  And I came in here to 
                 mellow out.

       She smiles at Wes as she exits.

                           GINA (cont'd)
                 It's all yours.

       Wesley murmurs a goodnight, then looks back at the screen:

       ON THE TV

       Some orderlies enter the lunatic's cell and attempt to sedate 
       him as he thrashes violently, SCREAMING bloody murder.  It is 
       gritty and awful but somehow riveting.

       WESLEY

       moves to the couch, clearly mesmerized by the scene.  He 
       curls up, absently pulling the white blanket around him as he 
       watches:

       ON THE TV

       The orderlies in the movie manage to get the needle into 
       their patient, who MOANS and SOBS pathetically.

                           ORDERLY ON TV
                 Relax, will ya, buddy? Everything's gonna 
                 be just swell.

       The second orderly leans on a wall and pulls out a pack of 
       cigarettes from the pocket of his scrubs.  (He bears a 
       suspicious resemblance to ROBERT ENGLUND.)

       WESLEY

       vaguely tenses at this and absently pulls the blanket more 
       tightly around him to compensate, like a cocoon.

       ON THE TV

       The second orderly smiles.

                           SECOND ORDERLY
                 Yeah, mac.  You've just had a hard day, 
                 that's all.

       The orderly produces a pack of matches.  He goes to the 
       lunatic on the cot, and LIGHTS the match off the guy's 
       forehead.  As the match FLARES, the lunatic SCREAMS.

       CLOSE ON WESLEY

       he shuts his eyes tensely as the SOUND is magnified, becoming 
       a sudden ROAR that fills the room.

       Wesley blinks his eyes open, looks around from his blanket 
       cocoon.  Whatever that last sound was, it did NOT come from 
       the TV.

       Beads of sweat line his upper lip as he nervously glances 
       about the room.  It remains quiet, serene.  Deciding it was 
       his imagination reacting to the scene on TV, Wesley nestles 
       back on the couch, laying down now as the CAMERA MOVES TO 
       REVEAL

       The carpet at the edge of the room is bunched up as though 
       the walls of the room itself have budged a few inches inward.

       BACK ON THE TV the second orderly lights his cigarette as he 
       hands the pack to the first.  They both look down at the 
       madman as they savor their cigarettes.  

                           ORDERLY ON TV
                 You heard the man, Wesley.  Just relax.  
                 Have a smoke with us.

       Wesley's brow furrows, reacting to the coincidence.  Then he 
       stiffens as the two orderlies in the movie begin to hold the 
       lit cigarettes over the lunatic's face

                           SECOND ORDERLY
                 Yeah, Wesley.  Have a smoke.

       OUR Wesley has seen about enough of this movie.  He starts to 
       get up

                           WESLEY
                 Fuck this.

       but finds that he can't move.  The white blanket around him 
       restraining him tightly like the straight-jacket on TV.  He 
       squirms and struggles.

                           WESLEY (cont'd)
                 Hey.

       He struggles harder now, but to no avail.  He's wrapped 
       tight, like a cigarette.

       ON THE TV the two orderlies torment the straight-jacketed 
       lunatic, poking his face with their lit cigarettes.  As the 
       lunatic SCREAMS, the screams become magnified, again becoming 
       that loud, deafening ROAR we heard before.  Wesley squirms in 
       his blanket/ straight-jacket, he jerks his head around, 
       SEEING with each of the man's SCREAMS, the walls of the room 
       SHUDDER INWARD and 

       Wesley's EYES WIDEN with horror as he realizes not only is he 
       TRAPPED like a sardine in his stark white blanket, but the 
       walls of the room are starting to CLOSE IN on him.  He SPINS 
       back to the TV set, where:

       The first orderly is now looking AT US.  Wesley REACTS as he 
       notices something familiar about the man's face.

                           FIRST ORDERLY
                 Relax, Wesley.

                           WESLEY
                 Dad?

       The second orderly BOLTS into view.  He has become Freddy 
       Krueger.

                           FREDDY
                 Yeah, Wesley.  Everything's gonna be 
                 great!  Just have a smoke on us!

       As they hold their smokes out TOWARD US, their arms PROTRUDE 
       FROM THE TV SET with their lit cigarettes.

       Wesley SCREAMS and jerks his head away from TV and he HITS 
       the floor with an ugly THUMP.  The wind knocked out of him.  
       He rolls.  The couch is GONE.

       As he squirms and struggles to escape his white cocoon, the 
       frightened boy looks around and sees that everything in the 
       room - furniture, carpet, TV, even the door - are all gone, 
       leaving just the white walls SLOWLY CLOSING IN ON HIM.

       Then we see that on the floor all around Wesley are long, 
       cylindrical white objects.  Clearly, they resemble GIANT 
       CIGARETTES, and Wesley - wrapped neck-to-toe in his white 
       blanket cocoon - looks just like one of them.

       He continues to squirm and SCREAM as the walls CLOSE IN from 
       all sides -- closer -- CLOSER -- pushing the long white 
       things toward him, around him, bunching them together until 
       they are in a tight cluster, as the room CRUNCHES IN TIGHTLY, 
       blocking whatever light source there is, until all Wesley can 
       do is SCREAM one last time, and

       The screen goes BLACK.

       After a few beats, we hear a huge, deafening RIPPING SOUND, 
       and a new LIGHT SOURCE appears as  Wesley looks up, eyes wide 
       with unspeakable horror as the giant, scarred face of FREDDY 
       looms over him, grinning, and we:

       INT. FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM

       The room is back to normal, but not the occupant.  Freddy 
       Krueger now stands here alone.  He has just peeled the 
       wrapper off a pack of cigarettes of which Wesley has become 
       one.

                           FREDDY
                 Didn't Daddy ever tell you what the 
                 Surgeon General says...?

       Krueger reaches in and pulls the tiny Wesley out of the pack.  
       As before, Wesley is immobile, helpless.  Freddy holds him 
       between two fingers.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Smoking's bad for your health!

       Freddy looks around, as if searching for something, then 
       beams as he reaches into the air and...

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Ah!  A match made in heaven!

       He produces a puny version of WESLEY'S FATHER In one hand.  
       His body is straight and rigid, like a match stick.

       Freddy places his thumb on the stiff man's head, and flicks 
       his thumbnail, causing the man's skull to BURST INTO FLAME, 
       an evil grin spanning Wesley's Father's face.

       He brings the Father-Match to what would be Wesley's tiny 
       feet, and lights the end.

       VERY CLOSE ON FREDDY'S HAND

       Wesley SCREAMS as Freddy tosses the FATHER-MATCH and brings 
       the teenager's little head up to his fire-scarred lips.

       The boy is enveloped by the massive cracked opening as Freddy 
       takes a huge drag off of Wesley's head. Where his feet should 
       be, the tip of the Wesley-Cig GLOWS RED, causing Wesley to 
       SCREAM with supernatural pain.  Smoke billows from Freddy's 
       nose and mouth.  He savors it.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Ahhhh!  Now we're smokin'!

       He CACKLES horribly as he continues to suck on the Wesley-
       Cig.  With each puff, Wesley's white-wrapped body becomes 
       slat-black ash.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 What's your sign, Wesley?  It wouldn't be 
                 Cancer, would it?

       In between his demonic CACKLES, Freddy DRAGS on the Wesley-
       Cig, each puff turning more of Wesley into ash until all but 
       his head is black and charred.  Freddy holds the Wesley-Cig 
       out, poised to tap the ashes loose.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Now say the secret word and you know what 
                 you'll win...

                           WESLEY
                 Go to hell!

       Freddy grins.

                           FREDDY
                 Right...

       And he taps the Wesley-cig with his finger.  The ashes 
       immediately fall, sifting in the air as Wesley's head - 
       charred and black at the neck where it's been separated - 
       falls loose.  Wesley SCREAMS.

                           WESLEY
                 Noooooooo!

       and his severed head falls and falls and falls.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

       WE START on WESLEY'S BODY.  Eyes closed, head normal and 
       everything from the neck down charred mass of burnt torso, 
       shriveled limbs, all wrapped in the scorched blanket.  ZIP.  
       A body bag hides this ghastly image from us as we PULL BACK.

       A FIRE MARSHALL and a COP are talking at the doorway in the 
       background.  The CORONER is here, a world weary seen-it-all 
       older guy, with his nervous ASSISTANT who's never seen 
       anything like this.  They whisper their conversation as they 
       lift the body bag onto a stretcher.

                           ASSISTANT
                 I don't get it.  The couch is barely 
                 scorched.  And how can he burn from just 
                 the neck down?

                           CORONER
                 It happens.

                           ASSISTANT
                 It happens?  That's your explanation?

                           CORONER
                 I've seen worse.

       We FOLLOW them as they push the stretcher towards the 
       doorway.

                           ASSISTANT
                 What?  What worse?

                           CORONER
                 Never mind.

       Our shot STOPS at the doorway with the fire Marshall and cop 
       while the wigged-out assistant's voice trails off outside.

                           ASSISTANT
                 No.  I wanna know.  Really.  What could 
                 be worse than...

                           FIRE MARSHALL
                 You know what the gossip rags are going 
                 to say?  Spontaneous human combustion.

                           COP
                 What's that?

                           FIRE MARSHALL
                 That's where bodies are supposed to go up 
                 in smoke for no reason.  It's all psychic 
                 bullshit.  What really happened is called 
                 the candle effect.  A tiny fire gets 
                 started, usually from a cigarette.  It 
                 slowly smolders through the blanket and 
                 clothes until the skin starts to actually 
                 bake.  The body fat begins to melt and 
                 liquefy, fueling the fire like a slow 
                 burning candle.  It takes hours, but it's 
                 real.

       The cop makes some notes.  Behind them we see Scott, Karen 
       and Gina.  The girls have been crying, and even tough-guy 
       Scott looks pretty screwed up by all this.  The cop nods.

                           COP
                 He fell asleep while smoking.  What a 
                 waste.

       The kids shoot unbelieving looks at each other as the two men 
       walk off.

                           SCOTT
                 That's impossible.

       Scott and Karen head for the front door.

       EXT. FOSTER HOME - DAY

       A coroner's van, a fire chief's car and the now familiar mob 
       of suspicious neighbors are gathered around the front of the 
       house as the stretcher with Wesley's body is put away.  A 
       small van marked ROSEDALE GENERAL HOSPITAL pulls up and Jacob 
       jumps out of it.

       Jacob's face turns grim as a tearful Karen runs up to him, 
       Scott following.

                           JACOB
                 Who?

                           KAREN
                 Wes...

                           JACOB
                 Oh my God.  It's started.

                           SCOTT
                 He fucking burned alive.

                           KAREN
                 They said he fell asleep smoking.

                           SCOTT
                 And we all know that can't be.

                           JACOB
                 I already told you how it would happen.

       Mr. Ross appears behind the three teenagers, a wasted look on 
       his face.

                           SCOTT
                 Don't start with that shit.

                           JACOB
                 It's not shit.

                           DAVID
                 C'mon, kids.  Everyone inside.  Now.

       David leads them back to the house as the coroner's van pulls 
       away.

       INT. KITCHEN - DAY

       Jacob, Scott, Karen and Gina stand around in various states 
       of utter shock as David tries to console them.

                           DAVID
                 We have to be strong.

       He puts an arm around Karen and reaches out to put the other 
       one around Gina, but pulls away at the last minute when she 
       starts to flinch.

                           DAVID (cont'd)
                 We need to pull together and help each 
                 other.  Mrs. Ross is upstairs in bed.  
                 She's pretty messed up.  We need to help 
                 her deal with this.

                           SCOTT
                 He would never touch a cigarette.  You 
                 know that.

                           DAVID
                 We don't know anything until the 
                 authorities are finished with their 
                 investigation.  In the mean time, no work 
                 for tomorrow - three day weekend.  But 
                 Monday, it's back on the job.  Jacob 
                 wasn't covered in our health plan and his 
                 little stint at the hospital cost us a 
                 bundle.  We have to work together or we 
                 might lose this place.  Okay?

       The kids all nod, but not convincingly.  They care more about 
       Wesley than the house.

       INT. WESLEY & JACOB'S BEDROOM - DAY

       Jacob closes the door.  All the kids are here.  Gina 
       absentmindedly plays with some of Wesley's things.

                           JACOB
                 When I was put under, Freddy was 
                 released.  I know this because I dreamed 
                 it.

                           SCOTT
                 And that dream was real?

                           JACOB
                 Yes.  Wesley was his first victim.

                           SCOTT
                 Aw, man...

                           JACOB
                 You said it yourself.  How could it have 
                 been a cigarette?

                           KAREN
                 And how could he...dire that way and not 
                 wake up?

                           GINA
                     (mockingly)
                 Maybe the "authorities" will figure it 
                 out.

                           SCOTT
                 I'm sorry.  I just can't buy into this.

                           JACOB
                 Call me crazy...but I think he's after 
                 Rosedale.  The whole place.  In my dream 
                 he said something about needing a few 
                 souls to get the job done. I think he has 
                 to kill in order to get the power to suck 
                 in a new town.

                           SCOTT
                 You are crazy.

                           JACOB
                 Thank you.  There's more.  There are...
                 other people in there.  In the 
                 nightmares.

                           KAREN
                 Like him?

                           JACOB
                 No. Different.  There are three of them.  
                 They're dressed in black. They have 
                 powers like Freddy, but they seem to be 
                 on our side.

                           KAREN
                 Who are they?

                           JACOB
                 Well, you gotta hang in there with me on 
                 this one.  They call themselves... the 
                 Dream Police.

       Scott actually laughs.

                           SCOTT
                 This is too much.

                           GINA
                 You mean...like cops?

                           JACOB
                 I guess. 

                           KAREN
                 Where are they from?

                           JACOB
                 They're kids that Freddy killed years 
                 ago.  THEY don't even know how they got 
                 there.  But they're somehow patrolling 
                 dreamworld to put a stop to Krueger.

                           SCOTT
                 Then why haven't these guys done the job 
                 already?

                           JACOB
                 They say they need help.  I don't know 
                 what or why...yet.

                           SCOTT
                 I can tell you who needs help.

                           JACOB
                 Hey, I'm trying to save all of us.

                           SCOTT
                 I won't believe it until I see it.

       Jacob is crushed that he's not getting through to them.

                           JACOB
                 By then it'll be too late.  It was too 
                 late for Wesley.

       The kids stare emptily at Wesley's earthly possessions.

       EXT. FOSTER HOME - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

       Jacob and Karen sit on the steps.  Across the street we can 
       see window curtains part as Mr. Hopkins sneaks a wary peek.

                           KAREN
                 They're going to use all this to shut us 
                 down.

                           JACOB
                 I know.  It's my fault.

                           KAREN
                 You going to try to run away again?

                           JACOB
                 It's too late for that. I have to stay 
                 and try and put a stop to it.

                           KAREN
                 I'm sorry.  It's all so hard to accept.

                           JACOB
                 I wish I could convince you of the danger 
                 you and the others are in.

                           KAREN
                 I've been in danger before. THAT I can 
                 handle.

                           JACOB
                 This is worse than anything you can 
                 imagine.

                           KAREN
                 I wouldn't be so sure about that.  Come 
                 on.  Let's go inside.

       She stands up.

       INT. KAREN'S ROOM - NIGHT

       Jacob and Karen lie in bed, clothes on, cozy.  Not sexual.  
       She stares at the ceiling while he listens.

                           KAREN
                 She was great. Loving.  Supportive, 
                 caring - everything a mom should be. 
                 Except she had one fatal flow: my father.  
                 You see, she was raised at a time when 
                 they still had the "obey" part in the 
                 wedding vows.  He was always jealous.  
                 She couldn't talk to another man without 
                 him thinking she wanted to go to bed with 
                 him.  He never hit me. But the things he 
                 did to her...and she would always just 
                 take it.  She never fought back.  He'd 
                 get drunk and...she'd tell people she 
                 just fell down or something.  Then one 
                 night...I was thirteen.  Something 
                 happened.  My mom suddenly wouldn't take 
                 it anymore.  Something made her say 
                 enough is enough.  She hit back.  Tat 
                 only made it worse.  I watched as he hit 
                 her over and over.  Then he knocked her 
                 down the stairs.  She broke her neck.  
                 And when y father saw what he'd done - he 
                 finally became human.  He cried over her 
                 body for a while, then went into the 
                 garage and blew his brains out with a 
                 shotgun.  To this day I don't remember 
                 what that final straw was.  The shrinks 
                 say I've blocked it out of my memory.  
                 There's no one else alive who knows what 
                 really happened.  I have dreams about it 
                 sometimes, but there's always that blank 
                 spot.  A missing piece.

       She stops and closes her eyes.  Jacob closes his eyes for a 
       second also - feeling her pain.

       DIFFERENT ANGLE

       Jacob opens his eyes and touches Karen's arm.  She finally 
       turns to him.

                           JACOB
                 I'm sorry.

                           KAREN
                 I know nightmares are real, Jacob.  I 
                 know.

                           JACOB
                 So did my mom.  She taught me a lot about 
                 dreams.

                           KAREN
                 Like what?

                           JACOB
                 She told me that a lot of people have 
                 special dream powers.  I inherited some 
                 from her - and some I have all to myself.  
                 She showed me how I could link up with 
                 other people's dreams - to actually be 
                 inside with them.

                           KAREN
                 That sounds wonderful.  But...I don't 
                 know...

                           JACOB
                 A little hard to imagine, huh?

                           KAREN
                 Yeah.  I'm sorry.

                           JACOB
                 I can convince you.

                           KAREN
                 How?

                           JACOB
                 Easy.  We're doing it now.

       Jacob smiles, gets up and walks over to the bedroom door.  
       Karen is confused.

                           KAREN
                 What do you mean?

                           JACOB
                 I mean we're dreaming.  You and me.  
                 Together.

       He opens the bedroom door.  And there's a FOREST OUTSIDE.  
       Karen is a little scared at first, totally blown away by 
       what's happening.  But then she stands up and smiles.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Want to go for a walk?

       Karen steps up next to him and they walk through the doorway 
       into daylight.

       EXT. FOREST - DAY

       Shafts of sunlight filter through as leaves flutter down from 
       the towering trees and Jacob and Karen step out of the 
       bedroom door.

                           KAREN
                 I don't believe it.

                           JACOB
                 It's true.  We're really doing it.

                           KAREN
                 But what if I'm just dreaming of you 
                 telling me that?

                           JACOB
                 We'll compare notes when we wake up.  
                 Then you'll know.

       Karen looks around.  Then she giggles.  She likes this a lot.  
       Karen suddenly runs away into the trees like an excited 
       little girl.  Jacob frowns.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Karen.  Wait.

       He heads off after her.

       AMONGST THE TREES

       Jacob runs.  Karen jumps out from behind a tree and laughs.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 You have to be careful.

                           KAREN
                 Did you bring us here on purpose?  Can 
                 you go anywhere you want?

                           JACOB
                 Sometimes.  It's not as easy as linking 
                 up, though.

                           KAREN
                 Wow, I never knew...

       She starts wandering off again.  Jacob follows her.

                           KAREN (cont'd)
                 You know what I like to do in my dreams?

       She ducks behind a tree.  And comes out suddenly dressed as a 
       sharp BUSINESSWOMAN.  Jacob is slightly taken aback.

                           KAREN (cont'd)
                 I like to be other people!

       Jacob grins as she steps behind another tree - and a FIREMAN 
       walks out in her place.  Jacob is really taken aback this 
       time.

                           KAREN (cont'd) (as fireman)
                 I can be anybody I want.

                           JACOB
                 Show off.

       Karen slips past another trunk and comes out as a tall 
       VOLUPTUOUS REDHEAD.

                           KAREN (AS REDHEAD)
                 When things get bad it helps to be 
                 someone else.  I use it to protect 
                 myself.  

       The redhead walks seductively towards Jacob.  He raises his 
       eyebrows as she slinks right up next to him - her ample 
       cleavage inches away from his nose.

                           KAREN (cont'd) (as redhead)
                 What do you think?

                           JACOB
                 I think I like you the way you always 
                 are.

       He smiles.

       DIFFERENT ANGLE

       And now Karen is herself again.  They're still very close.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Much better.

       They look like they're about to kiss... but Karen suddenly 
       sees something that grabs her attention.

                           KAREN
                 Look!

       Jacob turns as Karen runs over to ANOTHER DOOR.  It's not the 
       one to the bedroom.  It just hangs there in space between two 
       trees.

                           KAREN (cont'd)
                 I wonder where it goes?

       She reaches for the knob and opens it.  

                           JACOB
                 Karen, no!

       But she's already stepped through.  Jacob runs up to the 
       doorway and it SLAMS in his face.  Jacob tries to open the 
       door.  It doesn't budge.  He keeps twisting the knob to no 
       effect.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Karen!

       Jacob starts to pound on the door as we:

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. KAREN'S HOME - KITCHEN

       Sixties style decore, appliances that look about twenty-five 
       years old -- not the Foster Home kitchen at all.  Karen is 
       standing in the middle of the room, completely disoriented.  
       She walks across to a counter top where she finds a framed 
       picture.

       It's a picture of HER, Karen, age thirteen.  Karen sets the 
       picture down and quickly walks back to the door she came in.

       INT. KAREN'S HOME - LOWER HALLWAY

       Karen steps out of her old kitchen expecting, hoping to be 
       back in the forest again.  Nope.  She blinks.  Then she 
       starts to walk down the corridor. 

       More pictures on the wall this time.  One of a WOMAN and 
       another of a MAN (Karen's MOM and DAD).

       Karen's sure of it now.  She's home.  The center of her worst 
       nightmares.  She creeps along to the main stairs.  And that's 
       when the NOISES begin.  A thumping from upstairs.  A CRASH, 
       like something hit the floor above.  More thumping, 
       repeatedly and then human MOANING, the sound of pain.

       Somebody is getting beaten.

                           KAREN
                 Oh no...

       Something is twisting deep inside the girl.  Her face goes 
       shallow as she slowly shuffles around to the foot of the 
       stairs...and starts to climb them.

       ON THE STAIRS

       Karen goes up, step by painful step, as the sounds of the 
       BEATING increase in their intensity.  Every hit seems to 
       touch Karen as she flinches.  She's afraid to go on - but 
       can't seem to stop.

       INT. KAREN'S HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

       Karen slowly heads for a door at the end, nervously reaches 
       out for the knob.

       INT. KAREN'S PARENT'S BEDROOM

       Karen opens the door.  What she thought she was going to see 
       was bad enough - but this is worse:

       Freddy Krueger is in the middle of the room.  In front of him 
       is a giant human-sized version of an inflatable punching 
       doll, the kind little kids hit that keep bouncing back.  But 
       the doll doesn't have the image of a clown on it.

       It's a flattened wrapped-around version of KAREN'S MOTHER, a 
       pitiful beat-up look on her plastic face.  

       Freddy SMACKS the doll - it falls to the floor - and just 
       bounces back up.  And now the face on it has a NEW BRUISE.

       THWACK!  He hits it again, CACKLING with glee.  Swoop, 
       bounce.  More bruises develop.  Krueger looks at Karen.

                           FREDDY
                 Welcome to Romper Room!

       BAP!  BOOOOING!  The face on the punching doll changes again, 
       it's even sadder now.  And it's looking at Karen.

                           KAREN
                 Why are you doing this?

                           FREDDY
                 Don't you remember?

       ZING!  Krueger whips up his finger knives.  SWOOP!  he RIPS 
       them through the plastic doll.  SISSSSSssss.  The doll starts 
       to deflate.  SKREEEEeeeee.  The escaping air sounding like a 
       human SCREAM.  Freddy turns to Karen.

       And a HAND reaches out from behind her and pulls her out of 
       the room.

       INT. KAREN'S HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

       Jacob pulls Karen away from the door and slams it shut. He 
       grabs her hand.

                           JACOB
                 Come on!

       They turn to run down the hallway, and it's CHANGED.  There 
       are now NO DOORS and NO STAIRWAY.  The only way out is the 
       bedroom door they just closed.  They stop and Jacob turns to 
       Karen.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Wake up!

                           KAREN
                 What?

                           JACOB
                 You heard me.  I said wake up!

                           KAREN
                 How?  This is my old house.  How did I 
                 get here? 

       He begins to shake her.  She is confused and disoriented.  A 
       CRASH is heard at the bedroom door.  FREDDY'S COMING.

       And Jacob HITS Karen.  Nothing major.  It's a good slap, 
       nonetheless.  She stares at him unbelievingly.  He WHACKS her 
       again.

                           KAREN (cont'd)
                 Why are you doing this to me?

                           JACOB
                 This is a dream!  You have to get out of 
                 here.  I'm not hurting you, only he can 
                 really do that!  Wake up now!

       SLAP!  Karen's getting angry.  She doesn't know what she's 
       supposed to do.  KA-BLAM!  Freddy blasts through the door in 
       a shower of splinters.  He sees them and grins.

                           FREDDY
                 Gettin' kinky, huh?

       Jacob turns to Karen, raises his hand.  KA-BLAM!  Something 
       blasts through the wall across from them.  It's POWER COP.

       CRASH!  The other wall explodes.  BLADE appears in the 
       rubble.

       BOOM!  A piece of wall falls down at the end of the corridor.  
       SOUND COP steps through.

       Karen looks at all this nonsense, then at Jacob.

                           KAREN
                 I think I get it now.

       She closes her eyes and DISAPPEARS out of Jacob's hands.  The 
       DREAM POLICE stand in the hallway.  Freddy just puts his 
       hands on his hips and LAUGHS at them.

       Then Krueger lays his arms flat on his sides, takes a deep 
       breath and begins to INFLATE.  His body expands, his clothes 
       and skin stretch and flatten.  The bottom half of him getting 
       fatter.

       He turns into a giant FREDDY PUNCHING DOLL.

       Power Cop jumps in front of the plastic horror and lets loose 
       a devastating swing.  POW!  The Freddy Doll swings back and 
       BOUNCES right up again. 

       POW POW POW POW POW!  The big Dream Cop pummels away at the 
       Krueger toy as it slaps back and forth between the floor and 
       his fist until SHINK!  Two knives appear in Blade's hands and 
       SWOOP.  She swings them out.

       RIP!  The Freddy Doll tears, air blasting out in a grating 
       SHRIEK which screeches and hisses until it becomes:

       Freddy's LAUGH.  The red and green plastic flutters to the 
       ground as the evil guffaws fade away and we:

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. KAREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

       Karen shakes Jacob awake.  His eyes open.  They stare at each 
       other for a few beats, then Karen frowns.

                           KAREN
                 You hit me.

                           JACOB
                 Are you hurt?

                           KAREN
                 Um...no.

                           JACOB
                 If he had done it, you'd be dead.  

       Karen is confused.  She doesn't know what to make of all 
       this.  She looks at a clock.  It's late.

                           KAREN
                 You better get back to your room.  We 
                 don't want anybody to get the wrong idea.

                           JACOB
                     (smirks)
                 Or the right one?

       Karen finally relaxes.  She smiles and playfully pushes him.

                           KAREN
                 Get out of here.

       Jacob reaches under a pillow and pulls something out.  It's 
       the framed photo of Karen, age thirteen - from her dream.  He 
       hands it to her and she looks at it in astonishment.

                           JACOB
                 That's something else my mom taught me.

       He gets up and goes to the door, turning back to her.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Don't sleep.

                           KAREN
                 No.  Not tonight.

       She holds the picture tightly- staring at it with those 
       faraway eyes.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - UPPER HALLWAY - NIGHT

       Scott comes out of the bathroom in his night clothes, the 
       toilet flushing in the B.G.  He goes into his room, but stops 
       at the doorway when he hears Karen's door open.

       Scott ducks behind his door as he watches Jacob leave Karen's 
       room and head for his own.  Scott frowns.  His is not 
       pleased.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

       David Ross is sifting through some mail when a heated 
       conversation in the kitchen catches his interest.  He stops 
       to listen.

       IN THE KITCHEN

       Karen is finally convinced, Jacob and Scott are looking like 
       they're ready to punch each other, and Gina looks scared.

                           KAREN
                 I'm telling you, this Freddy guy is for 
                 real.

                           SCOTT
                 And I'm telling you a dream is a dream.

                           KAREN
                 Jacob was in there with me.

                           SCOTT
                 And where else was he with you last 
                 night?

                           JACOB
                 What the hell is that supposed to mean?

                           KAREN
                 I have the picture in my room if you want 
                 to see it.  He brought it out from the 
                 nightmare.

                           SCOTT
                 Or from your hope chest.  I bet your bed 
                 isn't the only thing he's been into.

                           KAREN
                 That picture was destroyed years ago.

                           JACOB
                 You better watch your mouth, pal.

                           SCOTT
                 I'm the last person you want to start 
                 fucking with.

                           JACOB
                 Go ahead and be a tough guy, Scott.  
                 Krueger will cut you to pieces before you 
                 can even flex a muscle.

                           GINA
                 Will you two stop it!  You're scaring the 
                 shit out of me.

                           KAREN
                 You should be scared.

       Mr. Ross enters the room, none too pleased.

                           DAVID
                 Alright.  What's going on here?

                           SCOTT
                 Join the fun.  Jacob and Karen were just 
                 telling us about their new excuse to 
                 sleep together.

                           JACOB
                 Nothing happened between us last night.

                           SCOTT
                 You mean in plain old reality, right?

                           DAVID
                 Okay, everybody.  Out.  Jacob and I are 
                 going to have a little talk.  Now.

       Scott, Gina and Karen grudgingly leave the room.  David turns 
       to Jacob.

                           DAVID (cont'd)
                 Your days are numbered here, buster.

                           JACOB
                 I'm sorry, but...

                           DAVID
                 Hey, I don't know what kind of shit 
                 you're shoveling to these kids, but it's 
                 going to stop.  My Good Samaritan 
                 instincts have their limits.  We've had 
                 enough tragedy around this place.  We 
                 don't need you making things worse with 
                 fantasies.

                           JACOB
                 You don't understand

                           DAVID
                 And I want you to stay away from Karen.

       Jacob starts to get defiant. 

                           JACOB
                 It's a free country.

                           DAVID
                 This isn't America, it's my house.  I've 
                 been checking up on you.  You have no 
                 record with the police or the state or 
                 any of the runaway groups.  You're the 
                 invisible kid.  And if I sense even a 
                 little bit more trouble-making from you, 
                 you're going to vanish from here.  Got 
                 it?

                           JACOB
                 Yes, sir.

       David catches his breath.  He looks like he wants to say 
       more, but doesn't have the energy left.  He just walks out of 
       the room leaving a frustrated Jacob.

       EXT. FOSTER HOME - NIGHT

       Mr. and Mrs. Ross are getting into their car.  The engine 
       starts and they drive away.

       INT. JACOB'S ROOM - NIGHT

       Jacob sits in bed, staring into space.  Karen quietly enters 
       the room, carefully shutting the door behind her.

       She sits down next to him.  Jacob looks at her with weary 
       eyes.

                           JACOB
                 You're supposed to be off-limits to me.

                           KAREN
                 It's okay.  The Ross's have gone to a 
                 council meeting and Scott's in his room.  
                 We should be safe for awhile.

                           JACOB
                 Wonderful.

                           KAREN
                 Jacob, what are we going to do?

                           JACOB
                 I'm going to go to bed soon.

                           KAREN
                 Now you WANT to sleep?

                           JACOB
                 I have to find the Dream Police.  I think 
                 I'm somehow their link to all this.  They 
                 only seem to appear when I'm around.  You 
                 woke me up before I had a chance to talk 
                 to them last night.

                           KAREN
                 I'm sorry.  I was scared.

                           JACOB
                 your fault.  I have to ask them what 
                 we're supposed to do to help them.  And 
                 maybe I can protect Gina while I'm in 
                 there.

                           KAREN
                 What about Scott?

                           JACOB
                 He's on his own.

                           KAREN
                 Oh...

                           JACOB
                 I don't mean to be cold,but we've done 
                 everything to convince him.  Gina's too 
                 scared to understand.  I think Freddy 
                 will go after her next.

                           KAREN
                 What should I do?

                           JACOB
                 You have to stay awake.

                           KAREN
                 That's not going to be easy.  I'm half 
                 asleep already.

                           JACOB
                 You have to try.

       She nods her head quietly.  Then

                           KAREN
                 I'd better get out of here.

                           JACOB
                 Okay.  Be careful.

                           KAREN
                 YOU be careful.  I'm not going anywhere.

       She kisses him quickly on the cheek.  He needed that.  Karen 
       gets up and quietly leaves.  Jacob yawns

       INT. GINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

       Gina sits on her bed in her night clothes.  She holds a deck 
       of cards in one hand while she plays solitaire on her bed 
       sheets.

       She flips a card from her deck: A black nine.  She puts it on 
       top of a ten.  Another card.  Queen of diamonds.  She lays it 
       on top of a king of clubs.  Gina yawns.  Takes another card.

       It's the Freddy of Spades.

       Gina frowns.  Freddy Krueger's image stares up at her from 
       the card.  She looks at her stacks.  There's no place to put 
       this one.  She starts flipping through the deck of cards, 
       trying to see if there are any more Freddys.  That's when a 
       HAND RIPS UP through the bed and grabs her arm.  

       Gina SCREAMS, pulls away from the hand's grip and jumps back 
       up on the bed.  And ANOTHER HAND shoots up from a pillow and 
       grabs her shoulder.  Gina twists.

       RIP.  TEAR.  GRAB.  More hands appear out of the mattress, 
       lunging for any part of Gina's body as she SHRIEKS from their 
       touch.  And Gina jumps out of bed.

       She leaps to the other side of the room, bumping against her 
       dresser drawers.  Turns to her bed.

       SWOOP.  The multiple hands disappear down into the mattress.  
       There is a quiet beat as she catches her shivering breath.

       Then a half-dozen ARMS AND HANDS pop out from the drawers 
       next to her.  Latching indiscriminately.  Some grabbing her 
       legs and arms.  Some grabbing more intimate parts.

       Gina SCREAMS.  Pulls away from the dresser.  Yanks a few 
       drawers out as the hands vanish and she spins over to another 
       wall.

       Where the wall ERUPTS with outreaching arms all around her.  
       Two grab her hair.  Three on each arm.  Her legs are pinned.  
       Gina shrieks and yells and flays her arms.  Beating the hands 
       with her fists as two grabs her breasts viciously.  She 
       starts kicking as one particularly perverse hand BURNT AND 
       SCARRED, pops out between her legs.  Aiming right for her 
       crotch and in an incredible show of strength, the girl pulls 
       away from the horde.

       Gina heads for the door.  CRASH.  Hands blast up from the 
       wood floor.  She leaps around them.  CRASH.  More hands try 
       to block her way.

       Gina jumps around like she's in a mine field made of hot 
       coals.  She finally reaches to door and flings it open.

       INT. ELEVATOR

       Gina hits the lift's opposite wall having expected it to be a 
       hallway.  The elevator's doors close on her bedroom and she 
       turns to see:

       Freddy.  A razor finger poised over the elevator's buttons.  
       He smiles politely.

                           FREDDY
                 Going up?

       Gina is shocked and speechless.  She backs away into a corner 
       like someone trapped in a closet with the devil.  Which is 
       exactly what she is.

       Rising past the terror is Gina's realization that everything 
       Jacob's been saying is true.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 At your service.

       He punches one of the buttons and the elevator LURCHES.  Gina 
       grabs onto a wall as the lift races up and Freddy actually 
       begins to WHISTLE nonchalantly.

                           GINA
                 You're not real!

                           FREDDY
                 Ah, but who is?

       The elevator begins to slow.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Fourth floor.  Overpopulation.

       The elevator stops.  The doors begin to open.  Gina leaps for 
       the way out.  But she's blocked.

       Blocked by PEOPLE.  They fill the entrance to the lift and 
       start to pile in.  All kinds of people: businessmen, nurses, 
       plumbers.  And they're all ZOMBIES.

       Vacant expressions fill their dark hollow eyes as the zombies 
       keep coming in.  Pushing Gina back into the elevator.  
       Filling it to capacity and beyond.

       The doors close and the elevator starts to move up.  Twenty 
       bodies are crammed into the tiny enclosure, smashed together, 
       surrounding the poor teenager, drool oozing out of their 
       mouths, breathing down her neck.  SMASHING her so hard she 
       can't even yell for help.  Gina turns her head.

       WESLEY is pressed up next to her.  A very dead look on his 
       face.  Begin squeezed by the zombies around him.  One of his 
       eyes POPS out of its socket.

       Gina finds the breath to scream and scream and scream.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Eight floor - the morgue.  

       The elevator doors open and the mass of zombies starts to 
       spastically pile out.  Gina, having only been held up by the 
       crushing bodies, falls to her knees as the last of the 
       monsters exit the lift.  She breathes in ripping gasps like 
       she's having a coronary.  But she sees the open door.  And 
       Gina jumps for the exit.

       Freddy grabs her shoulder and pulls her back violently.  Gina 
       falls to the floor again as the doors shut.  Freddy waves his 
       fingers down the row of buttons and stops above the very 
       bottom one.  This button doesn't looks like the others.  

       It's in the shape of a little heart.

       Freddy turns and gives Gina a frighteningly serious look.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Time to go down, Gina.

       He presses the heart button.  And the floor disappears.  Gina 
       falls SCREAMING into blackness as Freddy hangs in mid-air and 
       LAUGHS.  

       INT. HONEYMOON SUITE

       Gaudy colors, mirrors, a cheesy heart-shaped bed.  Gina's 
       body drops down, unexpectedly softly, landing on the fluffy 
       satin sheets.

       she's dressed in a skimpy piece of bright pink LINGERIE.  She 
       moans and tries to sit up.

       And four snake-like strips of satin swoop out from under the 
       bed and quickly wrap around each of her limbs, pulling her 
       down and yank her tight.

       She's trapped.  That's when the door to the room opens and in 
       walks an incredibly huge FAT MAN.  He barely fits through the 
       door as he closes it behind him.  Puffy cheeks, permanent 
       seat, dirty fingernails, and a lecherous smile.

       Gina's eyes widen.

                           FAT MAN
                 Hi there, princess.  Your mom's told me 
                 all about you.

       Gina SCREAMS as he approaches her, the ground actually 
       shaking from his weight.

                           FAT MAN (cont'd)
                 She said you're even better than she is.

       He looms above her, now.  Starts to unbutton his shirt to 
       reveal a hideous mound of hairy stomach flesh.  Gina is 
       repulsed.

                           FAT MAN (cont'd)
                 Aw, come on.  I'm really a nice guy.  You 
                 know what they say.  Inside every fat 
                 person...

       RIP! Krueger's finger blades JUT out of the abdomen ad start 
       tearing a huge SLIT up the front of his body.  The Fat Man 
       starts to fold back as Freddy's head pops out of the front.

                           FREDDY
                 ...is a maniac trying to get out!

       Freddy steps out of the Fat Man, sluffing the bulbous remains 
       aside.  He towers over Gina.  That creepy serious look on his 
       face again.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Now it's time for YOU to put out, Gina.

       Gina gasps in horror as Krueger moves in.  But then a KNOCK 
       at the door.  

                           ROOM SERVICE (O.S.)
                 Room service?

                           FREDDY
                 Huh?  I didn't order anything...

       Freddy frowns and walks over to the door.  He turns back to 
       Gina. 

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Maybe its complimentary champagne!

       Krueger opens the door.  On the other side is a dinner cart 
       and a waiter behind it.  The waiter is JACOB.

       CRASH!  Jacob shoves the dinner cart into the room and into 
       Freddy's gut, shoving Krueger across the room into a tumbled 
       heap.  Three EXPLOSIONS OF LIGHT BURST into the room.  The 
       Dream Police materialize.

       Freddy jumps up growling.  Power Cop grabs him from behind.  
       Blade leaps over to the bed and in a FLASH of steel, releases 
       Gina from her satin bonds.  Jacob yanks Gina off the bed and 
       pulls her towards the door.

                           JACOB
                 Come on!

       Freddy jumps out of Power Cop's grip and the Dream Police 
       surround him as the two teenagers bolt out of the room.

       INT. HOTEL HALLWAY

       Jacob pulls Gina along as the hotel room door SLAMS shut by 
       itself.  Gina yells at Jacob.

                           GINA
                 Let go of me!

       She squirms out of Jacob's grip and bounces away from him 
       like he has the plague.  CRASHING is heard from the hotel 
       room.  A violent battle is under way.  Jacob pleads with 
       Gina.

                           JACOB
                 I'm here to help!

       He holds out his hand to her.  Gina shivers, than looks into 
       Jacob's sincere eyes.  SOUNDS of destruction continue behind 
       the door as the girl battles with her worst fear.  Finally 
       Gina takes Jacob's hand.

                           GINA
                 Let's get out of here.

       They start running down the corridor - together.

       INT. HONEYMOON SUITE

       The entire room is filled with SWIRLING DUST and SMOKE, 
       completely obscuring everything from sight.  As the sound of 
       BREAKING FURNITURE and grunting fighters echoes, a few pieces 
       of debris bounce into view.

       And then there is SILENCE.

       The dust settles and the smoke dissipates.  The DREAM POLICE 
       stand alone in the rubble of a totally trashed room.

                           POWER COP
                 Where'd he go?

                           SOUND COP
                 I thought you had him. 

                           BLADE COP
                 Shit...

       Krueger has escaped.

       HOTEL CORRIDOR

       Jacob runs, Gina trailing behind him, the two of them trying 
       to find a way out.  They pass a door.

       The door SLAMS open and Freddy reaches out, grabs Gina and 
       yanks her into the room.  The door BANGS shut.

       Jacob twirls around and runs towards the door.

       And the door DISAPPEARS.  Nothing but flat wall remains as 
       Jacob hits it.  He starts banging his fist against the side 
       of the corridor.

                           JACOB
                 No no no no!

       The Dream police run up next to him.  Jacob spins around 
       angry.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 He's got Gina!

                           SOUND COP
                 Stand back.

       Everyone backs off.  Sound Cop opens his mouth.  BOOM!  An 
       almost visible sound wave bursts forth from his lips and 
       CRACK, a huge hole is punched in the wall.

       The Police leap into the hole, quickly followed by Jacob.

       INT. HOTEL ROOM

       This one's pretty normal.  Maybe the business suite.  And 
       it's EMPTY except for a heart-shaped box of candy in the 
       middle of the bed.  Jacob and the rest of the Police watch as 
       Blade picks up the box and opens it.  Dozens of COCKROACHES 
       pour out onto the floor.  Now Jacob's really pissed.

                           JACOB
                 You let him get away!

                           SOUND COP
                 It's difficult.

                           POWER COP
                 He's been at this longer than we have.

                           BLADE COP
                 He can do anything.

                           SOUND COP
                 But we have to catch him in the act to 
                 get him.

                           JACOB
                 What...there are rules to all this?

                           SOUND COP
                 They're not rules.

                           POWER COP
                 It's just the way it is.

                           BLADE COP
                 Jacob, we need you to bring the rest 
                 together.

                           JACOB
                 The rest?  You mean the kids at the home?

                           BLADE COP
                 Yes.  We need as many of you as we can 
                 get.  And you must bring them to 
                 Springwood.

                           JACOB
                 How?

                           BLADE COP
                 You have the power to link your dreams 
                 with other's.  Dream of Springwood, then 
                 bring the rest with you.

                           SOUND COP
                 Living souls are what he thrives on.  
                 Living souls are what we need to help 
                 stop him.

                           POWER COP
                 Before it's too late.

                           BLADE COP
                 Before he takes everyone.

                           SOUND COP
                 And every THING.

       Jacob just shakes his head.

       INT. LIMBO

       All is BLACK.  Except for Freddy and Gina.  He has her from 
       behind, his hands locked on her shoulders.

                           FREDDY
                 Ah...alone at last.

       Gina cries horribly like a person who knows death is seconds 
       away.  Freddy wraps his arms around her, hugging her.

       And he KEEPS wrapping his arms.  They STRETCH and elongate, 
       wrapping once around his body and then around her's again.

       And then again.  Freddy's rubber limbs curl around and around 
       an around Gina's quivering body.  Spiraling up and down.  
       Encircling on all sides on every part of her, touching and 
       grabbing her EVERYWHERE.

       Until Krueger's arms cover her entirely.  Gina whimpers.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Touching, isn't it?

       And he starts to SQUEEZE.  Gina gags as Freddy's snake-like 
       embrace TIGHTENS around her, draining the life out of Gina's 
       body.

       INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

       Jacob wakes with a start as the entire house around him 
       shakes.

                           JACOB
                 Gina!

       Jacob jumps out of bed.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - UPPER HALLWAY

       Jacob dashes down the corridor.  Karen comes out of her room.

                           KAREN
                 Is it an earthquake?

                           JACOB
                 No.  It's Freddy.

       They run to Gina's room and fling the door open.

       INT. GINA'S BEDROOM

       The RUMBLING of the house has stopped.  Gina's in bed, her 
       tongue sticking grotesquely out from the corner of her mouth, 
       her skin completely blue.  Jacob and Karen run to her to try 
       and help.

       Gina's already dead.  But Freddy's not quite done with her 
       yet.  Jacob and Karen watch as Gina's chest CAVES IN.  Karen 
       SCREAMS.

       EXT. FOSTER HOME - EARLY MORNING

       The coroner's back, the neighborhood gawks.  Jacob, Karen and 
       Scott sit on the front steps in a daze.

       But this time there are police barricades up.  In another 
       part of the front yard we can see Mr. and Mrs. Ross with a 
       social worker, MR. SILVERMAN.  Mary Ross is crying while her 
       husband David is having a heated argument with Silverman.

       The kids watch on gloomily.

       The social worker leaves as Mr. Ross walks over to the kids.  
       Mary walks right by them and into the house - to broken up 
       over something to talk.

                           DAVID
                 Pack your bags, kids.

                           JACOB
                 You're kicking us out?

                           DAVID
                 No.  They're taking you away.  They say 
                 it's for your own good.

                           KAREN
                 They can't do that.

                           DAVID
                 Yes, they can.  They consider Mary and I 
                 possibly unfit to act as foster parents.  
                 They're going to find temporary homes for 
                 you until this mess is straightened out.  
                 I'm so very sorry.

       Karen runs up to David and hugs him desperately.  He holds 
       her.

                           KAREN
                 No, please.

                           DAVID
                 They're not calling it an accident this 
                 time.  They don't really know what to 
                 call it.

       Karen lets go.  Scott stands up.

                           SCOTT
                 What's going to happen to us?

                           DAVID
                 You'll be alright.

                           KAREN
                 What's going to happen to you?

                           DAVID
                 I don't know.  They're thinking of 
                 pressing charges.  

                           JACOB
                 Aw, Jesus...

                           DAVID
                 Come on.  A car from juvenile hall will 
                 be here in an hour.

       He leads them up the stairs.

       EXT. JUVENILE HALL - DAY

       A sign reads: ROSEDALE YOUTH CENTER.

       INT. OFFICE - DAY

       Mr. Silverman, the social worker, is talking to the 
       teenagers.  Karen and Scott look understandably worried.  
       Jacob looks like the world just ended for him.

                           MR. SILVERMAN
                 I'm sure most of you know how this works 
                 already.  You'll be assigned new foster 
                 homes tomorrow afternoon.  Tomorrow 
                 morning the police will be talking to you 
                 regarding the matter at the old house.

                           KAREN
                 What about it?

                           MR. SILVERMAN
                 Anything you know.

                           SCOTT
                 Are we considered suspects?

                           MR. SILVERMAN
                 You'll talk to the police about that.  
                 Don't worry.  We'll all try and work this 
                 out.

                           KAREN
                 Will we be able to go back to the Ross's?

                           MR. SILVERMAN
                 I don't know.  You'll have a place to 
                 stay in the mean time.

                           KAREN
                 Will we be together?

                           MR. SILVERMAN
                 No.  We don't have anybody willing to 
                 take more than one person.  I'm afraid 
                 you'll be split up.

                           SCOTT
                 Great...

                           MR. SILVERMAN
                 Hey, you can visit each other.  You'll be 
                 in the same town.

                           JACOB
                 If it's still here.

       Silverman frowns at that last comment as the kids get up to 
       leave.

       INT. JUVENILE HALL CORRIDOR

       The teenagers walk glumly out of the office.  Jacob is still 
       strangely silent, not making eye contact with anyone.

                           KAREN
                 Jacob, what are we going to do?

                           JACOB
                 Nothing.

                           KAREN
                 What do you mean, nothing?

                           JACOB
                 It's over.  We're finished.  He's won.

       Jacob walks on ahead of them.  Karen is flabbergasted.  She 
       stops and just stands there with Scott.  The two of them 
       watching Jacob walk away.

                           SCOTT
                 Looks like your hero just gave up.

       And Karen still can't believe it.

       EXT. JUVENILE HALL COURTYARD - DUSK

       Jacob is sitting on a bench looking like a beaten man and 
       hating himself for it.

       Karen and Scott step out of a door.  They watch him for a few 
       seconds.  Then Karen walks towards Jacob.  Scott stays behind 
       and lights up a cigarette.

                           KAREN
                 How can you do this?

                           JACOB
                 Do what?  I'm not doing anything.

                           KAREN
                 Exactly.  After all we've been through 
                 you just throw in the towel.  Why?

                           JACOB
                 Because we're fucked.  The last thing the 
                 Dream Police told me was that they needed 
                 all our help.  Together.  Even if we 
                 weren't about to be split up there aren't 
                 enough of us left to make a difference.

                           KAREN
                 How do you know that?

                           JACOB
                 I don't.  But, it's all just too much.  
                 I've tried so hard and nothing's worked.  
                 I'm spent.  I'm wasted.  I'm...I'm so 
                 tired.

       Jacob puts his face in his hands.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 I've had enough.

                           KAREN
                 So you're just going to give up?  I'll 
                 bet that's something your mother never 
                 taught you.

       That hit home.  Jacob uncovers his face.  His ID bracelet 
       dangles from his wrist.  He looks at the bracelet.  ALICE 
       glints in the setting sunlight.  He remembers.  Jacob looks 
       up at Karen.

                           KAREN (cont'd)
                 We still have one night together.

                           JACOB
                 And we're not going to waste it.

       Jacob stands up.

       INT. JUVENILE HALL LOUNGE - NIGHT

       Jacob paces back and forth in front of Scott and Karen.

                           KAREN
                 Scott, we need you.

                           SCOTT
                 Look, I don't know what's going on 
                 anymore.  Two of my friends die and now 
                 you tell me I have to drop into dreamland 
                 with you guys to do battle with the dude 
                 that did it.

                           JACOB
                 We'll have help.

                           SCOTT
                 Ah, yes.  I almost forgot.  The Sleepy 
                 Squad.  Alright.  I'll make you a deal.  
                 I told you I wouldn't believe this stuff 
                 unless I saw it.  If I understand this 
                 correctly, all I have to do is fall 
                 asleep and you just whisk me into the 
                 action.

                           JACOB
                 Right.

                           SCOTT
                 Okay.  If that happens, if both of you 
                 show up in my dream, I'll help you out.  
                 If nothing happens, then I'll get a good 
                 night's sleep and laugh at you in the 
                 morning.

                           JACOB
                 Fine.  You got a deal.  And you won't be 
                 disappointed.

                           KAREN
                 I'm going to be sleeping in the girl's 
                 dorm.  Will you be able to bring me in?

                           JACOB
                 I hope so.  Then I got to make sure we 
                 all end up in Springwood.

                           SCOTT
                 The old stomping ground?

                           JACOB
                 Yeah.  Only right now it's not a very 
                 pretty place.

                           KAREN
                 What do we do when we get there?

                           JACOB
                 Play it by ear.  And try and stay alive.

       A SOCIAL WORKER sticks his head into the lounge.

                           SOCIAL WORKER
                 Half hour til lights out, everyone.

       The kids get up and start for the door.

                           JACOB
                 Off we go.

                           SCOTT
                 Into the wild black yonder.

       Scott shakes his head as they leave.

       INT. KAREN'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

       Karen lies in bed, under the covers.  She holds the picture 
       of herself, thirteen years old.  She stares at it.  Still 
       that missing piece.

       Karen puts the picture on a nightstand and closes her eyes.

       INT. SCOTT & JACOB'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

       Scott lies on the top of a set of bunk beds.  Jacob is on the 
       bottom and already looks asleep.

       ON SCOTT

       He's still awake.  Maybe he's starting to believe some of 
       Jacob's ramblings, because he nervously fidgets in bed.

                           SCOTT
                 Freddy Krueger.  Yeah, right.  Years ago 
                 some sicko gets fried and now he comes 
                 back to stick it to you when you're 
                 snoozing.  Stupid bedtime story.

       he sighs, looks at his wrist, but his watch isn't on.  Then:

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 Hey, Mr. Creepoid, you still up?
                     (a beat)
                 Yo, Jacob?

       There's still no answer.  Scott rolls and peeks over the edge 
       of the bunk bed.  And Jacob's not there.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 Huh?

       Scott sits up, looks around.  And FALLS right through the 
       middle of his bed, NOT appearing underneath the top bunk.  He 
       just disappears.

       EXT. NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD - SOUTH STREET - NIGHT

       Scott falls out of a tree and lands with a THUD.  He groans, 
       slowly gets to his feet and takes in his surroundings.

       The road is dark and desolate.  The street lights emit a grim 
       brown glow and there are no stars or moon in the sky.

       SOUNDS echo through the trees and buildings.  Weird MOANS, 
       odd GURGLINGS, eerie WHISPERS, and an occasional unearthly 
       HOWL.

       This does not comfort Scott.

                           SCOTT
                 Oh, this is lovely.

       He starts cautiously walking down the sidewalk.  SOMETHING 
       flies by with a FLAPPING.  Scott ducks.  Was it a bird or a 
       bat or what?  It's already gone.

       Then a craggy voice calls out from behind a tree.

                           BUM
                 Hey, buddy?

                           SCOTT
                 Yeah, what?

       Scott is understandably jumpy.  The dark figure of a BUM 
       starts walking towards him.  Scott backs away.

                           BUM
                 Can you spare some change?

                           SCOTT
                 Um, well, let me see...

       Scott starts sifting through his pockets, and the BUM steps 
       out into the light.

       He has THREE EYES and a HUMP BACK.  Scott YELPS.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 Holy Jesus Christ.

       The Bum grins and Scott starts stumbling away, his voice 
       trailing off:

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 I'll catch you next time, buddy.

       The mutant bum belches.

       EXT. NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD - PARNELL AVE. - NIGHT

       Karen rounds a corner.  She walks nervously down the middle 
       of the street.  There are no cars, and she wants to keep as 
       far away as possible from the houses on either side. 

       There is a CREAKING sound from one of those houses.  Karen 
       turns her head to look.

       A craggy OLD WOMAN is rocking back and forth on her front 
       porch.  She's eating something, something stringy and slimy.  
       She munches away with a vacant look in her eyes.

       The something in her hands MOVES slightly.  The old woman's 
       meal is still alive.

       Karen gags and walks faster.  And a PANTING sound is heard, 
       like two dogs.  Someone is walking their pet down the 
       sidewalk.  

       It's the MUTANT WOMAN from Jacob's opening nightmare: 
       straggly hair, oozing sores, limping.  The source of the 
       multiple paintings is her single dog, all two heads of it.

       The mutant woman waves unpleasantly at Karen.  Karen whimpers 
       and starts to RUN.

       WITH KAREN - RUNNING

       She stumbles quickly down the street.  We catch fleeting 
       glimpses of other horrors, twisted shapes, bent shadows.  

       Karen rounds a corner, and SCREAMS when she bumps into 
       someone.  It's Scott, out of breath from his own sprinting.

                           KAREN
                 Scott!  You're here.

                           SCOTT
                 Yeah.  Fun town.  Talk to any of the 
                 neighbors, yet? They're a swell bunch of 
                 folks.  

                           KAREN
                 Uh-huh.  Real friendly, too.

                           SCOTT
                 So this is a dream?

                           KAREN
                 And I'm in it with you.  Convinced?

                           SCOTT
                 Maybe I'm just dreaming bout being here 
                 with you.  Wouldn't be the first time.

                           KAREN
                 Nope.  I tired that one already.  Doesn't 
                 work.  Come on, we have to find Jacob.

       Scott nods and they take off down the street.  A cat with 
       three tails slithers by.

       EXT. NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD - MAIN STREET - NIGHT

       Jacob is standing motionless in the middle of the road.  He 
       stares down into the darkness, a wooden expression on his 
       face.

       Karen and Scott are running up behind him.

                           KAREN
                 Jacob!  Thank God!

                           SCOTT
                 So this is the place, huh?

       Jacob's eyes are steady.  He hasn't yet acknowledged the 
       other's presence.  He eyes are fixed on the gloominess in 
       front of him.  A look of vengeance beginning to grow as our 
       SHOT MOVES IN on him.

                           JACOB
                 I'm home.

       Karen and Scott are next to him now.  They stand silently 
       with Jacob for a few seconds.  Then:

                           KAREN
                 What now?

                           JACOB
                 Scott, are you with us?

                           SCOTT
                 A deal's a deal.

                           JACOB
                 Then we wait.

       And not for long.  FLASH!  In three bursts the Dream Police 
       appear directly across from the teenagers.  Scott and Karen 
       jump back.  Jacob hold his ground.

                           SCOTT
                 Whoa!

       The threesomes stand face-to-face in two parallel rows.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 Nice outfits.

                           POWER COP
                 Is this all?

                           JACOB
                 All that's left.

                           SOUND COP
                 It'll have to do.

                           SCOTT
                 We can always come back later.  Like when 
                 it's daytime.

                           POWER COP
                 It's always night here.

                           JACOB
                 What's the plan?

                           BLADE COP
                 We need you to draw him out.

                           SCOTT
                 Terrific.  We're supposed to be bait.

                           SOUND COP
                 Essentially.

                           JACOB
                 Then let's do it.

       KABOOOOOOOOM!  A huge BRICK WALL, ten feet high and spreading 
       out across the street and through the houses, BLASTS up from 
       the asphalt.  Right between the Police and the kids.

       ON THE DREAM POLICE SIDE

       The three cops crouch into battle positions.

       ON THE TEENAGER'S SIDE

       The three of them have hardly any time to react before three 
       perfectly round HOLES open up underneath each of them.

       And Scott, Jacob and Karen fall into darkness.

       ON THE DREAM POLICE SIDE

       Sound Cop stands up and his body begins to VIBRATE.  A new 
       noise emits from his mouth: a HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL.

       And like the walls of Jericho, the bricks in front of them 
       fall apart and tumble to the ground.  Dust settles and the 
       Police walk over the rubble to the other side.  The kids are 
       gone.

                           BLADE COP
                 Fan out.

       The Dream Police break formation and scatter.

       EXT. A STREET

       A hole opens up in the road and WHOOSH, KAREN is elevated up 
       into the scene and the hole seals up instantly.

       She jumps  a few feet and drops to her knees, holding onto 
       the ground.  She looks up at a street sign.  It reads: ELM 
       ST.  Karen stands up and heads down the road.

       EXT. ROCHESTER AVE.

       Another hole, and VOOM, Jacob is shot up into the street.  He 
       spins around, trying to get his bearings.  It doesn't take 
       him long.  He knows exactly where he is.

                           JACOB
                 Oh no...

       He starts to run and we FOLLOW him.

       Jacob jumps over a procession of RATS making their way across 
       the street and just keeps on sprinting.  Until he reaches a 
       certain house.  He catches his breath as he looks at the 
       building, pain registering on his face.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Mom...

       Jacob runs towards the house as our shot MOVES IN CLOSE to 
       the mailbox and ate name printed across it.  It reads 
       JOHNSON.

       INT. NIGHTMARE JOHNSON HOME - ENTRYWAY

       Jacob bursts through the door.  He turns on a light switch.  
       A lamp SPUTTERS into semi-life, and keeps sputtering, casting 
       a candle-like glow over the interior.  

       Cobwebs and dust cover everything.  Rats and tarantula 
       spiders skitter about.  Jacob grits his teeth and walks in 
       deeper.

       EXT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

       Scott BLASTS out of the asphalt.  He staggers for a few 
       seconds from the ride, then looks at the building in front of 
       him.  A puttering neon sign, ÔSPRINGWOOD TAVERN', marks the 
       local saloon.  Muffled MUSIC and VOICES seep through the 
       cracks of the double doors. 

       Scott looks around, then shrugs.  He heads for the entrance.

       INT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

       Dump is too clean a word, dive is too nice, abomination is 
       more like it.  A greenish haze covers everything.  Instead of 
       sawdust on the floor there is a collection of debris that 
       looks like a compilation of human teeth, crushed bugs, and 
       pools of unmentionable goo.

       Then there's the people.

       Imagine any profanity, any obscenity,any blasphemy, add them 
       all up - then double them.  It wouldn't even come close to 
       the patrons of this joint.

       They dance, they yell, they drink bloody bubbling mixtures.  
       There's a guy to the right that doesn't seem to mind that 
       half his brain is showing.  That girl over there has no jaw.  
       In a booth is a couple that are connected at the lips.  A 
       ventriloquist on stage is entertaining the troops with his 
       hand up the back of a real body.

       Scott steps through the door and blinks about a dozen times. 
       Then he decides that the smart course of action is to turn 
       around and go right back out.

       A MUTANT BOUNCER, half his face a skull, blocks Scott's way.

                           MUTANT BOUNCER
                 Two drink minimum.

                           SCOTT
                 Ah, that's okay.  I think I'm underage, 
                 anyway.

                           MUTANT BOUNCER
                 Two drink minimum.

                           SCOTT
                 No, really.  I'm driving.

                           MUTANT BOUNCER
                 Two drink minimum.

       The bouncer with the limited vocabulary seems adamant.  Scott 
       backs off and turns around.  He carefully moves forward.  A 
       MUTANT WAITRESS with three breasts slips next to him.

                           MUTANT WAITRESS
                 Can I get you anything?

                           SCOTT
                 That's okay.  I'll just sit at the bar.

                           MUTANT WAITRESS
                 Alright, honey.  You call if you need 
                 anything.

                           SCOTT
                 You bet.  You'll be the first to know.

       Scott turns away, trying to keep his eyes in their sockets.  
       He slides up to the bar next to a MUTANT BUSINESSMAN.  The 
       man's head is on backwards, his arms lean on the bar while 
       his face looks out into the crowd.  He has to twist his neck 
       to sip his vile drink.

       A BARTENDER, surprisingly normal-looking, steps up to Scott.

                           BARTENDER
                 What'll it be?

                           SCOTT
                 Um, a beer, I guess.

       The bartender fills a twisted glass with a sickly brown 
       liquid.  Chunks of matter float amongst the foam.  Scott 
       takes the drink warily and looks up at the businessman next 
       to him.  The mutant smiles at him.

                           BARTENDER
                 Go on.  Puts hair on your back.

                           SCOTT
                 And that's all?

       The bartender returns.  Holds one of those half pineapple 
       type drinks in his hand, except this one has the back end of 
       a wriggling lizard sticking out of mucousy fluid under a tiny 
       umbrella.  He gives it to Scott.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 That's okay, this'll be plenty.

                           BARTENDER
                 No charge.  Compliments of the man at the 
                 end of the bar.

       The bartender walks away and Scott cranes his head to look 
       down the bar.

       SCOTT'S POV

       The crowd blocks his view, but we can see a gloved hand with 
       four blades strapped to it tapping nonchalantly on the 
       surface of the wood.

       BACK TO SCOTT

       He picks up his drinks, holding the moving one at arm's 
       length, and heads down the bar.

       AT THE END OF THE BAR

       sits Freddy Krueger.  He sips coolly on some hideous 
       concoction as Scott sits down in the chair next to him and 
       lights a cigarette, trying to look equally cool.

                           FREDDY
                 Welcome to my favorite haunt.

                           SCOTT
                 So you're the man.

                           FREDDY
                 At your service.

                           SCOTT
                 What's on your mind?

                           FREDDY
                 A deal.

                           SCOTT
                 A deal's what got me into this.

                           FREDDY
                 Bring Jacob to me.

       Scott, valiantly holding on to his nerve, raises an eyebrow.

                           SCOTT
                 What's in it for me?

                           FREDDY
                 Power.  You don't need to hang out with 
                 those losers. You're a take-charge kind 
                 of guy, Scott.  Like when you took charge 
                 of your father.

       Suddenly Freddy is spinning a gun on the bar with his free 
       hand.  Scott grimaces.

                           SCOTT
                 Leave my father out of this.

                           FREDDY
                 I'll make you mayor of Rosedale.

                           SCOTT
                 After you make it look like this?

                           FREDDY
                 You can have Karen.

       That was Freddy's trump card.  It really hits a nerve in 
       Scott.  Karen's everything he's ever wanted.

                           SCOTT
                 Alive?

                           FREDDY
                 Any way you want her.

                           SCOTT
                     (after a beat)
                 Okay.

                           FREDDY
                 Shake?

       Krueger holds out his knives.  Scott shakes his head.

                           SCOTT
                 No thanks.  I trust you.

       Freddy laughs.

       INT. NIGHTMARE JOHNSON HOME - ALICE'S BEDROOM

       Jacob opens the door into darkness.

                           JACOB
                 Mother?

       He turns on the light and a RED HAZE blankets the room.  
       Jacob looks up.  The dish-like ceiling lamp is filled with 
       blood.

       Jacob walks into the room, tears welling.  He walks by 
       Alice's vanity, her makeup still sitting there as if she 
       might show up and use it at any moment.

       He steps up to a wardrobe closet and touches the edges of it 
       lightly.  He reaches out and slowly, almost reverently, opens 
       the doors. 

       Dozens of writhing SNAKES drop out of the closet and slither 
       onto the ground.

       Jacob jumps back and SCREAMS.

       Then he just stands there in the middle of the teaming 
       reptile mass, not giving a shit anymore, going insane.  His 
       fists clenched, his head tilted back, as he YELLS into the 
       air like a wolf baying at the moon.

       EXT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

       Scott steps off the sidewalk and looks up and down the 
       street.  He thinks and we MOVE IN on him.

                           SCOTT
                 Mayor of Rosedale.

       Scott sneers.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 What a crock of shit.

       We PULL WIDER as Scott cups his hands around his mouth.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 Hey!  He's over here.  Yo!  Dream Police.  
                 Hello!  Come on.  Move you collective 
                 asses.

       CLOSE ON SCOTT

       He puts his hands on his hips and sighs.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 Never a cop around when you need one.

       GLITCH! a stabbing sound of flesh, and Scott JERKS violently 
       as our shot PULLS BACK to reveal:

       Freddy behind Scott, his deadly fingers buried in the boy's 
       back.  Scott chokes on his own blood as Krueger growls.

                           FREDDY
                 I hate a snitch!

       Freddy pulls out his blades as Scott falls forward and with 
       his final breath utters:

                           SCOTT
                 Eat shit...

       His body hits the ground with a THUD as a sudden ROAR fills 
       the air.  Freddy looks around for its source.  And Sound Cop 
       drops down on him with a SMACK.

       The two of them tumble, then both jump up. Freddy laughs.  
       Sound Cop looks down at Scott's body, then back up at 
       Krueger.  His body is shaking with fury,and he opens his 
       mouth.

       The loudest sound yet comes from Sound Cop.  KABOOM!  A blast 
       of air at Mach 3 smacks into Freddy and sends him sailing 
       back, SMASHING right through the Tavern wall.

       INT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

       Freddy flies sideways, right through the bar, destroying 
       chandeliers as he careens through and punches yet another 
       huge hole through the opposite wall.

       The nightmarish customers don't even seem to notice.

       INT. NIGHTMARE JOHNSON HOME - ENTRYWAY

       Jacob is shuffling down the stairs as a SONIC BOOM of noise 
       echoes through the streets outside.

       He knows exactly what that sound means as we MOVE IN on his 
       face.

                           JACOB
                 Krueger...

       Jacob races for the front door.

       INT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

       The dust is just starting to settle as a THUD is heard coming 
       from the hole in the opposite wall.  Quickly followed by 
       Freddy's soaring body.  Krueger SMASHES into some tables and 
       slides across the floor.  Power Cop steps through the hole, 
       his fists clenched.  Freddy stands up and dusts himself off.

                           FREDDY
                 Lighten up, bone brain.

       Power Cop has no intention to.  He bolts over, grabs Krueger, 
       raises him over his head like a wrestler, slams him down on 
       the bar, and SHOVES Freddy, knocking glasses and ashtrays 
       aside until he SMACKS into yet another poor wall.

       Krueger barely gets back on his feet when Power Cop is right 
       on him again.  The big man in black SWINGS, but this time 
       Freddy DUCKS.  CRACK! a support column bursts into dust.  
       Freddy twirls around.  And the two of them start to PUNCH 
       each other.

       It's a barroom brawl between non-humans as Power Cop and 
       Freddy Krueger exchange multiple blows.

       SMACK SMACK SMACK!  Freddy nails Power Cop, whose head barely 
       seems to budge from the hits.

       POW POW POW!  Power Cop lays into Krueger, sending him 
       spinning and tumbling only to pick him up and start the 
       process all over again.

       This goes on for a while, and Krueger is losing.

       The mutant bouncer finally steps up to Power Cop to try and 
       put a stop to all this.

                           MUTANT BOUNCER
                 Take it outside!

       CRUNCH!  Power Cop puts a stop to the bouncer with a vicious 
       elbow in the chest.  All this gave Freddy a few seconds to 
       grab a chair and crack it ineffectually over the Cop's head.  
       The pummeling begins again.

       THWACK THWACK THWACK!  Power Cop is punching Freddy towards 
       the door.

       EXT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

       Like in an old wester, Krueger flies out of the double doors 
       and somersaults onto the pavement.  Sound Cop is a few yards 
       away knelt down next to Scott's dead body.  He looks up as 
       Freddy sneers.

                           FREDDY
                 No more playing around.

       Freddy raises his left fist and it begins to EXPAND.  It 
       grows like an inflated beach ball, except it doesn't look 
       soft at all.  Freddy slides up to the side of the entrance, 
       and raises his giant hammer hand.  Power Cop steps through, 
       looking for blood.  Sound Cop tries to warn him.

                           SOUND COP
                 Kincaid!

       Too late.  BAM!  Freddy's fist slams down on Power Cop's 
       head.  He's actually shoved down into the ground a full two 
       feet - trapped at the legs.

       BAM!  Freddy hits him again.  Power Cop is down to his thighs 
       and he can't get out.

       A RUMBLING is heard.  Freddy turns to see Sound Cop starting 
       to open his mouth.  Krueger instantly reaches down and grabs 
       a brick from the rubble and THROWS it at Sound Cop.

                           FREDDY
                 Put a lid on it!

       THUNK!  The brick lands squarely in Sound Cop's mouth, 
       stretching it painfully and blocking it completely.  Sound 
       Cop reels from the impact.  Tries to pull out the firmly 
       wedged plug.

       Freddy turns back to Power Cop, BAM!  Hits him down to his 
       hips.  The giant fist swings, BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM! like 
       hammering a nail until Power Cop DISAPPEARS into the ground.

       Freddy's hand deflates to regular size as he turns to the 
       struggling Sound Cop.

       Sound Cop's head is EXPANDING.  Pressure seems to be building 
       up, something's gonna blow.  Freddy picks up a boulder from 
       the street rubble.  He catapults it with both hands at Sound 
       Cop.  The boulder hits Sound Cop's head and takes it CLEAN 
       OFF.

       Sound Cop's decapitated skull tumbles away with the brick 
       still stuck, as a blast of air shoots up from the stump of 
       his neck with a SCREECH.

       Sound Cop's body stumbles for a few seconds, then falls over 
       limply.

       Freddy LAUGHS and laughs and laughs... KACHUNK! until a KNIFE 
       embeds itself in his back.  Krueger spins around.

       CHUNK CHUNK CHUNK!  Three more knives slam into his body as 
       he staggers back in surprise.  Blade Cop stands twenty feet 
       away reaching into thin air and whipping out knife after 
       knife, flinging them at Freddy.  They sail like flying 
       bullets.

       CHUNK CHUNK CHUNK!  Krueger falls back from the sheer force 
       of the onslaught, at least a dozen blades sticking out of his 
       body.  

       Blade stops. She stands there for a beat, waiting to see what 
       Freddy will do next.

       Krueger sways, looking like an inhuman pincushion.  Then he 
       grins.  His body steadies, and he suddenly poses like a body 
       builder and flexes every muscle.

       POP POP POP!  The daggers shoot out of his torso and limbs, 
       CLATTERING to the ground.

       The girl in black steps back and raises her arms.  SHINK 
       SHINK!  Two-foot-long sabers jut out from her forearms.  
       They're not held by her, they're a PART of her, exiting from 
       the tops of her wrists under her clenched fists.  She crosses 
       the blades in front of her.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                     (smiling)
                 Ah... a girl after my own heart.

       KACHINK! Freddy shoots out his finger knives and they EXTEND 
       to double their normal size.  He raises them and takes on a 
       fencing stance.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 En guard, bitch

       SWOOP/CLANG!  A swordfight ensues.  Freddy swinging his four 
       long knives.  Blade slashing her rapier-arms.  They lunge, 
       they parry, they leap, they duck.

       CLANG!  They connect.  SCREEEEE.  Metal scrapes metal.  It's 
       a bastardized version of an Errol Flynn movie and Blade Cop 
       and Freddy are equally matched.  Blade moves to get the upper 
       hand.

       CLINK CLINK!  Blades shoot out of the girl's ELBOWS.  Now 
       when she takes a swing with her fists, another sword is right 
       behind it on the follow-through.

       Freddy gets caught off-guard.  Gets slashed twice in the 
       shoulder and twirls away.  Then starts to move FASTER.

       Blade counters with an equally increased intensity.  Freddy 
       ducks, SWOOPS out twice quickly.  A fold of black cloth drops 
       down on Blade's stomach, revealing naked skin and a little 
       blood.  They pause for a second.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Touche.

       And Blade becomes AIRBORNE putting a Samurai to shame, 
       twirling her legs up and out as a blade juts momentarily from 
       her RIGHT HEEL, chopping off Freddy's left hand.

       Krueger stumbles back in astonishment as green goo spurts out 
       of the stump.

       Astonishment turns to rage as the two converge again, 
       swinging away at an incredible rate.  An impossible rate.

       JACOB rounds the corner.  He stumbles into the action just as 
       the battling pair are becoming an obscure swirling GLINTING 
       MASS.  Pieces of them start to drop away.

       Blade's foot hits the ground.  Freddy's arm plops away.  A 
       broken sword hits the asphalt under the spinning cloud, then 
       one of Blade's arms.

       CLOSE ON JACOB

       as he watches, his eyes dart to try to follow the action 
       that's moving too fast for him to see.

       Then there's silence.

       We PULL BACK and PAN  to follow Jacob as he walks into the 
       scene of carnage.  He steps up to two pills of remains: one 
       black and flesh colored covered with red blood, the other a 
       heap of red and green cloth, scarred tissues, and pukish 
       green glop.

       Blade and Freddy have literally chopped each other to bits, 
       the two mounds of body parts steaming in the cold night air.

       Jacob sees something else and walks over to it.  It's Scott's 
       body.  Jacob kneels down next to the dead teenager.

                           JACOB
                 I'm sorry, Scott.

       A CRACKING sound makes Jacob stand up.  Over to the now-
       silent bar entrance a BLACK FIST punches up through the 
       cement.  With a crumbling of granite, Power Cop rises from 
       the earth.

       Something else moves behind Jacob and he turns, then SCREAMS.  
       Sound Cop's headless body walks into the shot, his arms held 
       ABOVE FRAME over his neck.

       Then Sound Cop's arms lower his dismembered HEAD onto his 
       stump, push it down, twist it til it stays.  With great 
       effort, Sound Cop yanks the brick out of his mouth.  

       Jacob now looks OFF SCREEN at something else, something that 
       REALLY makes his eyes widen.  We get to see the shadow of 
       what Jacob sees, projected on the wall of the bar behind him.

       The shadow of the pile of body parts that was Blade Cop 
       begins to MOVE.  The pieces start to REFORM, leg to torso, 
       arm to shoulder, head to neck.  The shadow on the wall rises 
       and we PULL BACK.

       Blade Cop stands across from Jacob, whole again except for a 
       flash of exposed flesh on her abdomen to remind her of the 
       experience.

       Jacob raises his eyebrows as the resurrected Dream Police 
       step around him.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Okay, I'm impressed

       Blade whips her visor up to reveal an upset girl's face.

                           BLADE COP
                 You shouldn't be.

       Jacob frowns as the four of them walk over to the pile of 
       Freddy remains.  But they're not remains anymore.  All that's 
       left of Freddy is a stack of CLOTH remnants.

       A WIND rises and pieces of cloth blow away into the darkness.  
       The other two Dream Police raise their visors, looking 
       equally distraught.  They all face Jacob.

                           BLADE COP (cont'd)
                 This is what we were afraid of.

                           SOUND COP
                 He still exists.

                           JACOB
                 What!  How?

                           POWER COP
                 We're already dead, that's why he 
                 couldn't destroy us.

                           BLADE COP
                 But he's not dead. He's not alive either.  
                 He's something in between.

                           SOUND COP
                 He's not entirely part of reality or part 
                 of dreams.  He's unique.

                           BLADE COP
                 WE can't kill him.

                           POWER COP
                 We can wail away on each other until 
                 doomsday and not do any good.

                           JACOB
                 Then who's going to kill this fucker?

                           SOUND COP
                 YOU have to.

                           JACOB
                 How the hell am I supposed to do that?

                           BLADE COP
                 Krueger's power comes from his rage and 
                 the souls of children.

                           POWER COP
                 You have to find the original source of 
                 that rage and use it against him.

                           BLADE COP
                 This town in its present condition 
                 encompasses all evils from all times in 
                 its history.  The answer is here 
                 somewhere...

       Jacob sighs, then gets an idea.

                           JACOB
                 I think I know where...

       And he starts to run down the street.

                           BLADE COP
                 Jacob, wait.  We have to find him first.

                           JACOB
                 No time.  You guys find Karen!

       He disappears down the road as the Dream Police snap down 
       their visors

       EXT. ELM STREET HOUSE

       Karen stands in front of a rotted gate in front of a run down 
       building with shuttered windows and a crumbling foundation.  
       This isn't just an ELM STREET house, it's THE Elm Street 
       house.  And for some reason Karen is drawn to it.  She looks 
       to her let at the bent mailbox.

       It has a name plate on it.  Another one underneath it.  And 
       another.  It's as if people moved in and out and instead of 
       changing the plates on the mailbox, they just whacked a new 
       one over the old.  Karen steps closer to the mailbox.

       The little sign on the top reads WILLIAMS.  She touches it 
       with her finger and it drops off, the nails holding it on 
       rusted away to dust.  A new plate is revealed.  This one says 
       THOMPSON. Karen picks lightly at it, and it swings away.  The 
       name underneath makes Karen gasp.

       It reads KRUEGER.

       And there's still another one under that horrible name.  
       Karen quickly hits the Krueger plate off.  The last sign 
       reads UNDERWOOD.

       Karen frowns.  She turns back to the house, a determined 
       expression on her face.

                           KAREN
                 No more...

       She KICKS the gate open and walks up to the house.

       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE

       We've been here before, haven't we?  But for Karen it's the 
       first visit as she opens the front door and walks in.  She 
       takes in the twisted skeleton of a home for a few seconds and 
       then begins to SEARCH it.

       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

       Karen races through, pulling open desk drawers, rifling 
       through shelves, flipping through books.  She doesn't know 
       what she's looking for, but she knows she hasn't found it 
       yet.

       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - KITCHEN

       The intensity of Karen's quest increases as she yanks open 
       cabinets and tosses plates to the floor.  Still nothing.

       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - STAIRS

       Karen runs up them, a girl with a mission.

       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM

       Karen flings the door open.  Nothing but a bed and a set of 
       drawers.  No hint as to the occupant's lives.  She doesn't 
       bother ransacking this one and goes on to:

       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - FREDDY'S BEDROOM

       Jackpot.  Karen stares through the open door at a child's 
       room, a very twisted child's room.  She slowly walks in.

       A bed, a desk, a dresser.  There's a Jack-in-a-box with its 
       head torn off.  A disemboweled Teddy Bear.  White puffy guts 
       hanging out of it.  A clown doll with its face caved in.  A 
       hanging mobile made of strange bent shapes.

       And a pile of more-than-dirty clothes.

       Karen goes over to the pile and picks through it with her 
       toe.  A small pair of pants, about the right size for an 
       eight-year-old.  A black pair of shoes.  And a little 
       sweater, a RED AND GREEN STRIPED sweater.

       Karen goes over to the desk.  There is stack of drawings on 
       it - a child's drawings.  On one of them it looks like 
       someone was practicing writing their name.  FREDDY UNNERWOOD, 
       FREDDY UNDERWUD, FREDDY UNDERWOOD over and over again.  Until 
       the final attempt has the last name angrily crossed out, 
       replaced underneath by a hastily scrawled KRUEGER!!!

       Another piece of paper: a set of human stick figures.  A 
       small one is labeled FREDDY.  The large one is labeled DADDY.  
       The Daddy figure is depicted HITTING the Freddy figure.

       There are more drawings, all of them violent, the large 
       figure beating away at the small one.

       Suddenly a CREAKING.  Karen jumps.  Hides behind a bookshelf.  
       She's nervously trying to figure out what to do when a framed 
       picture catches her attention on the shelf.  It's a picture 
       of a tall, dark man and a little boy.  Karen reaches out to 
       grab the picture, but accidentally knocks over a glass mug 
       with a CRASH.

       FOOTSTEPS can now be heard tromping up the stairs.  

       Someone's coming and Karen's on the edge of panic.  She looks 
       around and finds an old baseball bat.  She grabs it and runs 
       to the side of the doorway as the FOOTSTEPS approach down the 
       hallway.  Karen raises the bat.

       And Jacob appears.  Karen pulls back with the bat as Jacob 
       jumps away from her.

                           KAREN
                 Jacob!  You scared the shit out of me!

                           JACOB
                 The feeling is mutual.

                           KAREN
                 Where are the Dream Police?

                           JACOB
                 I told them to look for you.  What are 
                 you doing here?  Don't you know what this 
                 place is?

                           KAREN
                 I do now.  Look what I found.

       She starts to drag him over to the desk of drawings.

                           JACOB
                 You've got to get out of here.

                           KAREN
                 Wait.  You have to see this.

                           JACOB
                 You don't understand.  The Police can't 
                 kill Freddy.  They literally chopped each 
                 other to pieces and he's still alive!  
                 Now I'm supposed to figure out how to get 
                 rid of him.

                           KAREN
                 But I think I found the answer.  Shut up 
                 for a second and look at these.

       She starts showing him the scrawlings.

                           JACOB
                 Okay, so he's a bad artist.

                           KAREN
                 No!  You told me Krueger's mother 
                 committed suicide and no one knows who 
                 his father was, right?

                           JACOB
                 Yeah...

                           KAREN
                 Freddy's been pushing all our buttons 
                 with our pasts.  These are HIS past.  
                 Don't you get it? HE was a foster child, 
                 too!

       She walks over to the bookshelf and grabs the picture of 
       LITTLE FREDDY and FREDDY'S FOSTER FATHER.

                           KAREN (cont'd)
                 Someone had to have taken care of him.  
                 This guy...he was Freddy's father.  Those 
                 drawings...they were Freddy's childhood.  
                 This house...it's where it all happened.

                           JACOB
                 But in reality Freddy hasn't lived here 
                 for decades.

                           KAREN
                 Like you tried to tell me once before, 
                 this is a dream.  Who knows why this is 
                 all here.

                           JACOB
                 All evils from all times in history...

                           KAREN
                 And isn't this where it all started in 
                 Springwood?  On Elm Street?

       Jacob thinks for a second.  It's all starting to make sense.

                           JACOB
                 But what does this do for us?

                           KAREN
                 There's got to be a way to use it against 
                 him.

                           JACOB
                 Okay, but we're not going to stand around 
                 here to figure out how. It's too 
                 dangerous.

       He grabs her hand and pulls her towards her door.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Let's get out of this house.

       They head out to

       UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

       And Blade Cop is standing in the middle of the corridor.  The 
       two teenagers stop.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Thank God.  Freddy's going to show up any 
                 minute.

       KACHINK!  A knife shoots out of Blade's right hand, ready for 
       action.  (but wait a minute, her uniform isn't ripped 
       anymore...)  Karen and Jacob make their way to the stairs.  
       He turns to Blade.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Where are the others?

       Blade walks up to him and stands there.  Then JAMS HER KNIFE 
       into JACOB'S GUT.  Karen SCREAMS.  Jacob chokes.  Blade Cop 
       shoves the knife in further until it juts out of Jacob's 
       back.  She turns.

       Then BECOMES FREDDY.

                           FREDDY
                 Time to join your mommy.

       Krueger yanks his finger blades out and Jacob's limp body 
       falls at Karen's feet.  Karen shrieks and cries, dropping to 
       her knees to hold him.

                           KAREN
                 No no no no no no no...Jacob...

       He looks up at her, slowly dying.  She strokes his forehead 
       while Freddy laughs at the sentiment. 

                           FREDDY
                 Young love...ha!

                           JACOB
                 Karen...dream...powers....

       And Jacob is gone.  Karen sobs, so torn apart that she is 
       ignoring the incredible danger above her.  But not for long.

       Krueger grabs Karen by the neck.

                           FREDDY
                 It's past your bedtime, young lady.

       And he starts to DRAG her, kicking and screaming, her body 
       scraping across the floor towards the 

       MASTER BEDROOM

       Freddy drags Karen in and TOSSES her across the room.  She 
       lands with a THUD on the bed.  He saunters over to her and 
       climbs up on the bed next to her.  Gets on top.

       Karen yells and hits him uselessly with her fists and it's 
       horrible because there he is, pressing down on her, right in 
       her face, mounting her as if he's going to rape her.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Aw, sweetheart.  This won't hurt a bit.

       She screams as he presses even harder.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Come on.  Be Daddy's little girl.

       And the last three words of that sentence seem to ECHO 
       through the room, swirling around Karen.  DADDY'S LITTLE 
       GIRL.  "Daddy's little girl."  Karen twists her head away.

       And Freddy's become Karen's FATHER.  He looks down on her 
       with a lecherous grin.

                           KAREN'S FATHER
                 That's my baby.  That's Daddy's little 
                 girl.

       Karen stops struggling.  The realization grows on her face 
       with the resurfacing memory.

                           KAREN
                 Oh no...

                           KAREN'S FATHER
                     (Freddy's voice)
                 Now do you remember?

       She does.  And she has an answer for him.

                           KAREN
                 You're NOT my father.

                           KAREN'S FATHER
                 But we're going to have the same fun!

       Karen stares at him defiantly.  And a HAND grabs Karen's 
       Father, and yanks him away.  We PULL BACK.  

       KAREN'S MOTHER is next to the bed.  Furious.

                           KAREN'S MOTHER
                 That's enough!

       And she SLAPS Karen's Father.  He stands up, SLUGS her across 
       the jaw.  She tumbles back.  Karen sits up.

                           KAREN
                 Mommy, no!

       Karen's Mother gets up, a defiant look just like Karen's on 
       her face.

                           KAREN'S MOTHER
                 You're never going to touch her again!

                           KAREN'S FATHER
                 I'll touch what I want!

       BAP!  He strikes her again, sending her right out the door.  
       He follows her. Karen stands up and runs after them.

       IN THE HALLWAY

       CRACK!  The man hits the woman down to the floor.  Karen's 
       mother stands up, just taking it.  She's at the top of the 
       stairs.  Karen's Father swings his arm back, and Karen jumps 
       on him.  He shrugs her away violently.

       WITH KAREN

       as she hits the ground and the wall next to Jacob's body.  
       She looks up.

       WIDER

       And Karen's Father is now FREDDY again.  He swings his fist.  
       SMACK!

       Karen's Mother reels from the hit, falls backwards.  Karen 
       jumps up to try and help her, reaching past Freddy.  But it's 
       too late.

       Karen's Mother tumbles down the stairs, head hitting, bones 
       cracking, disappearing into darkness.

       Freddy grabs Karen by the neck and lifts her.  DANGLES her 
       over the top of the steps.

                           FREDDY
                 Be honored, bitch.  You're the last soul 
                 I need.

       And Jacob RISES UP behind Krueger.  GRABS him.  Freddy DROPS 
       Karen.  She hits hard and rolls down the steps as Freddy 
       turns, his knives swinging out and SLAMMING Jacob's gut one 
       more time, IMPALING him against the wall.  Jacob gasps out 
       his final breath.

                           JACOB
                 I'll be back...

                           FREDDY
                 I'll be waiting.

       Freddy pulls his blades out of Jacob and the wall.  The boy's 
       body hits the floor for the last time.  Freddy turns back to 
       the stairs and looks down them.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Where's my little pumpkin?

       He strolls down the steps.

       DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

       Freddy walks down and no one's there.  Karen's Mom was just 
       an illusion, but Karen herself, dead or alive, is nowhere to 
       be seen.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Play time is over, bitch.

       He walks down the hallway.  Eyes darting.  Until a BOOMING 
       VOICE is heard from the kitchen.

                           VOICE
                 FREDERICK!

       Freddy cocks his head and frowns.

                           VOICE (cont'd)
                 Frederick!  What have you done?

       And, amazingly, a look of FEAR crosses Krueger's face.  
       Something about that voice has struck terror in the heart of 
       the creature that fears nobody.

       Krueger turns to the kitchen door.  A man steps out of the 
       shadows, a big muscular man with a horrifying look in his 
       eyes.  A man we've seen somewhere before - in a picture.

       It's FREDDY'S FOSTER FATHER - MR. UNDERWOOD.  And he looks 
       pissed beyond belief.

       Freddy shrinks back, eyes widening.

                           FREDDY
                 Daddy?

                           MR. UNDERWOOD
                 Don't you "Daddy" me!

       Mr. Underwood raises his arm and SMACKS Freddy across the 
       skull.  Krueger tumbles back into the hallway.

       Freddy scrambles to his feet.  Shakes with dread.  Looks like 
       a scared little boy.  Mr. Underwood advances on him.

                           FREDDY
                 No, Daddy. Please...

       Freddy turns and bolts for the front door.  He flings it 
       open.  Power Cop stands in his way and SHOVES Freddy back - 
       back in front of his foster father.

       PUNCH - a vicious blow from Underwood sends Krueger into

       THE LIVING ROOM

       where Freddy falls over a couch.  Underwood stomps into the 
       room. Krueger scrambles up and heads for the archway leading 
       into the dining room.

       BLADE COP blocks the escape.  The ripped flap of her uniform 
       proving she's the real one. She KICKS Freddy back and into 
       Underwood's hands.  The man picks up Krueger and HITS him 
       again.  And again.  And again.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Stop.  You're hurting me.  Stop.

       Freddy wriggles away and opens a window.  Sound Cop fills the 
       window, cutting him off.  Pushes him back inside.

       Mr. Underwood grabs Krueger and slaps him over and over.  
       Slugs him.  Gives the beating he's got coming to him.

       And Freddy MOANS and YELLS like a blubbering child.  Shrinks 
       into a corner but is yanked out for more pummeling.

       Power Cop stands at the exit to the hallway.  Blade Cop 
       continues to obstruct the dining room arch.  Sound Cop steps 
       through the window and stands in front of it.  The Dream 
       Police just stare in silence.

       It's not a street fight, not a punching match.  Just a 
       ruthless thrashing that would be hard to watch if it weren't 
       for the fact that we are all cheering because no one in 
       history has ever deserved it more.

       Underwood stops the whipping and stands over Krueger who is 
       lying on the ground whimpering, pleading for mercy.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Why, Daddy?  What did I do?

                           MR. UNDERWOOD
                 You took some things that don't belong to 
                 you!

       And with that, Underwood brings his fist down and JAMS it 
       into Freddy's stomach.  Right THROUGH IT.  Shoving it into 
       his very body.

       Freddy SCREAMS.  Underwood violently pulls his fist out and 
       there's SOMETHING in it.  A shimmering flowing thing.  
       Crackling with unworldly LIGHT.  It's a SOUL.  It's Wesley's 
       SOUL.  Underwood flings his arm out and lets go.  Wesley's 
       soul flies into thin air and DISSIPATES.

       Krueger's father brings his hand down again and RIPS out 
       GINA'S SOUL.  Again.  JACOB'S SOUL.  Freddy opens his mouth 
       and shrieks.  As Underwood raises his arms and begins to 
       SPARKLE.  FLASHES of light bounce around his body. He's 
       changing.

       And something's happening to Freddy's too.  Steam is rising 
       from the creature.  His feet are starting to flatten as he 
       lays on the ground and BLACK GOO oozes from his pores.

       He's melting.  And still screaming as he watches his foster 
       father's image turn into:

       KAREN.  An aura of LIGHT vanishes around her body as she 
       lowers her arms with a victorious yet sad look on her face.  
       Freddy DIES.

       A look of horrified realization burns in Krueger's eyes as he 
       sees Karen and CONTINUES to scream inhumanly.

       His body dissolves, all of it liquefying into BLACK SLIME.  
       Gone.  Just a bubbling black puddle of gunk is left.  His 
       SHRIEK echoes through the room and everywhere else.

       Then the GUNK grows and changes into a dark cloud that begins 
       to EXPAND.

       Power Cop runs up, grabs Karen and yells.

                           POWER COP
                 We gotta get outta here!

       Karen, almost mesmerized by the black cloud spreading in 
       front of her, stumbles away with Power Cop.

       EXT. ELM STREET HOUSE

       The Dream Police and Karen bolt out the front door and run 
       down the street as a RUMBLE joins Freddy's thunderous SHRIEK 
       and the entire town begins to SHAKE.

       We stay with a shot of the house as the noise and vibrations 
       continue.

       And the Elm Street House EXPLODES.  The BLACK CLOUD punches 
       out the roof and the walls, sending wood and debris flying 
       everywhere.

       The rubble flies into the air, hangs there for a beat, then 
       falls to the ground.

       All is SILENT.  And the dark cloud turns WHITE.  The milky 
       fog spreads out.

       EXT. ELM STREET INTERSECTION

       Karen falls to her knees on the pavement, not looking back at 
       the destruction one block away.

       The Dream Police stop running to turn to face her.  Karen 
       hangs her head and cries.

       Blade steps forward.

                           BLADE COP
                 It took a human touch.  It took knowing 
                 HIS nightmare.  Goodbye, Karen.

       Karen raises her head as the Dream Police turn away.

       KAREN'S POV - THE DREAM POLICE

       walk off into the distance.  Just as they are about to vanish 
       into the darkness, a FOURTH FIGURE appears and joins them in 
       formation.  Then they all disappear.

       ANGLE ON KAREN

       Her mouth drops open at what she's just seen.  What she 
       DOESN'T see is the white cloud swooping down the street 
       behind her. She just closes her eyes as the ivory mist 
       envelops her and the SCREEN GOES WHITE.

       FADE IN FROM WHITE TO:

       EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY

       Karen lies sleeping on the bench amongst the grass and trees.  
       Her eyes open and squint at the bright light.  She sits up 
       and tries to get her bearings.  Some hair falls into her face 
       and she brushes it away.  Only then noticing that she's 
       holding something in her hand.

       She opens her hand and looks down.

       KAREN'S POV

       It's an ID bracelet.  A band of gold with a larger plate 
       dangling from the middle of it.  Karen's hand turns it over.  
       This time the printing reads JACOB.

       WITH KAREN

       she chokes back the tears.  We hear a PANTING O.S.  Then a 
       woman's voice.

                           WOMAN
                 You okay, honey?

       Karen looks up as we PULL BACK.  A pleasant-looking woman, no 
       longer a mutant, is walking her cute dog.  She looks 
       sincerely concerned.  Karen nods.

                           KAREN
                 Yes.  I'm alright.

                           WOMAN
                 I've never seen you around.  Are you new 
                 in town?

                           KAREN
                 Sort of.

                           WOMAN
                 Well then...
                     (she smiles)
                 Welcome to Springwood.

       The woman continues on her way.  Karen sighs and puts the 
       bracelet on her wrist.  She stands and our SHOT PULLS UP AND 
       AWAY as the pretty young girl starts walking through a town 
       she's never seen - except in her dreams.

                                                          FADE OUT.
FADE IN:

       INT. DC-10 AIRLINER - NIGHT

       JACOB JOHNSON is sleeping.  It doesn't look like a pleasant 
       experience.  He is sixteen, dirty blonde, his eyes visibly 
       moving under closed lids as he sits huddle under a blanket in 
       his window seat.  The lights are dim -- the shade on the 
       window closed -- a bead of sweat dribbles down his forehead.  
       The HUMMING of the jet's engines vibrates through the cabin.

       The boy's eyes snap open.

       Jacob glances around nervously.  He looks like an escaped 
       convict who just accidentally walked into the Policemen's 
       Ball.  A GREYHAIRED MAN two seats away from him gives the 
       teenager a cursory glance, then goes back to his book.  Jacob 
       lays his head back and tries to relax.  The engines continue 
       to drone.

       Until a new noise starts.  A WHOOSHING NOISE.

       The sound is very faint.  But distinct from everything else.  
       Jacob frowns.

       The noise gets LOUDER.  Jacob's sure he's hearing it now.  He 
       looks at the Greyhaired Man.  The man catches his eye and the 
       two of them stare at each other for a heartbeat - then Jacob 
       turns away.  The Man returns to his book.  And Jacob 
       immediately turns back to him.

                           JACOB
                 Do you hear that?

       The man gives him an annoyed look as the WHOOSHING gets 
       louder.

                           GREYHAIRED MAN
                 Hear what?

                           JACOB
                 That noise.

                           GREYHAIRED MAN
                 I don't hear anything.

       The man turns back to the book as the sound gets even LOUDER -
       - like it's coming closer.  Jacob squirms in his seat -- 
       sneaks a look at the man again.  How can he not hear that?  A 
       STEWARDESS walks by and Jacob catches her attention.

                           JACOB
                 Excuse me.

                           STEWARDESS
                 Yes?

       The WHOOSHING is completely obvious now.  The greyhaired man 
       tries to ignore the two people talking over him.

                           JACOB
                 What is that sound?

                           STEWARDESS
                 That's just the engines, sir.

                           JACOB
                 No, it's different.  It's not the 
                 engines.  It's getting louder.

       The man sighs -- the stewardess smiles patronizingly.

                           STEWARDESS
                 We're just gaining altitude to get above 
                 some rough weather.  That's the sound of 
                 the engines speeding up a bit.  
                 Everything's fine.

                           JACOB
                 Um...okay.

       The stewardess walks away as Jacob sits back and starts to 
       bite his nails.  The whooshing is really starting to BLARE 
       now.  He looks between the seats in front of him -- twists 
       around to look behind.  He snaps back to the greyhaired man.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Can't you hear that?

                           GREYHAIRED MAN
                     (losing patience)
                 Look, kid.  Will you relax?  It's just 
                 the damn engines, okay?

       The man glares at him, and Jacob backs off.  The sound has 
       grown DEAFENING.  Jacob grinds his seat like he's going mad.  
       He looks at the closed window.  He reaches out his hand, 
       grabs the handle then rips up the shade for all to see:

       A 747 coming RIGHT AT US.

       Jacob SCREAMS.  The planes CRASH.

       Impact - decompression - explosion.  The hull of the cabin 
       buckles violently - moaning like a dying elephant - peeling 
       inward revealing RED AND GREEN STRIPING on the outside.

       A huge wing section RIPS through the structure - barely 
       missing Jacob - taking the greyhaired man's head clean off - 
       nailing the stewardess in the gut and shoving her body across 
       and out the other side of the cabin.

       And Jacob's seat drops down - sending him and us into:

       EXT. SKY - NIGHT

       Like an intricate ballet, Jacob, his body strapped to his 
       chair, tumbles away from the DC-10 and 747 as they seem to 
       merge and bend into some kind of mutant DC-47 - wings and 
       tails wrapping around each other as debris blooms out like a 
       flower and together they EXPLODE - a fiery ball lighting the 
       nighttime clouds and Jacob's shrieking face.  

       And Jacob falls and falls and falls, his hair sticking 
       straight up from the blasting wind.

       That's when CORPSES start falling past him.  The captain of 
       the plane - the stewardess, her body bent in half - the 
       greyhaired man, his head gone but his book still in his hand.  
       More men, women, crew people - and CHILDREN.

       But these children aren't dead bodies.  Two LITTLE GIRLS and 
       one LITTLE BOY, all dressed in white, plummet down next to 
       Jacob, head first, like high divers.  And they're singing:

                           THE CHILDREN
                 One two, Freddy's coming for you...

       The children turn around in the sky so that they are 
       travelling feet first.  The Little Boy's pants puff up and 
       the Girls' skirts poof out and RIP UPWARD - the wind taking 
       away their clothes and their skin and their bodies and their 
       hair...

                           THE CHILDREN (cont'd)
                 Three four, better lock your door...

       Leaving three tiny SKELETONS - taunting and laughing as Jacob 
       screams and covers his eyes.

                           THE CHILDREN (cont'd)
                 Five six, grab your crucifix...

       And the Skeletons sprout wings - leathery and veiny - the 
       wind catching them and sending them up and away as their 
       voices echo in the sky.

                           THE CHILDREN (cont'd)
                 Seven eight, gonna stay up late...

       Jacob takes his hands away from his face and starts to 
       frantically pull on his seat belt.  SNAP - it flies off his 
       back and miraculously turns into a PARACHUTE.  Rope swirls 
       into the air - the wind grabs the canvas - and Jacob's body 
       slows with a violent jerk.

       But at least he's not falling anymore.  Jacob catches his 
       breath as he starts gently floating through the sky.  He 
       smiles.  This isn't so bad.  This is actually kind of fun.  
       Not for long, though, because his new upward momentum carries 
       him back up to:

       The winged children's Skeletons.  Jacob's eyes bug out as he 
       rises into them and they start to circle.  They move closer 
       and we can see something in their hands:

       SCISSORS

       Jacob twists his body, trying to steer his parachute away 
       from the demons.  One of the Skeletons swoops up to his face 
       and pokes its scissors inches away from Jacob's eyes.  It 
       sings alone:

                           CHILD
                 Nine ten, never sleep again!

       The Skeleton cranks its arm back - ready to plunge the 
       scissor's blades into Jacob's sockets.  The arms swings 
       toward him - then suddenly diverts up past his head, heading 
       for:

       THE CHUTE'S STRINGS

       The Skeleton flaps its wings and poises its scissors at one 
       of the ropes.  The other two Skeletons join it over Jacob's 
       head.  The three of them look down at Jacob, their boney jaws 
       in a perpetual smile.

                           JACOB
                 No!

       The Skeletons nod "yes".  SNIP - SNIP - SNIP - they cut away 
       at Jacob's parachute as he swings underneath them, trying to 
       pull away - SNIP - SNIP.

       The parachute flutters away - the Skeletons cackle - and 
       Jacob plummets.

       ON JACOB

       We stay with him as he screams and shrieks and yells and the 
       clouds part and the ground rises quickly up to meet him.  The 
       ground becomes a town, the town becomes a block, the block 
       becomes a house, the house becomes a roof, and...

       INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

       KA-BLAM!  The ceiling explodes as Jacob's body plows through, 
       slams down, shatters the bed, and we immediately:

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - MORNING

       Jacob's eyes blast open as he sits up from bed in a cold 
       sweat.  A dream.  The worst fucking dream from hell anyone 
       would ever want to have -- but still just a dream.  He takes 
       a few deep breaths as a soft KNOCK is heard at the door.

                           JACOB
                 Yeah..

       ALICE JOHNSON opens the door and sticks her head in.  She's 
       thirty-two, blonde, with a caring smile.

                           ALICE
                 You okay, honey?

                           JACOB
                 Yeah, Mom.  I'm fine.

                           ALICE
                 Alright.  Better get cooking or you'll be 
                 late for school.

                           JACOB
                 On my way.

       Alice closes the door as Jacob gets out of bed and stretches.  
       Sunlight is leaking through the bedroom window shade and 
       Jacob walks over to it.  He reaches out and pulls up the 
       shade.

       And there's nothing buy sky.  Jacob frowns and pokes his head 
       out the window.

       JACOB'S POV - THE GROUND

       is once again racing up towards us at seven-thousand miles an 
       hour.  The entire house is falling.

       BACK IN THE BEDROOM

       Jacob leaps away from the window.  The WINGED SKELETONS 
       reappear outside -- dancing in the air -- cackling with glee.

       The bedroom starts to SHAKE violently as Jacob stumbles into 
       the center.  The roof starts caving in and the walls begins 
       to crumble.

       ANGLE STRAIGHT DOWN ON JACOB.

       Jacob grabs his head, looks up at us, and SCREAMS.  We 
       suddenly stay where we are as the house drops down and we 
       punch out through the roof and our shot becomes an:

       ANGLE STRAIGHT DOWN ON THE HOUSE

       as it falls away towards the ground.  We watch as it becomes 
       a small dot - and finally impacts on the surface.  A mushroom 
       cloud of smoke silently puffs out in the distance below

       EXT. TOWN - NIGHT - AT THE CRATER

       Smoke and dust whirl around a huge hole in the earth.  
       Splintered shreds of lumber stick up in the air like giant 
       toothpicks.  Some of the toothpicks start to move.

       Jacob rises out of the destruction, charred, scraped, 
       battered and, unfortunately, alive.  He climbs up to the edge 
       of the crater.  He looks back a the remnants of his home.

       Then something starts to happen.

       Something his growing from the crater - spreading out.  It's 
       not a cloud, it's not smoke - it's a DARKNESS.  Even though 
       it's night, this darkness is darker.  It creeps out from the 
       hole - fingers of blackness reaching out.  What it covers 
       doesn't disappear.  It becomes GLOOMY.  The shroud is getting 
       bigger.

       And it's getting faster.  Jacob runs.

       WITH JACOB - RUNNING

       He bolts down the streets of the small town in a blind panic.  
       He looks behind him and sees the darkness getting bigger, its 
       gloominess covering houses.  Then whole blocks.

       Everything it touches seems to fall deeper into SHADOW.

       AT THE STREET CORNER

       Jacob comes across a WOMAN walking her dog.  He stops and 
       yells at her.

                           JACOB
                 Get the hell out of here!  It's coming!

                           WOMAN
                 What's coming?

       Jacob points down the street.  The shroud is swooping down 
       the road - browning out street lights in its wake.  And the 
       woman doesn't find anything threatening about this.  Jacob 
       screams at her.

                           JACOB
                 Don't you see it?

                           WOMAN
                 See what?

       And it's obvious now: she doesn't see anything.  The Woman is 
       totally oblivious to the danger.  Jacob shakes his head -- 
       stumbles away.

       The woman watches him go as the darkness PASSES OVER HER.  
       She sighs.

       And begins to MUTATE.  Her hair gets scraggly, her skin 
       bursts out in sores, her back grows a hump -- all of which 
       she DOESN'T seem to notice.

       She just shrugs her twisted shoulders.

                           WOMAN (cont'd)
                 Kids...watcha gonna do?

       She hobbles away with her dog - which now has six legs and 
       two heads.

       BACK WITH JACOB - RUNNING

       Like a bat running from hell, he tears through the streets 
       passing buildings that turn creepy and people that become 
       passively accepting monsters.

       A VOICE booms out from nowhere.

                           FREDDY (O.S.)
                 Jacob!  You're too old to run away from 
                 home!

       Jacob covers his ears and races out of town.

       EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

       Jacob falls onto the deserted road just outside of town.  He 
       rolls on the asphalt and looks behind him.  most of the town 
       is covered in an opaque gloom.  

       Suddenly a CACKLING sound is heard and Jacob turns to its 
       source:

       HIS POV: THE SPRINGWOOD SIGN

       The town can still be seen behind it -- the darkness over 
       almost all of it now.  The sign reads: WELCOME TO SPRINGWOOD.  
       POPULATION...

       And the numbers after the word "population" are changing.  
       They're counting BACKWARDS, clattering away like an old-time 
       gas pump in reverse - faster and faster - blurring as the 
       "thousands" digit disappears, then the "hundreds", then 
       "tens", then...

       CLINK - the count stops at "1".  Springwood is entirely 
       engulfed in the shroud.  There is a pause.

       CRASH - the sign is violently YANKED into the ground.  It 
       vanishes into the earth and a CRACK APPEARS at the edge of 
       the road. The crack grows - moving out to the center of the 
       highway.

       BACK ON THE STREET

       Jacob watches the crack as it splits wider in the middle of 
       the street and a GURGLING sound starts to build.  The tar in 
       front of Jacob becomes molten.  It bubbles and pops.

       Jacob scrambles backwards as something begins to rise from 
       boiling asphalt.

       It's a hat.

       The hat, a fedora to be precise, pushes itself up. A left 
       hand - burned and scarred - pokes out next to it.  Four sharp 
       blades jut out of the muck on the other side.  A head is up 
       now - a curtain of tar dripping from the rim of the hat - 
       hiding the face.  The body beneath the head ascends.  The 
       veil of asphalt parts:

       It's FREDDY KRUEGER.  Jacob SCREAMS.

       Freddy LAUGHS.  He shakes off his layer of tar and looks 
       towards the clouded town of Springwood.  A look of pure 
       hatred appears on his ragged face.

                           FREDDY
                 Payback time...

       Freddy opens his mouth - lets out a large breath - and then 
       INHALES an even larger one.

       A WINDSTORM starts, the source being Krueger's own lungs.  
       The gale force begins to yank at the shroud surrounding 
       Springwood.  Fingers of darkness pull up from the town and 
       towards Freddy's mouth -- and houses begin to DISSOLVE.  
       Freddy continues to inhale like he's never going to stop.

       Krueger is sucking the black gloom into his body - and the 
       entire town of Springwood is going with it.  Trees, 
       buildings, cars, picket fences.  It's all crumbling and 
       fusing, becoming a part of t cloud that itself is caught in 
       the nightmarish wind tunnel, all piling into Freddy's mouth.

       The vortex swirls into Krueger.  Then it's gone.  Nothing but 
       a vacant lot the size of a town remains.  Freddy turns to 
       Jacob and BURPS, it sounds like a THUNDERCLAP.

                           JACOB
                 No!

                           FREDDY
                 Don't worry, I have a strong stomach.

       Freddy reaches down and yanks up his red and green sweater.  
       He pulls apart his putrid abdomen to reveal his guts - and a 
       transparent stomach.

       Inside the stomach: a black swirling mass.  Flashes of 
       houses, people, homes, couples, all trapped in horrible 
       anguish.  Freddy drops down his sweater.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Springwood is mine, boy!

                           JACOB
                 I dreamed you away before I was born!  
                 Mom said you couldn't come back!

                           FREDDY
                 Is that true?  Then she told you all 
                 about me, huh? Let's see what else she 
                 has to say.

       Freddy reaches his left hand into the bubbling tar at his 
       feet, digs around a bit, then pulls out:

       ALICE.  Jacob's mother.  Tar dripping down her body.  Krueger 
       has her by the neck, waves his blades in front of her.  Jacob 
       gets up and runs toward him.

       Freddy pulls a foot up from the asphalt pit and KICKS Jacob 
       back a good fifteen feet.

                           ALICE
                 Run, Jacob!

       The boy rolls painful on the hard road.  He sits up and 
       screams:

                           JACOB
                 Leave her alone!

                           FREDDY
                 You're such a momma's boy!

       Freddy swings his knives out, pauses for a terrifying beat, 
       then swoops the daggers towards Alice.

       CLOSE ON JACOB

       as OFF SCREEN we hear a horrible multiple GLITCH!  Jacob 
       shrieks in gut-wrenching anguish.

       WIDE ON SCENE

       We're far enough away so that we don't barf at the sight but 
       close enough to see that Freddy has impaled Alice's body on 
       his blades.  He lifts her up effortlessly and raises her limp 
       figure RIGHT OVER HIS HEAD.

       Krueger swings his arm out, shaking off Alice, sending her 
       flying over Jacob's head.  The body lands behind him.

       ON JACOB

       as he runs to his mother.  She VANISHES just as he reaches 
       out to touch her bloody body.  He turns to Krueger and raises 
       his fists.  A look of sheer rage is growing in him, blind, 
       insane anger.  He bellows:

                           JACOB
                 You fucker!

                           FREDDY
                 Springwood is only the beginning.  All I 
                 need from you is a ride!

       Suddenly, between Jacob and Freddy, three SHAFTS OF LIGHT 
       burst up from the road.  Three FIGURES appear as the light 
       dissipates.

       They're dressed in metallic black, heavy boots, helmets with 
       dark visors covering their faces.  One is large and muscular.  
       The one in the center has an obviously feminine figure under 
       her skin-tight outfit.  The third is a little smaller than 
       the other two with a slightly different face  that allows us 
       to see his mouth.

       They're the DREAM POLICE.  Jacob doesn't know this yet, but 
       Freddy seems to.  The bastard son of a hundred maniacs frowns 
       at the sight of these new apparitions.

       Then he looks past them and smiles at Jacob.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 See ya later!

       Freddy violently DROPS down into the bubbling asphalt pit.  
       Two of the black figures start after him.  The third one 
       turns to Jacob as his partners leap into the hole after 
       Freddy.  The sound from his exposed mouth is DEAFENING!

                           SOUND COP
                 WAKE UP!

       Jacob grabs his ears in pain as we suddenly:

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

       Jacob's eyes snap open so fast his sockets suffer whiplash.  
       He's lying smack in the middle of the road tucked in a fetal 
       position.  Jacob slowly uncurls his body and sits up.  He 
       shivers and wipes his sweaty forehead - and that's when he 
       notices something in his hand.

       INSERT: JACOB'S HAND

       it's a bracelet, a simple band of gold with a larger plate in 
       the middle, like an ID band.  Jacob's fingers turn the plate 
       over. Printed on the other side is the name of the bracelet's 
       former owner: ALICE.  Jacob has a souvenir.

       BACK TO JACOB

       He raises his face and looks at the road in front of him.  It 
       goes off into the distance surrounded on both sides by empty 
       fields. 

       This is where Springwood used to be.  A look of anguish 
       crosses Jacob's face as he stares at the desolation.

                           JACOB
                 Mom...

       HONK!  SCREECH!

       Jacob whips his head around in time to see a huge moving van 
       blasting right at him.  He rolls off to the side of the road.  
       The truck barely misses him, kicking up a cloud of dust in 
       its wake.

       Jacob chokes on the dust.  He slowly recovers and looks back 
       down at the bracelet in his hand. He clenches his fist around 
       it as a wild-eyed angry look starts to grow on him.  He takes 
       a few deep breaths, then stands up and walks OUT OF FRAME.

       ANGLE DOWN THE HIGHWAY

       We can see a pickup truck in the distance. Jacob's HAND 
       ENTERS FRAME, thumb sticking out, his mother's bracelet 
       dangling from his wrist.

       The pickup truck starts to slow down.

       EXT. ROSEDALE - DAY

       A sprawling little community with pleasant streets and 
       cheerful houses.  It looks a lot like Springwood, the only 
       real difference being that it actually exists.  It also has a 
       sign: WELCOME TO ROSEDALE.  POPULATION: 8,786

       A Volkswagon bus drives past the sign and stops a couple of 
       blocks down the road from us.  Jacob steps out of the 
       passenger side and wearily waves his ride goodbye.  He 
       shuffles into town.

       CLOSE ON YET ANOTHER SIGN

       It reads: DRUG ADDICTS NOT WELCOME TO ROSEDALE!

       The sign pulls away to reveal a middle-aged man with an angry 
       expression: MR. HOPKINS

                           MR. HOPKINS
                 Clean up your act somewhere else!

       He walks along as we PULL BACK TO SEE

       EXT. ROSEDALE FOSTER HOME - DAY

       It's a nice-looking two-story house in the middle of a 
       usually quiet neighborhood.  Today the home is surrounded by 
       about a dozen townsfolk carrying picket signs: NO HALFWAY 
       HOUSES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD!, DON'T LOWER OUR PROPERTY 
       VALUES!, and GO BACK TO JUVENILE HALL!  The crowd mumbles 
       amongst itself, occasionally bursting out with a chant in 
       protest.

       ON JACOB

       We catch him walking down the sidewalk.  He tramps along with 
       his hands stuffed in his pockets and his eyes on the 
       pavement.  He looks like he hasn't slept in days.  The sound 
       of the crowd ahead of him finally grabs his attention.

       Jacob approaches the disturbance and comes across a young 
       girl standing behind a bush holding a BAG OF GROCERIES.  She 
       is KAREN MILLER, dark hair, sixteen, very pretty, but with a 
       faraway look in her eyes.

       Jacob stands next to her and stares at the crowd like a 
       zombie.  She doesn't turn to look at him as he speaks:

                           JACOB
                 What's going on?

                           KAREN
                 Free speech.  The right of assembly.

                           JACOB
                 What is this place?

                           KAREN
                 It's a home.  A foster home.  For 
                 teenagers.  It's where you go when things 
                 get bad.  It's the place to figure out 
                 what to do next.  It's a home for kids 
                 that no one else wants.
                     (beat)
                 It's MY home.

       Karen hasn't looked at Jacob once.  She suddenly seems to 
       steel herself and walks away from the bush, towards the 
       house.  Jacob is befuddled.

                           JACOB
                 Oh...

       He stands there and watches.

       IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE

       Karen quickly makes her way into the crowd of people, head 
       up, eyes staring forward.  The crowd parts ever so slightly 
       as the irked townsfolk start to heat up.  They have an actual 
       human to vent their anger on now.  Mr. Hopkins lays in on her 
       as she passes him.

                           MR. HOPKINS
                 Why can't you find somewhere else to 
                 shack up?

       Karen turns to him, still walking, flustered and hurt.

                           KAREN
                 What have we ever done to you?

                           MR. HOPKINS
                 Nothing...YET.

       Karen turns quickly away from him and trips over a sprinkler 
       head.  Her groceries tumble onto the grass.  A hand reaches 
       down to help her.  It's Jacob's.

       He quietly helps her re-bag her groceries as Mr. Hopkins 
       looms above them.  Both angry and embarrassed now.

                           MR. HOPKINS (cont'd)
                 Look, we've been here for years.  This is 
                 a quiet street.  We'd just like to keep 
                 it that way.

       Jacob can't take this guy anymore.  He stands up and faces 
       the older man with a scowl.

                           JACOB
                 Lighten up, mister.

                           MR. HOPKINS
                     (smirks)
                 And what gutter did you crawl out from, 
                 kid?
                     (frowns)
                 We don't want your kind here.

                           JACOB
                 My kind?  What kind is that?

                           MR. HOPKINS
                 Drug addicts.  Dope pushers.  We have 
                 stand up and take charge.

                           JACOB
                 Swell.  I've just got a couple of 
                 questions for you...Do you love your 
                 parents?

                           MR. HOPKINS
                 Of course I do...

                           JACOB
                 Are they alive?

                           MR. HOPKINS
                 My mother is.

                           JACOB
                 What's it like?

       Jacob stares at Hopkins.  He doesn't answer.  He just huffs 
       and puffs as Karen grabs Jacob and pulls him up to the front 
       porch of the home, then into the floor.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - FRONT HALLWAY - DAY

       Karen slams the door and takes a deep breath.

                           KAREN
                 Assholes.

                           JACOB
                 I can think of a stronger word.  Are you 
                 okay?

                           KAREN
                 Yeah.  Thanks.  I'm Karen.

                           JACOB
                 Jacob.

       Jacob suddenly gets a little light-headed and has to use a 
       wall to hold himself up.  Karen looks concerned.

                           KAREN
                 Are YOU okay?

                           JACOB
                 Yeah.  I just haven't had much to eat 
                 lately.

                           KAREN
                 Then come help me unpack.

       She smiles and leads him further into the house.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

       Jacob is feverishly eating a sandwich at the table while 
       Karen finishes putting the rest of the food away.

                           KAREN
                 I guess the sandwich is alright, huh?

                           JACOB
                 It's incredible.  Best I've ever had.

                           KAREN
                 You're not from around here, are you?

                           JACOB
                 No.  I've been on the road for a couple 
                 of days.

                           KAREN
                 Do you need a place to stay?

       FOOTSTEPS are heard from below and a couple in their mid-
       thirties enter from the basement door.  They're DAVID and 
       MARY ROSS, both greasy and frustrated.

                           MARY
                 So, we have to get it fixed.

                           DAVID
                 We don't have the money to get it fixed.

       They both start washing up at the sink, not really noticing 
       the teenagers in the room.  Karen speaks up.

                           KAREN
                 What's wrong?

                           DAVID
                 Our plumbing has a bad case of hardening 
                 of the arteries.  Who's your friend?

       David gives Jacob a wary glance as the boy stands shakily.

                           KAREN
                 This is Jacob.

                           JACOB
                 Jacob Johnson.

                           DAVID
                 David Ross.  My wife, Mary.

                           KAREN
                 They run this house.  They're helping me 
                 and three other ids get a footing in 
                 reality before they kick us out of the 
                 nest to make room for the next batch.

       David is looking out the window at the now dissipating crowd.  
       He lets out a weary sigh.

                           DAVID
                 If there is a next batch.  I see the 
                 welcome wagon is back.  Was there any 
                 trouble?

                           KAREN
                 A little.  Jacob came to my rescue.

                           MARY
                     (pleasant)
                 Where you from, Jacob?

                           JACOB
                 Springwood.

                           MARY
                 Springwood?  Where's that?

                           JACOB
                 Upstate about a hundred miles.

                           DAVID
                     (suspicious)
                 I know this state like the back of my 
                 hand.  I've never heard of Springwood.

       There is an uncomfortable pause.  Then Karen suddenly breaks 
       in.

                           KAREN
                 Jacob's a little down on his luck.  I 
                 told him he could stay here a few days.

       Jacob gives here a surprised look.

                           MARY
                 Are your parents in Springwood?

                           JACOB
                 My father died before I was born.  My 
                 mother, she's dead, too.

                           DAVID
                 You have a legal guardian?

                           JACOB
                 No.

                           DAVID
                 Been in any state or federal program?

                           JACOB
                 No.

                           KAREN
                 Just for a little while.  So he can get 
                 his bearings.

                           DAVID
                 Got any ID?

       Jacob reaches for his back pocket - it's empty.  He shakes 
       his head "no".

                           MARY
                     (to David)
                 I think we can help him out, honey.  The 
                 budget's tight, but we can't turn down 
                 someone in need.

       David doesn't acknowledge his wife, he just stares at Jacob 
       sternly.  Karen bites her nails.  Then David sits down and 
       starts to lecture.

                           DAVID
                 Okay.  You got three, maybe four days to 
                 rest up while we try and find a more 
                 permanent arrangement for you.  But his 
                 isn't going to be a free ride.  We're 
                 part of a community summer work project 
                 and eighty percent of the money you make 
                 goes to the house.  Everybody works - and 
                 that includes you.  Are you on drugs?

                           JACOB
                 No.

                           DAVID
                 Good.  If I catch anything stronger then 
                 an aspirin on you, you're outta here.  No 
                 arguments.  You got that straight?

                           JACOB
                 Yes, sir.

                           DAVID
                 Okay.  Dinner in two hours.  Why don't 
                 you go meet the rest of the gang.

                           KAREN
                 Thanks, David.

                           MARY
                 I'll go fix up the spare bed in Wesley's 
                 room.

       David gets up.  He gives Jacob a final once-over.

                           DAVID
                 And take a shower, for chrissakes.

       David leaves the room.  Karen gives Jacob a huge grin.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - THE TV ROOM - DAY

       Karen leads Jacob into the room.  There are two teenagers on 
       the couch: WESLEY is a fifteen-year old, curly hair, kind of 
       small.  GINA is also fifteen, brunette hair, seems pretty 
       happy.

                           KAREN
                 Hey, guys, I got someone for you to meet.  
                 This is Jacob.  Jacob, this is Wesley and 
                 Gina.

                           JACOB
                 Hi.

                           WESLEY
                 Welcome to fun central.

                           KAREN
                 He's going to be staying with us for a 
                 while.

                           GINA
                 Oh yeah?  How'd you get through the 
                 blockade?

       Another kid, SCOTT, pops into the room.  He's sixteen, dark 
       hair, with a tough-guy I could give a shit attitude.  He 
       doesn't seem to care about anybody in the room, except for 
       Karen.

                           SCOTT
                 Hey, beautiful.  How's it going?

                           KAREN
                 Hi, Scott.

       Scott notices Jacob and frowns.  Karen is a little annoyed.

                           SCOTT
                 Who's Barney Rubble?

                           KAREN
                 This is Jacob Johnson.  He's a new 
                 resident.  At least temporarily.

                           SCOTT
                 He better not be rooming with me.  I 
                 value my privacy.

                           KAREN
                 No, I believe that honor goes to Wesley.

                           WESLEY
                 Good.  I could use the company.

                           SCOTT
                 So what's your story?  Divorce?  Custody 
                 battle?  Your parents just plain 
                 assholes?

                           JACOB
                 They're dead.

                           KAREN
                 Mellow out, Scott.  Give him a chance to 
                 settle in.

                           SCOTT
                 Just curious.

       Scott reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out a pack of 
       cigarettes.  As he lights one up, Wesley's cheerful attitude 
       suddenly turns grim.  He gets up from the couch and quickly 
       leaves the room.  Karen gives Scott an angry look.

                           JACOB
                 Is he alright?

                           SCOTT
                 He'll be fine.  He just has a problem 
                 with cigarettes.

                           GINA
                 His parents used to use them as a sick 
                 kind of discipline.  That's why he's 
                 here.

                           JACOB
                 If you know that, then why do you smoke 
                 in front of him?

                           SCOTT
                 It's not my problem.

       This really pisses Jacob off.  These two are not going to get 
       along very well.

                           JACOB
                 Just what is YOUR problem, then?

                           SCOTT
                 I took care of my problem.  That's why 
                 I'M here.

       Scott lets out an aloof puff of smoke and leaves.  Jacob 
       gives Karen a confused glance.

                           KAREN
                 His dad used to beat him.  One day he 
                 couldn't take it any more.

                           JACOB
                 What happened?

                           KAREN
                 He killed him with his father's gun.  
                 Self-defense.

       Jacob sits down on the couch and lets that sink in.  Gina 
       scootches away from him on the couch, then gives him a glum 
       look.

                           GINA
                 Everyone here has a fun tale to tell.  
                 Isn't that right, Karen?

       Karen is staring out the window.  She has that spaced-out 
       expression we saw before when she was hiding behind the bush.

                           KAREN
                 Yeah.  Right.

       No one has anything left to say.  Gina turns the sound on the 
       TV back up as the three sad kids start to watch cartoons.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - THE TV ROOM - NIGHT

       Jacob is alone in the dark watching some kind of NICK AT 
       NIGHT b&w sit-com re-run.  A cheerful family lovingly banters 
       away on the flickering tube.  Jacob just stares blankly.

       Karen sleepily shows up at the doorway in a long tee-shirt 
       with a glass of milk.

                           KAREN
                 Why don't you go to bed?

                           JACOB
                 I can't sleep.

                           KAREN
                 You need to talk?

                           JACOB
                 No.  I'm fine.  Thanks.

       Karen gives him a worried look and heads off to bed.  Jacob 
       continues watching TV with a creepy glean in his tired eyes.

       INT. OLD WAREHOUSE - DAY

       The kids are here cleaning up the building.  The guys throw 
       rotted lumber into trash bins while the girls sweep up.  We 
       catch Jacob and Scott tossing some debris into a wheelbarrow.  
       Jacob looks pretty ragged.

                           SCOTT
                 Come on.  Let's hop to it.  Gotta make 
                 way for those new indoor tennis courts.  
                 The fate of the world lies in the 
                 balance.  Okay, this load's full.

       Jacob grabs the handles of the wheelbarrow and shakily picks 
       it up.  Scott sneers.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 You got that?

                           JACOB
                 Yeah, no problem.

                           SCOTT
                 I don't know.  Maybe you should think 
                 about switching to de-caf or something.

       Jacob ignores him and pushes the wheelbarrow along.  Scott 
       takes some time off to smoke a cigarette.  He spots Karen 
       across the room bending over with a dustbin.  Scott lingers 
       on this view for a long time.

       AT A DUMPSTER

       Jacob pulls up with the wheelbarrow and starts to unload the 
       junk.  Gina is next to the dumpster sweeping.  She tries to 
       push a large crate aside by herself, but slips and falls.

       Jacob jumps over to her, reaches out, and grabs her arm to 
       help her up.

                           JACOB
                 You okay?

       Gina SCREAMS.

                           GINA
                 No!  Yes!  Let go of me!

       She shakes off his grip and he jumps back.  She runs away 
       with a wild look in her eyes as Karen steps up to a confused 
       Jacob.

                           KAREN
                 She doesn't like to be touched.

                           JACOB
                 No shit!

                           KAREN
                 Don't take it personally.  It's not her 
                 fault.

                           JACOB
                 What happened to her?

                           KAREN
                 Her mother was a hooker.  She forced Gina 
                 to carry on the tradition.  When she was 
                 thirteen...

                           JACOB
                 Jesus.

       Jacob looks off at Gina with genuine concern.  Karen gives 
       him the same expression.

                           KAREN
                 You look terrible.

                           JACOB
                     (smiling)
                 Thanks.

                           KAREN
                 I'm sorry...I just wish you'd tell me 
                 what happened to you, that's all.

                           JACOB
                 I can't talk about it right now.  I'll 
                 tell you later.  I promise.

                           KAREN
                 Okay.  Why don't you sit and rest for a 
                 bit.  The supervisor's not around.  You 
                 look like you could use it.

                           JACOB
                 I think I will.

       He gives her a gentle squeeze on the forearm, and Karen likes 
       it.  Jacob spots a pile of wood next to a wall and heads off 
       for it.

       ON SCOTT

       He's watched the entire interchange between Jacob and Karen, 
       and he DOESN'T like it.

       WITH JACOB

       as he goes around the stack of lumber and sits down facing 
       the brick wall.  He lets out a heavy sigh and stares at the 
       inside of the building.

       JACOB'S POV - THE BRICK WALL

       sits there quietly for a few beats until:

       IT EXPLODES

       Bricks fly out at us as a gaping hole blows into the wall 
       revealing nothing but BLACKNESS and our shot MOVES through:

       DREAM FLASHES - NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD

       Horrifying apparitions and images ZOOM by us.  Gloomy 
       buildings under a pitch black sky.  MUTANTS and twisted 
       MONSTERS.  Shadowy streets and dark alleyways.  And FIVE 
       RAZOR-BLADE FINGERS suddenly ripping right through the sky 
       and down upon us as a VOICE rings out.

                           VOICE
                 Hey, you!

       INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - ON JACOB

       Jacob's eyes are closed as a SUPERVISOR looms above him.

                           SUPERVISOR
                 No slacking off.  Back to work.

       The boy's eyes snap open and he jumps to his feet like a 
       babbling crazy man.

                           JACOB
                 What!  Jesus fucking...Oh, shit!

                           SUPERVISOR
                 Whoa!  Get a grip, boy.

       The supervisor backs off from Jacob as he slowly gets used to 
       reality again.

                           JACOB
                 Huh?  What's going on?

                           SUPERVISOR
                 Nothing.  That's the problem.  Now that 
                 you've gotten your beauty rest, let's see 
                 if you can change it, okay?

       Jacob calms down and nods.  He walks away, snatching a 
       nervous glance at the perfectly normal brick wall.

       EXT. FOSTER HOME - NIGHT

       We watch as various lit windows go dark and the residents of 
       the house go to bed.

       INT. WESLEY & JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

       Wesley is getting in bed.  Jacob is sitting in a chair 
       staring out the window.  Wes switches off the lights and 
       turns to Jacob.

                           WESLEY
                 Aren't you going to bed?

                           JACOB
                 I'm not tired.

                           WESLEY
                 Bullshit.  If you looked any more tired, 
                 you'd be dead.

       Jacob cracks a weary smile in the darkness.

                           JACOB
                 That's right.

                           WESLEY
                 You gotta sleep, man.

                           JACOB
                 Why?  Who says?  You know, people don't 
                 even really know why we sleep.  They 
                 haven't found any physical reason for it.

                           WESLEY
                 But they do know that you go nuts if you 
                 don't.

                           JACOB
                 Sharks don't sleep.  They can't pump 
                 water through their gills on their own.  
                 They have to always keep moving.  If they 
                 stop, they can't breath.  If they go to 
                 sleep, they die.

                           WESLEY
                 You're not a shark.

                           JACOB
                 I know.  I'm just a kid.  Don't worry 
                 about me, Wes.  Go to sleep.

       Wesley shakes his head and gets under the covers.  Jacob 
       continues to stare out the window, desperately trying to keep 
       his eyes open.

       JACOB'S POV - THROUGH WINDOW

       the trees sway quietly in the breeze outside.  There is a 
       pause.  Then we are suddenly PULLED THROUGH THE WINDOW, 
       SMASHING glass, careening back into:

       DREAM FLASH - NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD

       We SAIL through the gloomy air, over the creepy buildings.  
       And suddenly DIP DOWN, right for the street, and end up 
       CRUISING three inches off the asphalt, really ripping down 
       the road until we grind to a SUDDEN HALT.  Right in front of:

       FREDDY'S FEET.  Our shot TILTS UP.  Freddy looms above us and 
       grins.

                           FREDDY
                 You can't stay awake forever, boy!

       He LAUGHS, his mouth gaping wide, and then splitting open 
       impossibly wider.  Something starts pouring out of his mouth, 
       right at us.

       Hundreds of GIANT BUGS spew down upon us, covering us 
       completely as everything goes to BLACK and we:

       INT. WESLEY & JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

       ON JACOB

       his eyes are open, his mouth is hanging in a SILENT SCREAM.  
       It looks like his head is about to explode.  He lifts his 
       hand up to his face.  He's holding an eight-inch long MONSTER 
       BUG.

       Jacob SCREAMS out loud this time, tosses the mutant insect 
       away.  It lands on a windowsill and escapes out the opening. 

       Jacob jumps to his feet, sending his chair tumbling backwards 
       with a CRASH.  He shakes and moans, a little drool dripping 
       down his chin.

       Wesley sits up with a start and stares at Jacob.

                           WESLEY
                 I told you you'd go nuts!

       Jacob catches his breath, gives Wes a dead serious look.

                           JACOB
                 Get everybody else.  I have to tell them 
                 something.

                           WESLEY
                 In the middle of the night?

                           JACOB
                 I MEAN it!

       Wesley is shocked by Jacob's manic state and jumps out of 
       bed.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM - NIGHT

       Five kids are gathered around the room in various stages of 
       sleepy grumpiness and annoyed disbelief.  Jacob paces back 
       and forth.

                           SCOTT
                 I don't get it.  Is this guy alive or 
                 dead?

                           JACOB
                 He's neither.  He haunts your dreams and 
                 if he kills you, you die for real.

       Wesley, the most gullible of the group, looks pretty scared.

                           WESLEY
                 I haven't dreamed of him. I have 
                 nightmares like you wouldn't believe, but 
                 never of this guy.

                           SCOTT
                 That's because this all rates an eleven 
                 on the bullshit meter!  I don't know why 
                 we have to listen to this crap.  You're 
                 scaring the hell out of Wes here.

                           GINA
                 Keep your voice down.

                           SCOTT
                 It doesn't matter.  The Ross's sleep like 
                 rocks, which is what we all should be 
                 doing.

                           JACOB
                 I know this sounds crazy, but I swear 
                 it's true.  I went to bed one night and 
                 woke up in the middle of the road.  
                 Freddy Krueger killed my mother, blasted 
                 my whole town into his nightmare, and, 
                 worst of all, I think he wants to use me 
                 to kill more kids and bring more towns 
                 into his world.

                           KAREN
                 How?

                           JACOB
                 I'm not sure.  I think I'm some kind of 
                 carrier.  He's somehow inside me and as 
                 soon as I fall deep enough into sleep 
                 he'll be let loose.  You guys were great 
                 to take me in.  I just don't want to 
                 thank you by getting you all killed.

       Scott gets up and goes to a desk.  He pulls out a map and 
       shows it to Jacob.

                           SCOTT
                 Okay.  Show me Springwood.

       Jacob looks at the map and points.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 There's nothing there.

                           JACOB
                 That's what I've been trying to tell you.

                           SCOTT
                 There's NEVER been a town there.  

                           JACOB
                 That's how YOU see it.  I was part of the 
                 nightmare, so I'm the only one who 
                 notices the difference.

       Scott stares at Jacob.  He actually grows sympathetic.

                           SCOTT
                 Look, Jacob.  You don't have to convince 
                 us that nightmares are real.  Everybody 
                 in this room has been through one.  And 
                 some of us are still living it.  But the 
                 thing is, we know it's just in our heads 
                 now.  It can be just as bad as the real 
                 thing was, but it's still only a memory.  
                 It can't hurt us physically, unless we do 
                 the hurting ourselves.

                           GINA
                 And we don't want to see you get hurt.

                           WESLEY
                 We know it gets crazy.  And we'll help 
                 out the best we can.

                           SCOTT
                 But this is just too hard to believe.

       Jacob plops down on the couch, defeated.  He hangs his head 
       while the kids start to get up.  Wesley gives him a pat on 
       the back as he, Scott, and Gina leave.  But Karen is still 
       here.

       She sits next to a window with a faraway look in her eyes.  
       Jacob looks up at her.

                           JACOB
                 You don't believe me, either, do you?

                           KAREN
                 I don't know.

                           JACOB
                 Why are you still here?

                           KAREN
                 I'm not sure.  I guess, I guess I see a 
                 lot of me in you.

                           JACOB
                 Feels good to see someone more fucked up 
                 than yourself, huh?

       Karen smiles and sits down next to him.

                           KAREN
                 Yeah.  That must be it.

                           JACOB
                 But you haven't told me why you're here 
                 at this place.

                           KAREN
                 I can't talk about it right now.  Maybe 
                 later.  Do you want me to stay with you?

                           JACOB
                 Yeah, that'd be great.  Don't let me 
                 sleep, okay?

                           KAREN
                 I'll do my best.

       She reaches for the remote control and flicks on the TV, 
       moving a little closer to Jacob when she sits back into the 
       couch.  The two of them watch the screen with glassy eyes.

                           KAREN (cont'd)
                 Thank God for cable TV.

                           JACOB
                 Yeah.  Thank God.

       They continue to watch in silence as Karen takes hold of 
       Jacob's hand.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - THE TV ROOM - MORNING

       We are ON KAREN as she sleeps curled up on the couch.  Jacob 
       is in the background putting on his shoes.  He has a brown 
       paper bag with him.

       Jacob gets up, grabs his bag, and steps over to Karen.  He 
       gently pulls a lock of hair away from her face.  Then he 
       heads for the front door.

       EXT. FOSTER HOME - FRONT PORCH - DAY

       Jacob walks out the door and closes it behind him.  He 
       crosses to the porch steps and stops.  He has to hold onto a 
       porch column just to keep standing.

       Karen appears behind him.  Jacob jumps a bit.

                           KAREN
                 Where are you going?

                           JACOB
                 I'm leaving.

                           KAREN
                 Why?

                           JACOB
                 He can't hurt you if I'm gone.  Maybe 
                 I'll go to the desert or something.  I'll 
                 lie down in the middle of nowhere and 
                 finally get some sleep.  Krueger can feed 
                 of the dreams of snakes and vultures.

                           KAREN
                 Fine.  You're just going to take off 
                 then...

       Karen has an angry expression on his face.  Jacob gives her a 
       pained look.

                           JACOB
                 Don't do this to me.  I'm just trying to 
                 protect you and the others.

                           KAREN
                 Right.  You blow into town and then blow 
                 right out.  Terrific.

                           JACOB
                 I don't understand why you're so mad at 
                 me.

                           KAREN
                 You just don't get it, do you?

                           JACOB
                 Get what?

       Karen, though still very angry, looks like she's about to 
       cry.  Jacob, confused, sits down on the porch steps.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Maybe I'm crazy.

                           KAREN
                 Running away doesn't help.

       He sighs and smiles a bit.

                           JACOB
                 And you're going to convince me, huh?

                           KAREN
                 Maybe.

       This time Karen smiles.  Jacob looks at her and sighs.  Then 
       he yawns.

                           KAREN (cont'd)
                 I'm going to make some coffee.  You 
                 promise not to move?

                           JACOB
                 Yeah.  Sure.

       Karen jumps and heads back into the house.  Jacob stares at 
       the grass in front of him, his eyes heavy.

       JACOB'S POV - THE LAWN

       A bush sits there doing nothing.  Until it suddenly comes TO 
       LIFE.  Its leaves start to shrivel, the lawn turns brown, the 
       sky turns dark.  Everything changes and turns into

       DREAM FLASH - NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD

       We're in a different front yard in a different town, in a 
       different dimension.

       The mutant bush starts to change, sprout legs, grow arms, 
       become human.  

       ALICE

       Her body takes shape as she reaches out a pleading arm to us.

                           ALICE
                 Jacob!  Help me!

       She's fully formed now.  And Freddy bursts out from the 
       ground behind her.  He grabs Alice, reaches his knife arm 
       around

                           ALICE (cont'd)
                 No-o-o-o-o!

       Her words are cut off as Krueger jams his blades in her gut 
       and we re-live her death once more.  But it's even worse this 
       time.

       Blood POURS from Alice like a burst fire hydrant, spraying 
       and showering the entire nightmare lawn like a human 
       sprinkler.  Freddy LAUGHS.

                           FREDDY
                 Say it, don't spray it, huh, Jacob?  Come 
                 and join the fun!

                           JACOB (O.S.)
                 NOOOOOOO!

       Jacob's voice rips through the scene as everything starts to 
       BLUR RED.

       EXT. FOSTER HOME - FRONT LAWN - DAY

       Jacob is lying in the grass, violently shaking.  Karen drops 
       down next to him.

                           KAREN
                 Jacob!

                           JACOB
                 Nooooo!

       His body jerks around as if caught in the throes of an 
       epileptic seizure.  He SHRIEKS, ignoring Karen completely, 
       and continues to shriek and scream and yell and shake.  Like 
       he's never going to stop.

       EXT. MR. HOPKINS' FRONT DOOR - DAY

       We're directly across the street from the Foster Home as 
       Jacob's cries echo through the neighborhood.  Mr. Hopkins 
       opens the front door.  He sees what's going on, scowls, and 
       yells into his house.

                           MR. HOPKINS
                 I told you!  It's an overdose!  Jesus 
                 Christ, I saw this coming.  Call 9-1-1!

       He watches the commotion growing across the street, and never 
       once moves to help.

       EXT. FOSTER HOME - MOMENTS LATER

       Jacob is being strapped into a stretcher, babbling 
       incoherently.  The residents of the Foster Home stand off to 
       the side while neighbors gawk from the street.  Karen is next 
       to the AMBULANCE GUYS looking frantic.

                           JACOB
                 No!  Don't let them take me!

                           KAREN
                 Jacob, it'll be alright.

                           AMBULANCE GUY #1
                 Calm down, kid.  We'll take care of you.

       Jacob grabs the Ambulance Guy.

                           JACOB
                 You don't understand!  Let me go!

       The ambulance guy straps Jacob's arm down.  Mr. Ross grabs 
       Karen and pulls her away as they start loading the crazed 
       teenager into the ambulance.  Scott shakes his head.  Wesley 
       looks terrified.  Gina keeps her distance from any human.  
       Karen can't take it and runs into the house.  Mr. Ross 
       frowns.

                           DAVID
                 This is just what we need.

       The ambulance drives away as the gathered crowd stares at the 
       kids angrily.

       INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

       Jacob yells and struggles as an Ambulance Guy prepares a 
       syringe for injection.

                           JACOB
                 Don't fucking put me under!  You'll set 
                 him free!

       The ambulance guy holds Jacob down and slams the needle home. 
       Jacob screams and his eyes start to glass over.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 He'll kill them all...

       Jacob's head starts to go limp.  A VOICE rings out in the 
       van, a voice only Jacob hears:

                           FREDDY (O.S.)
                 Every town as an Elm Street!

       LAUGHTER echoes as Jacob turns his head towards a window.

       EXT. A STREET CORNER - DAY

       The ambulance zooms by.  All is quiet for a second until 
       CRASH! A twisted rusty sign post erupts out of the sidewalk 
       and settles at an ugly angle.

       It's an ELM ST. sign.

       INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

       We PULL BACK from a wide awake Jacob, who is now suddenly 
       alone in the van.  Outside the window there is only darkness.  
       Jacob twists and struggles on the stretcher as

       CLANG! the ambulance doors crash open revealing BLACKNESS and 
       KA-BOOM!  the stretcher is shot out of the van like a 
       cannonball.

       INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

       The stretcher with Jacob BLASTS through a wall and starts to 
       race across the floor of the building that Jacob had been 
       sweeping up the day before.

       It careens along, actually taking a few turns, like it has a 
       mind of its own, heading for a shallow pit in the middle of 
       the warehouse.

       The stretcher hits the pit, drops a bit, swings up violently, 
       and stops in a vertical position like a rake that has been 
       stepped on AND A BLACK HUMAN SHAPE shoots out of Jacob's body 
       from intertial force, staying upright as it slides across the 
       floor, spins, stops, then changes into:

       FREDDY KRUEGER

       Freddy has his hands on his hips and a grin on his face.

                           FREDDY
                 Thanks for the lift, kid!

       He saunters up to Jacob who is still strapped to the vertical 
       stretcher.  Krueger waves his knives and wiggles his tongue.

                           JACOB
                 What do you want from me?

                           FREDDY
                 I already got it!  The rest I'm going to 
                 get from your new little friends.

                           JACOB
                 Leave them alone!

                           FREDDY
                 It's my duty to clean up the 
                 neighborhood!

                           JACOB
                 What have you done with my town?

                           FREDDY
                 Aw, poor baby's homesick, isn't he?  
                 Don't worry.  We'll all be one happy 
                 family soon.  Wanna be the first recruit?

       Freddy raises his blades and SWINGS.  The straps around Jacob 
       drop away as his body falls to the floor.  He scrambles to 
       his feet and starts to RUN.

       Freddy laughs

       WITH JACOB - RUNNING

       as he heads for a door.  Before he gets there, the door 
       swings open and Freddy leans casually in his way.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 What's the matter?  Don't want to be part 
                 of my expansion project?

       Jacob turns right around and races back across the warehouse.

       AT THE DUMPSTER

       Jacob races around to the other side and there's Krueger 
       again.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Today, Rosedale.  Tomorrow, the world!

                           JACOB
                 Over my dead body!

                           FREDDY
                 As you wish.

       Freddy cranks up his knives and looms over Jacob.  And three 
       FLASHES OF LIGHT blast out behind the boy.  Jacob rolls away 
       as Freddy holds up an arm to block the blinding glare.  The 
       light fades.  The DREAM POLICE have arrived.

       We'll call the small one SOUND COP.  He stands there 
       motionless as a loud and horrible GROWING noise emanates from 
       his clenched teeth.  This guy's bark is worse than his bite.

       The female in black is BLADE COP.  From nowhere she produces 
       two nasty-looking knives, one in each hand.  She spins the 
       blades in the air like an expert Samurai.

       The large one we'll call POWER COP.  He reaches out for the 
       dumpster, and with one hand sends it tumbling away with a 
       CRASH.  Freddy frowns.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Uh oh. Too many parking tickets.

       The Dream Police fan out around Krueger, surrounding him.  
       Power Cop leaps at Freddy, grabs him and TOSSES him in the 
       air.  Freddy tumbles, rolls and bounces right back up on his 
       feet.  Right next to BLADE.

       She swings her knives.  Freddy dodges.  Swings hi own blades 
       at her.  She ducks.  Freddy spins again.  Right towards:

       SOUND COP.  The short man in black opens his mouth and a 
       sound like a foghorn at a rock concert BLARES OUT.  The force 
       of it hitting Freddy like a fist.

       Freddy bounces back.  And once again he nimbly pops up.  He 
       glares at the Dream Police.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Don't interfere!

                           BLADE COP
                 We have to.

                           SOUND COP
                 It's our job.

                           FREDDY
                 Get a new one.

       And Freddy starts to SPIN.  Slowly at first, then faster and 
       faster, until his image starts to BLUR.

       The Police circle the whirling image, holding back to see 
       what will happen next.  Krueger stops spinning.  And his 
       clothes are different.  His red and green stripes have been 
       replaced by black and white ones.  There is a number printed 
       across his chest.  He's dressed like a CONVICT.  Freddy 
       grins.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Time to blow this joint.

       BOOM!  A hole is suddenly blown in the high ceiling above 
       Krueger.  The building is suddenly filled with the beams of 
       moving SPOTLIGHTS and the sound of blasting SIRENS.

       A rope falls down through the hole.  Freddy grabs it and 
       WHOOSH! he's yanked up.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 You'll never get me, coppers!

       and away he's gone.  After a few seconds the spotlights fade 
       away and the sirens die.  The Dream Police look up seemingly 
       unsure of their next action.  Then Power Cop kicks a pile of 
       lumber, sending wood flying dozens of yards away.

                           POWER COP
                 Goddamnit!

       Sound Cop shakes his head.  Blade looks frustrated.  Jacob 
       steps up behind them.

                           JACOB
                 Alright...just who the hell are you guys?

       The black-clad trio turn around in unison and look at Jacob.  
       There is a pause.  Then:

                           BLADE COP
                 We're the Dream Police.

       Jacob almost laughs.

                           JACOB
                 The what?

                           POWER COP
                 The Dream Police.  Didn't you hear her, 
                 man?

       Power Cop turns to Sound Cop and flips up his visor revealing 
       his face.  He's a sixteen-year old black boy.  Heavyset 
       features, sweat dripping down his cheeks.  He's KINCAID from 
       NIGHTMARE 3.  And he's pissed.

                           POWER COP (cont'd)
                 We try and save this guy's ass and then 
                 he goes off and cops an attitude.

       Sound Cop flips up his helmet.  He's JOEY, the former mute 
       boy.

                           SOUND COP
                 I think you're the wrong guy to talk 
                 about attitudes.

                           BLADE COP
                 Guys, guys.  This is getting us nowhere.

       She takes her helmet completely off, long dark hair tumbling 
       over her shoulders.  It's TARYN, the ex-junkie.  These three, 
       they're the Dream Warriors.  Or at least they used to be. 

                           JACOB
                 Hello?  May I butt in here and ask some 
                 more stupid questions?

       The three of them stop bickering and turn to Jacob.  Blade 
       walks up to Jacob.  Her two partners assume position behind 
       her.

                           BLADE COP
                 We don't know much more than you do.  
                 What we do know is that we've been 
                 recruited...

                           JACOB
                 By who?

                           SOUND COP
                 We don't know.

                           JACOB
                 Why?

                           BLADE COP
                 I think that's obvious.

                           POWER COP
                 The shit's about to hit the fan.

                           SOUND COP
                 Krueger's discovered new powers.

                           BLADE COP
                 He's ripped a hole between dreams and 
                 reality.

                           POWER COP
                 Our own powers have been amplified.

                           SOUND COP
                 We only hope it will be enough.

                           BLADE COP
                 But we're going to need your help.

                           JACOB
                 Me?  What can I do?  Just who are you 
                 guys...really?

       Blade puts her helmet back on.  Her face turns grim.

                           BLADE COP
                 We were like you.  We fought Freddy 
                 Krueger many years ago.  Our souls were 
                 released from his grip.  No we're back to 
                 try again.

       All three of them drop their visors down at the same time.

                           JACOB
                 I still don't understand what...

       Jacob's voice starts to GARBLE. He keeps trying to talk but 
       the words come out twisted and clipped.  He raises a hand to 
       his throat.  The hand is transparent.  Jacob looks at his 
       body as it slowly starts to disappear and now he's completely 
       mute.

                           SOUND COP
                 Freddy Krueger can't hurt us anymore.

                           POWER COP
                 Because we're already dead.

       Jacob vanishes completely.

       INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

       Jacob opens his eyes.  He's in bed, dressed in a white smock.  
       A DOCTOR stands next to him with a clipboard in hand.

                           JACOB
                 What's going on?

                           DOCTOR
                 Just relax, everything's fine.

                           JACOB
                 That's what you say...

                           DOCTOR
                 You're lucky you're here instead of 
                 juvenile hall.  You put up quite a fight.  
                 But you're clean.  No traces of drugs or 
                 alcohol in your blood.

                           JACOB
                 I could've told you that.

       Jacob starts getting out of bed.

                           DOCTOR
                 Hold on there.

                           JACOB
                 You said I was fine.  I have to get back.  
                 My friends are in trouble.

                           DOCTOR
                 I said you weren't on drugs, but I never 
                 said you were fine.  You're suffering 
                 from extreme fatigue and stress that 
                 manifested itself into one hell of an 
                 anxiety attack.  At least that's what we 
                 hope it is.  You had a major seizure, 
                 Jacob.

                           JACOB
                 You don't understand.  This whole town is 
                 in danger.

                           DOCTOR
                 We're keeping you here for observation.  
                 You're not going anywhere tonight.

                           JACOB
                 You can't do that.  You don't have the 
                 right!

                           DOCTOR
                 Yes we do.  Your temporary guardian, Mr. 
                 Ross, signed all the papers.  If you're 
                 okay in the morning we might let you go 
                 home.  Until then, you're bed bound.

                           JACOB
                 But...

                           DOCTOR
                 We took off the restraints.  Do you want 
                 us to put them back on?

       Jacob drops back in bed.  The doctor goes to the door and 
       turns out the lights.

                           DAVID
                 Sleep.

       He closes the door behind him...

                           JACOB
                 Shit...

       and we hear it LOCK

                                                            CUT TO:

       A CRAZED LUNATIC

       suddenly SCREAMING into the lens with desperation.  Dark 
       circles under bloodshot eyes, hair matted with sweat.  A guy 
       not having a good day.  WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

       The man is tightly bound in a regulation straight-jacket in a 
       tiny, claustrophobic holding cell.  We can now tell that the 
       image is in BLACK AND WHITE.  We continue PULLING BACK

       INT. FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM - NIGHT

       Gina sits on the couch with a stark white blanket on her lap, 
       watching a b&w 1940's potboiler with something less than 
       enthusiasm.  Wesley appears in the doorway, checking out the 
       source of the screaming.  He looks at Gina, who tosses the 
       blanket aside and rises, frowning.  The lunatic on television 
       continues his blood-curdling SHRIEKS.

                           GINA
                 Nice movie, huh?  And I came in here to 
                 mellow out.

       She smiles at Wes as she exits.

                           GINA (cont'd)
                 It's all yours.

       Wesley murmurs a goodnight, then looks back at the screen:

       ON THE TV

       Some orderlies enter the lunatic's cell and attempt to sedate 
       him as he thrashes violently, SCREAMING bloody murder.  It is 
       gritty and awful but somehow riveting.

       WESLEY

       moves to the couch, clearly mesmerized by the scene.  He 
       curls up, absently pulling the white blanket around him as he 
       watches:

       ON THE TV

       The orderlies in the movie manage to get the needle into 
       their patient, who MOANS and SOBS pathetically.

                           ORDERLY ON TV
                 Relax, will ya, buddy? Everything's gonna 
                 be just swell.

       The second orderly leans on a wall and pulls out a pack of 
       cigarettes from the pocket of his scrubs.  (He bears a 
       suspicious resemblance to ROBERT ENGLUND.)

       WESLEY

       vaguely tenses at this and absently pulls the blanket more 
       tightly around him to compensate, like a cocoon.

       ON THE TV

       The second orderly smiles.

                           SECOND ORDERLY
                 Yeah, mac.  You've just had a hard day, 
                 that's all.

       The orderly produces a pack of matches.  He goes to the 
       lunatic on the cot, and LIGHTS the match off the guy's 
       forehead.  As the match FLARES, the lunatic SCREAMS.

       CLOSE ON WESLEY

       he shuts his eyes tensely as the SOUND is magnified, becoming 
       a sudden ROAR that fills the room.

       Wesley blinks his eyes open, looks around from his blanket 
       cocoon.  Whatever that last sound was, it did NOT come from 
       the TV.

       Beads of sweat line his upper lip as he nervously glances 
       about the room.  It remains quiet, serene.  Deciding it was 
       his imagination reacting to the scene on TV, Wesley nestles 
       back on the couch, laying down now as the CAMERA MOVES TO 
       REVEAL

       The carpet at the edge of the room is bunched up as though 
       the walls of the room itself have budged a few inches inward.

       BACK ON THE TV the second orderly lights his cigarette as he 
       hands the pack to the first.  They both look down at the 
       madman as they savor their cigarettes.  

                           ORDERLY ON TV
                 You heard the man, Wesley.  Just relax.  
                 Have a smoke with us.

       Wesley's brow furrows, reacting to the coincidence.  Then he 
       stiffens as the two orderlies in the movie begin to hold the 
       lit cigarettes over the lunatic's face

                           SECOND ORDERLY
                 Yeah, Wesley.  Have a smoke.

       OUR Wesley has seen about enough of this movie.  He starts to 
       get up

                           WESLEY
                 Fuck this.

       but finds that he can't move.  The white blanket around him 
       restraining him tightly like the straight-jacket on TV.  He 
       squirms and struggles.

                           WESLEY (cont'd)
                 Hey.

       He struggles harder now, but to no avail.  He's wrapped 
       tight, like a cigarette.

       ON THE TV the two orderlies torment the straight-jacketed 
       lunatic, poking his face with their lit cigarettes.  As the 
       lunatic SCREAMS, the screams become magnified, again becoming 
       that loud, deafening ROAR we heard before.  Wesley squirms in 
       his blanket/ straight-jacket, he jerks his head around, 
       SEEING with each of the man's SCREAMS, the walls of the room 
       SHUDDER INWARD and 

       Wesley's EYES WIDEN with horror as he realizes not only is he 
       TRAPPED like a sardine in his stark white blanket, but the 
       walls of the room are starting to CLOSE IN on him.  He SPINS 
       back to the TV set, where:

       The first orderly is now looking AT US.  Wesley REACTS as he 
       notices something familiar about the man's face.

                           FIRST ORDERLY
                 Relax, Wesley.

                           WESLEY
                 Dad?

       The second orderly BOLTS into view.  He has become Freddy 
       Krueger.

                           FREDDY
                 Yeah, Wesley.  Everything's gonna be 
                 great!  Just have a smoke on us!

       As they hold their smokes out TOWARD US, their arms PROTRUDE 
       FROM THE TV SET with their lit cigarettes.

       Wesley SCREAMS and jerks his head away from TV and he HITS 
       the floor with an ugly THUMP.  The wind knocked out of him.  
       He rolls.  The couch is GONE.

       As he squirms and struggles to escape his white cocoon, the 
       frightened boy looks around and sees that everything in the 
       room - furniture, carpet, TV, even the door - are all gone, 
       leaving just the white walls SLOWLY CLOSING IN ON HIM.

       Then we see that on the floor all around Wesley are long, 
       cylindrical white objects.  Clearly, they resemble GIANT 
       CIGARETTES, and Wesley - wrapped neck-to-toe in his white 
       blanket cocoon - looks just like one of them.

       He continues to squirm and SCREAM as the walls CLOSE IN from 
       all sides -- closer -- CLOSER -- pushing the long white 
       things toward him, around him, bunching them together until 
       they are in a tight cluster, as the room CRUNCHES IN TIGHTLY, 
       blocking whatever light source there is, until all Wesley can 
       do is SCREAM one last time, and

       The screen goes BLACK.

       After a few beats, we hear a huge, deafening RIPPING SOUND, 
       and a new LIGHT SOURCE appears as  Wesley looks up, eyes wide 
       with unspeakable horror as the giant, scarred face of FREDDY 
       looms over him, grinning, and we:

       INT. FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM

       The room is back to normal, but not the occupant.  Freddy 
       Krueger now stands here alone.  He has just peeled the 
       wrapper off a pack of cigarettes of which Wesley has become 
       one.

                           FREDDY
                 Didn't Daddy ever tell you what the 
                 Surgeon General says...?

       Krueger reaches in and pulls the tiny Wesley out of the pack.  
       As before, Wesley is immobile, helpless.  Freddy holds him 
       between two fingers.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Smoking's bad for your health!

       Freddy looks around, as if searching for something, then 
       beams as he reaches into the air and...

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Ah!  A match made in heaven!

       He produces a puny version of WESLEY'S FATHER In one hand.  
       His body is straight and rigid, like a match stick.

       Freddy places his thumb on the stiff man's head, and flicks 
       his thumbnail, causing the man's skull to BURST INTO FLAME, 
       an evil grin spanning Wesley's Father's face.

       He brings the Father-Match to what would be Wesley's tiny 
       feet, and lights the end.

       VERY CLOSE ON FREDDY'S HAND

       Wesley SCREAMS as Freddy tosses the FATHER-MATCH and brings 
       the teenager's little head up to his fire-scarred lips.

       The boy is enveloped by the massive cracked opening as Freddy 
       takes a huge drag off of Wesley's head. Where his feet should 
       be, the tip of the Wesley-Cig GLOWS RED, causing Wesley to 
       SCREAM with supernatural pain.  Smoke billows from Freddy's 
       nose and mouth.  He savors it.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Ahhhh!  Now we're smokin'!

       He CACKLES horribly as he continues to suck on the Wesley-
       Cig.  With each puff, Wesley's white-wrapped body becomes 
       slat-black ash.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 What's your sign, Wesley?  It wouldn't be 
                 Cancer, would it?

       In between his demonic CACKLES, Freddy DRAGS on the Wesley-
       Cig, each puff turning more of Wesley into ash until all but 
       his head is black and charred.  Freddy holds the Wesley-Cig 
       out, poised to tap the ashes loose.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Now say the secret word and you know what 
                 you'll win...

                           WESLEY
                 Go to hell!

       Freddy grins.

                           FREDDY
                 Right...

       And he taps the Wesley-cig with his finger.  The ashes 
       immediately fall, sifting in the air as Wesley's head - 
       charred and black at the neck where it's been separated - 
       falls loose.  Wesley SCREAMS.

                           WESLEY
                 Noooooooo!

       and his severed head falls and falls and falls.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

       WE START on WESLEY'S BODY.  Eyes closed, head normal and 
       everything from the neck down charred mass of burnt torso, 
       shriveled limbs, all wrapped in the scorched blanket.  ZIP.  
       A body bag hides this ghastly image from us as we PULL BACK.

       A FIRE MARSHALL and a COP are talking at the doorway in the 
       background.  The CORONER is here, a world weary seen-it-all 
       older guy, with his nervous ASSISTANT who's never seen 
       anything like this.  They whisper their conversation as they 
       lift the body bag onto a stretcher.

                           ASSISTANT
                 I don't get it.  The couch is barely 
                 scorched.  And how can he burn from just 
                 the neck down?

                           CORONER
                 It happens.

                           ASSISTANT
                 It happens?  That's your explanation?

                           CORONER
                 I've seen worse.

       We FOLLOW them as they push the stretcher towards the 
       doorway.

                           ASSISTANT
                 What?  What worse?

                           CORONER
                 Never mind.

       Our shot STOPS at the doorway with the fire Marshall and cop 
       while the wigged-out assistant's voice trails off outside.

                           ASSISTANT
                 No.  I wanna know.  Really.  What could 
                 be worse than...

                           FIRE MARSHALL
                 You know what the gossip rags are going 
                 to say?  Spontaneous human combustion.

                           COP
                 What's that?

                           FIRE MARSHALL
                 That's where bodies are supposed to go up 
                 in smoke for no reason.  It's all psychic 
                 bullshit.  What really happened is called 
                 the candle effect.  A tiny fire gets 
                 started, usually from a cigarette.  It 
                 slowly smolders through the blanket and 
                 clothes until the skin starts to actually 
                 bake.  The body fat begins to melt and 
                 liquefy, fueling the fire like a slow 
                 burning candle.  It takes hours, but it's 
                 real.

       The cop makes some notes.  Behind them we see Scott, Karen 
       and Gina.  The girls have been crying, and even tough-guy 
       Scott looks pretty screwed up by all this.  The cop nods.

                           COP
                 He fell asleep while smoking.  What a 
                 waste.

       The kids shoot unbelieving looks at each other as the two men 
       walk off.

                           SCOTT
                 That's impossible.

       Scott and Karen head for the front door.

       EXT. FOSTER HOME - DAY

       A coroner's van, a fire chief's car and the now familiar mob 
       of suspicious neighbors are gathered around the front of the 
       house as the stretcher with Wesley's body is put away.  A 
       small van marked ROSEDALE GENERAL HOSPITAL pulls up and Jacob 
       jumps out of it.

       Jacob's face turns grim as a tearful Karen runs up to him, 
       Scott following.

                           JACOB
                 Who?

                           KAREN
                 Wes...

                           JACOB
                 Oh my God.  It's started.

                           SCOTT
                 He fucking burned alive.

                           KAREN
                 They said he fell asleep smoking.

                           SCOTT
                 And we all know that can't be.

                           JACOB
                 I already told you how it would happen.

       Mr. Ross appears behind the three teenagers, a wasted look on 
       his face.

                           SCOTT
                 Don't start with that shit.

                           JACOB
                 It's not shit.

                           DAVID
                 C'mon, kids.  Everyone inside.  Now.

       David leads them back to the house as the coroner's van pulls 
       away.

       INT. KITCHEN - DAY

       Jacob, Scott, Karen and Gina stand around in various states 
       of utter shock as David tries to console them.

                           DAVID
                 We have to be strong.

       He puts an arm around Karen and reaches out to put the other 
       one around Gina, but pulls away at the last minute when she 
       starts to flinch.

                           DAVID (cont'd)
                 We need to pull together and help each 
                 other.  Mrs. Ross is upstairs in bed.  
                 She's pretty messed up.  We need to help 
                 her deal with this.

                           SCOTT
                 He would never touch a cigarette.  You 
                 know that.

                           DAVID
                 We don't know anything until the 
                 authorities are finished with their 
                 investigation.  In the mean time, no work 
                 for tomorrow - three day weekend.  But 
                 Monday, it's back on the job.  Jacob 
                 wasn't covered in our health plan and his 
                 little stint at the hospital cost us a 
                 bundle.  We have to work together or we 
                 might lose this place.  Okay?

       The kids all nod, but not convincingly.  They care more about 
       Wesley than the house.

       INT. WESLEY & JACOB'S BEDROOM - DAY

       Jacob closes the door.  All the kids are here.  Gina 
       absentmindedly plays with some of Wesley's things.

                           JACOB
                 When I was put under, Freddy was 
                 released.  I know this because I dreamed 
                 it.

                           SCOTT
                 And that dream was real?

                           JACOB
                 Yes.  Wesley was his first victim.

                           SCOTT
                 Aw, man...

                           JACOB
                 You said it yourself.  How could it have 
                 been a cigarette?

                           KAREN
                 And how could he...dire that way and not 
                 wake up?

                           GINA
                     (mockingly)
                 Maybe the "authorities" will figure it 
                 out.

                           SCOTT
                 I'm sorry.  I just can't buy into this.

                           JACOB
                 Call me crazy...but I think he's after 
                 Rosedale.  The whole place.  In my dream 
                 he said something about needing a few 
                 souls to get the job done. I think he has 
                 to kill in order to get the power to suck 
                 in a new town.

                           SCOTT
                 You are crazy.

                           JACOB
                 Thank you.  There's more.  There are...
                 other people in there.  In the 
                 nightmares.

                           KAREN
                 Like him?

                           JACOB
                 No. Different.  There are three of them.  
                 They're dressed in black. They have 
                 powers like Freddy, but they seem to be 
                 on our side.

                           KAREN
                 Who are they?

                           JACOB
                 Well, you gotta hang in there with me on 
                 this one.  They call themselves... the 
                 Dream Police.

       Scott actually laughs.

                           SCOTT
                 This is too much.

                           GINA
                 You mean...like cops?

                           JACOB
                 I guess. 

                           KAREN
                 Where are they from?

                           JACOB
                 They're kids that Freddy killed years 
                 ago.  THEY don't even know how they got 
                 there.  But they're somehow patrolling 
                 dreamworld to put a stop to Krueger.

                           SCOTT
                 Then why haven't these guys done the job 
                 already?

                           JACOB
                 They say they need help.  I don't know 
                 what or why...yet.

                           SCOTT
                 I can tell you who needs help.

                           JACOB
                 Hey, I'm trying to save all of us.

                           SCOTT
                 I won't believe it until I see it.

       Jacob is crushed that he's not getting through to them.

                           JACOB
                 By then it'll be too late.  It was too 
                 late for Wesley.

       The kids stare emptily at Wesley's earthly possessions.

       EXT. FOSTER HOME - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

       Jacob and Karen sit on the steps.  Across the street we can 
       see window curtains part as Mr. Hopkins sneaks a wary peek.

                           KAREN
                 They're going to use all this to shut us 
                 down.

                           JACOB
                 I know.  It's my fault.

                           KAREN
                 You going to try to run away again?

                           JACOB
                 It's too late for that. I have to stay 
                 and try and put a stop to it.

                           KAREN
                 I'm sorry.  It's all so hard to accept.

                           JACOB
                 I wish I could convince you of the danger 
                 you and the others are in.

                           KAREN
                 I've been in danger before. THAT I can 
                 handle.

                           JACOB
                 This is worse than anything you can 
                 imagine.

                           KAREN
                 I wouldn't be so sure about that.  Come 
                 on.  Let's go inside.

       She stands up.

       INT. KAREN'S ROOM - NIGHT

       Jacob and Karen lie in bed, clothes on, cozy.  Not sexual.  
       She stares at the ceiling while he listens.

                           KAREN
                 She was great. Loving.  Supportive, 
                 caring - everything a mom should be. 
                 Except she had one fatal flow: my father.  
                 You see, she was raised at a time when 
                 they still had the "obey" part in the 
                 wedding vows.  He was always jealous.  
                 She couldn't talk to another man without 
                 him thinking she wanted to go to bed with 
                 him.  He never hit me. But the things he 
                 did to her...and she would always just 
                 take it.  She never fought back.  He'd 
                 get drunk and...she'd tell people she 
                 just fell down or something.  Then one 
                 night...I was thirteen.  Something 
                 happened.  My mom suddenly wouldn't take 
                 it anymore.  Something made her say 
                 enough is enough.  She hit back.  Tat 
                 only made it worse.  I watched as he hit 
                 her over and over.  Then he knocked her 
                 down the stairs.  She broke her neck.  
                 And when y father saw what he'd done - he 
                 finally became human.  He cried over her 
                 body for a while, then went into the 
                 garage and blew his brains out with a 
                 shotgun.  To this day I don't remember 
                 what that final straw was.  The shrinks 
                 say I've blocked it out of my memory.  
                 There's no one else alive who knows what 
                 really happened.  I have dreams about it 
                 sometimes, but there's always that blank 
                 spot.  A missing piece.

       She stops and closes her eyes.  Jacob closes his eyes for a 
       second also - feeling her pain.

       DIFFERENT ANGLE

       Jacob opens his eyes and touches Karen's arm.  She finally 
       turns to him.

                           JACOB
                 I'm sorry.

                           KAREN
                 I know nightmares are real, Jacob.  I 
                 know.

                           JACOB
                 So did my mom.  She taught me a lot about 
                 dreams.

                           KAREN
                 Like what?

                           JACOB
                 She told me that a lot of people have 
                 special dream powers.  I inherited some 
                 from her - and some I have all to myself.  
                 She showed me how I could link up with 
                 other people's dreams - to actually be 
                 inside with them.

                           KAREN
                 That sounds wonderful.  But...I don't 
                 know...

                           JACOB
                 A little hard to imagine, huh?

                           KAREN
                 Yeah.  I'm sorry.

                           JACOB
                 I can convince you.

                           KAREN
                 How?

                           JACOB
                 Easy.  We're doing it now.

       Jacob smiles, gets up and walks over to the bedroom door.  
       Karen is confused.

                           KAREN
                 What do you mean?

                           JACOB
                 I mean we're dreaming.  You and me.  
                 Together.

       He opens the bedroom door.  And there's a FOREST OUTSIDE.  
       Karen is a little scared at first, totally blown away by 
       what's happening.  But then she stands up and smiles.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Want to go for a walk?

       Karen steps up next to him and they walk through the doorway 
       into daylight.

       EXT. FOREST - DAY

       Shafts of sunlight filter through as leaves flutter down from 
       the towering trees and Jacob and Karen step out of the 
       bedroom door.

                           KAREN
                 I don't believe it.

                           JACOB
                 It's true.  We're really doing it.

                           KAREN
                 But what if I'm just dreaming of you 
                 telling me that?

                           JACOB
                 We'll compare notes when we wake up.  
                 Then you'll know.

       Karen looks around.  Then she giggles.  She likes this a lot.  
       Karen suddenly runs away into the trees like an excited 
       little girl.  Jacob frowns.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Karen.  Wait.

       He heads off after her.

       AMONGST THE TREES

       Jacob runs.  Karen jumps out from behind a tree and laughs.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 You have to be careful.

                           KAREN
                 Did you bring us here on purpose?  Can 
                 you go anywhere you want?

                           JACOB
                 Sometimes.  It's not as easy as linking 
                 up, though.

                           KAREN
                 Wow, I never knew...

       She starts wandering off again.  Jacob follows her.

                           KAREN (cont'd)
                 You know what I like to do in my dreams?

       She ducks behind a tree.  And comes out suddenly dressed as a 
       sharp BUSINESSWOMAN.  Jacob is slightly taken aback.

                           KAREN (cont'd)
                 I like to be other people!

       Jacob grins as she steps behind another tree - and a FIREMAN 
       walks out in her place.  Jacob is really taken aback this 
       time.

                           KAREN (cont'd) (as fireman)
                 I can be anybody I want.

                           JACOB
                 Show off.

       Karen slips past another trunk and comes out as a tall 
       VOLUPTUOUS REDHEAD.

                           KAREN (AS REDHEAD)
                 When things get bad it helps to be 
                 someone else.  I use it to protect 
                 myself.  

       The redhead walks seductively towards Jacob.  He raises his 
       eyebrows as she slinks right up next to him - her ample 
       cleavage inches away from his nose.

                           KAREN (cont'd) (as redhead)
                 What do you think?

                           JACOB
                 I think I like you the way you always 
                 are.

       He smiles.

       DIFFERENT ANGLE

       And now Karen is herself again.  They're still very close.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Much better.

       They look like they're about to kiss... but Karen suddenly 
       sees something that grabs her attention.

                           KAREN
                 Look!

       Jacob turns as Karen runs over to ANOTHER DOOR.  It's not the 
       one to the bedroom.  It just hangs there in space between two 
       trees.

                           KAREN (cont'd)
                 I wonder where it goes?

       She reaches for the knob and opens it.  

                           JACOB
                 Karen, no!

       But she's already stepped through.  Jacob runs up to the 
       doorway and it SLAMS in his face.  Jacob tries to open the 
       door.  It doesn't budge.  He keeps twisting the knob to no 
       effect.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Karen!

       Jacob starts to pound on the door as we:

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. KAREN'S HOME - KITCHEN

       Sixties style decore, appliances that look about twenty-five 
       years old -- not the Foster Home kitchen at all.  Karen is 
       standing in the middle of the room, completely disoriented.  
       She walks across to a counter top where she finds a framed 
       picture.

       It's a picture of HER, Karen, age thirteen.  Karen sets the 
       picture down and quickly walks back to the door she came in.

       INT. KAREN'S HOME - LOWER HALLWAY

       Karen steps out of her old kitchen expecting, hoping to be 
       back in the forest again.  Nope.  She blinks.  Then she 
       starts to walk down the corridor. 

       More pictures on the wall this time.  One of a WOMAN and 
       another of a MAN (Karen's MOM and DAD).

       Karen's sure of it now.  She's home.  The center of her worst 
       nightmares.  She creeps along to the main stairs.  And that's 
       when the NOISES begin.  A thumping from upstairs.  A CRASH, 
       like something hit the floor above.  More thumping, 
       repeatedly and then human MOANING, the sound of pain.

       Somebody is getting beaten.

                           KAREN
                 Oh no...

       Something is twisting deep inside the girl.  Her face goes 
       shallow as she slowly shuffles around to the foot of the 
       stairs...and starts to climb them.

       ON THE STAIRS

       Karen goes up, step by painful step, as the sounds of the 
       BEATING increase in their intensity.  Every hit seems to 
       touch Karen as she flinches.  She's afraid to go on - but 
       can't seem to stop.

       INT. KAREN'S HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

       Karen slowly heads for a door at the end, nervously reaches 
       out for the knob.

       INT. KAREN'S PARENT'S BEDROOM

       Karen opens the door.  What she thought she was going to see 
       was bad enough - but this is worse:

       Freddy Krueger is in the middle of the room.  In front of him 
       is a giant human-sized version of an inflatable punching 
       doll, the kind little kids hit that keep bouncing back.  But 
       the doll doesn't have the image of a clown on it.

       It's a flattened wrapped-around version of KAREN'S MOTHER, a 
       pitiful beat-up look on her plastic face.  

       Freddy SMACKS the doll - it falls to the floor - and just 
       bounces back up.  And now the face on it has a NEW BRUISE.

       THWACK!  He hits it again, CACKLING with glee.  Swoop, 
       bounce.  More bruises develop.  Krueger looks at Karen.

                           FREDDY
                 Welcome to Romper Room!

       BAP!  BOOOOING!  The face on the punching doll changes again, 
       it's even sadder now.  And it's looking at Karen.

                           KAREN
                 Why are you doing this?

                           FREDDY
                 Don't you remember?

       ZING!  Krueger whips up his finger knives.  SWOOP!  he RIPS 
       them through the plastic doll.  SISSSSSssss.  The doll starts 
       to deflate.  SKREEEEeeeee.  The escaping air sounding like a 
       human SCREAM.  Freddy turns to Karen.

       And a HAND reaches out from behind her and pulls her out of 
       the room.

       INT. KAREN'S HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

       Jacob pulls Karen away from the door and slams it shut. He 
       grabs her hand.

                           JACOB
                 Come on!

       They turn to run down the hallway, and it's CHANGED.  There 
       are now NO DOORS and NO STAIRWAY.  The only way out is the 
       bedroom door they just closed.  They stop and Jacob turns to 
       Karen.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Wake up!

                           KAREN
                 What?

                           JACOB
                 You heard me.  I said wake up!

                           KAREN
                 How?  This is my old house.  How did I 
                 get here? 

       He begins to shake her.  She is confused and disoriented.  A 
       CRASH is heard at the bedroom door.  FREDDY'S COMING.

       And Jacob HITS Karen.  Nothing major.  It's a good slap, 
       nonetheless.  She stares at him unbelievingly.  He WHACKS her 
       again.

                           KAREN (cont'd)
                 Why are you doing this to me?

                           JACOB
                 This is a dream!  You have to get out of 
                 here.  I'm not hurting you, only he can 
                 really do that!  Wake up now!

       SLAP!  Karen's getting angry.  She doesn't know what she's 
       supposed to do.  KA-BLAM!  Freddy blasts through the door in 
       a shower of splinters.  He sees them and grins.

                           FREDDY
                 Gettin' kinky, huh?

       Jacob turns to Karen, raises his hand.  KA-BLAM!  Something 
       blasts through the wall across from them.  It's POWER COP.

       CRASH!  The other wall explodes.  BLADE appears in the 
       rubble.

       BOOM!  A piece of wall falls down at the end of the corridor.  
       SOUND COP steps through.

       Karen looks at all this nonsense, then at Jacob.

                           KAREN
                 I think I get it now.

       She closes her eyes and DISAPPEARS out of Jacob's hands.  The 
       DREAM POLICE stand in the hallway.  Freddy just puts his 
       hands on his hips and LAUGHS at them.

       Then Krueger lays his arms flat on his sides, takes a deep 
       breath and begins to INFLATE.  His body expands, his clothes 
       and skin stretch and flatten.  The bottom half of him getting 
       fatter.

       He turns into a giant FREDDY PUNCHING DOLL.

       Power Cop jumps in front of the plastic horror and lets loose 
       a devastating swing.  POW!  The Freddy Doll swings back and 
       BOUNCES right up again. 

       POW POW POW POW POW!  The big Dream Cop pummels away at the 
       Krueger toy as it slaps back and forth between the floor and 
       his fist until SHINK!  Two knives appear in Blade's hands and 
       SWOOP.  She swings them out.

       RIP!  The Freddy Doll tears, air blasting out in a grating 
       SHRIEK which screeches and hisses until it becomes:

       Freddy's LAUGH.  The red and green plastic flutters to the 
       ground as the evil guffaws fade away and we:

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. KAREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

       Karen shakes Jacob awake.  His eyes open.  They stare at each 
       other for a few beats, then Karen frowns.

                           KAREN
                 You hit me.

                           JACOB
                 Are you hurt?

                           KAREN
                 Um...no.

                           JACOB
                 If he had done it, you'd be dead.  

       Karen is confused.  She doesn't know what to make of all 
       this.  She looks at a clock.  It's late.

                           KAREN
                 You better get back to your room.  We 
                 don't want anybody to get the wrong idea.

                           JACOB
                     (smirks)
                 Or the right one?

       Karen finally relaxes.  She smiles and playfully pushes him.

                           KAREN
                 Get out of here.

       Jacob reaches under a pillow and pulls something out.  It's 
       the framed photo of Karen, age thirteen - from her dream.  He 
       hands it to her and she looks at it in astonishment.

                           JACOB
                 That's something else my mom taught me.

       He gets up and goes to the door, turning back to her.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Don't sleep.

                           KAREN
                 No.  Not tonight.

       She holds the picture tightly- staring at it with those 
       faraway eyes.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - UPPER HALLWAY - NIGHT

       Scott comes out of the bathroom in his night clothes, the 
       toilet flushing in the B.G.  He goes into his room, but stops 
       at the doorway when he hears Karen's door open.

       Scott ducks behind his door as he watches Jacob leave Karen's 
       room and head for his own.  Scott frowns.  His is not 
       pleased.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

       David Ross is sifting through some mail when a heated 
       conversation in the kitchen catches his interest.  He stops 
       to listen.

       IN THE KITCHEN

       Karen is finally convinced, Jacob and Scott are looking like 
       they're ready to punch each other, and Gina looks scared.

                           KAREN
                 I'm telling you, this Freddy guy is for 
                 real.

                           SCOTT
                 And I'm telling you a dream is a dream.

                           KAREN
                 Jacob was in there with me.

                           SCOTT
                 And where else was he with you last 
                 night?

                           JACOB
                 What the hell is that supposed to mean?

                           KAREN
                 I have the picture in my room if you want 
                 to see it.  He brought it out from the 
                 nightmare.

                           SCOTT
                 Or from your hope chest.  I bet your bed 
                 isn't the only thing he's been into.

                           KAREN
                 That picture was destroyed years ago.

                           JACOB
                 You better watch your mouth, pal.

                           SCOTT
                 I'm the last person you want to start 
                 fucking with.

                           JACOB
                 Go ahead and be a tough guy, Scott.  
                 Krueger will cut you to pieces before you 
                 can even flex a muscle.

                           GINA
                 Will you two stop it!  You're scaring the 
                 shit out of me.

                           KAREN
                 You should be scared.

       Mr. Ross enters the room, none too pleased.

                           DAVID
                 Alright.  What's going on here?

                           SCOTT
                 Join the fun.  Jacob and Karen were just 
                 telling us about their new excuse to 
                 sleep together.

                           JACOB
                 Nothing happened between us last night.

                           SCOTT
                 You mean in plain old reality, right?

                           DAVID
                 Okay, everybody.  Out.  Jacob and I are 
                 going to have a little talk.  Now.

       Scott, Gina and Karen grudgingly leave the room.  David turns 
       to Jacob.

                           DAVID (cont'd)
                 Your days are numbered here, buster.

                           JACOB
                 I'm sorry, but...

                           DAVID
                 Hey, I don't know what kind of shit 
                 you're shoveling to these kids, but it's 
                 going to stop.  My Good Samaritan 
                 instincts have their limits.  We've had 
                 enough tragedy around this place.  We 
                 don't need you making things worse with 
                 fantasies.

                           JACOB
                 You don't understand

                           DAVID
                 And I want you to stay away from Karen.

       Jacob starts to get defiant. 

                           JACOB
                 It's a free country.

                           DAVID
                 This isn't America, it's my house.  I've 
                 been checking up on you.  You have no 
                 record with the police or the state or 
                 any of the runaway groups.  You're the 
                 invisible kid.  And if I sense even a 
                 little bit more trouble-making from you, 
                 you're going to vanish from here.  Got 
                 it?

                           JACOB
                 Yes, sir.

       David catches his breath.  He looks like he wants to say 
       more, but doesn't have the energy left.  He just walks out of 
       the room leaving a frustrated Jacob.

       EXT. FOSTER HOME - NIGHT

       Mr. and Mrs. Ross are getting into their car.  The engine 
       starts and they drive away.

       INT. JACOB'S ROOM - NIGHT

       Jacob sits in bed, staring into space.  Karen quietly enters 
       the room, carefully shutting the door behind her.

       She sits down next to him.  Jacob looks at her with weary 
       eyes.

                           JACOB
                 You're supposed to be off-limits to me.

                           KAREN
                 It's okay.  The Ross's have gone to a 
                 council meeting and Scott's in his room.  
                 We should be safe for awhile.

                           JACOB
                 Wonderful.

                           KAREN
                 Jacob, what are we going to do?

                           JACOB
                 I'm going to go to bed soon.

                           KAREN
                 Now you WANT to sleep?

                           JACOB
                 I have to find the Dream Police.  I think 
                 I'm somehow their link to all this.  They 
                 only seem to appear when I'm around.  You 
                 woke me up before I had a chance to talk 
                 to them last night.

                           KAREN
                 I'm sorry.  I was scared.

                           JACOB
                 your fault.  I have to ask them what 
                 we're supposed to do to help them.  And 
                 maybe I can protect Gina while I'm in 
                 there.

                           KAREN
                 What about Scott?

                           JACOB
                 He's on his own.

                           KAREN
                 Oh...

                           JACOB
                 I don't mean to be cold,but we've done 
                 everything to convince him.  Gina's too 
                 scared to understand.  I think Freddy 
                 will go after her next.

                           KAREN
                 What should I do?

                           JACOB
                 You have to stay awake.

                           KAREN
                 That's not going to be easy.  I'm half 
                 asleep already.

                           JACOB
                 You have to try.

       She nods her head quietly.  Then

                           KAREN
                 I'd better get out of here.

                           JACOB
                 Okay.  Be careful.

                           KAREN
                 YOU be careful.  I'm not going anywhere.

       She kisses him quickly on the cheek.  He needed that.  Karen 
       gets up and quietly leaves.  Jacob yawns

       INT. GINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

       Gina sits on her bed in her night clothes.  She holds a deck 
       of cards in one hand while she plays solitaire on her bed 
       sheets.

       She flips a card from her deck: A black nine.  She puts it on 
       top of a ten.  Another card.  Queen of diamonds.  She lays it 
       on top of a king of clubs.  Gina yawns.  Takes another card.

       It's the Freddy of Spades.

       Gina frowns.  Freddy Krueger's image stares up at her from 
       the card.  She looks at her stacks.  There's no place to put 
       this one.  She starts flipping through the deck of cards, 
       trying to see if there are any more Freddys.  That's when a 
       HAND RIPS UP through the bed and grabs her arm.  

       Gina SCREAMS, pulls away from the hand's grip and jumps back 
       up on the bed.  And ANOTHER HAND shoots up from a pillow and 
       grabs her shoulder.  Gina twists.

       RIP.  TEAR.  GRAB.  More hands appear out of the mattress, 
       lunging for any part of Gina's body as she SHRIEKS from their 
       touch.  And Gina jumps out of bed.

       She leaps to the other side of the room, bumping against her 
       dresser drawers.  Turns to her bed.

       SWOOP.  The multiple hands disappear down into the mattress.  
       There is a quiet beat as she catches her shivering breath.

       Then a half-dozen ARMS AND HANDS pop out from the drawers 
       next to her.  Latching indiscriminately.  Some grabbing her 
       legs and arms.  Some grabbing more intimate parts.

       Gina SCREAMS.  Pulls away from the dresser.  Yanks a few 
       drawers out as the hands vanish and she spins over to another 
       wall.

       Where the wall ERUPTS with outreaching arms all around her.  
       Two grab her hair.  Three on each arm.  Her legs are pinned.  
       Gina shrieks and yells and flays her arms.  Beating the hands 
       with her fists as two grabs her breasts viciously.  She 
       starts kicking as one particularly perverse hand BURNT AND 
       SCARRED, pops out between her legs.  Aiming right for her 
       crotch and in an incredible show of strength, the girl pulls 
       away from the horde.

       Gina heads for the door.  CRASH.  Hands blast up from the 
       wood floor.  She leaps around them.  CRASH.  More hands try 
       to block her way.

       Gina jumps around like she's in a mine field made of hot 
       coals.  She finally reaches to door and flings it open.

       INT. ELEVATOR

       Gina hits the lift's opposite wall having expected it to be a 
       hallway.  The elevator's doors close on her bedroom and she 
       turns to see:

       Freddy.  A razor finger poised over the elevator's buttons.  
       He smiles politely.

                           FREDDY
                 Going up?

       Gina is shocked and speechless.  She backs away into a corner 
       like someone trapped in a closet with the devil.  Which is 
       exactly what she is.

       Rising past the terror is Gina's realization that everything 
       Jacob's been saying is true.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 At your service.

       He punches one of the buttons and the elevator LURCHES.  Gina 
       grabs onto a wall as the lift races up and Freddy actually 
       begins to WHISTLE nonchalantly.

                           GINA
                 You're not real!

                           FREDDY
                 Ah, but who is?

       The elevator begins to slow.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Fourth floor.  Overpopulation.

       The elevator stops.  The doors begin to open.  Gina leaps for 
       the way out.  But she's blocked.

       Blocked by PEOPLE.  They fill the entrance to the lift and 
       start to pile in.  All kinds of people: businessmen, nurses, 
       plumbers.  And they're all ZOMBIES.

       Vacant expressions fill their dark hollow eyes as the zombies 
       keep coming in.  Pushing Gina back into the elevator.  
       Filling it to capacity and beyond.

       The doors close and the elevator starts to move up.  Twenty 
       bodies are crammed into the tiny enclosure, smashed together, 
       surrounding the poor teenager, drool oozing out of their 
       mouths, breathing down her neck.  SMASHING her so hard she 
       can't even yell for help.  Gina turns her head.

       WESLEY is pressed up next to her.  A very dead look on his 
       face.  Begin squeezed by the zombies around him.  One of his 
       eyes POPS out of its socket.

       Gina finds the breath to scream and scream and scream.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Eight floor - the morgue.  

       The elevator doors open and the mass of zombies starts to 
       spastically pile out.  Gina, having only been held up by the 
       crushing bodies, falls to her knees as the last of the 
       monsters exit the lift.  She breathes in ripping gasps like 
       she's having a coronary.  But she sees the open door.  And 
       Gina jumps for the exit.

       Freddy grabs her shoulder and pulls her back violently.  Gina 
       falls to the floor again as the doors shut.  Freddy waves his 
       fingers down the row of buttons and stops above the very 
       bottom one.  This button doesn't looks like the others.  

       It's in the shape of a little heart.

       Freddy turns and gives Gina a frighteningly serious look.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Time to go down, Gina.

       He presses the heart button.  And the floor disappears.  Gina 
       falls SCREAMING into blackness as Freddy hangs in mid-air and 
       LAUGHS.  

       INT. HONEYMOON SUITE

       Gaudy colors, mirrors, a cheesy heart-shaped bed.  Gina's 
       body drops down, unexpectedly softly, landing on the fluffy 
       satin sheets.

       she's dressed in a skimpy piece of bright pink LINGERIE.  She 
       moans and tries to sit up.

       And four snake-like strips of satin swoop out from under the 
       bed and quickly wrap around each of her limbs, pulling her 
       down and yank her tight.

       She's trapped.  That's when the door to the room opens and in 
       walks an incredibly huge FAT MAN.  He barely fits through the 
       door as he closes it behind him.  Puffy cheeks, permanent 
       seat, dirty fingernails, and a lecherous smile.

       Gina's eyes widen.

                           FAT MAN
                 Hi there, princess.  Your mom's told me 
                 all about you.

       Gina SCREAMS as he approaches her, the ground actually 
       shaking from his weight.

                           FAT MAN (cont'd)
                 She said you're even better than she is.

       He looms above her, now.  Starts to unbutton his shirt to 
       reveal a hideous mound of hairy stomach flesh.  Gina is 
       repulsed.

                           FAT MAN (cont'd)
                 Aw, come on.  I'm really a nice guy.  You 
                 know what they say.  Inside every fat 
                 person...

       RIP! Krueger's finger blades JUT out of the abdomen ad start 
       tearing a huge SLIT up the front of his body.  The Fat Man 
       starts to fold back as Freddy's head pops out of the front.

                           FREDDY
                 ...is a maniac trying to get out!

       Freddy steps out of the Fat Man, sluffing the bulbous remains 
       aside.  He towers over Gina.  That creepy serious look on his 
       face again.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Now it's time for YOU to put out, Gina.

       Gina gasps in horror as Krueger moves in.  But then a KNOCK 
       at the door.  

                           ROOM SERVICE (O.S.)
                 Room service?

                           FREDDY
                 Huh?  I didn't order anything...

       Freddy frowns and walks over to the door.  He turns back to 
       Gina. 

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Maybe its complimentary champagne!

       Krueger opens the door.  On the other side is a dinner cart 
       and a waiter behind it.  The waiter is JACOB.

       CRASH!  Jacob shoves the dinner cart into the room and into 
       Freddy's gut, shoving Krueger across the room into a tumbled 
       heap.  Three EXPLOSIONS OF LIGHT BURST into the room.  The 
       Dream Police materialize.

       Freddy jumps up growling.  Power Cop grabs him from behind.  
       Blade leaps over to the bed and in a FLASH of steel, releases 
       Gina from her satin bonds.  Jacob yanks Gina off the bed and 
       pulls her towards the door.

                           JACOB
                 Come on!

       Freddy jumps out of Power Cop's grip and the Dream Police 
       surround him as the two teenagers bolt out of the room.

       INT. HOTEL HALLWAY

       Jacob pulls Gina along as the hotel room door SLAMS shut by 
       itself.  Gina yells at Jacob.

                           GINA
                 Let go of me!

       She squirms out of Jacob's grip and bounces away from him 
       like he has the plague.  CRASHING is heard from the hotel 
       room.  A violent battle is under way.  Jacob pleads with 
       Gina.

                           JACOB
                 I'm here to help!

       He holds out his hand to her.  Gina shivers, than looks into 
       Jacob's sincere eyes.  SOUNDS of destruction continue behind 
       the door as the girl battles with her worst fear.  Finally 
       Gina takes Jacob's hand.

                           GINA
                 Let's get out of here.

       They start running down the corridor - together.

       INT. HONEYMOON SUITE

       The entire room is filled with SWIRLING DUST and SMOKE, 
       completely obscuring everything from sight.  As the sound of 
       BREAKING FURNITURE and grunting fighters echoes, a few pieces 
       of debris bounce into view.

       And then there is SILENCE.

       The dust settles and the smoke dissipates.  The DREAM POLICE 
       stand alone in the rubble of a totally trashed room.

                           POWER COP
                 Where'd he go?

                           SOUND COP
                 I thought you had him. 

                           BLADE COP
                 Shit...

       Krueger has escaped.

       HOTEL CORRIDOR

       Jacob runs, Gina trailing behind him, the two of them trying 
       to find a way out.  They pass a door.

       The door SLAMS open and Freddy reaches out, grabs Gina and 
       yanks her into the room.  The door BANGS shut.

       Jacob twirls around and runs towards the door.

       And the door DISAPPEARS.  Nothing but flat wall remains as 
       Jacob hits it.  He starts banging his fist against the side 
       of the corridor.

                           JACOB
                 No no no no!

       The Dream police run up next to him.  Jacob spins around 
       angry.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 He's got Gina!

                           SOUND COP
                 Stand back.

       Everyone backs off.  Sound Cop opens his mouth.  BOOM!  An 
       almost visible sound wave bursts forth from his lips and 
       CRACK, a huge hole is punched in the wall.

       The Police leap into the hole, quickly followed by Jacob.

       INT. HOTEL ROOM

       This one's pretty normal.  Maybe the business suite.  And 
       it's EMPTY except for a heart-shaped box of candy in the 
       middle of the bed.  Jacob and the rest of the Police watch as 
       Blade picks up the box and opens it.  Dozens of COCKROACHES 
       pour out onto the floor.  Now Jacob's really pissed.

                           JACOB
                 You let him get away!

                           SOUND COP
                 It's difficult.

                           POWER COP
                 He's been at this longer than we have.

                           BLADE COP
                 He can do anything.

                           SOUND COP
                 But we have to catch him in the act to 
                 get him.

                           JACOB
                 What...there are rules to all this?

                           SOUND COP
                 They're not rules.

                           POWER COP
                 It's just the way it is.

                           BLADE COP
                 Jacob, we need you to bring the rest 
                 together.

                           JACOB
                 The rest?  You mean the kids at the home?

                           BLADE COP
                 Yes.  We need as many of you as we can 
                 get.  And you must bring them to 
                 Springwood.

                           JACOB
                 How?

                           BLADE COP
                 You have the power to link your dreams 
                 with other's.  Dream of Springwood, then 
                 bring the rest with you.

                           SOUND COP
                 Living souls are what he thrives on.  
                 Living souls are what we need to help 
                 stop him.

                           POWER COP
                 Before it's too late.

                           BLADE COP
                 Before he takes everyone.

                           SOUND COP
                 And every THING.

       Jacob just shakes his head.

       INT. LIMBO

       All is BLACK.  Except for Freddy and Gina.  He has her from 
       behind, his hands locked on her shoulders.

                           FREDDY
                 Ah...alone at last.

       Gina cries horribly like a person who knows death is seconds 
       away.  Freddy wraps his arms around her, hugging her.

       And he KEEPS wrapping his arms.  They STRETCH and elongate, 
       wrapping once around his body and then around her's again.

       And then again.  Freddy's rubber limbs curl around and around 
       an around Gina's quivering body.  Spiraling up and down.  
       Encircling on all sides on every part of her, touching and 
       grabbing her EVERYWHERE.

       Until Krueger's arms cover her entirely.  Gina whimpers.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Touching, isn't it?

       And he starts to SQUEEZE.  Gina gags as Freddy's snake-like 
       embrace TIGHTENS around her, draining the life out of Gina's 
       body.

       INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

       Jacob wakes with a start as the entire house around him 
       shakes.

                           JACOB
                 Gina!

       Jacob jumps out of bed.

       INT. FOSTER HOME - UPPER HALLWAY

       Jacob dashes down the corridor.  Karen comes out of her room.

                           KAREN
                 Is it an earthquake?

                           JACOB
                 No.  It's Freddy.

       They run to Gina's room and fling the door open.

       INT. GINA'S BEDROOM

       The RUMBLING of the house has stopped.  Gina's in bed, her 
       tongue sticking grotesquely out from the corner of her mouth, 
       her skin completely blue.  Jacob and Karen run to her to try 
       and help.

       Gina's already dead.  But Freddy's not quite done with her 
       yet.  Jacob and Karen watch as Gina's chest CAVES IN.  Karen 
       SCREAMS.

       EXT. FOSTER HOME - EARLY MORNING

       The coroner's back, the neighborhood gawks.  Jacob, Karen and 
       Scott sit on the front steps in a daze.

       But this time there are police barricades up.  In another 
       part of the front yard we can see Mr. and Mrs. Ross with a 
       social worker, MR. SILVERMAN.  Mary Ross is crying while her 
       husband David is having a heated argument with Silverman.

       The kids watch on gloomily.

       The social worker leaves as Mr. Ross walks over to the kids.  
       Mary walks right by them and into the house - to broken up 
       over something to talk.

                           DAVID
                 Pack your bags, kids.

                           JACOB
                 You're kicking us out?

                           DAVID
                 No.  They're taking you away.  They say 
                 it's for your own good.

                           KAREN
                 They can't do that.

                           DAVID
                 Yes, they can.  They consider Mary and I 
                 possibly unfit to act as foster parents.  
                 They're going to find temporary homes for 
                 you until this mess is straightened out.  
                 I'm so very sorry.

       Karen runs up to David and hugs him desperately.  He holds 
       her.

                           KAREN
                 No, please.

                           DAVID
                 They're not calling it an accident this 
                 time.  They don't really know what to 
                 call it.

       Karen lets go.  Scott stands up.

                           SCOTT
                 What's going to happen to us?

                           DAVID
                 You'll be alright.

                           KAREN
                 What's going to happen to you?

                           DAVID
                 I don't know.  They're thinking of 
                 pressing charges.  

                           JACOB
                 Aw, Jesus...

                           DAVID
                 Come on.  A car from juvenile hall will 
                 be here in an hour.

       He leads them up the stairs.

       EXT. JUVENILE HALL - DAY

       A sign reads: ROSEDALE YOUTH CENTER.

       INT. OFFICE - DAY

       Mr. Silverman, the social worker, is talking to the 
       teenagers.  Karen and Scott look understandably worried.  
       Jacob looks like the world just ended for him.

                           MR. SILVERMAN
                 I'm sure most of you know how this works 
                 already.  You'll be assigned new foster 
                 homes tomorrow afternoon.  Tomorrow 
                 morning the police will be talking to you 
                 regarding the matter at the old house.

                           KAREN
                 What about it?

                           MR. SILVERMAN
                 Anything you know.

                           SCOTT
                 Are we considered suspects?

                           MR. SILVERMAN
                 You'll talk to the police about that.  
                 Don't worry.  We'll all try and work this 
                 out.

                           KAREN
                 Will we be able to go back to the Ross's?

                           MR. SILVERMAN
                 I don't know.  You'll have a place to 
                 stay in the mean time.

                           KAREN
                 Will we be together?

                           MR. SILVERMAN
                 No.  We don't have anybody willing to 
                 take more than one person.  I'm afraid 
                 you'll be split up.

                           SCOTT
                 Great...

                           MR. SILVERMAN
                 Hey, you can visit each other.  You'll be 
                 in the same town.

                           JACOB
                 If it's still here.

       Silverman frowns at that last comment as the kids get up to 
       leave.

       INT. JUVENILE HALL CORRIDOR

       The teenagers walk glumly out of the office.  Jacob is still 
       strangely silent, not making eye contact with anyone.

                           KAREN
                 Jacob, what are we going to do?

                           JACOB
                 Nothing.

                           KAREN
                 What do you mean, nothing?

                           JACOB
                 It's over.  We're finished.  He's won.

       Jacob walks on ahead of them.  Karen is flabbergasted.  She 
       stops and just stands there with Scott.  The two of them 
       watching Jacob walk away.

                           SCOTT
                 Looks like your hero just gave up.

       And Karen still can't believe it.

       EXT. JUVENILE HALL COURTYARD - DUSK

       Jacob is sitting on a bench looking like a beaten man and 
       hating himself for it.

       Karen and Scott step out of a door.  They watch him for a few 
       seconds.  Then Karen walks towards Jacob.  Scott stays behind 
       and lights up a cigarette.

                           KAREN
                 How can you do this?

                           JACOB
                 Do what?  I'm not doing anything.

                           KAREN
                 Exactly.  After all we've been through 
                 you just throw in the towel.  Why?

                           JACOB
                 Because we're fucked.  The last thing the 
                 Dream Police told me was that they needed 
                 all our help.  Together.  Even if we 
                 weren't about to be split up there aren't 
                 enough of us left to make a difference.

                           KAREN
                 How do you know that?

                           JACOB
                 I don't.  But, it's all just too much.  
                 I've tried so hard and nothing's worked.  
                 I'm spent.  I'm wasted.  I'm...I'm so 
                 tired.

       Jacob puts his face in his hands.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 I've had enough.

                           KAREN
                 So you're just going to give up?  I'll 
                 bet that's something your mother never 
                 taught you.

       That hit home.  Jacob uncovers his face.  His ID bracelet 
       dangles from his wrist.  He looks at the bracelet.  ALICE 
       glints in the setting sunlight.  He remembers.  Jacob looks 
       up at Karen.

                           KAREN (cont'd)
                 We still have one night together.

                           JACOB
                 And we're not going to waste it.

       Jacob stands up.

       INT. JUVENILE HALL LOUNGE - NIGHT

       Jacob paces back and forth in front of Scott and Karen.

                           KAREN
                 Scott, we need you.

                           SCOTT
                 Look, I don't know what's going on 
                 anymore.  Two of my friends die and now 
                 you tell me I have to drop into dreamland 
                 with you guys to do battle with the dude 
                 that did it.

                           JACOB
                 We'll have help.

                           SCOTT
                 Ah, yes.  I almost forgot.  The Sleepy 
                 Squad.  Alright.  I'll make you a deal.  
                 I told you I wouldn't believe this stuff 
                 unless I saw it.  If I understand this 
                 correctly, all I have to do is fall 
                 asleep and you just whisk me into the 
                 action.

                           JACOB
                 Right.

                           SCOTT
                 Okay.  If that happens, if both of you 
                 show up in my dream, I'll help you out.  
                 If nothing happens, then I'll get a good 
                 night's sleep and laugh at you in the 
                 morning.

                           JACOB
                 Fine.  You got a deal.  And you won't be 
                 disappointed.

                           KAREN
                 I'm going to be sleeping in the girl's 
                 dorm.  Will you be able to bring me in?

                           JACOB
                 I hope so.  Then I got to make sure we 
                 all end up in Springwood.

                           SCOTT
                 The old stomping ground?

                           JACOB
                 Yeah.  Only right now it's not a very 
                 pretty place.

                           KAREN
                 What do we do when we get there?

                           JACOB
                 Play it by ear.  And try and stay alive.

       A SOCIAL WORKER sticks his head into the lounge.

                           SOCIAL WORKER
                 Half hour til lights out, everyone.

       The kids get up and start for the door.

                           JACOB
                 Off we go.

                           SCOTT
                 Into the wild black yonder.

       Scott shakes his head as they leave.

       INT. KAREN'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

       Karen lies in bed, under the covers.  She holds the picture 
       of herself, thirteen years old.  She stares at it.  Still 
       that missing piece.

       Karen puts the picture on a nightstand and closes her eyes.

       INT. SCOTT & JACOB'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

       Scott lies on the top of a set of bunk beds.  Jacob is on the 
       bottom and already looks asleep.

       ON SCOTT

       He's still awake.  Maybe he's starting to believe some of 
       Jacob's ramblings, because he nervously fidgets in bed.

                           SCOTT
                 Freddy Krueger.  Yeah, right.  Years ago 
                 some sicko gets fried and now he comes 
                 back to stick it to you when you're 
                 snoozing.  Stupid bedtime story.

       he sighs, looks at his wrist, but his watch isn't on.  Then:

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 Hey, Mr. Creepoid, you still up?
                     (a beat)
                 Yo, Jacob?

       There's still no answer.  Scott rolls and peeks over the edge 
       of the bunk bed.  And Jacob's not there.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 Huh?

       Scott sits up, looks around.  And FALLS right through the 
       middle of his bed, NOT appearing underneath the top bunk.  He 
       just disappears.

       EXT. NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD - SOUTH STREET - NIGHT

       Scott falls out of a tree and lands with a THUD.  He groans, 
       slowly gets to his feet and takes in his surroundings.

       The road is dark and desolate.  The street lights emit a grim 
       brown glow and there are no stars or moon in the sky.

       SOUNDS echo through the trees and buildings.  Weird MOANS, 
       odd GURGLINGS, eerie WHISPERS, and an occasional unearthly 
       HOWL.

       This does not comfort Scott.

                           SCOTT
                 Oh, this is lovely.

       He starts cautiously walking down the sidewalk.  SOMETHING 
       flies by with a FLAPPING.  Scott ducks.  Was it a bird or a 
       bat or what?  It's already gone.

       Then a craggy voice calls out from behind a tree.

                           BUM
                 Hey, buddy?

                           SCOTT
                 Yeah, what?

       Scott is understandably jumpy.  The dark figure of a BUM 
       starts walking towards him.  Scott backs away.

                           BUM
                 Can you spare some change?

                           SCOTT
                 Um, well, let me see...

       Scott starts sifting through his pockets, and the BUM steps 
       out into the light.

       He has THREE EYES and a HUMP BACK.  Scott YELPS.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 Holy Jesus Christ.

       The Bum grins and Scott starts stumbling away, his voice 
       trailing off:

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 I'll catch you next time, buddy.

       The mutant bum belches.

       EXT. NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD - PARNELL AVE. - NIGHT

       Karen rounds a corner.  She walks nervously down the middle 
       of the street.  There are no cars, and she wants to keep as 
       far away as possible from the houses on either side. 

       There is a CREAKING sound from one of those houses.  Karen 
       turns her head to look.

       A craggy OLD WOMAN is rocking back and forth on her front 
       porch.  She's eating something, something stringy and slimy.  
       She munches away with a vacant look in her eyes.

       The something in her hands MOVES slightly.  The old woman's 
       meal is still alive.

       Karen gags and walks faster.  And a PANTING sound is heard, 
       like two dogs.  Someone is walking their pet down the 
       sidewalk.  

       It's the MUTANT WOMAN from Jacob's opening nightmare: 
       straggly hair, oozing sores, limping.  The source of the 
       multiple paintings is her single dog, all two heads of it.

       The mutant woman waves unpleasantly at Karen.  Karen whimpers 
       and starts to RUN.

       WITH KAREN - RUNNING

       She stumbles quickly down the street.  We catch fleeting 
       glimpses of other horrors, twisted shapes, bent shadows.  

       Karen rounds a corner, and SCREAMS when she bumps into 
       someone.  It's Scott, out of breath from his own sprinting.

                           KAREN
                 Scott!  You're here.

                           SCOTT
                 Yeah.  Fun town.  Talk to any of the 
                 neighbors, yet? They're a swell bunch of 
                 folks.  

                           KAREN
                 Uh-huh.  Real friendly, too.

                           SCOTT
                 So this is a dream?

                           KAREN
                 And I'm in it with you.  Convinced?

                           SCOTT
                 Maybe I'm just dreaming bout being here 
                 with you.  Wouldn't be the first time.

                           KAREN
                 Nope.  I tired that one already.  Doesn't 
                 work.  Come on, we have to find Jacob.

       Scott nods and they take off down the street.  A cat with 
       three tails slithers by.

       EXT. NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD - MAIN STREET - NIGHT

       Jacob is standing motionless in the middle of the road.  He 
       stares down into the darkness, a wooden expression on his 
       face.

       Karen and Scott are running up behind him.

                           KAREN
                 Jacob!  Thank God!

                           SCOTT
                 So this is the place, huh?

       Jacob's eyes are steady.  He hasn't yet acknowledged the 
       other's presence.  He eyes are fixed on the gloominess in 
       front of him.  A look of vengeance beginning to grow as our 
       SHOT MOVES IN on him.

                           JACOB
                 I'm home.

       Karen and Scott are next to him now.  They stand silently 
       with Jacob for a few seconds.  Then:

                           KAREN
                 What now?

                           JACOB
                 Scott, are you with us?

                           SCOTT
                 A deal's a deal.

                           JACOB
                 Then we wait.

       And not for long.  FLASH!  In three bursts the Dream Police 
       appear directly across from the teenagers.  Scott and Karen 
       jump back.  Jacob hold his ground.

                           SCOTT
                 Whoa!

       The threesomes stand face-to-face in two parallel rows.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 Nice outfits.

                           POWER COP
                 Is this all?

                           JACOB
                 All that's left.

                           SOUND COP
                 It'll have to do.

                           SCOTT
                 We can always come back later.  Like when 
                 it's daytime.

                           POWER COP
                 It's always night here.

                           JACOB
                 What's the plan?

                           BLADE COP
                 We need you to draw him out.

                           SCOTT
                 Terrific.  We're supposed to be bait.

                           SOUND COP
                 Essentially.

                           JACOB
                 Then let's do it.

       KABOOOOOOOOM!  A huge BRICK WALL, ten feet high and spreading 
       out across the street and through the houses, BLASTS up from 
       the asphalt.  Right between the Police and the kids.

       ON THE DREAM POLICE SIDE

       The three cops crouch into battle positions.

       ON THE TEENAGER'S SIDE

       The three of them have hardly any time to react before three 
       perfectly round HOLES open up underneath each of them.

       And Scott, Jacob and Karen fall into darkness.

       ON THE DREAM POLICE SIDE

       Sound Cop stands up and his body begins to VIBRATE.  A new 
       noise emits from his mouth: a HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL.

       And like the walls of Jericho, the bricks in front of them 
       fall apart and tumble to the ground.  Dust settles and the 
       Police walk over the rubble to the other side.  The kids are 
       gone.

                           BLADE COP
                 Fan out.

       The Dream Police break formation and scatter.

       EXT. A STREET

       A hole opens up in the road and WHOOSH, KAREN is elevated up 
       into the scene and the hole seals up instantly.

       She jumps  a few feet and drops to her knees, holding onto 
       the ground.  She looks up at a street sign.  It reads: ELM 
       ST.  Karen stands up and heads down the road.

       EXT. ROCHESTER AVE.

       Another hole, and VOOM, Jacob is shot up into the street.  He 
       spins around, trying to get his bearings.  It doesn't take 
       him long.  He knows exactly where he is.

                           JACOB
                 Oh no...

       He starts to run and we FOLLOW him.

       Jacob jumps over a procession of RATS making their way across 
       the street and just keeps on sprinting.  Until he reaches a 
       certain house.  He catches his breath as he looks at the 
       building, pain registering on his face.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Mom...

       Jacob runs towards the house as our shot MOVES IN CLOSE to 
       the mailbox and ate name printed across it.  It reads 
       JOHNSON.

       INT. NIGHTMARE JOHNSON HOME - ENTRYWAY

       Jacob bursts through the door.  He turns on a light switch.  
       A lamp SPUTTERS into semi-life, and keeps sputtering, casting 
       a candle-like glow over the interior.  

       Cobwebs and dust cover everything.  Rats and tarantula 
       spiders skitter about.  Jacob grits his teeth and walks in 
       deeper.

       EXT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

       Scott BLASTS out of the asphalt.  He staggers for a few 
       seconds from the ride, then looks at the building in front of 
       him.  A puttering neon sign, ÔSPRINGWOOD TAVERN', marks the 
       local saloon.  Muffled MUSIC and VOICES seep through the 
       cracks of the double doors. 

       Scott looks around, then shrugs.  He heads for the entrance.

       INT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

       Dump is too clean a word, dive is too nice, abomination is 
       more like it.  A greenish haze covers everything.  Instead of 
       sawdust on the floor there is a collection of debris that 
       looks like a compilation of human teeth, crushed bugs, and 
       pools of unmentionable goo.

       Then there's the people.

       Imagine any profanity, any obscenity,any blasphemy, add them 
       all up - then double them.  It wouldn't even come close to 
       the patrons of this joint.

       They dance, they yell, they drink bloody bubbling mixtures.  
       There's a guy to the right that doesn't seem to mind that 
       half his brain is showing.  That girl over there has no jaw.  
       In a booth is a couple that are connected at the lips.  A 
       ventriloquist on stage is entertaining the troops with his 
       hand up the back of a real body.

       Scott steps through the door and blinks about a dozen times. 
       Then he decides that the smart course of action is to turn 
       around and go right back out.

       A MUTANT BOUNCER, half his face a skull, blocks Scott's way.

                           MUTANT BOUNCER
                 Two drink minimum.

                           SCOTT
                 Ah, that's okay.  I think I'm underage, 
                 anyway.

                           MUTANT BOUNCER
                 Two drink minimum.

                           SCOTT
                 No, really.  I'm driving.

                           MUTANT BOUNCER
                 Two drink minimum.

       The bouncer with the limited vocabulary seems adamant.  Scott 
       backs off and turns around.  He carefully moves forward.  A 
       MUTANT WAITRESS with three breasts slips next to him.

                           MUTANT WAITRESS
                 Can I get you anything?

                           SCOTT
                 That's okay.  I'll just sit at the bar.

                           MUTANT WAITRESS
                 Alright, honey.  You call if you need 
                 anything.

                           SCOTT
                 You bet.  You'll be the first to know.

       Scott turns away, trying to keep his eyes in their sockets.  
       He slides up to the bar next to a MUTANT BUSINESSMAN.  The 
       man's head is on backwards, his arms lean on the bar while 
       his face looks out into the crowd.  He has to twist his neck 
       to sip his vile drink.

       A BARTENDER, surprisingly normal-looking, steps up to Scott.

                           BARTENDER
                 What'll it be?

                           SCOTT
                 Um, a beer, I guess.

       The bartender fills a twisted glass with a sickly brown 
       liquid.  Chunks of matter float amongst the foam.  Scott 
       takes the drink warily and looks up at the businessman next 
       to him.  The mutant smiles at him.

                           BARTENDER
                 Go on.  Puts hair on your back.

                           SCOTT
                 And that's all?

       The bartender returns.  Holds one of those half pineapple 
       type drinks in his hand, except this one has the back end of 
       a wriggling lizard sticking out of mucousy fluid under a tiny 
       umbrella.  He gives it to Scott.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 That's okay, this'll be plenty.

                           BARTENDER
                 No charge.  Compliments of the man at the 
                 end of the bar.

       The bartender walks away and Scott cranes his head to look 
       down the bar.

       SCOTT'S POV

       The crowd blocks his view, but we can see a gloved hand with 
       four blades strapped to it tapping nonchalantly on the 
       surface of the wood.

       BACK TO SCOTT

       He picks up his drinks, holding the moving one at arm's 
       length, and heads down the bar.

       AT THE END OF THE BAR

       sits Freddy Krueger.  He sips coolly on some hideous 
       concoction as Scott sits down in the chair next to him and 
       lights a cigarette, trying to look equally cool.

                           FREDDY
                 Welcome to my favorite haunt.

                           SCOTT
                 So you're the man.

                           FREDDY
                 At your service.

                           SCOTT
                 What's on your mind?

                           FREDDY
                 A deal.

                           SCOTT
                 A deal's what got me into this.

                           FREDDY
                 Bring Jacob to me.

       Scott, valiantly holding on to his nerve, raises an eyebrow.

                           SCOTT
                 What's in it for me?

                           FREDDY
                 Power.  You don't need to hang out with 
                 those losers. You're a take-charge kind 
                 of guy, Scott.  Like when you took charge 
                 of your father.

       Suddenly Freddy is spinning a gun on the bar with his free 
       hand.  Scott grimaces.

                           SCOTT
                 Leave my father out of this.

                           FREDDY
                 I'll make you mayor of Rosedale.

                           SCOTT
                 After you make it look like this?

                           FREDDY
                 You can have Karen.

       That was Freddy's trump card.  It really hits a nerve in 
       Scott.  Karen's everything he's ever wanted.

                           SCOTT
                 Alive?

                           FREDDY
                 Any way you want her.

                           SCOTT
                     (after a beat)
                 Okay.

                           FREDDY
                 Shake?

       Krueger holds out his knives.  Scott shakes his head.

                           SCOTT
                 No thanks.  I trust you.

       Freddy laughs.

       INT. NIGHTMARE JOHNSON HOME - ALICE'S BEDROOM

       Jacob opens the door into darkness.

                           JACOB
                 Mother?

       He turns on the light and a RED HAZE blankets the room.  
       Jacob looks up.  The dish-like ceiling lamp is filled with 
       blood.

       Jacob walks into the room, tears welling.  He walks by 
       Alice's vanity, her makeup still sitting there as if she 
       might show up and use it at any moment.

       He steps up to a wardrobe closet and touches the edges of it 
       lightly.  He reaches out and slowly, almost reverently, opens 
       the doors. 

       Dozens of writhing SNAKES drop out of the closet and slither 
       onto the ground.

       Jacob jumps back and SCREAMS.

       Then he just stands there in the middle of the teaming 
       reptile mass, not giving a shit anymore, going insane.  His 
       fists clenched, his head tilted back, as he YELLS into the 
       air like a wolf baying at the moon.

       EXT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

       Scott steps off the sidewalk and looks up and down the 
       street.  He thinks and we MOVE IN on him.

                           SCOTT
                 Mayor of Rosedale.

       Scott sneers.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 What a crock of shit.

       We PULL WIDER as Scott cups his hands around his mouth.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 Hey!  He's over here.  Yo!  Dream Police.  
                 Hello!  Come on.  Move you collective 
                 asses.

       CLOSE ON SCOTT

       He puts his hands on his hips and sighs.

                           SCOTT (cont'd)
                 Never a cop around when you need one.

       GLITCH! a stabbing sound of flesh, and Scott JERKS violently 
       as our shot PULLS BACK to reveal:

       Freddy behind Scott, his deadly fingers buried in the boy's 
       back.  Scott chokes on his own blood as Krueger growls.

                           FREDDY
                 I hate a snitch!

       Freddy pulls out his blades as Scott falls forward and with 
       his final breath utters:

                           SCOTT
                 Eat shit...

       His body hits the ground with a THUD as a sudden ROAR fills 
       the air.  Freddy looks around for its source.  And Sound Cop 
       drops down on him with a SMACK.

       The two of them tumble, then both jump up. Freddy laughs.  
       Sound Cop looks down at Scott's body, then back up at 
       Krueger.  His body is shaking with fury,and he opens his 
       mouth.

       The loudest sound yet comes from Sound Cop.  KABOOM!  A blast 
       of air at Mach 3 smacks into Freddy and sends him sailing 
       back, SMASHING right through the Tavern wall.

       INT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

       Freddy flies sideways, right through the bar, destroying 
       chandeliers as he careens through and punches yet another 
       huge hole through the opposite wall.

       The nightmarish customers don't even seem to notice.

       INT. NIGHTMARE JOHNSON HOME - ENTRYWAY

       Jacob is shuffling down the stairs as a SONIC BOOM of noise 
       echoes through the streets outside.

       He knows exactly what that sound means as we MOVE IN on his 
       face.

                           JACOB
                 Krueger...

       Jacob races for the front door.

       INT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

       The dust is just starting to settle as a THUD is heard coming 
       from the hole in the opposite wall.  Quickly followed by 
       Freddy's soaring body.  Krueger SMASHES into some tables and 
       slides across the floor.  Power Cop steps through the hole, 
       his fists clenched.  Freddy stands up and dusts himself off.

                           FREDDY
                 Lighten up, bone brain.

       Power Cop has no intention to.  He bolts over, grabs Krueger, 
       raises him over his head like a wrestler, slams him down on 
       the bar, and SHOVES Freddy, knocking glasses and ashtrays 
       aside until he SMACKS into yet another poor wall.

       Krueger barely gets back on his feet when Power Cop is right 
       on him again.  The big man in black SWINGS, but this time 
       Freddy DUCKS.  CRACK! a support column bursts into dust.  
       Freddy twirls around.  And the two of them start to PUNCH 
       each other.

       It's a barroom brawl between non-humans as Power Cop and 
       Freddy Krueger exchange multiple blows.

       SMACK SMACK SMACK!  Freddy nails Power Cop, whose head barely 
       seems to budge from the hits.

       POW POW POW!  Power Cop lays into Krueger, sending him 
       spinning and tumbling only to pick him up and start the 
       process all over again.

       This goes on for a while, and Krueger is losing.

       The mutant bouncer finally steps up to Power Cop to try and 
       put a stop to all this.

                           MUTANT BOUNCER
                 Take it outside!

       CRUNCH!  Power Cop puts a stop to the bouncer with a vicious 
       elbow in the chest.  All this gave Freddy a few seconds to 
       grab a chair and crack it ineffectually over the Cop's head.  
       The pummeling begins again.

       THWACK THWACK THWACK!  Power Cop is punching Freddy towards 
       the door.

       EXT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

       Like in an old wester, Krueger flies out of the double doors 
       and somersaults onto the pavement.  Sound Cop is a few yards 
       away knelt down next to Scott's dead body.  He looks up as 
       Freddy sneers.

                           FREDDY
                 No more playing around.

       Freddy raises his left fist and it begins to EXPAND.  It 
       grows like an inflated beach ball, except it doesn't look 
       soft at all.  Freddy slides up to the side of the entrance, 
       and raises his giant hammer hand.  Power Cop steps through, 
       looking for blood.  Sound Cop tries to warn him.

                           SOUND COP
                 Kincaid!

       Too late.  BAM!  Freddy's fist slams down on Power Cop's 
       head.  He's actually shoved down into the ground a full two 
       feet - trapped at the legs.

       BAM!  Freddy hits him again.  Power Cop is down to his thighs 
       and he can't get out.

       A RUMBLING is heard.  Freddy turns to see Sound Cop starting 
       to open his mouth.  Krueger instantly reaches down and grabs 
       a brick from the rubble and THROWS it at Sound Cop.

                           FREDDY
                 Put a lid on it!

       THUNK!  The brick lands squarely in Sound Cop's mouth, 
       stretching it painfully and blocking it completely.  Sound 
       Cop reels from the impact.  Tries to pull out the firmly 
       wedged plug.

       Freddy turns back to Power Cop, BAM!  Hits him down to his 
       hips.  The giant fist swings, BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM! like 
       hammering a nail until Power Cop DISAPPEARS into the ground.

       Freddy's hand deflates to regular size as he turns to the 
       struggling Sound Cop.

       Sound Cop's head is EXPANDING.  Pressure seems to be building 
       up, something's gonna blow.  Freddy picks up a boulder from 
       the street rubble.  He catapults it with both hands at Sound 
       Cop.  The boulder hits Sound Cop's head and takes it CLEAN 
       OFF.

       Sound Cop's decapitated skull tumbles away with the brick 
       still stuck, as a blast of air shoots up from the stump of 
       his neck with a SCREECH.

       Sound Cop's body stumbles for a few seconds, then falls over 
       limply.

       Freddy LAUGHS and laughs and laughs... KACHUNK! until a KNIFE 
       embeds itself in his back.  Krueger spins around.

       CHUNK CHUNK CHUNK!  Three more knives slam into his body as 
       he staggers back in surprise.  Blade Cop stands twenty feet 
       away reaching into thin air and whipping out knife after 
       knife, flinging them at Freddy.  They sail like flying 
       bullets.

       CHUNK CHUNK CHUNK!  Krueger falls back from the sheer force 
       of the onslaught, at least a dozen blades sticking out of his 
       body.  

       Blade stops. She stands there for a beat, waiting to see what 
       Freddy will do next.

       Krueger sways, looking like an inhuman pincushion.  Then he 
       grins.  His body steadies, and he suddenly poses like a body 
       builder and flexes every muscle.

       POP POP POP!  The daggers shoot out of his torso and limbs, 
       CLATTERING to the ground.

       The girl in black steps back and raises her arms.  SHINK 
       SHINK!  Two-foot-long sabers jut out from her forearms.  
       They're not held by her, they're a PART of her, exiting from 
       the tops of her wrists under her clenched fists.  She crosses 
       the blades in front of her.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                     (smiling)
                 Ah... a girl after my own heart.

       KACHINK! Freddy shoots out his finger knives and they EXTEND 
       to double their normal size.  He raises them and takes on a 
       fencing stance.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 En guard, bitch

       SWOOP/CLANG!  A swordfight ensues.  Freddy swinging his four 
       long knives.  Blade slashing her rapier-arms.  They lunge, 
       they parry, they leap, they duck.

       CLANG!  They connect.  SCREEEEE.  Metal scrapes metal.  It's 
       a bastardized version of an Errol Flynn movie and Blade Cop 
       and Freddy are equally matched.  Blade moves to get the upper 
       hand.

       CLINK CLINK!  Blades shoot out of the girl's ELBOWS.  Now 
       when she takes a swing with her fists, another sword is right 
       behind it on the follow-through.

       Freddy gets caught off-guard.  Gets slashed twice in the 
       shoulder and twirls away.  Then starts to move FASTER.

       Blade counters with an equally increased intensity.  Freddy 
       ducks, SWOOPS out twice quickly.  A fold of black cloth drops 
       down on Blade's stomach, revealing naked skin and a little 
       blood.  They pause for a second.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Touche.

       And Blade becomes AIRBORNE putting a Samurai to shame, 
       twirling her legs up and out as a blade juts momentarily from 
       her RIGHT HEEL, chopping off Freddy's left hand.

       Krueger stumbles back in astonishment as green goo spurts out 
       of the stump.

       Astonishment turns to rage as the two converge again, 
       swinging away at an incredible rate.  An impossible rate.

       JACOB rounds the corner.  He stumbles into the action just as 
       the battling pair are becoming an obscure swirling GLINTING 
       MASS.  Pieces of them start to drop away.

       Blade's foot hits the ground.  Freddy's arm plops away.  A 
       broken sword hits the asphalt under the spinning cloud, then 
       one of Blade's arms.

       CLOSE ON JACOB

       as he watches, his eyes dart to try to follow the action 
       that's moving too fast for him to see.

       Then there's silence.

       We PULL BACK and PAN  to follow Jacob as he walks into the 
       scene of carnage.  He steps up to two pills of remains: one 
       black and flesh colored covered with red blood, the other a 
       heap of red and green cloth, scarred tissues, and pukish 
       green glop.

       Blade and Freddy have literally chopped each other to bits, 
       the two mounds of body parts steaming in the cold night air.

       Jacob sees something else and walks over to it.  It's Scott's 
       body.  Jacob kneels down next to the dead teenager.

                           JACOB
                 I'm sorry, Scott.

       A CRACKING sound makes Jacob stand up.  Over to the now-
       silent bar entrance a BLACK FIST punches up through the 
       cement.  With a crumbling of granite, Power Cop rises from 
       the earth.

       Something else moves behind Jacob and he turns, then SCREAMS.  
       Sound Cop's headless body walks into the shot, his arms held 
       ABOVE FRAME over his neck.

       Then Sound Cop's arms lower his dismembered HEAD onto his 
       stump, push it down, twist it til it stays.  With great 
       effort, Sound Cop yanks the brick out of his mouth.  

       Jacob now looks OFF SCREEN at something else, something that 
       REALLY makes his eyes widen.  We get to see the shadow of 
       what Jacob sees, projected on the wall of the bar behind him.

       The shadow of the pile of body parts that was Blade Cop 
       begins to MOVE.  The pieces start to REFORM, leg to torso, 
       arm to shoulder, head to neck.  The shadow on the wall rises 
       and we PULL BACK.

       Blade Cop stands across from Jacob, whole again except for a 
       flash of exposed flesh on her abdomen to remind her of the 
       experience.

       Jacob raises his eyebrows as the resurrected Dream Police 
       step around him.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Okay, I'm impressed

       Blade whips her visor up to reveal an upset girl's face.

                           BLADE COP
                 You shouldn't be.

       Jacob frowns as the four of them walk over to the pile of 
       Freddy remains.  But they're not remains anymore.  All that's 
       left of Freddy is a stack of CLOTH remnants.

       A WIND rises and pieces of cloth blow away into the darkness.  
       The other two Dream Police raise their visors, looking 
       equally distraught.  They all face Jacob.

                           BLADE COP (cont'd)
                 This is what we were afraid of.

                           SOUND COP
                 He still exists.

                           JACOB
                 What!  How?

                           POWER COP
                 We're already dead, that's why he 
                 couldn't destroy us.

                           BLADE COP
                 But he's not dead. He's not alive either.  
                 He's something in between.

                           SOUND COP
                 He's not entirely part of reality or part 
                 of dreams.  He's unique.

                           BLADE COP
                 WE can't kill him.

                           POWER COP
                 We can wail away on each other until 
                 doomsday and not do any good.

                           JACOB
                 Then who's going to kill this fucker?

                           SOUND COP
                 YOU have to.

                           JACOB
                 How the hell am I supposed to do that?

                           BLADE COP
                 Krueger's power comes from his rage and 
                 the souls of children.

                           POWER COP
                 You have to find the original source of 
                 that rage and use it against him.

                           BLADE COP
                 This town in its present condition 
                 encompasses all evils from all times in 
                 its history.  The answer is here 
                 somewhere...

       Jacob sighs, then gets an idea.

                           JACOB
                 I think I know where...

       And he starts to run down the street.

                           BLADE COP
                 Jacob, wait.  We have to find him first.

                           JACOB
                 No time.  You guys find Karen!

       He disappears down the road as the Dream Police snap down 
       their visors

       EXT. ELM STREET HOUSE

       Karen stands in front of a rotted gate in front of a run down 
       building with shuttered windows and a crumbling foundation.  
       This isn't just an ELM STREET house, it's THE Elm Street 
       house.  And for some reason Karen is drawn to it.  She looks 
       to her let at the bent mailbox.

       It has a name plate on it.  Another one underneath it.  And 
       another.  It's as if people moved in and out and instead of 
       changing the plates on the mailbox, they just whacked a new 
       one over the old.  Karen steps closer to the mailbox.

       The little sign on the top reads WILLIAMS.  She touches it 
       with her finger and it drops off, the nails holding it on 
       rusted away to dust.  A new plate is revealed.  This one says 
       THOMPSON. Karen picks lightly at it, and it swings away.  The 
       name underneath makes Karen gasp.

       It reads KRUEGER.

       And there's still another one under that horrible name.  
       Karen quickly hits the Krueger plate off.  The last sign 
       reads UNDERWOOD.

       Karen frowns.  She turns back to the house, a determined 
       expression on her face.

                           KAREN
                 No more...

       She KICKS the gate open and walks up to the house.

       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE

       We've been here before, haven't we?  But for Karen it's the 
       first visit as she opens the front door and walks in.  She 
       takes in the twisted skeleton of a home for a few seconds and 
       then begins to SEARCH it.

       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

       Karen races through, pulling open desk drawers, rifling 
       through shelves, flipping through books.  She doesn't know 
       what she's looking for, but she knows she hasn't found it 
       yet.

       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - KITCHEN

       The intensity of Karen's quest increases as she yanks open 
       cabinets and tosses plates to the floor.  Still nothing.

       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - STAIRS

       Karen runs up them, a girl with a mission.

       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM

       Karen flings the door open.  Nothing but a bed and a set of 
       drawers.  No hint as to the occupant's lives.  She doesn't 
       bother ransacking this one and goes on to:

       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - FREDDY'S BEDROOM

       Jackpot.  Karen stares through the open door at a child's 
       room, a very twisted child's room.  She slowly walks in.

       A bed, a desk, a dresser.  There's a Jack-in-a-box with its 
       head torn off.  A disemboweled Teddy Bear.  White puffy guts 
       hanging out of it.  A clown doll with its face caved in.  A 
       hanging mobile made of strange bent shapes.

       And a pile of more-than-dirty clothes.

       Karen goes over to the pile and picks through it with her 
       toe.  A small pair of pants, about the right size for an 
       eight-year-old.  A black pair of shoes.  And a little 
       sweater, a RED AND GREEN STRIPED sweater.

       Karen goes over to the desk.  There is stack of drawings on 
       it - a child's drawings.  On one of them it looks like 
       someone was practicing writing their name.  FREDDY UNNERWOOD, 
       FREDDY UNDERWUD, FREDDY UNDERWOOD over and over again.  Until 
       the final attempt has the last name angrily crossed out, 
       replaced underneath by a hastily scrawled KRUEGER!!!

       Another piece of paper: a set of human stick figures.  A 
       small one is labeled FREDDY.  The large one is labeled DADDY.  
       The Daddy figure is depicted HITTING the Freddy figure.

       There are more drawings, all of them violent, the large 
       figure beating away at the small one.

       Suddenly a CREAKING.  Karen jumps.  Hides behind a bookshelf.  
       She's nervously trying to figure out what to do when a framed 
       picture catches her attention on the shelf.  It's a picture 
       of a tall, dark man and a little boy.  Karen reaches out to 
       grab the picture, but accidentally knocks over a glass mug 
       with a CRASH.

       FOOTSTEPS can now be heard tromping up the stairs.  

       Someone's coming and Karen's on the edge of panic.  She looks 
       around and finds an old baseball bat.  She grabs it and runs 
       to the side of the doorway as the FOOTSTEPS approach down the 
       hallway.  Karen raises the bat.

       And Jacob appears.  Karen pulls back with the bat as Jacob 
       jumps away from her.

                           KAREN
                 Jacob!  You scared the shit out of me!

                           JACOB
                 The feeling is mutual.

                           KAREN
                 Where are the Dream Police?

                           JACOB
                 I told them to look for you.  What are 
                 you doing here?  Don't you know what this 
                 place is?

                           KAREN
                 I do now.  Look what I found.

       She starts to drag him over to the desk of drawings.

                           JACOB
                 You've got to get out of here.

                           KAREN
                 Wait.  You have to see this.

                           JACOB
                 You don't understand.  The Police can't 
                 kill Freddy.  They literally chopped each 
                 other to pieces and he's still alive!  
                 Now I'm supposed to figure out how to get 
                 rid of him.

                           KAREN
                 But I think I found the answer.  Shut up 
                 for a second and look at these.

       She starts showing him the scrawlings.

                           JACOB
                 Okay, so he's a bad artist.

                           KAREN
                 No!  You told me Krueger's mother 
                 committed suicide and no one knows who 
                 his father was, right?

                           JACOB
                 Yeah...

                           KAREN
                 Freddy's been pushing all our buttons 
                 with our pasts.  These are HIS past.  
                 Don't you get it? HE was a foster child, 
                 too!

       She walks over to the bookshelf and grabs the picture of 
       LITTLE FREDDY and FREDDY'S FOSTER FATHER.

                           KAREN (cont'd)
                 Someone had to have taken care of him.  
                 This guy...he was Freddy's father.  Those 
                 drawings...they were Freddy's childhood.  
                 This house...it's where it all happened.

                           JACOB
                 But in reality Freddy hasn't lived here 
                 for decades.

                           KAREN
                 Like you tried to tell me once before, 
                 this is a dream.  Who knows why this is 
                 all here.

                           JACOB
                 All evils from all times in history...

                           KAREN
                 And isn't this where it all started in 
                 Springwood?  On Elm Street?

       Jacob thinks for a second.  It's all starting to make sense.

                           JACOB
                 But what does this do for us?

                           KAREN
                 There's got to be a way to use it against 
                 him.

                           JACOB
                 Okay, but we're not going to stand around 
                 here to figure out how. It's too 
                 dangerous.

       He grabs her hand and pulls her towards her door.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Let's get out of this house.

       They head out to

       UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

       And Blade Cop is standing in the middle of the corridor.  The 
       two teenagers stop.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Thank God.  Freddy's going to show up any 
                 minute.

       KACHINK!  A knife shoots out of Blade's right hand, ready for 
       action.  (but wait a minute, her uniform isn't ripped 
       anymore...)  Karen and Jacob make their way to the stairs.  
       He turns to Blade.

                           JACOB (cont'd)
                 Where are the others?

       Blade walks up to him and stands there.  Then JAMS HER KNIFE 
       into JACOB'S GUT.  Karen SCREAMS.  Jacob chokes.  Blade Cop 
       shoves the knife in further until it juts out of Jacob's 
       back.  She turns.

       Then BECOMES FREDDY.

                           FREDDY
                 Time to join your mommy.

       Krueger yanks his finger blades out and Jacob's limp body 
       falls at Karen's feet.  Karen shrieks and cries, dropping to 
       her knees to hold him.

                           KAREN
                 No no no no no no no...Jacob...

       He looks up at her, slowly dying.  She strokes his forehead 
       while Freddy laughs at the sentiment. 

                           FREDDY
                 Young love...ha!

                           JACOB
                 Karen...dream...powers....

       And Jacob is gone.  Karen sobs, so torn apart that she is 
       ignoring the incredible danger above her.  But not for long.

       Krueger grabs Karen by the neck.

                           FREDDY
                 It's past your bedtime, young lady.

       And he starts to DRAG her, kicking and screaming, her body 
       scraping across the floor towards the 

       MASTER BEDROOM

       Freddy drags Karen in and TOSSES her across the room.  She 
       lands with a THUD on the bed.  He saunters over to her and 
       climbs up on the bed next to her.  Gets on top.

       Karen yells and hits him uselessly with her fists and it's 
       horrible because there he is, pressing down on her, right in 
       her face, mounting her as if he's going to rape her.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Aw, sweetheart.  This won't hurt a bit.

       She screams as he presses even harder.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Come on.  Be Daddy's little girl.

       And the last three words of that sentence seem to ECHO 
       through the room, swirling around Karen.  DADDY'S LITTLE 
       GIRL.  "Daddy's little girl."  Karen twists her head away.

       And Freddy's become Karen's FATHER.  He looks down on her 
       with a lecherous grin.

                           KAREN'S FATHER
                 That's my baby.  That's Daddy's little 
                 girl.

       Karen stops struggling.  The realization grows on her face 
       with the resurfacing memory.

                           KAREN
                 Oh no...

                           KAREN'S FATHER
                     (Freddy's voice)
                 Now do you remember?

       She does.  And she has an answer for him.

                           KAREN
                 You're NOT my father.

                           KAREN'S FATHER
                 But we're going to have the same fun!

       Karen stares at him defiantly.  And a HAND grabs Karen's 
       Father, and yanks him away.  We PULL BACK.  

       KAREN'S MOTHER is next to the bed.  Furious.

                           KAREN'S MOTHER
                 That's enough!

       And she SLAPS Karen's Father.  He stands up, SLUGS her across 
       the jaw.  She tumbles back.  Karen sits up.

                           KAREN
                 Mommy, no!

       Karen's Mother gets up, a defiant look just like Karen's on 
       her face.

                           KAREN'S MOTHER
                 You're never going to touch her again!

                           KAREN'S FATHER
                 I'll touch what I want!

       BAP!  He strikes her again, sending her right out the door.  
       He follows her. Karen stands up and runs after them.

       IN THE HALLWAY

       CRACK!  The man hits the woman down to the floor.  Karen's 
       mother stands up, just taking it.  She's at the top of the 
       stairs.  Karen's Father swings his arm back, and Karen jumps 
       on him.  He shrugs her away violently.

       WITH KAREN

       as she hits the ground and the wall next to Jacob's body.  
       She looks up.

       WIDER

       And Karen's Father is now FREDDY again.  He swings his fist.  
       SMACK!

       Karen's Mother reels from the hit, falls backwards.  Karen 
       jumps up to try and help her, reaching past Freddy.  But it's 
       too late.

       Karen's Mother tumbles down the stairs, head hitting, bones 
       cracking, disappearing into darkness.

       Freddy grabs Karen by the neck and lifts her.  DANGLES her 
       over the top of the steps.

                           FREDDY
                 Be honored, bitch.  You're the last soul 
                 I need.

       And Jacob RISES UP behind Krueger.  GRABS him.  Freddy DROPS 
       Karen.  She hits hard and rolls down the steps as Freddy 
       turns, his knives swinging out and SLAMMING Jacob's gut one 
       more time, IMPALING him against the wall.  Jacob gasps out 
       his final breath.

                           JACOB
                 I'll be back...

                           FREDDY
                 I'll be waiting.

       Freddy pulls his blades out of Jacob and the wall.  The boy's 
       body hits the floor for the last time.  Freddy turns back to 
       the stairs and looks down them.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Where's my little pumpkin?

       He strolls down the steps.

       DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

       Freddy walks down and no one's there.  Karen's Mom was just 
       an illusion, but Karen herself, dead or alive, is nowhere to 
       be seen.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Play time is over, bitch.

       He walks down the hallway.  Eyes darting.  Until a BOOMING 
       VOICE is heard from the kitchen.

                           VOICE
                 FREDERICK!

       Freddy cocks his head and frowns.

                           VOICE (cont'd)
                 Frederick!  What have you done?

       And, amazingly, a look of FEAR crosses Krueger's face.  
       Something about that voice has struck terror in the heart of 
       the creature that fears nobody.

       Krueger turns to the kitchen door.  A man steps out of the 
       shadows, a big muscular man with a horrifying look in his 
       eyes.  A man we've seen somewhere before - in a picture.

       It's FREDDY'S FOSTER FATHER - MR. UNDERWOOD.  And he looks 
       pissed beyond belief.

       Freddy shrinks back, eyes widening.

                           FREDDY
                 Daddy?

                           MR. UNDERWOOD
                 Don't you "Daddy" me!

       Mr. Underwood raises his arm and SMACKS Freddy across the 
       skull.  Krueger tumbles back into the hallway.

       Freddy scrambles to his feet.  Shakes with dread.  Looks like 
       a scared little boy.  Mr. Underwood advances on him.

                           FREDDY
                 No, Daddy. Please...

       Freddy turns and bolts for the front door.  He flings it 
       open.  Power Cop stands in his way and SHOVES Freddy back - 
       back in front of his foster father.

       PUNCH - a vicious blow from Underwood sends Krueger into

       THE LIVING ROOM

       where Freddy falls over a couch.  Underwood stomps into the 
       room. Krueger scrambles up and heads for the archway leading 
       into the dining room.

       BLADE COP blocks the escape.  The ripped flap of her uniform 
       proving she's the real one. She KICKS Freddy back and into 
       Underwood's hands.  The man picks up Krueger and HITS him 
       again.  And again.  And again.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Stop.  You're hurting me.  Stop.

       Freddy wriggles away and opens a window.  Sound Cop fills the 
       window, cutting him off.  Pushes him back inside.

       Mr. Underwood grabs Krueger and slaps him over and over.  
       Slugs him.  Gives the beating he's got coming to him.

       And Freddy MOANS and YELLS like a blubbering child.  Shrinks 
       into a corner but is yanked out for more pummeling.

       Power Cop stands at the exit to the hallway.  Blade Cop 
       continues to obstruct the dining room arch.  Sound Cop steps 
       through the window and stands in front of it.  The Dream 
       Police just stare in silence.

       It's not a street fight, not a punching match.  Just a 
       ruthless thrashing that would be hard to watch if it weren't 
       for the fact that we are all cheering because no one in 
       history has ever deserved it more.

       Underwood stops the whipping and stands over Krueger who is 
       lying on the ground whimpering, pleading for mercy.

                           FREDDY (cont'd)
                 Why, Daddy?  What did I do?

                           MR. UNDERWOOD
                 You took some things that don't belong to 
                 you!

       And with that, Underwood brings his fist down and JAMS it 
       into Freddy's stomach.  Right THROUGH IT.  Shoving it into 
       his very body.

       Freddy SCREAMS.  Underwood violently pulls his fist out and 
       there's SOMETHING in it.  A shimmering flowing thing.  
       Crackling with unworldly LIGHT.  It's a SOUL.  It's Wesley's 
       SOUL.  Underwood flings his arm out and lets go.  Wesley's 
       soul flies into thin air and DISSIPATES.

       Krueger's father brings his hand down again and RIPS out 
       GINA'S SOUL.  Again.  JACOB'S SOUL.  Freddy opens his mouth 
       and shrieks.  As Underwood raises his arms and begins to 
       SPARKLE.  FLASHES of light bounce around his body. He's 
       changing.

       And something's happening to Freddy's too.  Steam is rising 
       from the creature.  His feet are starting to flatten as he 
       lays on the ground and BLACK GOO oozes from his pores.

       He's melting.  And still screaming as he watches his foster 
       father's image turn into:

       KAREN.  An aura of LIGHT vanishes around her body as she 
       lowers her arms with a victorious yet sad look on her face.  
       Freddy DIES.

       A look of horrified realization burns in Krueger's eyes as he 
       sees Karen and CONTINUES to scream inhumanly.

       His body dissolves, all of it liquefying into BLACK SLIME.  
       Gone.  Just a bubbling black puddle of gunk is left.  His 
       SHRIEK echoes through the room and everywhere else.

       Then the GUNK grows and changes into a dark cloud that begins 
       to EXPAND.

       Power Cop runs up, grabs Karen and yells.

                           POWER COP
                 We gotta get outta here!

       Karen, almost mesmerized by the black cloud spreading in 
       front of her, stumbles away with Power Cop.

       EXT. ELM STREET HOUSE

       The Dream Police and Karen bolt out the front door and run 
       down the street as a RUMBLE joins Freddy's thunderous SHRIEK 
       and the entire town begins to SHAKE.

       We stay with a shot of the house as the noise and vibrations 
       continue.

       And the Elm Street House EXPLODES.  The BLACK CLOUD punches 
       out the roof and the walls, sending wood and debris flying 
       everywhere.

       The rubble flies into the air, hangs there for a beat, then 
       falls to the ground.

       All is SILENT.  And the dark cloud turns WHITE.  The milky 
       fog spreads out.

       EXT. ELM STREET INTERSECTION

       Karen falls to her knees on the pavement, not looking back at 
       the destruction one block away.

       The Dream Police stop running to turn to face her.  Karen 
       hangs her head and cries.

       Blade steps forward.

                           BLADE COP
                 It took a human touch.  It took knowing 
                 HIS nightmare.  Goodbye, Karen.

       Karen raises her head as the Dream Police turn away.

       KAREN'S POV - THE DREAM POLICE

       walk off into the distance.  Just as they are about to vanish 
       into the darkness, a FOURTH FIGURE appears and joins them in 
       formation.  Then they all disappear.

       ANGLE ON KAREN

       Her mouth drops open at what she's just seen.  What she 
       DOESN'T see is the white cloud swooping down the street 
       behind her. She just closes her eyes as the ivory mist 
       envelops her and the SCREEN GOES WHITE.

       FADE IN FROM WHITE TO:

       EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY

       Karen lies sleeping on the bench amongst the grass and trees.  
       Her eyes open and squint at the bright light.  She sits up 
       and tries to get her bearings.  Some hair falls into her face 
       and she brushes it away.  Only then noticing that she's 
       holding something in her hand.

       She opens her hand and looks down.

       KAREN'S POV

       It's an ID bracelet.  A band of gold with a larger plate 
       dangling from the middle of it.  Karen's hand turns it over.  
       This time the printing reads JACOB.

       WITH KAREN

       she chokes back the tears.  We hear a PANTING O.S.  Then a 
       woman's voice.

                           WOMAN
                 You okay, honey?

       Karen looks up as we PULL BACK.  A pleasant-looking woman, no 
       longer a mutant, is walking her cute dog.  She looks 
       sincerely concerned.  Karen nods.

                           KAREN
                 Yes.  I'm alright.

                           WOMAN
                 I've never seen you around.  Are you new 
                 in town?

                           KAREN
                 Sort of.

                           WOMAN
                 Well then...
                     (she smiles)
                 Welcome to Springwood.

       The woman continues on her way.  Karen sighs and puts the 
       bracelet on her wrist.  She stands and our SHOT PULLS UP AND 
       AWAY as the pretty young girl starts walking through a town 
       she's never seen - except in her dreams.

    READER NOTE

    One thing that will be obvious to viewers, but not
    to readers, is that the nine principal parts in this
    film are played by only three actors:

     1) Gary, Gavin, Gabriel

     2) Sarah, Susan, Sierra

     3) Margaret, Melissa, Mary

    It'll make more sense in context. Promise.

      A MAN'S HAND

      unwinds a short length of green string. We're extremely
      close, with a shallow, blurry focus. It's like the first
      moments after a dream -- just fragments.

      Scissors cut the string. The man wraps it around his left
      wrist. A loop. A bracelet.

      We see the man's teeth, the edge of his chin as he pulls the
      knot tight.

      His fingers pull against the string.   Solid.   It won't break
      easily.

      PITCH BLACK

      There's no music. No sound at all, really, except for some
      distant birds CHIRPING.

      Then a SQUEAK.   A SQUEAL as rusty springs engage.

      A GARAGE DOOR LIFTS,

      revealing GARY BANKS in silhouette. He's 30, effortlessly
      fit, with movie-star good looks. (Although for now, he's
      merely a TV star.)

      Like most Laurel Canyon garages, this one has never held a
      car. Instead, it's the resting place for all the detritus of
      bachelordom: shitty Ikea furniture, a drum set, a styrofoam
      snowman, and the Harley he always meant to get running.

      Gary spots what he was looking for.

      EXT. BACK PATIO / LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR (DAWN)

      Gary drags a beaten Weber kettle. One of its wheels is
      broken, SCRAPING against the deck.

      WIDER, we see Gary's house has an incredible view of the
      city. He couldn't fucking care less.

      He yanks the circular grill out of the Weber and throws it
      down the canyon.

                                                                  2.

      He empties a garbage bag into the barbecue: mostly women's
      clothes, but also some stuffed animals and photos still in
      their frames. There's too much to fit, so he tries stomping
      it down with a flip-flopped foot.

      He cracks open a container of lighter fluid and begins
      drenching everything inside. He sprays until the container
      is WHEEZING air. He shakes it, making sure it's really
      empty.

      Then he cracks open a new container and keeps spraying.   And
      spraying.

      We follow the dripping fluid as it runs across a photo of
      Gary and a BLONDE WOMAN. Her eyes are scratched out, making
      her unrecognizable.

      Under the grill, lighter fluid is dripping in a stream,
      soaking into the wooden deck.

      Finally satisfied, Gary throws the lighter fluid aside. He
      takes five steps back and pulls a box of matches from his
      pocket.

      EXTREMELY CLOSE as the match SCRAPES, erupting in flames.

      On Gary's left wrist, we see a green string bracelet.

      MUSIC STARTS: a pounding, hypnotic track that will carry us
      through these MAIN TITLES.

      In EPIC SLOW-MOTION, we follow the burning match as it sails
      through the air, tumbling end-over-end.

      Just as it's about to reach its target, we...

      INT. THE PRIUS - DAY

      Gary's at the wheel, driving, as he finishes a fifth of
      bourbon. JUMP CUTS take us out of Hollywood, heading
      downtown. Our TRAVELLING MUSIC is serving us well.

      Gary stops at a light. He looks left and sees himself on the
      side of a bus. It's an ad for CRIME LAB ("This fall, Mondays
      are killer.") Gary watches himself drive away.

106   Further along, Gary spots two THUGGY TEENAGERS sitting on a 106
      low wall. He calls out to them:

                              GARY
                   Hey!   Do you sell crack?

      The boys look wary.

                                GARY (CONT'D)
                   It's cool.     I'm only a cop on TV.



      QUICK CUTS:

      Money changes hands.

      Gary holds a small ziplock bag -- and has no idea what to do
      with its lumpy beige contents.

      HOLLYWOOD.

      Gary pulls up to a curb. He's now on Sunset Blvd. A
      matronly black streetwalker (OCTAVIA, 35) approaches the
      passenger window.

      Gary holds up the little bag.

                             GARY
                   Is this crack?

      She takes a closer look.

                   Do you know how to do it?

      INT. SHITTY MOTEL ROOM - DAY

      Gary and Octavia jump up and down on the bed, each trying to
      bounce higher than the other, LAUGHING all the while.

      Gary bounces so high that he THUNKS his head against the
      ceiling. He crumples, falling off the bed. But he's still
      laughing.

      Gary takes a shower with his jeans on.

      INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Toweling off, Gary looks at his body in the mirror. He
      notices something odd. He tries to wake Octavia up, but
      she's down for the count.

      Looking around, he finds his cell phone. Dials 911. Pacing,
      he tries to sober up while it rings. The far side answers.

                          GARY
                Yes, hello. I'm having a medical
                situation. Yes. Okay. I don't
                have a belly button.
                    (explaining carefully)
                I do not have a belly button where
                I should, on my belly. And I'm
                concerned, because I don't know if
                that's...

      He sits down on the edge of the bed.

                          GARY (CONT'D)
                Can a person live without a belly
                button? Because if you think about
                it, you're born with one. So if
                you don't have one, you're unborn
                and it's really hazy whether you're
                alive or not. I guess I'm
                wondering: am I alive?
                    (a sudden thought)
                Or what if I'm God?

      A beat.

                           GARY (CONT'D)
                No, no.   I'm totally sober.

                          GARY (CONT'D)
                No, I don't think I need an
                ambulance. I don't seem to be
                dying any faster than usual. But I
                should probably go to the hospital,
                don't you think? Yeah, I should.

       He's driving again, but most of his attention is focused on
       trying to locate his missing navel.

       He looks up in the rear-view mirror, where he sees two

       sitting in the back seat.    All three Garys give each other
       thumbs-up.

       Gary has rolled the car.

       MARGARET O'REILLY, 34, is speaking to herself.

                  La la la la la. Like you've never
                  done worse.

       From a NEW ANGLE, we see she's using a cell phone earpiece.

                  Okay, yes. He totalled a car. But
                  it was an environmentally friendly
                  car. Why doesn't that get

                A few. Not Hugh Grant level. More

                day or night. If you don't answer

                That's why it's called house

                house.

                He can take direction, I promise.

      INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

      Margaret pulls open curtains, flooding the room with light.
      Gary wanders, checking it all out.

                          MARGARET
                Okay, just so it's said, this house
                is flammable.

                          GARY
                I didn't mean to burn down my
                house.

                          MARGARET
                Yeah, I didn't mean to eat my way
                into a ten-year shame spiral, but I
                did, and it's healthier to
                acknowledge it.
                    (moving on)
                This flammable house belongs to one
                of Lola's other fabulous clients,
                who is currently shooting a pilot
                in Toronto.

                             GARY
                Actor?

                          MARGARET
                Writer. So for the next six weeks,
                su casa es su casa. I say, feel
                free to wear his clothes. He'll
                probably get a sick thrill of out
                it. The gays.

      Noticing two crates...

                          GARY
                He has dogs?

                          MARGARET
                They're away at summer camp.    Now,
                try the bed.

      He lies back on it, feeling it out.

                             GARY
                It's fine.

                          MARGARET
                Comfortable?

                             GARY
                Sure.

      She massages his besocked feet.

                                                                 9.

                          MARGARET
                Look, Gary, I know this has been
                crazy and stressful. I want you to
                feel safe. And comfortable.

                           GARY
                I do.

                          MARGARET
                I'm a fan of yours, you know.   Your
                number-one fan.

      Gary looks over his toes at Margaret. From this angle, she
      looks a bit like Kathy Bates from Misery.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)
                But if you fuck this up, I will
                smash your ankles with a sledge
                hammer.

      A long beat.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)
                That wouldn't be comfortable for
                either of us.

                                                CUT TO:

      INT. KITCHEN - DAY

      Margaret boxes up the alcohol while Gary bounces a lime on
      the island.

                           MARGARET
                I'll be coming by twice a day to
                check up on you. I'm the only
                person who should be coming by. No
                buddies, no pals, no heroin
                dealers...

                          GARY
                I don't do heroin.

                          MARGARET
                Yeah, crack is classy. And I'm not
                buying you porn. There's spray-per-
                view on cable.

                          GARY
                Good. I really wasn't concerned
                about my career, my family or my
                future. I just wanted to jack off.

      Margaret is a little impressed by this show of backbone.

                                                                 10.

                          MARGARET
                Let me see your phone.

      He hands over his cell phone.   She drops it in the contraband
      box.

                           GARY
                C'mon!   All my numbers are in that.

                          MARGARET
                Dial ten digits at random. Whoever
                answers will be better than the
                people on this phone.

      She picks up the liquor box, ready to go.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)
                You have my cell number. You have
                delivery menus. You're fine.
                Right?

                           GARY
                I guess.

      As she leaves, Margaret notices a long butane lighter by the
      stove. She adds it to the box, just to be sure.

                                                  TIME CUT TO:

      INT. HOUSE / VARIOUS - DAY

      Gary paces around his new home, trying to get a feel for it.

      He plays a few NOTES on the piano.

      He looks up at the painting over the staircase:    a cliff near
      the ocean.

      He opens random drawers in a Chinese herb cabinet, wondering
      if there's anything hidden in one of the 46 slots. There
      isn't.

      He takes a long beat to consider three paintings in the
      dining room, which show the same thing in three different
      ways.

      EXT. BACKYARD - SUMMER NIGHT

      Gary swims laps, trying to exhaust himself.

      He stands in the shallow end, listening to the quiet.

                                                                 11.

      INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT

      Wearing a fluffy white robe, he looks through the delivery
      menus.


122                                                                     122
      INT. FOYER / FRONT DOOR - SUMMER NIGHT

      He takes a bag of food from a college-age DELIVERY GUY, who
      seems to recognize him. Gary pays him, shuts the door.

      As he's walking to the kitchen with the food, Gary looks back
      and sees the Delivery Guy watching him from the front walk.
      The guy is a little embarrassed, but Gary is pretty used to
      being stared at.


123                                                                     123
      INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT

      Gary unwraps the Thai food.   Makes himself a plate.

      He watches CRIME LAB on the plasma screen while eating
      dinner.

                          GARY (O.S. TV DIALOGUE)
                Once we get these samples back to
                the Crime Lab, we'll know who the
                real killer is.


124                                                                     124
      INT. LIBRARY / TV ROOM - NIGHT

      Gary scans the shelves, looking for something to read. There
      are five times more books here than Gary has opened in his
      lifetime.

      He settles on a paperback of Voltaire's Candide.

      He lies back on the couch, reading it.

      He flips a few pages ahead to see if it gets more
      interesting. A beat.

      GARY JACKING OFF

      to soft-core pay-per-view. We're CLOSE ON Gary's straining
      face, but we can hear the pleasured MOANS of the actresses as
      they go down on each other.

      Nearing climax, he looks for something to come on.     He can't
      find anything.

                                                                  12.

      INT. FOYER - NIGHT

      His left hand cupped to hold the semen, he pads barefoot from
      the TV room to the downstairs bathroom. We hear WATER
      RUNNING as he washes his hands. Then it shuts off.

      We hear a THUNK.   Something hard was dropped on the wood
      floor.

      Gary hears it too.

      He steps out of the bathroom, looks around. He takes a few
      silent paces back in our direction, stopping just before he
      reaches the two-story section of the foyer.

      That's when he hears it: CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK on the
      wooden floor. A JINGLE of metal.

      We follow Gary's eyes up to the second-floor walkway.   We can
      hear the little FOOTSTEPS, toe nails CLICKING. Faint
      PANTING. But there's no dog.

      BACK ON Gary, increasingly unsettled. He's directly below
      the walkway, and can't see up into it.

                           GARY
                 Is somebody there?   Hello?

      He CLAPS his hands twice.   Listens.

      Nothing.

      He's about to venture a step forward when suddenly

      THE PHONE RINGS.

      He nearly jumps out of his skin. It RINGS two more times
      before he ducks into the TV room to answer it.

                           GARY (CONT'D)
                 Hello?!
                     (relieved)
                 Yes. Yes.

      He turns his back to the foyer, listening to the instructions
      on the phone.

                           GARY (CONT'D)
                 Nine leopards run through the
                 jungle.
                     (listening)
                 I bought two cakes at the store.

      His identity evidently confirmed, he hangs up.   He looks back
      into the foyer.

                                                            13.

                           GARY (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
                 The house is haunted. There's a
                 zeitgeist, or something.


127                                                               127
      EXT. UPSTAIRS DECK - DAY

      Margaret's brought coffee and pastries from Susina.

                           MARGARET
                 Poltergeist, and no. Maybe they
                 were rats. L.A. is teaming with
                 rats. They live in the palm trees.

                            GARY
                 Sure.   Maybe.

      He's obviously not convinced.

                           MARGARET
                 Okay. You know I'm a licensed
                 psychotherapist.

                            GARY
                 Really?

                           MARGARET
                 No. I'm a publicist. My job is
                 what other people think of you, not
                 what you think of yourself. So
                 pull your shit together. I am
                 thisclose to getting Christine
                 Walsh to do your piece in Parade.

                            GARY
                 Parade?   I fucking hate Parade.

                           MARGARET
                 Everyone hates Parade. But the
                 people who watch "Crime Lab," they
                 love their Marilyn Vos Savant.
                 Give them a woman of indeterminate
                 age who solves riddles and they are
                 in hee-haw heaven.

                            GARY
                 Okay.

                           MARGARET
                 One heartfelt act of contrition and
                 maybe the showrunner won't kill off
                 your character between seasons.

      He nods.   He gets it.

                                                               14.

                I swear to God, if you go batshit
                on me...

                          GARY
                I'm not crazy.

                            MARGARET
                Exactly.    Exactly.

      EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

      Gary is lying in the sun, eyes shut.   Suddenly, a golf ball
      hits him on the head.

      He sits up, perplexed. For a long moment, he has no idea
      where the ball came from, until he hears a voice from beyond
      the wall that separates the properties.

                           WOMAN'S VOICE
                Sorry!   Really sorry.

      (A practiced ear notices a Canadian accent.)

                          WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                Over here. To your left.
                    (correcting)
                Right. Sorry. Right.

      He follows the voice to a gap in the hedges at the far corner
      of the yard, finding SARAH GLEASON. Late 30's, fresh-
      scrubbed and girlish, she looks more fragile than she really
      is.

                          SARAH
                I'm working on my putting, if you
                can believe it.

      Indeed, she's holding a putter.

                          GARY
                Not really.

                          SARAH
                Okay. Maybe I was just looking for
                a way to meet my infamous neighbor.
                You see, I'm under house arrest,
                too.

                          GARY
                What did you do?

                                                15.

                     SARAH
           I had sex with my husband.

                     GARY
           That's awful.

                     SARAH
           Nine months later, I had Jaden.
           That's her over there.

She points to a small portable baby monitor.

                     GARY
           She's cute.

                     SARAH
           She's sleeping for another...
               (checks watch)
           ...seventeen minutes. She keeps to
           a schedule.

                     GARY
           She sounds really boring.

                     SARAH
               (whispers)
           She is.

A beat.   A smile between them.

                     GARY
           You're rich. Shouldn't you have a
           nanny from Ecuador?

                     SARAH
           I'm Canadian.

                     GARY
               (as if that explains it)
           Ohhh...

                     SARAH
           I can't work in the U.S. Plus, I
           want to maintain this air of moral
           superiority by doing everything
           myself.

                     GARY
           Very Canadian.

                     SARAH
           Thanks.

Another pregnant pause.

                 Listen, Jaden goes down again at
                 2:30. Maybe I could stop by.

                           GARY
                 I'm pretty sure I'll be here.

                           SARAH
                 It's a date.

                             GARY
                 Is it?

      She picks up the baby monitor, heading back into her house.
      Suddenly, she realizes...

                            SARAH
                 Oh.   I'm Sarah, by the way.

                 Gary.

      Gary neatens up, tossing out newspapers and delivery boxes.
      He plumps pillows.

      He looks up at the clock:      2:30.

      He sits, trying to read Candide again.     He fidgets.

      He looks at the clock again:     2:49.

      Gary carefully sets rat traps, staggering them every few
      feet.

      He pokes one with a pencil.   The metal arm SNAPS back,
      breaking the pencil in two.

      INT. FOYER - DAY

      Gary notices that the piano has an electronic device attached
      to it. He turns it on.

      He opens the piano bench, finding computer disks. A red disk
      is labelled "Knowing." He puts it in. Hits play.

      The piano begins playing by itself, a sensuous but melancholy
      CLASSICAL PIECE.

      Gary lies on the floor, listening to it.   He stares up at the
      elaborate chandelier.

      EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY

      Gary is sitting on a bench by the front walk, trying to read
      more of his book. He looks over to see Sarah coming up the
      steps, carrying the baby monitor and a bottle of chardonnay.

      She stops beside him.

                           SARAH
                 The best of all possible worlds.

                           GARY
                     (confused)
                 Okay.

                 I thought I was.

      He gets up.

                 Sorry I bailed. Jaden had a fever.

      INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

      Sarah tops off Gary's wine glass. They're both on the couch.
      The baby monitor is sitting on the table behind them.

                           GARY
                 ... so it's kind of hard to prove
                 that I only meant to burn my ex-
                 girlfriend's stuff, and not the
                 entire house.

                            SARAH
                 Yeah.   Fire's tricky that way.

                           GARY
                 How about you? Any history of
                 arson?

                 Strangely enough...

                              GARY
                 I knew it!     I could see that little
                 spark.

                           SARAH
                 It wasn't arson.    Probably.

      A long beat while she decides whether she wants to tell him
      the story.

                           SARAH (CONT'D)
                 Okay. When I was a little girl,
                 our house caught on fire.

                                                                    19.

                              GARY
                 Oh shit.

     MUSIC begins, providing backing to her monologue.

                           SARAH
                 I'll never forget the look on my
                 father's face as he gathered me up
                 in his arms and raced through the
                 burning building, out onto the
                 pavement.

     ON GARY, feeling bad he brought this up, but fascinated at
     the same time.

                           SARAH (CONT'D)
                 I stood there shivering in my
                 pajamas and watched the whole world
                 go up in flames. And when it was
                 all over, I said to myself, "Is
                 that all there is to a fire?" Is
                 that all there is?

     As she starts to SING, Gary realizes the story isn't hers at
     all. It's Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is."

                              SARAH (CONT'D)
                 Is that all there is, is that all there is?
                 If that's all there is my friends, then let's
                 keep dancing.

     She leans closer.

                 If that's all there is.

     Standing up, Sarah takes Gary's hands, pulling him off the
     couch. She leads him to an open area -- more space for
     dancing.

                   Then I fell in love with the most
                   wonderful boy in the world. We
                   would take long walks by the river
                   or just sit for hours gazing into
                   each other's eyes. We were so very
                   much in love. Then one day he went
                   away and I thought I'd die. But I
                   didn't. And when I didn't, I said
                   to myself, "Is that all there is to
                   love?"

      Deep in the bowels of the store, Sarah is surrounded by

      Sarah and Gary become more intimately acquainted on the
      couch. They still haven't kissed, but hands are running up
      and down over clothing. Sarah isn't singing anymore, though
      her voice continues.

                                                                  21.

      A BABY HOWLS.

      It's the monitor, HISSING and POPPING as Jaden wakes up from
      her nap, cranky and hungry. Sarah pushes back. Gary tries
      to close the gap, but she's already standing up.

      Gary washes the wine glasses, being sure to wash off any
      trace of lipstick. He dries them and puts them back in the
      cabinet.

      Faced with the remainder of the wine, he considers dumping it
      down the sink. Instead, he chugs it from the bottle.

      He wraps the empty bottle in newspaper and tucks it in the
      recycling.

      Gary enters from the driveway door, gulping from a water
      bottle. He starts to look through the delivery menus when he
      notices an orange Post-It note by the telephone. It reads:

                         Look for the Nines.

      He picks it up, looks at the back.   Nothing.    Sticks it back
      down on the counter.

                Goodnight.

      For a long beat, it's quiet.   Then we hear RUSTLING.

      A crib toy plays a short MELODY.   Then a slightly-digital
      voice speaks:

                          VOICE
                The cat says meow!

                The cow says moo!
                The cow says moo!
                The cow says moo!

      Evidently, Jaden loves the cow.

                          VOICE (CONT'D)
                The dog says, nine. Nine. Nine.
                Nine.

                                                                  23.

       Gary looks back.     Did he just hear that?

       The phone RINGS.


159                                                                     159
       INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

       Gary answers it on the third ring.

                               GARY
                   Hello.

       It's the parole system.

                             GARY (CONT'D)
                   Yes. Yes. Two trains run through
                   the forest.

       Music STRIKES. We see a sudden change in Gary's expression.
       He nearly drops the phone.

       Forcing himself not to panic, he pushes the button for
       speakerphone. He wants to make sure he's hearing it right.

                               MALE COMPUTER VOICE
                   Nine.    Nine. Nine. Nine.

       Gary backs away from the phone like it might sprout legs and
       jump on him. Suddenly, he backs into

       SOMEONE ELSE.

       He spins around, startled. He only catches a glimpse of THE
       MAN -- same height, same build, same everything. The Man is
       gone in half an instant, vanished into thin air.

       Gary bolts for the door.

       Reaching the foyer, Gary steps on a

       RAT TRAP,

       which SNAPS down on his toes. He SCREAMS, pulling it off.
       He looks around to find all eight traps are now on the main
       floor, rather than the second-floor walkway.

       Limping, he hops out the door.     We stay behind, looking out
       through the open door.


A160                                                                A160
       EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD. - NIGHT

       HEADLIGHTS FLARE as cars travel down Miracle Mile, bringing
       us to a Metro Bus stop -- a semi-enclosed bench with backlit
       signage.

                                                           24.

The far side of the shelter has a one-sheet for Crime Lab.
("This fall, Mondays are murder.") The bench side is a promo
poster for a show called Knowing. ("Some fates are chosen
for you.")

It's here we find Gary taking a seat, gingerly checking his
toes where the rat trap snapped. He's hobbled his way here
from the house, which is probably a block away.

There's only a little blood, but his toes really hurt.

Over Gary's shoulder, we see a blonde 8-year old girl
(Noelle) watching him with concern. She BANGS on the shelter
to get his attention. Gary nearly jumps out of his skin.

                     GARY
          Jesus!   You scared the shit out
          of...

She signs "What's wrong?"

                    GARY (CONT'D)
              (confused)
          What?

                    NOELLE
              (signed, subtitled)
          You're hurt.
                    GARY
          I don't speak that.   Sorry.   I
          don't...

She points to his toes.   Getting what she must mean...

                      GARY (CONT'D)
          I'm fine.    I'll be fine.

Looking around, he realizes that the little girl is out here
by herself.

                    GARY (CONT'D)
          Where are your parents?

She looks at him oddly, not really getting the question.

                    GARY (CONT'D)
          Your mom, your dad. Where are
          they?

                     NOELLE
               (signed, subtitled)
          Mom is at the car. Where you left
          her.
Again, Gary has no idea what she's saying.

                                                                  25.

                             NOELLE (CONT'D)
                       (signed, subtitled)
                   You're lost.
                             GARY
                   Look, you need to go back, okay?
                   You shouldn't be out here. It's
                   not safe.

       Noelle glances to her left.

       We hear BWOOP BWOOP as a police cruiser pulls over to the
       curb.

                             GARY (CONT'D)
                   Shit.

       We go to a WIDER ANGLE as TWO OFFICERS get out of the car.
       Gary looks back.

       Noelle is gone, though there's really nowhere she could have
       disappeared.

       Putting on his best face for the police...

                             GARY (CONT'D)
                   Evening, officers.

                                                    CUT TO:

       INT./EXT.   POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

       Handcuffed, Gary is placed in back.     He's reserving the right
       to remain silent.

                             MARGARET (PRE-LAP)
                   Once again, the idea of house
                   arrest is you stay inside your
                   house.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

       The same parole officer from earlier attaches a black anklet
       to Gary's left leg. We see that Gary's left foot also
       features bandaged toes.

                              MARGARET
                   Think of it like an electronic
                   leash. Basically, if you ever go
                   more than 100 feet from the base
                   station...

       She points to an electronic device by the wall.

                                                                 26.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)
                ...the cops come, they throw your
                ass in jail. If you ever try to
                take it off, the cops come and
                throw your ass in jail. And if
                they ever detect drugs or alcohol
                in your system...

                          GARY
                ...the cops come and throw my ass
                in jail.

                          MARGARET
                No. I kick your ass. Then the
                cops come and throw your ass in
                jail.

      The parole officer smiles.

                          GARY
                Do I still have to answer the
                phone?

                          MARGARET
                No, I'll be doing that from now on.
                I'm moving into the guest room.

                          GARY
                I don't need a babysitter.

                          MARGARET
                Despite all evidence to the
                contrary. Don't worry, I'm a cool
                roomie. Who do you think taught
                Affleck how to gamble?

      The parole officer hits a test button on the anklet, which
      lets out a PIERCING ALARM.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)
                Let's never hear that again.

      Margaret walks heel-to-toe, counting her steps.

                            MARGARET
                97.   98.   99.

      With a piece of chalk, she draws a line on the concrete.    She
      looks back to Gary, who's waiting by the front door.

                                                               27.

                    (jumps over the line)
                Out of the world. In the world.
                Out of the world. Look at me, I'm
                dancin'!

      She starts doing the running man over the line.   Even Gary's
      dark mood is broken.

      Margaret and Gary roast marshmallows over the propane grill
      to make s'mores. They're giggling.

                          GARY
                So the guy was like, "Do you know
                fencing?" And I say, of course.
                That's what it says on my headshot.

                           MARGARET
                Lies!

                           GARY
                Always.   So he says, "Foil or epi?"

                           MARGARET
                Epée.

                          GARY
                I say, I'm about equal in both.

                          MARGARET
                Which is true.

                          GARY
                So he tosses me this fucking Conan
                sword and goes after me. I'm just
                swinging, trying to stay alive.
                But I end up cutting his ear.

                          MARGARET
                You cut his ear off?

                          GARY
                Just a little. But I got the job.

      Margaret is confused.

                Yes. No. Not the movie, the ride.
                I was like, "Gar! Keep both hands

      They're safe inside an inflatable paradise.

      With that, she's gone.

                                                 CUT TO:

      INT. KITCHEN - DAY

      Gary is trying to load dishes into the dishwasher, but has a
      hard time getting one bowl to fit.

                          MARGARET
                What are "the Nines?"

                             GARY
                What?

      He looks over.    Margaret holds up the orange sticky note by
      the phone.

                                                                31.

                           MARGARET
                 "Look for the Nines."

                           GARY
                 It's not mine.

                           MARGARET
                 It's your handwriting.

                           GARY
                 I didn't write it.

                             MARGARET
                 Okay.

      She puts it back down.    But she doesn't believe him.

                           MARGARET (CONT'D)
                 All-ee-all-ee-all-come-free.

                           GARY
                     (perplexed)
                 What?

                             MARGARET
                 Nothing.

                           GARY
                 Seriously, what?

                           MARGARET
                 Nothing. I thought you
                 were...forget it. Done.    Sorry.


171                                                                   171
      EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

      At the far edge of the property, Margaret and Gary play
      backgammon. Their mood is significantly more subdued.

      Margaret answers her RINGING cell phone.

                           MARGARET
                 Yhello? Hi. What?!
                     (to Gary)
                 I have to take this.

      He nods.   Margaret starts walking back to the house.

                           MARGARET (CONT'D)
                     (on phone)
                 Well, who thought it was a good
                 idea letting Courtney into a
                 pottery shop?

                                                                32.

      Left alone, Gary rolls the dice idly. He gets a 4 and a 5.
      Rolls again. 4,5. 3,6. 4,5. 3,6. 3,6. 3,6. 4,5.

      He keeps rolling, the wheels in his head starting to turn.


172                                                                   172
      EXT.   FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY

      Sarah is looking in through the living room windows, trying
      to spot Gary. Giving up, she turns back to the main steps,
      only to find...

      MARGARET,

      who doesn't look pleased.

                            MARGARET
                  I know who you are.

                              SARAH
                  Really.

                            MARGARET
                  I know what you are. And if you
                  come near him again...

                            SARAH
                  You'll what?

      Margaret lets that go unanswered.   There's obviously
      something big we're not privy to.

                            SARAH (CONT'D)
                  What are you going to do, M...

      She's forgotten Margaret's name -- if she ever knew it.

                            SARAH (CONT'D)
                  Sorry, what's he calling you?

                              MARGARET
                  Margaret.

                            SARAH
                  I like that. "Margaret."   Classic.

                            MARGARET
                  Why can't you just leave him alone?

                            SARAH
                  Alone? He's an actor. If nobody's
                  watching him, he doesn't really
                  exist.
                      (approaching)
                  And for the record, I'm not the one
                  deceiving him.
                            (MORE)

                                                                   33.
                            SARAH (CONT'D)
                  He's going to figure it out
                  eventually. And when he does, who
                  do you think he's gonna blame?

       Sarah lets her warning land, then walks past Margaret,
       heading back down the stairs.

       REVEAL Gary watching through the hole in the door.

       INT. FOYER - DAY

       Gary heard the whole conversation.   Or at least enough of it
       to be deeply freaked out.


173                                                                      173

       INT.   UPSTAIRS WALKWAY - NIGHT

       Margaret leans out her doorway:

                            MARGARET
                  Goodnight, ratface.

                               GARY
                  Goodnight.

       INT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT

       Gary sits in one of the upholstered chairs, staring at his
       still-made bed. It's impossible to know what he's thinking,
       but the wheels are turning.


176                                                                      176
       EXT. SIDE PATIO - MORNING

       Gary opens the newspaper to a page at random.   He starts
       circling things with a red Sharpie.

       MACRO CLOSE UP.    His pen circles the number nine every time
       it appears.

       As he flips the page, he spots Sarah looking in through the
       rounded trellis, just a few feet away. She's holding her own
       newspaper, still in the wrapper.

                            SARAH
                  Hey neighbor.

                               GARY
                  Hi.

                                                        34.

                    SARAH
          Sorry for the psychotic episode.
          I'll blame it on hormones.

                    GARY
          Okay.

                    SARAH
          Are you alright? You look a little
          Beautiful Mind-ish.

He almost deflects it, but decides to trust her:

                    GARY
          How many times should the number
          nine come up? Probablistically?

                    SARAH
          Probablistically?

                    GARY
              (annoyed)
          You know what I mean.

                    SARAH
          One time out of ten.

                    GARY
          How about every time?

He hands her the paper through the bars.

                    GARY (CONT'D)
          But they only show up when you look
          for them. Looking for them changes
          things.

Trying to find an explanation...

                    SARAH
          Some of these are prices. There's
          going to be a lot of nines when...

                    GARY
          There is something wrong with the
          world.

Sarah looks up slowly. She smiles for an uncomfortably long
beat. She's stalling, thinking.

                    SARAH
          You have an eyelash on your...
          here...

She steps forward, and motions for him to lean closer to the
bars. Brushing off the non-existent eyelash, she WHISPERS:

                                                                 35.

                           SARAH (CONT'D)
                 I can get you out of here.    But you
                 have to trust me.

                            MARGARET [O.S.]
                 Morning.



      MARGARET

      enters, carrying her tea. She sees Gary by himself, leaning
      near the bars of the trellis.

                           MARGARET
                 Everything okay?

                            GARY
                 Peachy.

                           MARGARET
                 Peachy's good. I like peaches.

      WIDER,

      we see that Sarah is flush back against the wall, out of
      Margaret's line of sight.

                           MARGARET (CONT'D)
                 You want coffee?

                            GARY
                 Sure.

      She turns and heads back into the house.    Once she's out of
      earshot...

                           GARY (CONT'D)
                 What do I do?

                           SARAH
                 You have to trust me.


177                                                                    177
      INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY [A FEW MINUTES LATER]

      CLOSE ON a white plastic device mounted in the corner of the
      room, about ten feet up. It might be a smoke detector.

      Gary stares up at it, intently.    He steps forward.

      A little red light flicks on inside the unit. After a few
      seconds it turns off. It's some sort of motion detector.

      Gary tests it again, trying to move his arm slowly enough
      that the light never engages.

                                                         36.

Margaret enters, carrying two mugs.   She watches him warily.

                       MARGARET
          You okay?

                       GARY
          No.

                       MARGARET
          Oh.

                    GARY
          Tell me about the Nines.

                       MARGARET
          The Nines?

                       GARY
          The Nines.

                    MARGARET
          Sort of hard to start there...

                    GARY
          Try. And don't tell me I'm
          imagining it. They're showing up
          everywhere, and I want to know why.

Trying to formulate the simplest truthful explanation:

                    MARGARET
          Best guess? They're your
          subconscious trying to remind you
          who you are.

                    GARY
          I'm a Nine?

                    MARGARET
          Yes. It doesn't make a lot of
          sense of out context.
              (offering)
          Coffee?

He takes the mug, then reconsiders.   Maybe it's laced with
something.

                    GARY
          Why don't you drink coffee?   You're
          always drinking tea.

Frustrated, she takes his coffee back and drinks it. She'd
really like to drink the whole thing to prove her point, but
it's just too hot.

                                                              37.

                      MARGARET
          Happy?

She gestures for him to sit down.     Reluctantly, he does.    She
sits across from him.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          You're not going to understand this
          yet, but we've known each other for
          like 25 years. One day when I was
          12, you called me out of the blue.
          And we've been talking ever since.

                      GARY
          Talking.

                    MARGARET
          On the phone. Usually.

                    GARY
          I never met you before I came here.

                    MARGARET
          You, Gary, never met me. But
          you're not always...
              (lacking the words)
          I can understand why you're a
          little confused.

                     GARY
          No.   I'm a lot confused.

                      MARGARET
          Theories?

                    GARY
          This is all a dream.

                      MARGARET
          No.

                    GARY
          I'm in a coma.

                      MARGARET
                (amused)
          No.

                    GARY
          Then I'm dead. This is Hell, or
          Purgatorium or something.

                    MARGARET
          Okay, a purgatorium is where Romans
          vomited. But no. This is as real
          as anything can be.

                                                                38.

                           GARY
                     (suspicious)
                 What does that mean?

      She sits forward in her chair.    By instinct, he sits back.

                           MARGARET
                 Everything is what it is. But
                 you're not who you think you are.

178                                                                   178
      NEW ANGLE (TIME JUMP)

      Gary gets up, headed for the front door.

                            MARGARET (CONT'D)
                 God, no!   Please, Gary, don't.

      But he's already outside.


180                                                                   180
      EXT.   FRONT WALKWAY - DAY

      He's walking towards the blue chalk perimeter line, headed
      for Sarah's house.

      Leaves fall lazily from the trees, counter-point to the
      tension.

      Margaret calls out from the arched windows.

                           MARGARET
                 You don't know what you're doing.

      She's almost at tears.   He stops at the edge of the chalk
      line.

                           GARY
                 What happens if I cross this line?

      The tear in her eye falls.

                           MARGARET
                 I don't know. But it's not good.

      He very deliberately steps over the line. We hear a thin
      BEEPING from the house-arrest anklet. He shoots her a look
      to say, is that all there is?

      But the BEEPING grows louder, deeper. It starts to come from
      all sides, booming, a nuclear-meltdown/self-destruct-sequence-
      activated DRONE.

      Gary suddenly realizes something very, very terrible is about
      to happen.

                     GARY
          Oh shit.

The world ignites in white-hot atomic flames.

We see the blinding glare erupt behind Margaret, illuminating
through her skin, right to the bone.

The same flash catches a leaf in mid-air, sizzling through it
like an etched x-ray.

As the light hits Gary, we...

READER NOTE: Part 2 is a half-hour episode
of a Project Greenlight-style documentary
series called "Behind the Screen," which
tracks the progress of a one-hour TV drama
pilot from conception through delivery. In
keeping with the genre, it's very fast and
cutty.

INTERVIEW sequences are done to an off-
camera interviewer.

Some scenes are unscripted. The gist of
these scenes is summarized in italics.

      GAVIN TAYLOR (30) walks to a meeting, with his laptop bag
      over his shoulder. He has a tidy, Banana Republic
      sensibility and an easy smile that belies his manic schedule.

       Gavin unlocks the door, entering from the driveway. He's
       hauling a massive wheeled duffle bag. (Note: This is the
       same house from Part One.)

       We hear the CLATTER of toenails on hardwood floors.   Gavin
       kneels down to greet...

       Gavin is on the cordless phone, talking with a friend as he
       sorts through massive piles of mail.

       On his left wrist, we notice the same green string bracelet
       Gary wore in Part One.

                            GAVIN (ON PHONE)
                  It's weird being back. It doesn't

       INT.   FOYER - DAY

       Gavin sits at the piano, pecking out a haunting melody he's
       been fiddling with. He grabs a red diskette and a Sharpie.

                            GAVIN (V.O.)
                  At this stage, you have the script
                  you wrote, and the film you shot,
                  but you don't know how it's all
                  going to come together. You just
                  know how you want it to feel.

       He writes "Knowing" on the diskette, and pops it into the
       Disclavier unit.

                 Wow. I thought it was pretty
                 obvious. And dramatic.

                 More importantly, I trust her as a
                 barometer of Roger's taste.

      "Mary"

                           GAVIN
                 So we're trying to squeeze in a
                 wild line over this shot of Noelle.

      The monitor shows a three-second clip. It's Melissa and a
      eight year-old actress ("Noelle") in a car.

                                                        46.

Melissa's character looks alarmed by something the girl has
just done or said.

          What's the line?

          Howkajew. It sounds like kosher
          drug paraphernalia. Like, come on
          Shmuley! Have a toke on the
          Howkajew.

                     GAVIN
          I know. It's just for the test
          screening.

                    MELISSA
          They really think people won't get
          it?

                    GAVIN
          The dumb people might not.

                    MELISSA
          I didn't think we were making the
          show for dumb people.

      a forest road.

      Through a one-way mirror, Gavin and Susan watch as the
      Moderator asks a group of twelve MALE VIEWERS about the pilot
      they just watched.

      Their comments are mostly positive. Gavin and Susan share relieved looks. She has a
      notepad, as always.

      One AGITATED MAN keeps staring at the mirror, right at Gavin.
      (We recognize him as the Parole Officer from Part One.)

                             GAVIN
                   That guy's looking at me.

                             SUSAN
                   He can't see you.

      As a test, Gavin waves his arm. The Agitated Man's
      expression changes slightly, but it's not clear whether it's
      in reaction or not.

      The Moderator directs her next question to the Agitated Man.

                             AGITATED MAN
                   The show's not real. Why can't you
                   see that? Jesus! Are you fucking
                   blind?
                       (looking at the mirror)
                   You think you're above it all,
                   don't you? You are trapped here
                   with the rest of them, brother.

      He stands up, pushing past the other people to come right up
      to the one-way glass. He stares directly at Gavin, even
      though he shouldn't be able to see him.

      He SHOUTS:

      EXT. STREET - [LATER THAT] DAY

      Impromptu INTERVIEW with Gavin, standing beside his Prius.
      He's clearly still shaken by the experience.

                             GAVIN
                   The guy was crazy. Obviously. The
                   show is kinda twisted, and it just
                   flipped something in him.

      Gavin sounds like he's trying to convince himself.

                             GAVIN
                   Oblivio accebit. It's Latin.
                   "Oblivion approaches."

                             PRODUCER'S VOICE (O.C.)

                   Other than the world is coming to
                   an end? "Oblivio" also means
                   forgetting, forgetfulness.
                       (jump cut)
                   I think that's what I'm going to

      SAM, TOM, BRUCE, DANA, JON, KEVIN, JEFF, DAN, and CARL. (We
      don't show anyone's names.)

      They're playing Celebrity. We go several rounds, keeping the best of what's said.

      INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Between rounds of Celebrity, party-goers mingle. Gavin is
      making a new batch of cocktails -- he obviously has a knack
      for it.

      Susan pours herself another glass of chardonnay.

                              SUSAN
                    Did you have a chance to look at
                    the cards yet?

                              GAVIN
                    From the screening?

      Melissa reaches in, grabbing the vodka.

                                  MELISSA
                    Pardon me.      Daddy needs his drink.

      She makes a quick Cape Cod.            From the other room, Sam YELLS:

                              SAM (O.S.)
                    Woman, where's my cocktail!

                              MELISSA
                        (yelling back)
                    I'm a-comin!
                        (to Gavin)
                    I still love you most.

      She gives him a quick peck, then dashes off with Sam's drink.

                              SUSAN
                        (continuing her thought)
                    People write stuff on the cards
                    they won't say in a focus group.
                    They get more specific.

      He SHAKES the mixer.

                              SUSAN (CONT'D)

                             SUSAN (CONT'D)
                   Forget about anyone who scores you
                   in the Twos and Threes. They'll
                   never like your show.

      Gavin pours.

                             SUSAN (CONT'D)
                   Instead, look for the Nines.

                                GAVIN
                   The Nines.

                             SUSAN
                   They're the one who think your show
                   is almost the best thing they've
                   ever seen. They get your vision.
                   They just want it to be even
                   better.

      Melissa YELLS from the living room:

                             MELISSA
                   Round two is starting without you!

                             SUSAN
                   So you'll look at the cards?

                             GAVIN
                   Absolutely.

      Making his way back to the living room, he stops by the
      phone. Pulls out an orange Post-It and makes a note.

                Her overall scores were okay. But
                if you look at the people who
                scored the show highest, the one
                consistent dip was Melissa.

      INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

      Susan and Gavin are having lunch.

                          GAVIN
                She doesn't have a ton to do in the
                pilot. There's so much to set up,
                you don't get a lot of Melissa-
                time.

                          SUSAN
                True. That's one of the challenges
                with a premise pilot.

                          GAVIN
                But the network still likes the
                show?

                          SUSAN
                Of course. Roger is your biggest
                cheerleader.

                          GAVIN
                How about above Roger?

                          SUSAN
                Roger calls the shots.

                          GAVIN
                After he consults with the Higher
                Powers.

                          SUSAN
                True.

                          GAVIN
                Do they like the show?

                          SUSAN
                They haven't seen it. They're
                watching all the pilots on Friday.

      A beat.

                          GAVIN
                Why are you focusing on Melissa?

                                                            52.

                    SUSAN
          Because she's the biggest concern.

                    GAVIN
          She's also the biggest star in the
          show.

                    SUSAN
          No, you're the biggest star. Roger
          made a huge deal with you, and he
          went along with casting Melissa
          when that wasn't his instinct.

                    GAVIN
          Well, hooray for Roger. I don't
          understand what you want me to do.

                    SUSAN
          Meet with someone.

                     GAVIN
          Who?

                    SUSAN
          Dahlia Salem.

Gavin drops his fork so that it will CLATTER on his plate.

                    SUSAN (CONT'D)
          The network has a holding deal with
          her.

                   GAVIN
          Yes. And you put her in Gatin's
          pilot.

                    SUSAN
          It's dead. It's dying. But the
          network loves Dahlia. So if she
          could jump over to your show...

                    GAVIN
          Replace Melissa and reshoot the
          pilot.

                    SUSAN
          Roger would pay for it.

Gavin is nauseous.   He has to take a drink to be able to
speak.

                    GAVIN
          So is this even about Melissa?

                                                                                             53.

                               SUSAN
                     It's about getting your show on the

                     I see why the network loves her.
                     It's just, I wrote the part for
                     Melissa. She's one of my best
                     friends. And in my head, I only
                     see Melissa for the role.

                     Could Dahlia do it? Absolutely.
                     It could work. I just don't know
                     if I want it to work.

                          SUSAN
                He wants your show on the air,
                starring Dahlia. I just got off
                the phone with her agents. They
                love it. She loves you.

                          GAVIN
                What about Melissa?

                          SUSAN
                You want me to call her agents?

                            GAVIN
                God no.    I'll tell her.

      Gavin hangs up.   We stay on his side of the conversation.

      In the background, we see the door to the driveway swing open
      by itself.

                                                              55.

      A beat later, it SLAMS shut.

      Gavin is understandably startled.

      INTERCUT with on-camera INTERVIEW:

                           MELISSA (CONT'D)
                In-between the pilot and the
                series, I'm trying to squeeze in a
                one-woman show.
                    (edit)
                I've always been obsessed with
                nuns. They're sort of like God's
                fag-hags.

      Melissa spots Gavin entering and sings the rest of the song
      to him.

      EXT. WEST HOLLYWOOD BAR - NIGHT

      Gavin and Melissa have martinis.

                          GAVIN
                I think my house is haunted.

                          MELISSA
                Your house is really old.

                          GAVIN
                1926. Ever since I got back, I
                feel like there's someone else
                there. And then last night, I
                thought I heard something. A woman
                singing.

                           MELISSA
                Shit.   Like a ghost?

                                                          56.

                    GAVIN
          I guess. And then I saw something.
          I ran into someone.

                       MELISSA
          The woman?

                    GAVIN
          It was a man. I think it was me.

A beat while Melissa processes.

                    MELISSA
          Your house is haunted by yourself?

                       GAVIN
          Yeah.

                    MELISSA
          Gavin, are you alright?

                       GAVIN
          No.    No.

He takes a long beat, psyching himself up.    What spills out
is heartfelt but clearly rehearsed.

                    GAVIN (CONT'D)
          The network wants to replace you.

                       MELISSA
          Oh my God.

                    GAVIN
          And I'm letting them, because I
          really want the show on the air. I
          have all these characters inside my
          head, and they want to live. I'm
          the only way they can. This is the
          only way they can. I have five
          seasons mapped out, and though it
          sucks, either you go away, or the
          show goes. I had to make a
          decision, and that's the decision I
          made. I'm sorry.

By the end of it, we can hear the emotion in his voice.
Melissa takes a beat to process.

                    MELISSA
          So it's done. Finished.   Decided.

                       GAVIN
          Yes.

                                                        57.

                    MELISSA
          I understand. It's not your fault.
          You're morally incapable of doing
          the right thing.

Gavin doesn't rise to the challenge.

                    MELISSA (CONT'D)
          Don't get me wrong. I think you do
          feel bad for me. But that's all
          you feel for me. You still see me
          as the fat girl you call on Friday
          night when a date falls through.
          Let's go to a movie! Let's go to
          Fubar! And if you meet a hot piece
          of ass, don't worry about Melissa,
          you can apologize tomorrow. Or
          don't! Same difference. It's not
          like we're actually friends.

                    GAVIN
          I don't want to do this on camera.

                    MELISSA
          No, because you can't control it.
          Your little puppets are off their
          strings, running around. Saying
          things you didn't write. Reality
          terrifies you.

                     GAVIN
          Reality.

                     MELISSA
          Yes.

                    GAVIN
          The reality is, you would not be
          here without me. I gave you your
          first few roles. And your career
          is a result of that.

With exaggerated relief...

                    MELISSA
          God, thank you. Thank you for
          finally playing that card. I
          always knew you were holding onto
          it, the "I invented Melissa
          McCarthy card." Congratulations,
          you win. The game is over.

She gets up to go, then decides she has one more thing to
say:

                                                             58.

      She leaves him sitting at the table.

      elevator.

                   Look,   I'm sorry. But I'm kind of
                   not.    I want my show on the air.
                   And I   think it was shitty for you
                   to go   after Dahlia behind my back.

                             GAVIN
                   I heard your show was gone.

                   I "heard" you fired Melissa
                   McCarthy without having a backup.
                   Why would they pick up your show
                   when you don't have a star?

                             GAVIN
                   The network wanted Dahlia.

                             GATINS
                   Yeah, in my show. We tested right

                          GAVIN
                Susan Howard.

                          GATINS
                She would know. She was there.
                Ask her.

                                               CUT TO:

      INT. CONFERENCE HALLWAY - DAY

      Susan is on her cell phone. A cocktail party is in full
      swing nearby. We can hear the DIN and MUSIC, and see the
      occasional GUEST looking for the restrooms.

                            SUSAN
                      (on phone)
                I'm   at the UTA party. Yeah. Did
                you   hear about Ricky's assistant?
                She   literally shat herself. No, I
                saw   it.

      In the background, we see Gavin approaching. Susan spots him
      and seizes up a bit. She holds up a one-sec finger to him as
      she continues her conversation.

                          GAVIN
                I will break your fucking finger.

                          SUSAN
                    (to phone)
                I'll call you back.

      She hangs up. They look each other in the eye, daring each
      other to go first.

                          SUSAN (CONT'D)
                Roger wanted to talk to you
                personally.

                            GAVIN
                Bullshit.

                          SUSAN
                They're only picking up two dramas.

                          GAVIN
                The rest is, what, reality?

                          SUSAN
                You can go mid-season.

                                                        63.

                    GAVIN
          You can go to Hell.

                      SUSAN
          Wow.

She takes a beat, trying to size him up.

                     SUSAN (CONT'D)
          You think I deliberately sabotaged
          your show.

                    GAVIN
          Didn't you?

                    SUSAN
          G., I'm on your side. Trust me,
          I'm the only one who is trying to
          protect you.

            GAVIN                           SUSAN
Protect me from what?   You?    There is so much more going
You are psychotic.              on than you...

                    GAVIN
          All I want to know is why.

                    SUSAN
          You want a motive?

                      GAVIN
          Yes.

                    SUSAN
          This isn't "Crime Lab."   No one got
          murdered.

                    GAVIN
          My show did. So tell me why.

                    SUSAN
          I had to get you away from her.
          She was holding you back.

                      GAVIN
          Melissa.

                     SUSAN
          You had to give her up.
              (beat)
          C'mon, G. If she really mattered,
          you couldn't have betrayed her so
          easily.

                      GAVIN
          I didn't.

                                                                  64.

                          SUSAN
                What, you're the victim? The big
                Creator can't stand up to one
                little d-girl? It was your choice.
                I didn't make you do anything. I
                mean, do you have any principles?
                Do you believe in anything but your
                own ego?

                            GAVIN
                Fuck you.

                          SUSAN
                Your dialogue used to be sharper.
                Maybe Gatins could do a polish.

      He suddenly punches her, one hit to the face.   She drops
      hard.

      Gavin takes a step back.

      Tasting blood, Susan gets to her knees.   A wry smile.

                          SUSAN (CONT'D)
                Is that all there is?

      In the background, we see partygoers responding to the blow.
      Susan gets to her feet. She approaches Gavin, hands open.
      She's not going to hit him.

                          SUSAN (CONT'D)
                Do you feel like a man? Because
                I'll tell you a secret.

      She leans in very close to his ear.   There's a strange
      intimacy between them.

                          SUSAN (CONT'D)
                    (whisper)
                You're not.

      She walks away.   CLOSE ON Gavin.

      EXT. MANHATTAN SIDEWALK - DAY

      We move with Gavin as he walks. He's trying to get away from
      the camera, but it keeps following him.

      He reaches a crosswalk. He has to wait for the light.
      Finally, he looks INTO CAMERA:

                          GAVIN
                Look, I don't want to do this
                anymore. My show's not going to
                happen, so this show is over.
                          (MORE)

                                                          65.
                       GAVIN (CONT'D)
             Done. Gone. I`m not going to be
             your fucking puppet.

                       OFF-SCREEN VOICE
             Are you alright?

Gavin looks left, where an African-American woman is waiting
for the same crosswalk. (We recognize her as Octavia, the
streetwalker from Part One.)

                         GAVIN
             I'm fine.

                       OCTAVIA
             Who were you talking to?

Gavin looks back towards camera, a strange expression.

MUCH WIDER

We see Gavin and the woman on the corner. There's no camera
Gavin could have been talking to. He's understandably
perplexed: Where did the documentary crew go?

Was there ever anyone there?

Our CAMERA style has changed:    instead of handheld and jerky,
we're smooth and slow.

The MUSIC has completely changed, underscoring a sense of
creeping dread.

We HOLD for a long beat. The light changes. Still a little
unnerved, Octavia begins to cross the street.

Only then do we notice something unusual floating above her
head:

A SPHERE OF BLUE LIGHT.

WIDER, we see that everyone on the street has the same kind
of sphere floating a foot above their heads. No one seems to
see the lights other than Gavin.

Gavin looks around in uneasy fascination, as if he's just
landed on an alien world.

A beat, then he has an unsettling thought.

He slowly looks up. Above his own head, he sees the same
sphere of light -- only his is bright white. Pulsing.
Blinding.

                         GAVIN
             Oh God.

                                                                  66.

       We PULL BACK, RISING UP to a perspective above and behind
       Gavin. As we do, the edges of the frame creep in, revealing
       ICONS and unintelligible STATISTICS, changing moment by
       moment.

       A dialog box appears in the center of the screen, reading...

                                   Exit Now?
                         Unsaved changes will be lost.

                          [ Cancel ]          [ Exit ]

       An arrow slides back and forth between to the two options.
       Finally it lands on `Exit.'

       A CLICK.

       We're continuing an earlier scene from the end of Part One.

                            MARGARET
                  I can understand why you're a
                  little confused.

                             GARY
                  No.   I'm a lot confused.

                              MARGARET
                  Theories?

                            GARY
                  This is all a dream.

                              MARGARET
                  No.

                            GARY
                  I'm in a coma.

                              MARGARET
                        (amused)
                  No.

                            GARY
                  Then I'm dead. This is Hell, or
                  Purgatorium or something.

                                                         67.

                    MARGARET
          Okay, a purgatorium is where Romans
          vomited. But no. This is as real
          as anything can be.

                    GARY
              (suspicious)
          What does that mean?

She sits forward in her chair.   By instinct, he sits back.

                    MARGARET
          Everything is what it is. But
          you're not who you think you are.

                    GARY
          Okay, then. Who am I?

With practiced calm...

                    MARGARET
          You're a multi-dimensional being of
          vast, almost infinite power. You
          created this world on a whim, and
          decided to stick around to see how
          it turned out. You, this body
          you're in, is just one of your
          incarnations. Avatars. Call you
          what you will.

Not sure he follows...

                    GARY
          Are you saying I'm God?

                    MARGARET
          Technically, no. If God is a ten --
          a theoretical ultimate, that-which-
          no-greater-can-be-imagined --
          you're more of a nine.

                    GARY
          So what are you?

                    MARGARET
          Humans are sevens. Monkeys are
          sixes.

                    GARY
          What are the eights?

                    MARGARET
          Koalas. They're telepathic.    Plus,
          they control the weather.

She didn't mean to get on that tangent...

                                                          68.

                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
          What's important is that you,
          you're the big cheese. El Supremo.
          You could destroy the world with a
          single thought.
              (suddenly)
          Don't, incidentally. Just file
          that away. But the truth is, you
          hold all the cards: every church,
          every candle, every sacrifice --
          that's for you. When people pray,
          they're not praying because they
          want this thing or that thing.
          They just don't want to be
          forgotten.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          So you understand, I would have
          told you earlier, but I didn't...

                    GARY
          Yeah.

                    MARGARET
          Okay.

                    GARY
          I understand. But I don't believe
          you.

He gets up to exit. (This is where we jump-cut time earlier.)

      EXT. MEADOW - DAY

      In a WIDE SHOT, we see a vast field, bordered by green
      mountains. Unseen BIRDS call out from the trees, while
      insects CLICK and WHIRR.

      In the distance, we spot swatches of bright colors moving our
      way. It's a family: father GABRIEL (34), wife MARY (33) and
      daughter NOELLE (8). They're returning from a short day
      hike. Mary carries a small videocamera.

      Seeing that Noelle is already a ways down the path...

                            GABRIEL
                 Noelle!   Don't get too far ahead.

      Noelle turns around. Instead of speaking, she moves her
      hands in sign language. (She's mute, not deaf.)

                            MARY
                 No.   You had ice cream at lunch.

      Noelle begs to differ.   More signing.

                           GABRIEL
                     (to Mary)
                 Apparently frozen yogurt doesn't
                 count.

                           MARY
                 I'll make note.

      EXT. SMALL GRAVEL ROAD - DAY

      The family walks up to their car, a blue Toyota Prius.
      Gabriel sheds his daypack, trying to open the hatchback.    It
      won't lift.

      Mary goes to open the passenger door.      Locked.

                           MARY
                 Did you hit it?

                           GABRIEL
                 Shouldn't have to.

                                                             70.

He fishes the keys out of his pocket.     Presses the remote
entry button repeatedly.

Gabriel tries to open the driver's side door.      Locked.   Even
Noelle knows something's wrong.

Gabriel pulls the small mechanical key out of the fob.
Unlocks the door and climbs in. Opens the door for Mary and
Noelle.

                    GABRIEL (CONT'D)
          I think we left the overhead light
          on.

He taps it.   Moves the switch.

                     MARY
          Shit.

Noelle signs her made-up representation of "shit."

                     MARY (CONT'D)
          Noelle.

Gabriel slides the key into the slot.     Hits "START."
Nothing.

                    GABRIEL
          Battery is dead. Least the starter
          is.

Noelle leans forward, aware that this is something serious.

                    MARY
          How do we...?

                    GABRIEL
          We call the service.     That's all we
          can do.

                    MARY
          It's just the little battery that's
          dead, right? The big one is
          probably fine.

                     GABRIEL
          I guess.

                    MARY
          We can't jump it from one battery
          to the other? Cross-over somehow?

                    GABRIEL
          Who did you marry?      MacGyver?

                                                          71.

He gets out of the car, retrieving his cell phone. Mary
follows him out. Noticing that he's not dialing...

                    MARY
          Are you getting a signal?

                      GABRIEL
          No.    Do you?

She checks her phone.    A long beat.

                       MARY
          Yes!     One bar.

They're both relieved. Finding the AAA card in his wallet,
Gabriel takes the phone and dials.

It's at this moment we notice the familiar green string
bracelet around Gabriel's wrist.

In the back seat, Noelle KNOCKS on the window.   She signs,
asking if everything is okay.

                    MARY (CONT'D)
          We're okay. Daddy's calling people
          to help us.

Gabriel pulls the phone from his ear.   Looks at the screen.
Hits redial. Fuck.

                    GABRIEL
          The minute you try to place a call,
          the bar goes away.

                    MARY
          Keep trying.

                    GABRIEL
          Okay, I'll keep trying, Mary.   But
          it will keep happening.

                    MARY
          Well, what do you want to do?

                    GABRIEL
          I don't know.

He tries redial.

                    MARY
          Maybe if you hold it up higher.

Humoring her, he holds it at arm's length.   No good.

                                                                72.

                          GABRIEL
                The problem is we're boxed in.
                It's a canyon.

      A beat.

                          GABRIEL (CONT'D)
                Where we turned off the main road,
                it was more open. And higher, too.

                          MARY
                That's at least a mile.

                          GABRIEL
                I can run that.

                          MARY
                So...we stay here?

                          GABRIEL
                You okay with that?

                          MARY
                I don't think we have a choice, so,
                yeah. Go.

      Half a beat, while each waits for the other to think of a
      better plan. Neither does.

      Gabriel leans down next to Noelle's window.

                           GABRIEL
                Daddy's going to get a truck to
                help us out. You take care of your
                mom, okay?

      Noelle nods.

                          GABRIEL (CONT'D)
                I'll be right back.

      Gabriel gives Mary a quick peck and starts running down the
      road.

      We MOVE IN on Noelle, who smiles a little.

                                                 CUT TO:


303                                                                   303
      EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - DAY

      Gravel CRUNCHES under Gabriel's shoes as he runs.    He keeps
      an easy pace.

      In VARIOUS SHOTS, we get a sense of the distance he's
      travelling. He passes gulches, meadows and boulder fields.

                                                                 73.

      He finally arrives at the junction of the dirt road and a
      larger...


304                                                                     304
      EXT. PAVED ROAD - DAY [CONTINUOUS]

      Pulling out Mary's cell phone, Gabriel tries to get a signal.
      By his reaction, it's still iffy.

      He dials, but the call drops.    Tries again.   Just the same.

      He looks left.   Looks right.    Looks back down the dirt road.

      He decides to head off to the right, downhill.


305                                                                     305
      EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD - DAY

      We catch up to Gabriel as he's walking in the middle of the
      road, still trying unsuccessfully to get a signal.

      In the distance, he spots a patch of moving color: a female
      hiker. A moment's hesitation, then he YELLS out to her:

                             GABRIEL
                Excuse me!     Hi! Hello?

      She stops, turns.

      Gabriel jogs to close the distance. As we approach, we
      reveal SIERRA, 38. In the past 10 years, she's "made a fresh
      start" 12 times. In this incarnation, she's a wilderness-
      loving, Bush-hating, wildly-overeducated clerk at Trader
      Joe's in Venice.

                             GABRIEL (CONT'D)
                Excuse me.     Do you have a cell
                phone?

                          SIERRA
                No, I don't. There's no service up
                here.

                          GABRIEL
                    (re: his phone)
                Yeah, I'm finding that out.

                          SIERRA
                You can usually get a signal up at
                the ranger station.

                             GABRIEL
                Okay...

      She points in the opposite direction -- back the way he came.

                                                                74.

                     SIERRA
           You follow the road. It's
           probably... I don't know. You have
           a car?

                        GABRIEL
           It's dead.     That's why I need...

                        SIERRA
           Oh...

She pulls a stray hair back from her mouth.       Notices him
noticing her.

                        GABRIEL
           Yeah.

A beat.   She takes a subtle step closer to the center of the
road.

                     GABRIEL (CONT'D)
           Are you headed back to your car
           now? If you could give me a ride
           to a gas station, wherever...

She doesn't leap to extend an invitation.        It takes a beat
for Gabriel to figure out why.

                     GABRIEL (CONT'D)
           Oh. Hey. Look, I'm not some crazy
           Ted Bundy guy. I'm not going to
           rape you or kill you or anything.

She doesn't seem reassured.

                     GABRIEL (CONT'D)
           Of course, that's what Ted Bundy
           would say. Look, I'm a videogame
           designer.
               (fishing through wallet)
           My wife is an editor. My daughter
           is four.

He offers her a family photo.     She looks at it, but doesn't
take it.

                     GABRIEL (CONT'D)
           They're waiting back at the car,
           and I want to get some help before
           it gets dark.

                     SIERRA
           I can call somebody when I get to
           town.

Trying to temper his frustration...

                                                                75.

                          GABRIEL
                I believe you. I do. But you
                don't know where the car is. And
                the guy might not come. We can't
                be up here all night.

      Sierra backs away.

                             SIERRA
                I'm sorry.

                          GABRIEL
                Don't be sorry. Just help me out
                here.

                           SIERRA
                No.   I can't. I'm sorry.

      Once she feels she's reached a good distance, she turns and
      keeps walking.

                          GABRIEL
                Why won't you trust me?

      She doesn't turn back, heading down the road.

                                               TRANSITION TO:

      EXT. ROAD / INT. PRIUS - DAY

      Mary is sitting in the back seat of the Prius with Noelle,
      who's getting tired of her coloring book.

      Noelle signs something to Mary, who considers the request.

                          MARY
                Okay, but you have to be careful,
                understand? You have to use Big
                Girl hands.

      Noelle nods. Mary hands her the small video camera. Noelle
      has some trouble folding out the little screen, but
      eventually gets it open without any help from her mom.

                          MARY (CONT'D)
                Do you want to see where we were
                today?

      Noelle nods.

      Mary takes the camera back for a second, flipping it to
      playback mode and rewinding. The blocky video footage zips
      past.

                                                               76.

                          MARY (CONT'D)
                Okay, now hit play. This button.

      Noelle does. On the tiny screen, we see Noelle and her
      father eating lunch by a waterfall. (Mary is filming.)

                          MARY (CONT'D)
                There's you. And there's Daddy.
                You're a little movie star, huh?

      Noelle smiles.   Signs something.

                          MARY (CONT'D)
                He'll be back soon. Don't you
                worry.

                                                CUT TO:

      EXT. PAVED ROAD - DAY

      Gabriel continues walking, headed back in the direction he
      came. From behind him...

                           SIERRA (O.S.)
                Hey!

      He turns, finding her a ways back.   She approaches.

                          GABRIEL
                Were you following me?

                          SIERRA
                Once I was sure you weren't
                following me. I'm sorry, it's
                just...

                          GABRIEL
                You thought I was Ted Bundy.

                           SIERRA
                Kinda.

                          GABRIEL
                My name's Gabriel.   Bundy.

      She smiles.

                           SIERRA
                Sierra.

      They shake.

                          SIERRA (CONT'D)
                Weird that there's no cars.    At
                all.

                                                                   77.

                            GABRIEL
                 Yeah.

                           SIERRA
                 So, listen. I'm parked that way.

      She points off the road, through the forest.

                           SIERRA (CONT'D)
                 It's not that far. If you want,
                 I'll give you a ride to town.

                            GABRIEL
                 Really?

                            SIERRA
                 Yeah.   Make up some karma.

                           GABRIEL
                 Lead the way.

      She does. They cross off the pavement, descending into a
      dark forest.

                                                  TRANSITION TO:

      EXT.   FOREST - DAY

      Gabriel walks with Sierra. The trees here are taller,
      creating a cathedral-like ceiling above them.

                           SIERRA
                 Okay, confession.    I kind of
                 recognized you.

                            GABRIEL
                 Really?

                           SIERRA
                 I wasn't sure, but I think I saw a
                 picture of you in some videogame
                 magazine my boyfriend had. You're,
                 like, the shit.

                            GABRIEL
                 No.

                           SIERRA
                 You're like the Quentin Tarantino
                 of that world. A videogame God.

                           GABRIEL
                 Not really.

                                       78.

           SIERRA
Fine.

           GABRIEL
You seriously recognized me off of
one photo?

          SIERRA
I thought you were kinda hot.
Considering.

          GABRIEL
Considering..?

          SIERRA
Within the subset of videogame
people.

           GABRIEL
Okay.

          SIERRA
I wasn't masturbating to your
picture or anything.

          GABRIEL
Well, I guess I'm flattered.

          SIERRA
You should be. I'm stingy with
compliments.

          GABRIEL
So your boyfriend plays videogames?

          SIERRA
Ex-boyfriend. And yes. Way too
many. He used to play Evercrack
back in the day, but yours, well,
that was like...what's worse than
crack?

          GABRIEL
Super-crack?

           SIERRA
Sure.   He was this orc witch doctor
guy.

           GABRIEL
Shaman?

          SIERRA
Yeah. At one point he was spending
like, 40 hours a week gathering
"thunderleaf" or whatever.

                          SIERRA (CONT'D)
                Then I was his mule, hauling it
                around because he ran out of space.

                          GABRIEL
                You had an account?

                          SIERRA
                I was part of your world, and you
                didn't even know it.

                            GABRIEL
                Sorry.

                          SIERRA
                You can make it up to me.

      EXT. ROAD NEAR PRIUS - DAY

      Mary is pacing -- but trying not to look like she's pacing.
      She holds the other cell phone (Gabriel's), which she turns
      on and off, hoping that somehow she'll get a signal.

      Each time she turns it on, we hear the CHIMES.

      IN THE PRIUS

      Noelle is still playing with the video camera, watching
      footage of the hike. She decides to wind back further.

      CLOSE ON the blocky pixels rushing past.

      Noelle hits "play."   For now, we just hear the audio.

                          MAN'S VOICE
                ...I have five seasons mapped out,
                and though it sucks, either you go
                away, or the show goes. I had to
                make a decision, and that's the
                decision I made. I'm sorry.

      We reveal the screen. We're watching the argument between
      Gavin and Melissa from Part 2.

                          MELISSA (ON TAPE)
                So it's done. Finished. Decided.

                            GAVIN (ON TAPE)
                Yeah.

      Confused, Noelle looks out at her mother, Mary, who is still
      pacing with the cell phone.

                          MELISSA (ON TAPE)
                I understand.

                             GAVIN (ON TAPE)
                 You do?

                           MELISSA (ON TAPE)
                 I understand. It's not your fault.
                 You're morally incapable of doing
                 the right thing.

      Noelle REWINDS further.    Blocky pixels RUSH PAST as we...

      Sierra continues to lead the way. She seems confident where
      she's headed, even though there's no real path.

      During the conversation, we notice a small tattoo on her
      right shoulder blade: IX.

                           SIERRA
                 So you play a lot of characters at

                             GABRIEL
                 A couple.    Most people do.

                           SIERRA
                 You're not most people. You
                 created the world. You know all
                 the secret codes.

                           GABRIEL
                 What, like `God mode'?

                           SIERRA
                 That's what you call it?

                 That's when you have all the
                 powers, and you can't be killed.
                 It's fine when you're designing,
                 but it's really boring to play. A
                 game isn't fun unless there are
                 rules.

                           SIERRA
                 And you make the rules.

                           GABRIEL
                 Yes I do. I mean, you want to give
                 everyone freedom, but they can't
                 handle it. Half your players are
                 teenage boys, and it's like they're
                 programmed to be destructive.

                    Do you think I'm pretty?

                    What?

                              SIERRA
                    Do you think I'm hot?   On a purely
                    physical level.

                              GABRIEL
                    Sure.

       He drinks.

                              SIERRA
                    That's a rave.

                              GABRIEL
                    Well, I don't know why you're
                    asking.

                              SIERRA
                    My ex-boyfriend, the orc, he says,
                    "What I like about you is that
                    you're not so hot that I'm afraid
                    of losing you."

                              GABRIEL
                    So where's the orc now?

                              SIERRA
                    He's dead. I spiked his water
                    bottle with a massive quantity of
                    GHB. He hallucinated, went into
                    convulsions and died.

       He screws the cap back on the water bottle and hands it back.

                              GABRIEL
                    Remind me not to piss you off,
                    Sarah.

                                                                   82.

                Sierra.

      He's surprised.    He could have sworn her name was Sarah.

                            GABRIEL
                Sorry.

                          SIERRA
                And what makes you think you
                haven't pissed me off already?

      She smiles, keeps walking.

      Mary sits down in the front passenger seat of the car.
      Noelle is still in back, watching footage on the video
      camera.

                          MARY
                How are you doing, kiddo?

      Noelle doesn't look up.

                          MARY (CONT'D)
                I was thinking we could all go to
                El Cholo for dinner. How would you
                feel about some blue corn
                enchiladas? Should we ask Daddy
                when he gets back?

      Without looking up...

                          NOELLE
                He's not coming back.

      Mary is stunned. For her part, Noelle seems to have no idea
      she just spoke her first words.

      We hear three evenly-spaced BEEPS.    After the third one, Mary
      says:

                          MARY
                How could you...

      Mary flinches.    It's like someone walked over her grave.

      Noelle hands her the camera. The footage is cued to earlier
      in Part 2, where Gavin is having Melissa loop in a wild line:

                           MELISSA (ON TAPE)
                Howkajew. How could you. How

                 That's how I like ya.

      Mary backs out of the car, as if trying to get away from the
      video camera. But she's still holding it.

      She hits STOP.   Tries to collect herself.

      Noelle gets out of the car, but doesn't approach.      She signs,
      "Mommy?"

      Mary backs away.

      Gabriel and Sierra stop for a moment, so he can pull off his
      outer shirt. For the first time, we see that Gabriel has a
      large tattoo on his back which looks like this:

                                     IX
      He's sweating a lot.

                           GABRIEL
                 Am I crazy, or is it getting
                 hotter?

                           SIERRA
                 Oh, you're crazy.

      She hands him back the water bottle.   He gladly drinks.

      When she takes the bottle back, she steps forward. The
      motion leaves them face-to-face. She pauses for a moment,
      just long enough for him to turn away.

      He doesn't.

      She kisses him. He doesn't really kiss back -- but he
      doesn't fight it, either.

      She puts a hand on his thigh, sliding up the inside.     Only
      when she reaches his crotch does he pull back.

                           GABRIEL
                 I have a wife. And a daughter.
                 They're waiting for me.

                 I mean, which direction?

                           GABRIEL
                 They're back...

      Gabriel turns, trying to get his bearing.      The trees BLUR.
      He nearly falls over.

      He manages to steady himself.

                           SIERRA
                 Face it, G.: You don't know where
                 they are. You don't know where you
                 are. We've been walking in circles
                 for an hour.

                           GABRIEL
                 Where's your car?

                           SIERRA
                 There is no car. That was all a...
                     (what's the word)
                 "pretense," I guess. An excuse to
                 get you alone.

      Wobbling, Gabriel sits down on a stump.   Sierra kneels down
      in front of him.

                           SIERRA (CONT'D)
                 Dizzy, huh? It's probably just the
                 GHB. In the water.

      She holds up the water bottle.

                 That's right. Just let it go.       Let
                 it go.

      She's genuinely empathetic -- she doesn't enjoy his

                 checked in every once in a while.

                 We couldn't just storm in on a
                 fiery chariot. It's your universe.
                 We had to play by your rules. We
                 had to make you see how limited and
                 corrupt your little world was.
                 Don't get me wrong, this world is
                 nice. It's cozy. But do you
                 remember where you came from?

       A few beats while it comes back to him. Tears start to build
       in his eyes. What he's picturing is unspeakably beautiful.

                           G.
                 It was warm. And white.    Like...

       EXT.   GRAVEL ROAD / NEAR THE PRIUS - DAY

       Mary is sitting on the road. Noelle has her chin on her
       mother's shoulder, watching the videotape with her.

       ON SCREEN, with tinny audio: (from scene 177)

                             MARGARET
                  You could destroy the world with a
                  single thought.
                      (suddenly)
                  Don't, incidentally. Just file
                  that away. But the truth is, you
                  hold all the cards: every church,
                  every candle, every sacrifice --
                  that's for you. When people pray,
                  they're not praying because they
                  want this thing or that thing.
                  They just don't want to be
                  forgotten.

       Mary is still watching the tape. She realizes Noelle isn't
       watching over her shoulder anymore.

       Mary looks around.    Her daughter is nowhere to be seen.

                              MARY

       EXT.   FOREST CROSSROADS - DAY

       Gabriel and Sierra are back at the junction where the paved
       road meets the gravel road.

                            GABRIEL
                  Maybe if I just cut back, didn't
                  get so involved...

                            SIERRA
                  We both know that'll never work.
                  Next week, you'll be back here
                  redesigning the pinecones. You
                  have to quit cold-turkey.

                              GABRIEL
                  I can't.

                                                                  89.

                           SIERRA
                  You can. But I can't force you to
                  leave. You have to want it.

       She takes his hand, running a finger through the green string
       bracelet around his wrist.

       She kisses him.   And then she's gone.

       Gabriel stands there for a long beat, considering his
       decision.

                  Noelle!   Noelle!

       She's nowhere to be found.     Then, from behind her...

                            GABRIEL
                  She's here.

       Gabriel is walking up the gravel road, with Noelle holding
       his hand.

                            GABRIEL (CONT'D)
                  I didn't forget you guys.

       Mary regards him as a familiar stranger, a beloved imposter.

                            MARY
                  Everything okay?

                            GABRIEL
                  Absolutely. Let's go home.

       MUSIC BEGINS, a song that will carry us through the next
       sequence.

       Gabriel climbs into the driver's seat. Both Mary and Noelle
       watch with interest as he pushes the "START" button. The car
       BEEPS and engages without any problem.

       Everyone fastens their seatbelts.

      INT.   KITCHEN / EXT.   BACK YARD - DAWN

      Gabriel stands in the doorway, looking out at the inky-blue
      sky. His eyes are red, tired. He hasn't slept at all.

      It's very quiet, except for the occasional precocious BIRD
      CALL.

      Mary enters from the living room, still in her pajamas.   He
      knows she's there. Neither wants to speak.

                           MARY
                 You need to go, don't you?

                            GABRIEL
                 No.   I can stay.

                           MARY
                 How long? Forever? Every day,
                 you'd know what you were missing.

      He smiles, a little.

                           MARY (CONT'D)
                 What happens? If you go.

                           GABRIEL
                 Worst-case scenario? Spontaneous
                 disintegration into a fiery void.
                 Oblivio accebit. The end of
                 everything.

                           MARY
                 That's all?

      Both smile.

                           GABRIEL
                 That probably wouldn't happen. The
                 basic structure of the universe
                 should hold. I guess I'm just
                 worried about the human factor.
                 You guys kill each other a lot.

                                                 92.

                    MARY
          In fairness, that's usually in your
          name. Plus we've gotten much more
          efficient at it.

A beat.

                    GABRIEL
          I like this world. I like my life,
          here, with you and Noelle...

                    MARY
          But it's not real. I'm not really
          your wife, you're not really my
          husband. On some level, it's all
          pretend.

                    GABRIEL
          It's not pretend. There's a reason
          you were there, in every version.
          You were my sister, my wife, my
          best friend...

                    MARY
          That's a little creepy.

                    GABRIEL
          I wanted you close. In one
          version, I even told you. I warned
          you that some day they might come
          for me, and...

                    MARY
          ...You'd have to leave.   How many
          versions were there?

                     GABRIEL
          Ninety.   This is the last one.

                     MARY
          Wow.

                    GABRIEL
          I've destroyed billions of people
          with a thought. Obliterated them.
          And you'd like to think it's
          painless...

                    MARY
          Stop. You don't have to explain, or
          apologize. Everything that is, is
          because of you. If that's all,
          that's enough.

With that, there's really nothing more to say.

                                                           93.

                      MARY (CONT'D)
          So.

                      GABRIEL
          So.

                    MARY
          Guess you don't really need to pack
          anything.

                      GABRIEL
          I'm good.

                    MARY
          You're great. It's been a
          pleasure.

                      GABRIEL
          Likewise.    I love you.

                    MARY
          Love you, too. Ya big lug.

He kisses her. It's not a big, passionate, movie-ending
kiss, but rather a fond kiss farewell. At the end of it, he
WHISPERS into her ear:

                    GABRIEL
          You're my favorite.

She smiles.

With two fingers, Gabriel BREAKS the green string bracelet
around his left wrist.

And in that moment, a film passes over him, like the boundary
between water and air.

He's stepped out of this dimension.

Mary is frozen with the same smile on her face, but we notice
that she and the kitchen around her have flattened out to two-
dimensional images.

She and everything around her has become like wallpaper,
slowly curling away, revealing emptiness beneath.

Gabriel collapses into a single, spiky sphere of light.

The light moves through the kitchen, creating waves that
ripple through the tissue-thin walls.

Picking up speed, the sphere rushes through the window,
heading west.

                                                                  94.

      EXT.   LOS ANGELES - DAY

      As the light flies out over Hancock Park, the mansions and
      skyscrapers seem unreal, like models.

      Reaching Santa Monica, we pass over the ferris wheel at the
      end of the pier.

      We dive into the blue ocean beneath us, which becomes only a
      swirling gray fog with a viscous thickness.

      We see three lights in the distance.    We join them, moving
      with them.

      Further ahead, more lights, circling. It's a loose spiral
      made of stars, resembling nothing so much as the number 9.

      As we get closer and closer, we...

                                                  MATCH CUT TO:

      INT.     KITCHEN - MORNING

      Hands reach up, expecting to find glasses, but there are
      none.

      As we PULL OUT, we reveal it's not Mary, Melissa or Margaret,
      but a fourth person -- just slightly different from any of
      them. We'll call her M.

      She looks first to the spot where Gabriel was standing.

      Empty.

                             MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                   Honey, do we have nutmeg?

      M looks over at husband Ben, who is busy making pancakes,
      reading from a recipe.

                                M 
                   We should.

      Coming around from behind Ben, Noelle checks through the
      spice drawer. M watches her with cautious fascination.

                             BEN
                   Cinnamon, too.

                                                         95.

M catches her reflection in the toaster.   Notices she looks
different than she expected.

                    NOELLE
              (to Ben)
          If I had a horse...

Noelle turns back with the spices, handing them to Ben one at
a time.

                    NOELLE (CONT'D)
          I would name her Cinnamon.

                       BEN
          Really.

                    NOELLE
          And if I had another horse...

                       BEN
          Nutmeg?

                       NOELLE
          No, Flash.

                       M 
          Sweetie?

She beckons Noelle over. Tucks back the little girl's hair.
Keeping her voice low enough so Ben can't hear:

                    M  (CONT'D)
          This is going to sound really
          strange, but...what's my name?

Noelle only gives her a half-crazy look.

                    NOELLE
          Mmmmmmmmmm-Mommy.

Noelle smiles.   M smiles too, a little embarrassed.

                      M 
          Right.    Exactly.

Noelle looks her right in the eye.

                    NOELLE
          He's not coming back. But it's
          gonna be okay. He put the pieces
          together, it's like...

                    M 
          The best of all possible worlds.

Noelle taps her nose.

                                                          96.

                       BEN
            Honey? Is it supposed to stick
            like this?

Sharing a look...

                      M 
            We should help him.

Noelle agrees.   They head over to assist.

We MOVE ACROSS the family as they work on the pancakes,
Noelle directing how big the ears on hers should be.

We leave them in the middle of a messy kitchen, gooey
pancakes, and a good life.


FADE OUT.




                             THE END

                                                                97.


     ADDITIONAL MATERIAL

     The following scene (Scene 99) is the conversation between S
     and G that plays near the end of Part Three. The plan is to
     shoot this scene in almost every setup of the film that
     involves both characters -- be it in Part One, Two or Three.

     So we'll be shooting this scene a lot. We'll then be
     intercutting the best of all these moments to create one
     sequence.


99                                                                    99
     INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS

                         S.
               It's not that hard to make a
               universe. At first, you just
               checked in every once in a while.
               See how the Neanderthals were
               doing. Move some continents
               around. But then you got more into
               it. Starting playing a couple of
               characters of your own. Kings.
               Slaves. Messiahs. Pretty soon,
               you were playing 24/7.

                         G.
               How long have I..?

                         S.
               You've been gone for four thousand
               years. Not that time means the
               same for us, but...

                         G.
               You came looking for me.

                         S.
               That's what a girl does.

                           G.
               Why now?

                         S.
               We couldn't just storm in on a
               fiery chariot. It's your universe.
               We had to play by your rules. We
               had to make you see how limited and
               corrupt your little world was.
               Don't get me wrong, this world is
               nice. It's cozy. But do you
               remember where you came from?

     A few beats while it comes back to him. Tears start to build
     in his eyes. What he's picturing is unspeakably beautiful.

                                    98.

          G.
It was warm. And white.   Like...

           S.
You can't describe it with human
words. You can't think it with
human thoughts.
    (beat)
That's why you have to come back.
Come back with us. With me.
The Ninth Gate (1999) - Dean Corso... A Roman Polanski Film 
 Written by...Enrique Urbiz, Roman Polanski, and John Brownjohn 
 Telfer House, Library. Night. Andrew Telfer, a scrawny seventy-year-old, is writing a note at his desk in one corner of a big, book-lined room. Dangling from the central chandelier is a noose. A chair stands beneath it. Telfer looks up for a moment. Blankly, he eyes a framed photoportrait on his desk: a beautiful, thirty-something blonde returns his gaze with an enigmatic smile. He stops writing and folds the sheet, scrawls something on the back, and leaves it on the desk. Then he walks to the centre of the room and climbs on the chair. He puts his head through the noose and tightens it around his neck. He kicks away the back of the chair, but it doesn't fall. Frantically, he tries again: this time the chair topples over. The chandelier squeaks as it swings on its hook, but it holds. Fragments of plaster come raining down. His neck isn't broken: he starts to choke. His feet perform a convulsive dance in mid-air only six inches above the floor; one of his shoes comes off. The camera leaves the dying man and moves in on the bookshelves. To the accompaniment of choking sounds, it pans across the rows of volumes until it reaches a gap that shows where one of them has been removed. The choking sounds cease. The camera enters the black void left by the missing book. The screen goes dark. *** Manhattan apartment. Day. Manhattan skyline seen through a picture window. Above it, reflected in the windowpane, the face of an old woman seated with her back to the room. Her expression is impassive and self-absorbed, her twisted mouth suggests she's a stroke victim. She seems quite uninvolved in the action behind her. Corso: (Off screen) An impressive collection. You have some very rare editions here. Sure you want to sell them all? (Dean Corso, a tall, lean, rather unkempt man in his 30's. Steel-rimmed glasses, crumpled old tweed jacket, worn cords, scuffed brown oxfords. He replaces a book on a shelf. Standing beside him is the old woman's son, a middle-aged man with a puffy red face. Her daughter-in-law looks on, one hand cupping her elbow, the fingers of the other playing avidly with her lower lip. The son is cuddling a large Scotch on the rocks like it's an integral part of his anatomy. Son: They're no use to Father, not anymore -not now he's passed away. His library was his own little world. Now it's just a painful memory for Mother here. Daughter-in-law: Unbearably painful. Corso: (glances at them over the top of his glasses, then at the old woman. It's clear that the old woman's true source of pain is their desire to convert her late husband's library into hard cash. He picks up a notebook, adjusts his glasses with an instinctive, habitual movement, taps the notebook with his pencil) Corso: Well, at a rough, preliminary estimate, you have a collection here worth around two hundred thousand dollars. Daughter-in-Law: (almost jumps): Two hundred thousand?! Corso: Or thereabouts. He smiles sweetly at the Daughter-in-Law. The old woman continues to stare blankly at her reflection in the window. Behind her, the son sidles up to Corso, who indicates the volumes in question. Son: How much were you thinking of... Corso: Hmm... I couldn't go higher than four grand - four-and-a-half tops. (takes an envelope from his shoulder bag and starts peeling off some bills) *** Manhattan Apartment. Corridor. Day. Corso walks along the corridor toward the elevator with the canvas bag slung from his shoulder. He's grinning to himself. The bag is obviously heavier than it was. The elevator doors open just as he's about to press the button. He almost collides with a bespectacled, briefcase-carrying man in a three-piece suit and bow tie (Witkin). Witkin: (caustically): You here? You didn't waste much time. Corso: Hello, Witkin. There's a small fortune in there. (smiles sardonically) Help yourself. Witking: (eyes Corso's beg suspiciously): You're a vulture, Corso. Corso: Who isn't in our business? Witkin: You'd stoop to anything. Corso: (brushes past him into the elevator, turns and pats his shoulder bag) For a 'Quixote' by Ybarra? You bet I would. Witkin: (indignantly) Unscrupulous, thoroughly unscrupulous! Corso: (thumbs the elevator button): Good hunting! (The elevator doors close on Witkins face.) *** Bernies Book Store. Day. A sign says "CLOSED." Corso pushes open the door of an old fashioned semibasement bookstore - 'BERNIE'S RARE BOOKS'  and enters. He walks up to the counter and deposits his bag on it. Bernie: (Off Screen) Witkin just called me. He's spitting blood. Corso: (looks around. The voice came from ten feet up and three bookcases along. Bernie Feldman, a man around Corso's age with dark, curly hair receding at the temples, is perched at the top of a spiral staircase) What's his problem? Bernie: (replacing some books): He says you're a double-dealing, money grubbing bastard. He says he had that sale tied up, and now you've queered his pitch. Corso: (grins to himself): He should be quicker off the mark. (Bernie starts to descend. Corso goes over to a wall cupboard and opens it. An assortment of bottles and glasses come to light.) May I? Bernie:Your valuation was way over the odds it's brought those people out In a rash. They're now asking twice what the books are worth. (Corso, still grinning, pours himself a slug of Scotch. Bernie reaches the ground) He's talking about suing you. Well, let's face it: you screwed him. That's what it's called. Corso: I know what it's called. Bernie: (comes up close) He also says you snaffled the 'Don Qui ... (he stops when Corso shows him the four volumes of the Quixote'. He bends over to examine them, whistles appreciatively) The Ybarra 'Don Quixote', 1780, four volumes. Fantastic! (opens one) Sonofabitch, you're the best in the business. Definitely. Corso: And the most expensive. (smiles slyly) That client of yours, the Swiss, is he still interested in this edition? Bernie: (smiles back, then redirects his attention to the books) Sure, but Witkin will blow a fuse. I told him I had nothing to do with this operation. Corso: (knocks back his Scotch in one gulp. Takes out a crumpled cigarette from the pocket of his overcoat, he sticks it in his mouth and lights it) Nothing except your ten percent. Bernie: Twenty. The Swiss is my client, remember. Corso: (shakes his head): No deal. Bernie: Fifteen. (cynically) For my children's sake. Corso: You don't have any. Bernie: I'm still young. Give me time. Corso: (eblows out a stream of smoke, unmoved): Ten. *** A taxi pulls up outside an opulent building downtown. Corso gets out, dodges a persistent beggar, and enters. The sign above the entrance reads: 'BALKAN PUBLICATIONS'. Inside, he nods to the security guard at the desk and makes his way across the lobby to a door at the back. Beside it stands an easel-mounted announcement: 'Demons and Medieval Literature, by Boris Balkan, Ph.D.' It's adorned with a medieval engraving of an Inquisition torture scene. Enter Lecture Room. Boris Balkan, standing at a state-of-the-art lecturer's desk, is a bulky, imposing figure of a man around 50 years old. His thick gray hair is slicked back to reveal a domed forehead. Wearing a pair of heavy hornrimmed glasses, he speaks in a deep, slow, almost monotonous voice, but with great authority. Balkan: Relevant information may be found in Antoine Martin del Rio's 'Disquisitionum Magicarum', Louvain 1599, and earlier, in 1580, in 'De la d'monomanle des sorciers' by the Frenchman, Jean Bodin... His eyes flicker in the direction of the door as Corso enters. His entrance has also been noted by a girl in jeans and white sneakers: childlike face, short hair and green, feline eyes. He sits down in the same row, but on the other side of the aisle, settles himself in his chair and scans the audience, most of whom are middle-aged and female. He gives the girl a cursory glance, then concentrates on Balkan. Balkan: Bodin was probably the first to attempt to establish a system - if the term system may be applied to the Middle Ages - for classifying the contemporary perceptions of evil. In Bodin we find one of the first definitions of the word 'witch'. I quote: (cocks his head for a better look at the text) 'A witch is a person who, though cognizant of the laws of God, endeavors to act through the medium of a pact with the Devil...' As Balkan continues the lecture, Corso's eyelids begin to droop. We pan over the faces of the audience (the girl is still observing Corso). Balkan's voice drones on, fades away. Later...Corsos fast asleep. Balkan: (Off Screen) I see you enjoyed my little talk, Mr. Corso. Corso: (gives a start and opens his eyes. He takes a moment or two to focus on Balkan, who's standing over him. Peering around, he sees that the lecture is over. The last of the audience are filing out. We glimpse the girl making her exit.) Did I snore? Balkan: Nice of you to ask. No, not that I noticed. Shall we go? (He gestures at the door with a cold and impassive air. Corso gets to his feet. Balkan walks swiftly across the lobby to the elevators with Corso at his heels. They leave behind a buzz of conversation from members of the audience who are still discussing the lecture. ) Don't you sleep nights? Corso: Like a baby. Balkan: Strange, I'd have bet a brace of Gutenberg Bibles you spend half the night with your eyes peeled. You're one of those lean, hungry, restless types that put the wind up Julius Caesar - men who'd stab their friends in the back. (They reach the elevator. Balkan presses a button and turns to Corso, who yawns.) Not, I suspect, that you have many friends, do you, Mr. Corso? Your kind seldom does. Corso: (calmly): Go to hell. Balkan: (is unruffled by Corso's words. The elevator doors open. He stands aside to let Corso pass, then follows him in. He punches a code number on the elevator's digital keyboard. The elevator starts to ascend. )You're right, of course. Your friendships don't concern me in the least. Our relations have always been strictly commercial, isn't that so? There's no one more reliable than a man whose loyalty can be bought for hard cash. Corse: Hey, Balkan, I came here to do some business, not shoot the breeze. You want to expound your personal philosophy, write another book. Balkan: You don't like me, do you? Corso: (shrugs) I don't have to like you. You're a client, and you pay well. The elevator doors open into a spacious room faced with black marble. The walls are bare save for a big, back-lighted photograph of a ruined castle overlooking a desolate valley. Two huge windows in the right-hand wall extend from floor to ceiling. Visible outside on the building's floodlit facade, gargoyles gaze out over the city with their monstrous heads propped on their claws. The centre of the room is occupied by a rectangular block of tinted glass resembling a big black monolith. Vaguely discernible through the glass are shelves filled with antique books in exquisite bindings. Balkan leads Corso over to the 'monolith' . He gestures at it proudly, soliciting admiration. Balkan: Well? Corso: Yup. Balkan: You're privileged, Corso. Very few people have ever set foot in here. This is my private collection. Some bibliophiles specialize in Gothic novels, others in Books of Hours. All my own rare editions have the same protagonist: the Devil. Corso: (impressed but does his best not to show it) May I take a look? Balkan: That's why I brought you here. (Balkan goes over to the 'monolith' and punches a keyboard on a control panel, gestures to Corso to come closer. Corso puts out his hand. Before he can touch the glass, it glides aside with a faint hum. He fixes his glasses and glances at Balkan, who looks on calmly. His eyes roam along the spines of the books. Balkan comes and stands beside him.) Beautiful, aren't they? That soft sheen, that superb gilding... Not to mention the centuries of wisdom they contain - centuries of erudition, of delving into the secrets of the Universe and the hearts of men. I know people who would kill for a collection like this. (Corso shoots him a quick glance) The Ars Diavoli! You'll never see as many books on the subject anywhere else in the world. They're the rarest, the choicest editions in existence. It has taken me a lifetime to assemble them. Only the supreme masterpiece was missing. Come. He accompanies Corso on his tour of the collection. They come to the end of the monolith'. Gesturing to Corso to follow him, Balkan goes over to an ultramodern, brushed steel lectern standing beside one of the huge picture windows. As he approaches the lectern, Corso briefly glimpses the sheer drop beyond the window, the twinkling lights of traffic passing in the street far below. Reposing on the lectern is a black book adorned with a gold pentagram. Corso opens it at the title page, which displays the title in Latin and a pictorial engraving. Corso: (not looking at Balkan) 'The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows... Balkan: You're familiar with it? Corso: Sure. Venice, 1623. The author and printer was Aristide Torchia, burned by the Holy Inquisition, together with all his works. Only three copies survived. Balkan: One. Corso: The catalogs list three copies surviving in private ownership: the Fargas, the Kessler, and the Telfer. Balkan: True. You've done your homework, but you're wrong nonetheless. According to all the sources I myself have consulted, only one is authentic. The author confessed under torture that he'd hidden one copy. Only one. Corso: Well, three are known. Balkan: That's the trouble. Corso: (resumes his inspection of the book) Where did you get it? Balkan: I bought it from Telfer. Corso: (surprised) Telfer? Balkan: (looking out the window): Yes, he finally sold it to me. The day before he killed himself. Corso: Good timing. Balkan: (ignores this. Corso turns the pages with care. He lingers over an engraving of a knight in armor riding toward a castle with a finger to his lips as though enjoining the reader to silence. Below it is a caption. Balkan draws closer and reads over Corso's shoulder) Nemo pervenit qui non legitime certaverit. Corso: You only succeed if you fight by the rules? Balkan: More or less. Ever heard of the 'Delomelanicon'? Corso: Heard of it, yes. A myth, isn't it? Some horrific book reputed to have been written by Satan himself. Balkan: No myth. That book existed. Torchia actually acquired it. (he returns to the window overlooking the sheer drop. Gazing down, he goes on) The engravings you're now admiring were adapted by Torchia from the 'Delomelanicon'. They're a form of satanic riddle. Correctly interpreted with the aid of the original text and sufficient inside information, they're reputed to conjure up the Prince of Darkness in person. Corso: You don't say. (he continues to turn the pages) Balkan: Are you a religious man, Corso? I mean, do you believe in the supernatural? Corso: I believe in my percentage. I also believe that books grow old and decay like the rest of us. Don't you get dizzy, standing there? (Balkan continues to stare down at the city) What the hell do you want from me, Balkan? Balkan: (leaves the window and confronts him) I want you to go to Europe and play the detective. The other two copies are in Portugal and France. You must find some way of comparing them with mine: every page, every engraving, the binding - everything. I'm convinced that only one can be authentic, and I want to know which one it is. Corso: Could be an expensive trip. Balkan: (takes a folded check from his pocket and hands it to Corso, who slips it into his breast pocket unexamined) That's to get you started. Spend what you need. Corso: What if I find your copy's a forgery? Balkan: (stares at him coldly) It's quite on the cards. Corso: (seeming mildly surprised. He looks at the book again, 'listens' to the quality of the paper by putting his ear to the pages and riffling them with his thumb) Really? It doesn't appear to be. Even the paper sounds kosher. Balkan: Even so. There may be something wrong with it. Corso: (continues to examine the book. He smiles)You mean the Devil won't show up? (shuts the book and replaces it on the lectern) Balkan: Don't be flippant. (quotes) 'There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy.' Corso: Hamlet believed in ghosts, not demons. Balkan: If all three copies turn out to be bogus or incomplete, your work will be done. If one of them proves to be genuine, on the other hand, I'll finance you further. (Corso stares at him, then unfolds the check and glances at the amount - a substantial sum, from the way he raises his eyebrows) I shall want you to get it for me at all costs, never mind how. Corso: Never mind how sounds illegal. Balkan: It wouldn't be the first time you've done something illegal. Corso: Not that illegal. Balkan: Hence the size of the check. Do a good job, and I'll double it. (He picks up 'The Nine Gates' and holds it out. After a moment's hesitation, Corso replaces the check in his pocket and takes the book) Be careful, Corso. Corso: What do you mean? (indicates the book) With this? Balkan: Just be careful. *** Corsos Apartment. Night. A small kitchen. Corso, one hand wrapped around a Scotch, uses the other to remove a TV dinner from the freezer compartment of his refrigerator and insert it in a microwave. He shuts the door, sets the timer, and strolls out into the living room. A plain apartment. No pictures, ornaments or photographs, just books on every available shelf and surface. Against one wall, a desk with a computer on it. On the floor beside the desk, Corso's shabby canvas bag. On the desk itself, 'The Nine Gates'. Corso goes over to the desk. He stares down at the book for a long moment, meditatively sipping his Scotch. Then, without putting his glass down, he opens the book one-handed and idly turns a few pages, pauses at the engraving of the knight in armor riding toward the castle. The camera moves in slowly until the screen is filled with the image of the knight with his finger enigmatically raised to his lips. *** Telfer House. Library. Day. Corso, canvas bag on shoulder, is standing in the middle of a sitting room. The decor, which includes a smiling portrait of Andrew Telfer, is very rich. Hes looking up at the portrait when the door opens. He turns to see Liana Telfer on the threshold with a business card in her hand. His appreciation of her looks is evident. Liana is a very sexy, thirtyish blonde. She gives Corso the once-over, then enters, closing the door behind her. Corso: Mrs. Telfer? (gestures at the business card) Dean Corso. Sorry to trouble you at a time like this. (Liana comes over and sits down on a sofa, motioning Corso into the armchair that faces it over a coffee table. She puts his card down, crosses her legs, and waits. Corso sits down with his bag between his feet. Opening it, he produces 'The Nine Gates'. Liana stiffens at the sight of it. Corso: It would be very helpful, ma'am, if you could tell me what you know about this book. He holds it out. After a momentary pause, Liana slowly reaches for the book, opens it at random, turns a page or two. She speaks with a slight French accent. Liana: (casually) Isn't this one of my husband's books? Corso: Right. It was in his collection until very recently. He sold it to a client of mine. I'm trying to authenticate it. Liana: He sold it, you say? How strange. It was one of his most treasured possessions. Corso: He never mentioned the sale? Liana: (late in answering. Corso spots her hesitation) No. It's news to me. Who bought it? Corso: A private collector. Liana: May I know his name? Corso: I'm afraid that's confidential. Liana: I suppose he has a bill of sale? Corso: No problem there. Liana: Is this your job, authenticating rare books? Corso: And tracking them down. Liana: (smiles): You're a book detective. Corso: (smiles back): Kind of. (pause) Do you recall when and where your husband acquired this book? Liana: In Spain. We were vacationing at Toledo. Andrew got very excited -- paid a great deal of money for it. He was a fanatical collector. Corso: So I gather. Liana: (puts the book on the coffee table and rises) I'll show you. Corso rises. Then a thought strikes him: picking up the book and his bag, he follows her to a door at the far end of the room, which she opens. Liana: (cont.) Look. She walks on ahead into the library in which Andrew Telfer hanged himself. Corso is eyeing her from behind. Corso: Magnificent... (He drags his eyes away from Lianas figure and surveys the crowded shelves) Really magnificent... He goes over to inspect the bookshelves. In passing he glances up at the chandelier, which is still hanging slightly askew. Liana: Andrew used to spend many hours in here.Too many. Corso: Did he ever try it out? He asks the question with an air of spurious innocence, looking around the room as he does so. Liana frowns. Liana: I don't understand. Corso: The book - did he ever use it to perform some kind of ritual intended to... well. produce a supernatural effect? Liana: Are you serious? Corso: Absolutely. Liana: A Black Mass, you mean? Corso: More or less. An attempt to conjure up the Devil. Liana: Andrew was a trifle eccentric, Mr. Corso, but he wasn't insane. It's true he'd been acting strangely those last few days. He shut himself up in here - seldom emerged except for meals. (She draws a deep breath, glances at the chandelier) That morning I was woken by the screams of the maid: he'd hanged himself. (pauses, looks at him) Whatever he was up to, I certainly can't see him chanting mumbo-jumbo or trying to raise the dead. The flippant tone of the last few words sounds rather forced. Corso smiles at her faintly over his glasses, pats his shoulder bag. Corso: The Devil, Mrs. Telfer. This book is designed to raise the Devil. *** Corso exits the Telfer House and crosses the forecourt to the street. A man with a mustache and a scarred face is leaning against a limo parked outside the house, smoking a small cigar. They eye each other briefly. Corso reaches the sidewalk just as a cab sails past. He raises his hand too late to flag it down, looks around for another. The mustached mans cellphone beeps. He reaches into the limo and picks up the receiver. Reference Library, Day. Numerous readers are occupying the rows of tables in the central area. Corso is seated at one of the tables with the 'Nine Gates' in front of him. Beside it reposes a large catalog and his notebook. The 'Nine Gates' is open at the frontispiece, which displays the title - 'De Umbrarum Regni Novem Portis'- and the words 'Sic Luceat Lux' separated by an emblem consisting of a tree encircled by a snake devouring its own tail. As we move in on the coiled snake, we hear Corso translating to himself in a low voice: Corso: (Off Screen) Sic Luceat Lux ... Thus let the light shine... The day goes on. Many of the tables are now deserted and Corso shuts a catalog and gets up to replace It in the wall of books behind him. He runs his finger along a shelf till he comes to another fat tome and removes it. He's startled to see, framed in the gap where the book just was, the face of the girl at Balkan's lecture: short hair, green, feline eyes. The face recedes and disappears. Corso quickly rounds the end of the bookshelf: no sign of her. He looks both ways, but the aisles are deserted. Puzzled, he resumes his seat and opens the second catalog. Then, sensing that he's being watched, he swings around. Nothing outwardly suspicious, just two students comparing notes, whispering. He scans the reading-room at large: still nothing. He turns some pages in 'The Nine Gates', comes to an engraving of a naked woman riding a seven headed dragon with a castle ablaze in the background. He consults the second catalog, which displays a small reproduction of the same scene with text wrapped around it, and jots something down in his notebook. Tired, he straightens and stretches, removes his glasses, pinches the bridge of his nose. As he scans the room, his vision gives him an unfocused glimpse of the girl looking down at him from the gallery overhead. By the time he replaces his glasses, she's gone. *** Corsos Apartment. Night. It's raining hard. He trudges up the steps of his brownstone with the canvas bag on his shoulder and a bag of groceries in his arms. He rides the elevator up and walks down the passage to his door. He puts his key in the lock and tries to turn it but finds that its unlocked already. He tries the second lock and turns it. This is unlocked as well so the door opens at once. It takes him a moment to digest this but then he hears a muffled crash from inside the apartment: and a window has been flung open in a hurry. He bursts into the living room. No one there, but the light is on. Dropping his shoulder bag and groceries, he dashes into the bedroom. The window is open and the curtains are billowing out into the room. He darts to the window, flings one leg over the sill and climbs out on the fire escape. Feet can be heard clattering down the fire escape. He peers over the rail just in time to see a dark figure head into the side street beneath him and sprint off through the rain. Corso: (yells half-heartedly): Hey, you! He gives up and climbs back inside, and scans the living room. The only immediate sign of the intruder's presence is that the chair has been pulled away from the desk and one of the drawers is open. He pushes the chair back into place and shuts the drawer. *** Bernies book store. Next day. 'The Nine Gates' is lying open on Bernie's desk. He's reverently turning the pages with Corso at his elbow. Bernie: Son of a bitch... Where did you get this? Corso: Balkan. He wants me to research it. Bernie: Balkan owns a 'Nine Gates'? Corso: Recently acquired from the late lamented Andrew Telfer. Bernie: Trust Balkan. What does he need you for? I don't suppose he plans to sell it. Corso: He wants me to compare it with the other two surviving copies in Portugal and France. I'm off to Europe. Bernie: Compare it? Corso: Yeah. Only one of the three is authentic, he says. Bernie: Well, this one looks genuine enough. Must be worth a million. Jesus! Take good care of it. Corso: That's why I'm here. I need you to stash it for me. I'm starting to see things. Bernie: (stares at him) Like what? Corso: Uninvited visitors, unfamiliar faces. I don't trust anyone, not even Balkan. (reflects for a moment) Come to think of it, I don't even trust you. Bernie: (a mixture of affection and cynicism) That's mean, buddy. You know I'd never screw you without a damn good reason: money, women, business. Anything else, you can relax. Corso: (taps the book with his forefinger) You'll answer for this with your balls, Bernie. Bernie: (still engrossed): Sure, man, sure. You can castrate me personally. Corso: I'll pick it up on my way to the airport. Bernie: No problem. (He continues to pore over the book, turns another page, reads aloud) 'Virtue lies vanquished', huh? These engravings are terrific. Corso: (leans over his shoulder): Or horrific, whichever. Bernie: (nods absently. He smiles to himself with an air of enchantment) Beautiful, just beautiful... Visible through the bookstore's semi-basement windows, the legs of passerby accelerate as they scurry past: it has started to rain. A pair of mans legs in dark slacks come to a halt. The butt of a small cigar falls to the sidewalk, the legs walk on. Two white sneakers come into view. They step on the butt and extinguish it. *** Corsos apartment. Night. In the bedroom, Corso packs some articles of clothing and toiletries in a small suitcase lying open on the bed. The doorbell rings. Somewhat startled, Corso straightens up, dumps a handful of socks on the bed and goes out into the lobby. He peers through the spyhole: Liana Telfer is standing outside. He pauses for a moment, thinking hard, then opens the door. Liana: May I come in? Corso: (steps aside and lets her in) This way. (he shows her into the living room. She starts to unbutton her coat) Allow me. He helps her off with her coat and drapes it neatly over a chair. She's dressed to kill in a black, lowcut cocktail gown. Liana: Thank you. Corso: Sit down, won't you? Liana: (sits gracefully on the sofa, taking in the decor of his bachelor apartment as she does so) I've come to talk business. Corso: Great. Everyone's talking business to me lately. Liana: (takes a slim gold cigarette case from her purse, and lights it) Yesterday, when you came to see me about that book, I was too surprised to react as I should have done. I mean, it really was one of Andrew's favorites. Corso: So you said. Liana: I'd like to get it back. Corso: That could be a problem. Liana: Not necessarily. it all depends. Corso: On what? Liana: On you. Corso: (stares at her, absorbing the lines of her figure) I don't understand, Mrs. Telfer. The book isn't mine to dispose of. Liana: (She sits back, showing off her legs) You work for money, I take it? Corso: What else? Liana: I have a great deal of money. Corso: I'm happy for you. Liana: You could stage a theft. I'm sure your client is well insured. Corso: I'm a professional, ma'am. Liana: You're a professional mercenary. Mercenaries work for the highest bidder. Corso: I make a living. Liana: (huskily): I could throw in a bonus. Corso: This has happened before someplace. Liana: I know. In the movies. Corso: And she had an automatic in her stocking top. Corso watches, mesmerized, as she slowly, very slowly, slides her skirt up her thighs to reveal her stocking tops and black lace garter belt. Liana: No automatic. Just as slowly, she smooths her skirt down over her thighs. Corso swallows hard. He rises and goes to his drinks corner, a shelf with an array of bottles and glasses on it. Over his shoulder: Corso: Want one? Liana: Why not? Corso splashes some Scotch into two tumblers and carries them over to her. Liana sits motionless for an instant, looking up at him. Then, very slowly, she stubs out her cigarette, extends the same hand, and fondles his crotch. Corso, with the tumblers encumbering both his hands, can only stand there like a bird hypnotized by a snake. His Adam's apple bobs some more. Holding his gaze, Liana withdraws her hand and rises. They're only inches apart now. She takes one of the tumblers and clinks it against Corsos, then drains it. He does the same, while in a kind of trance. Very deliberately, Liana relieves him of his glass and puts it down on the table with hers. Then, cupping his face between her hands, she proceeds to kiss him. Corso responds. He pulls up her skirt, she reaches for his zipper and yanks at it. He bears her backward and downward onto the sofa. The gown slips down over Liana's left shoulder, revealing a small tattoo in the shape of a snake devouring its own tail. Later. Lianas hand reaches across the floor for Corso's canvas bag. She searches in the bag, then inverts it, spilling the contents: a couple of packs of Luckies, a notebook, an envelope full of bills, a Swiss Army knife, an expert's magnifying glass, some pencils, etc. Corso and Liana on the floor, their clothing dishevelled. Corso is lying back, still panting and sweating from his exertions, Liana is sitting up. Liana: Well, where is it? Corso: Where's what? Liana: Don't fuck with me, Corso. Corso: I thought that's what we were doing. Lianas eyes narrow. She goes for his face with her nails and teeth. Corso turns his head away just in time and scrambles to his feet, pulling up his trousers. Liana, beside herself with fury, flies at him with both hands extended like claws. He manages to grab her wrists and immobilize them, so she sinks her teeth in his chest. With an agonized yell, Corso releases her wrists, clasps his chest and staggers back, he's hobbled by the trousers that have slumped around his ankles. Liana looks around wildly for a weapon of some kind, catches sight of the Scotch bottle and seizes it by the neck. Corso, one hand holding his trousers at half mast, the other raised in supplication, comes shuffling toward her. Corso: Hey, look, be reasonable... Unmoved, Liana raises the bottle and smashes it over his head. Sometime later. Corso recovers consciousness, gingerly feels his aching head. Some blood has trickled down his face. He surveys the room, which is in chaos and has obviously been ransacked. He goes into the bathroom and inspects himself in the mirror, takes a hand towel and gingerly dabs his scalp. Holding the towel to his head, he returns to the living room, where he picks up the phone and punches out a number. We hear a recorded announcement: Bernie: (Voice Over): Hi, this is Bernie's Rare Books. I'm not available right now. If you want to leave a message, please speak after the beep. Corso: (into phone): Bernie, you there? Bernie? Pick up! No response. He hangs up. *** Bernies Book Store. Corso, bag on shoulder, is lurking in a doorway across the street from the bookstore. The place looks silent and deserted, but a dim glow indicates that a light must be on somewhere inside. Corso quits the doorway and hurries across the street. He walks down the steps to the door and tries the handle. The door opens. Only Bernie's desk light is on. No sign of Bernle himself. He listens intently, looks up at the top of the spiral staircase, which is in shadow, calls in a low voice: Corso: Bernie? No response. He listens some more: nothing but the sound of a passing car. He makes his way cautiously along the bookcases and rounds a corner, then stops short with a look of horror on his face. Bernie has been lashed upside down to the handrail of the spiral staircase. His mouth and eyes are open, and his battered face is streaked with blood. Corso: Jesus Christ! He puts out a hand toward Bernie, but the man is so obviously dead that he withdraws it. He looks around in an involuntary, apprehensive way. Then, satisfied that he's alone, he starts to climb the staircase. Once past Bernie's corpse, which he studiously avoids touching, he climbs faster. The staircase creaks and sways. Reaching the third tier of bookshelves, he presses a hidden button. With a faint click, a panel springs open to disclose a recess filled with books. Corso expels a deep breath. There it is, safe and sound: 'The Nine Gates'. He looks down at Bernie. Corso: Thanks, man. I'm sorry... *** Airport. Corso, ensconced in a window seat, is moodily gazing out at some passing cloud-castles. The sun is setting. Wearing his overcoat and carrying his suitcase, threads his way through them with the canvas bag on his shoulder. Weary and unshaven, he stares straight ahead with an abstracted expression, adjusts his glasses. His footsteps echo as he walks, bag on shoulder, along one of Toledo's narrow medieval streets. Very few people to be seen. The sun is shining brightly, but there's a strong wind blowing. Rounding a corner, he heads down an alleyway flanked by scaffolding swathed in protective netting and blue tarpaulins. It's completely deserted. No sound but that of canvas billowing in the wind like a ship's sails. He consults a street sign, turns another corner. He reaches a doorway leading to an inner courtyard, bumps into a boy who comes running out. We hear the strident cries of a woman. Boy: Si! Si, mama!!! A flight of steps in one corner of the courtyard leads down to the basement. Corso descends them and stops outside a door. A grimy window beside it serves to display some old books and religious prints. The sign on the door reads Hermanos Ceniza Restauracion de Libros. Below it: 'On parle Francais' and 'English spoken'. He opens the door, which creaks and enters. A gaunt, bent-backed old man (Pedro Ceniza) with a pair of glasses perched on the end of his big nose looks up from an old hand press. Everything about him is as gray as the cigarette ash that rains down on his clothes and the books he's working on. He's a chain-smoker. Pedro:Senor. Corso: Buenas tardes. Pedro: Buenes tardes. Pablo: (Off Screen) Buenas tardes. Corso turns to see another old man (Pablo Ceniza) surface from behind some stacks of paper. His resemblance to Pedro is such that they can only be twins. Pablo wipes his inky hand on a rag before shaking Corsos. Pedro follows suit. Corso hesitates briefly, as Pedro and Pablo look him up and down. Their movements are slow and serene, their expression carries a hint of mockery, and they often exchange knowing smiles. Corso: You speak English? (They nod simultaneously. He produces 'The Nine Gates' from his shoulder bag) I'd appreciate your opinion on this. Pedro takes the book with tremulous hands. Pablo quickly clears away some parchments on the workbench to make room for it. Some ash from Pedro's cigarette falls on the cover. Pablo clicks his tongue and blows it off. Pablo: (reprovingly) What a habit for a bookbinder! (smiles at Corso) 'The Nine Gates...' A superb edition. Very rare. Pedro: (opens it): The Telfer copy. Corso: You used to own it, right? Pedro: We used to, yes. Pablo: We sold it. Pedro: We sold it when the opportunity presented itself. It was too... Pablo: too good to miss. An excellent sale. Pedro: An excellent buy - impeccable condition. Pablo: Impeccable. You are the present owner? Corso: A client of mine. Pablo: (over his glasses): I would never have believed she would part with it. Corso: She? Pablo: (without looking up): Senora Telfer. Corso reaches into his overcoat pocket and extracts a crumpled cigarette. He's raising it to his lips when he stops short, produces the equally crumpled pack and offers it to Pedro, who has just discarded his butt. Pedro helps himself to a Lucky, breaks off the filter and jams it in his mouth. Corso lights both of them. Corso: I understood it was Mr. Telfer that bought it. Pablo: He paid for it. Pedro: It was the senora who made him buy it. He did not seem particularly... (glances at Pablo) Pablo: ...interested. Pedro: (finished examining the text. He looks at the spine) A superb specimen. Corso: (hesitates briefly): Could it be a forgery? Pedro: (suspiciously, almost indignantly) A forgery? (turns to Pablo) You heard that, Pablo? Pablo: (wags his finger reprovingly in Corso's face) I took you for a professional, senor. You speak too lightly of forgeries. Pedro: Far too lightly. Pablo: Forging a book is expensive. Paper of the period, the right inks.... (makes a dismissive gesture) Too expensive to be profitable. Pedro and Pablo assess the effect of their words on Corso, who digests them. Corso: I'm aware of all that, but could some part of it be forged? Restorers have been known to replace missing pages with pages taken from another copy of the same edition. Have you never done that yourselves? The old men look at each other, then turn to Corso simultaneously. Pedro, looking flattered, nods. Pedro: Of course it can be done. Pablo: It requires great skill, naturally, but yes, it can be done. Corso: Couldn't that be the case here? Pablo: What makes you ask? Corso: My client wishes to satisfy himself of the book's authenticity. (The brothers eye each other over their glasses. Corso adjusts his own) His name is Balkan. Boris Balkan of New York. Pablo and Pedro exchange another glance. Corso detects the hint of a smile that passes between them. Pedro: All books have a destiny of their own. Pablo: Even a life of their own. Senor Balkan is a noted bibliophile. He's no fool. He must know this book is authentic. Pedro: We know it. Pablo: So must he. Pedro: This book was with us for years. Pablo: Many years. Pedro: We had ample opportunity to examine it thoroughly. The printing and binding are superb examples of 17th century Venetian craftsmanship. (he picks up the book and riffles the pages under Corso's nose) Finest rag paper, resistant to the passage of time! None of your modern wood pulp! Pablo: Watermarks, identical shades, ink, type faces... If this is a forgery, or a copy with pages restored, it's the work of a master. Pedro: A master. Corso: (contemplates the brothers with a smile) Did you study the engravings? They seem to form a kind of riddle. Pedro and Pablo reopen the book and look at the engravings. Pablo: Well, yes... (another glance at Pedro) Books of this type often contain little puzzles. Pedro: Especially in the case of such an illustrious collaborator. Corso looks at Pedro with sudden interest, then at the book, then back at Pedro. Corso: Collaborator? Pedro: (shrugs, Pablo refocuses on Corso) You cannot have proceeded very far with your research. Come, look closely. He takes a magnifying glass and holds it over one of the engravings, which shows a hermit with two keys in his hand and dog and a lantern beside him. A microscopic inscription can be detected in the bottom right corner. Corso bends over it, looking mystified. Pedro grows impatient. Pedro: Don't you see? Only seven of the engravings were signed by Aristide Torchia. Corso: And the other two? Pedro: This is one of them. Look. Corso: (peers through the magnifying glass once more. We see the insert 'Invenit L.F.') 'L.F.'? Who's that? Pedro: Think. Corso: Lucifer? Pedro: (he and Pablo chuckle heartily) You're a clever man, senor. Torchia was not alone when they burned him alive. Corso: But that's absurd! You don't honestly believe... Pedro: The man who wrote this did so in alliance with the Devil and went to the stake for it. Even Hell has its heroes, senor. Corso looks from one to the other, trying to figure this out. *** Toledo Alleyway. Day. Corso walks back along the narrow alleyway with the canvas- covered scaffolding. He glances over his shoulder. Not a soul in sight. The blue canvas flaps in the wind, the scaffolding creaks and groans. He walks on. He hears a sudden rending sound, looks back and up. There's little time to react: the scaffolding has come away from its mountings. It's starting to buckle and fall out into the street. He breaks into a run. Behind him, collapsing like a house of cards, the mass of canvas and metal gains on him as he sprints for the end of the alley, summoning up all his energy for a final burst. The last of the scaffolding hits the ground only inches behind him. He looks back at the tangled mass that has only just failed to engulf him. *** Train. Dining car. Night. The dining car is deserted save for Corso and a Steward, who is lolling against the kitchen bulkhead at the far end. Corso, with a coffee cup and a brandy glass at his elbow, has 'The Nine Gates' lying open in front of him at the engraving of the hermit with the keys, dog and lantern. There's some cigarette ash trapped between the pages. Smiling faintly, he blows it away. Then he reaches into his bag for his magnifying glass, pushes up his steel-rimmed specs, and screws the glass into his eye. He examines the engraving at close range. We see again the insert of the inscription 'Invenit L.F.' He straightens up and removes the glass from his eye. He finishes his brandy and beckons the steward. Corso, with bag on shoulder, crosses the sliding floorplates that connect one car to another. He enters the next corridor and stops short: there's a lone figure leaning against a window, looking out: it's the girl we saw at Balkan's lecture: short dark hair, catlike green eyes, slim, athletic figure, jeans and white sneakers. Corso sets off along the corridor. When he reaches her, they eye each other's reflections in the windowpane. Girl: (softly): Hi. Corso: (pauses to look at her, unable to make up his mind) I've seen you before, haven't I? Girl: Have you? Corso: Yes, somewhere. A brief silence. Girl: Are you traveling in this car? Corso: The next one. Girl: The sleeper. (smiles) I travel on the cheap. Corso: Are you a student? Girl: Something like that. (looks out the window again) I like trains. Corso: Me too. What's your name? Girl: Guess. Corso: (shrugs, smiles): Greeneyes. Girl: That'll do. What's yours? Corso: Corso. Girl: Strange name. Corso: Italian. it means 'I run'. Girl: You don't look like a runner to me - more the quiet type. They look at each other's reflections once more. Corso nods. Corso: Well, have a good trip. Girl: And you. Corso walks on down the corridor. There's something weird about this chance encounter, but he can't figure out what. Girl: See you around, maybe. Corso: (pauses and looks back. He nods) Maybe. *** Sintra Station. Day. Corso with bag on shoulder, gets off the train. A horse-drawn carriage drops him off in front of a massive gateway flanked by stone walls thick with ivy. Corso pushes open the gate, and beyond them is a neglected drive. Dead leaves litter a gravel driveway flanked by crumbling statues, some of which have toppled over onto the long-neglected, weed-infested lawn. His muffled footsteps are the only sound. Near the house is a dried-up, dilapidated fountain faced with tiles and topped by a mouldering cherub. The waters of the ornamental pond beside it are dark and coated with dead leaves and water lilies. The Quinta Fargas is a gloomy, four-square, 18th century mansion. Corso walks up the steps and tugs the old-fashioned bellpull. He waits, glances at his watch. Echoing footsteps approach. A sound of bolts being withdrawn, and the door opens to reveal Victor Fargas. Tall and bone thin, he has a drooping white mustache. His baggy trousers and oversized woolen sweater contrast with a pair of old but immaculately polished shoes. Fargas: Yes? Corso: Dean Corso, Mr. Fargas. (Puts out his hand) How do you do. Fargas: (hesitates before shaking hands.) Corso, ah yes. Please come in. Fargas, who has a slight limp, leads the way through two reception rooms, entirely bare and empty. Corso observes the patches on the walls that indicate the former location of paintings, curtains, pieces of furniture, etc. Fargas: Home, sweet home! (he ushers Corso into a large but sparsely furnished drawing room. ) You won't say no to a brandy, I take it? He goes over to a side table and pours some cognac into two fine crystal glasses. Corso, meantime, is surveying the room. At the far end is a huge open fireplace. Two armchairs, a table, a sideboard, some candlesticks, a violin case - and books. They're neatly stacked on the floor and the few pieces of furniture. Corso has just discovered them when Fargas comes over with the glasses. He puts his bag down and takes one. Corso: Thanks. (admiringly) Handsome glasses. Fargas: These are the only ones I have left. Corso: (looks around the room) Must have been a beautiful place. Fargas: It was, but old families are like ancient civilizations: they wither and die. (he raises his glass in a silent toast. Corso does the same. Fargas gestures towards the books) There they are, eight hundred and thirty-four of them. A pity you didn't see them in better times, in their bookcases. I used to have five thousand. These are the survivors. Corso: (runs his fingers caressingly over a book) So this is the Fargas collection. Not quite as I imagined it. Fargas: C'est la vie, my friend. But I keep them in perfect condition, safe from damp, light, heat and rats. I dust and air them every day. it's all I do do, in fact. Corso: What happened to the rest? Fargas: Sacrificed in a good cause. I had to sell them to preserve the others. Five or six books a year. Almost all the proceeds go to the state in taxes. Corso: Why don't you sell up? Fargas: Sell the Fargas family estate? It's obvious you're an American, my friend. There are things you can't be expected to understand. Corso: (continues to survey the books, fascinated) If you sold all these your financial problems would be over... (picks up a book and examines it) Look at this, Poliphilo, for example: a real gem! Fargas: (Corso replaces the book. Fargas leans over and carefully adjusts the book until it's precisely in its original position) I know, but if I sold them all I'd have no reason to go on living. More brandy? (he heads for the bottle on the side table without waiting for a reply.) Corso: What about 'The Nine Gates'? Fargas: (puzzled): What about it? Corso: That's why I'm here.. I told you on the phone. Fargas: The phone? (pause) Yes, of course, I remember now. Forgive me. Of course, 'The Nine Gates'. (he looks around several times as if trying to collect his thoughts, drains his cognac, and limps over to some books on a rug near the fireplace. They both kneel on the rug side by side. Corso examines the books, which all deal with magic, alchemy and demonology) Well, what do you think? Corso: Not bad. Fargas: Not bad indeed. These I will never sell. At least ten of them are exceedingly rare. Look, Plancy's 'Dictionary of Hell', First Edition, 1842, Leonardo Fioravanti's 'Compendi di Secreti' of 1571... But this is what interests you, no? (he picks up a black book with a gold pentacle on the cover - the second copy of 'The Nine Gates' - and holds it out. Corso takes it carefully and gets to his feet. Fargas rises too) There it is, in perfect condition. It has traveled the world for three-and-a-half centuries, yet it might have been printed yesterday. Corso: (takes the book over to a window. Fargas follows) Is it in order? You haven't detected anything unusual? Fargas: Unusual? No. The text is complete, the engravings too. Nine plus the title page, just as the catalogs state - just like the Kessler in Paris and the Telfer in New York. Corso: It isn't the Telfer anymore. Telfer killed himself, but he sold his copy to Balkan first. Fargas: Balkan... If he sets his heart on a book, no price is too high. It's strange he should have sent you here, if he already... (breaks off as something has just occurred to him. He points to Corso's bag) You have it with you? May I see it? (Corso gets the book, and they go over to a table. Fargas places the two copies side by side, bends over them) Superb, beautiful, identical. Two of the only three that escaped the flames, reunited for the first time in over three centuries. (he turns the pages of each book, caressing the yellowing paper with his fingertips) Look at this imperfection. In the fourth line here - the damaged "S". The same type, the same impression. (turns both copies of 'The Nine Gates' over to reveal their backboards.) You see? If it weren't for this slight discoloration on the back of my copy, one couldn't tell them apart. Corso: If it's all right with you, I'd like to stay awhile and study them in detail. Fargas: (eyes him keenly): What are you looking for, Mr. Corso? Corso: I wish I knew. Fargas: (looks suddenly grave) Some books are dangerous. Not to be opened with impunity. Corso: Very true. *** Drawing Room. Evening. A fire burns on the hearth. Fargas is seated at a window, practicing the violin. He repeats the same short piece over and over again, occasionally pausing to take a sip of brandy. Corso is sitting at a table with both copies of 'The Nine Gates' open in front of him at the engraving of the knight with a finger to his lips. He compares the two copies with the aid of his magnifying glass. They look identical. He turns over several pages in each book until he comes to the hermit with the keys, dog and lanter. He compares the two copies. Again, no apparent difference. He proceeds to a third engraving: a wayfarer approaching a bridge with two gate towers and an angelic archer in the clouds overhead. Another seemingly identical pair. Then he stops short and returns to the second engraving. it looks the same, but then he spots it: in Balkan's copy the keys are in the Hermit's right hand, in Fargas' copy, theyre in his left. Fascinated by this discovery, he peers closely at each signature in turn. Balkan's reads 'AT', Fargas' ... 'LF'. Corso turns to an engraving of a jester outside a maze with two entrances. Comparison of the two copies reveals that in Fargas' copy one of the doorways is open; in Balkan's it's bricked up. The signatures, too, vary: 'AT' in one, 'LF' in the other. Corso: (excitedly, under his breath): Now we're getting somewhere An old-fashioned telephone bell starts ringing somewhere in the house. Corso looks up. Fargas doesn't hear the bell immediately. He plays on for a bar or two, then pauses and listens while the telephone continues to ring. He gets to his feet. He puts the violin down and limps out. Corso's open notebook now displays a chart consisting of two horizontal rows of nine boxes. One row is marked 'BALKAN', the other 'FARGAS'. He is busy filling in the boxes with either 'AT' or 'LF'. Fargas reappears. He gives Corso a friendly nod, returns to the window and launches into the same old piece on his violin. Corso has now filled in all the boxes. He studies them for a moment, then circles all the 'LF's in red ink. Outside. Corso exits and shuts the gate. His breath is visible as steam in the chilly night air. After a last backward look at the statue-bordered driveway and the neglected garden, he turns up his overcoat collar, settles his bag on his shoulder, and sets off down the road toward the lights of Sintra, which are visible in the distance. His footsteps re-echo from the wall that bounds the Fargas property. He hasn't gone far when two headlights snap on behind him. Simultaneously, the car starts up and takes off with a squeal of tires. Corso spins around. He stands there transfixed for a moment, then dodges behind a projecting buttress as the car hurtles past, missing him by a hair. The car, a big dark sedan, skids to a halt some twenty yards away. The driver' s door opens and a tall man gets out. He momentarily hesitates when he sees Corso still on his feet. Just then we hear a motor vehicle - a noisy one - rounding the next bend. The tall man is captured by a beam of light. Corso has seen him before: it's the mustache. The man dives back into the car and takes off fast. Corso, trembling with shock, watches the tail lights recede and disappear. The sound of the approaching vehicle increases in volume. Corso turns to stare at it. Wobbling unsteadily along the road comes a lone peasant astride a ramshackle motorbike with a blown exhaust. The peasant honks as he goes by. Corso retrieves his bag from the roadside. *** Corso enters a small hotel, collects his key from the reception desk and sets off in the direction of the elevator. Visible in the background is the hotel lounge. Two elderly female tourists, are quietly conversing at one table while an overweight German couple sip cocktails. Corso, idly scanning the lounge as he makes for the elevator, stops short: a pair of legs in jeans and white sneakers are jutting from an inglenook fireplace in the far corner. He goes over to investigate. The girl is snuggled up in an armchair with a book on her lap. He hesitates for a moment. She looks up. Corso: Hi. You didn't say you were bound for Sintra. Girl: Neither did you. Corso: What are you doing here? Girl: Reading. Corso: I can see that. Girl: And bumping into people unexpectedly. Corso: Unexpectedly is right. Girl: Are you on a business trip? (indicates his shoulder bag) Is that why you always carry that thing around? Corso: (doesn't answer, adjusts his glasses. He looks at the book she has. She hands it to him. We see the title: 'The Devil in Love' by Jacques Cazotte) You like Gothic novels? Girl: I like books. I never travel without one. Corso: Been traveling long? Girl: Ages. Corso: (eyes her, intrigued) You said you were a student? Girl: Did I? (shrugs) So I am. In a way. Hotel Porter: (appears at Corsos elbow) Excuse me, senor. Phone call. Corso: (surprised): For me? Are you sure? Hotel Porter: Si, senor. (he leaves.) Corso: (turns back to the girl) Well, sorry I disturbed you. (hands back the book and turns to go. Corso goes to the hotel phone and picks up the receiver with a puzzled frown) Yes? Balkan: (Voice Over) Mr. Corso? Corso: (startled): Balkan? How did you find me? Balkan: Made any progress? Corso: Progress? You could call it that. Balkan: Well? Corso: I've examined the Fargas copy. It's authentic. At least it looks that way. Like yours. But there are discrepancies. Balkan: Discrepancies? Corso: In the engravings. Like keys in different hands, doorways open in one copy and bricked up in the other. Balkan: I see. Corso: And there's another thing. Balkan: Yes? Corso: The ones that differ are ail signed 'LF'. Seems like some kind of riddle. ( A long pause) Are you still there? Where are you, anyway? Balkan: I think you'd better get it for me. Corso: The old man wouldn't sell it to save his life - he said as much. (Another long pause) Balkan? A click, and the line goes dead. *** Corsos hotel room. Corsos lying fast asleep on his back in bed, one limp arm trailing over the edge. A knock at the door. He grunts and props himself on one elbow. Corso: (sleepily): Just a minute. (He rolls out of bed and wraps the bedspread around his waist. Then he opens the door and stands there, a tousled figure with Liana's teeth marks clearly visible on his chest. The girl stands outside his door. Girl: You left your phone off the hook. Corso: Jesus... (peers blearily at his watch): What time is it? Girl: Early, but you have to go. Corso: (bewildered): Go where, for God's sake? Girl: The Fargas place. Corso: Fargas? I already saw Fargas. Girl: I think you should see him again. Corso: What is this, a practical joke? Who the hell are you? What do you know about Fargas? Girl: Better get dressed. I'll wait for you downstairs. *** Fargas Driveway. Corso and the girl walk in silence up the driveway. He eyes her, mystified, as she strides briskly alongside him. Corso goes up to the front door and yanks at the bellpull. Girl: Don't bother. He isn't there. Corso: (sarcastically): Really. So where is he? Girl: Over there. She points in the direction of the ornamental pond. Corso stares at her, then walks over to it and freezes: Victor Fargas corpse is floating face up among the dead leaves and lily pads. An empty brandy bottle is floating alongside. Corso: (mutters): God Almighty! Girl: (Ignoring her, Corso tries the door handle, but it's bolted) You want to get inside? Corso nods, too shocked to trade words with her. She looks up at the facade. Then, with surprising agility, she shimmies up a drainpipe beside the door and climbs onto the balcony above it. One of the French windows is broken. She reaches inside, releases the catch, and disappears from view. Corso waits, casting occasional glances at the ornamental pond and its occupant. There's the rattle of a bolt being withdrawn, and the girl opens the front door from the inside. Corso: Wait here. (he enters the house and reaches the drawing room. His foot crunches on something as he crosses it on his way to the rug on which the occult books were stacked: it's the remains of one of Fargas' treasured brandy glasses. He pauses long enough to identify it, then walks on. The books are lying scattered across the rug: no sign of 'The Nine Gates') Shit! Shit, SHIT!!! He looks around helplessly. Then he sees it: the last of the fire is still smoldering on the hearth, and lying open among the ashes, charred around the edges, is Fargas' 'Nine Gates'. He picks up,the mutilated volume, looks at it for a moment, shaking his head, and stows it in his canvas bag and emerges from the house. Girl: Well, did you find it? Corso: You know too damned much. More than I do. Why do you keep following me around? What are you, a groupie or something? IRS, CIA, Interpol? Who are you working for? Girl: You're wasting time, asking all these questions. We'd better get out of here. There's a flight from Lisbon to Paris at noon. We should just make it. Corso: What's with the 'we'? Girl: There are two of us, aren't there? *** Airliner cabin. The girl is drowsing with her head on Corso's shoulder. He looks down at her. Corso: Somebody's playing a game with me. Girl: (drowsily): Of course. You're a part of it. Corso: What exactly happened back there? Girl: Fargas caught someone stealing, I guess. Corso: And what do you guess happened to him? Girl: He drowned. Corso: With a little help from who? Girl: (shrugs): He's dead. Who cares? Corso: I care. I could wind up the same way. Girl: Not with me around to take care of you. Corso: I see. You're my guardian angel. Girl: Something like that. She removes her head from his shoulder, turns away, and snuggles up against the window instead. *** Paris Airport. Corso makes his way across the bustling arrivals hall. The girl, is trailing along in his wake. He glances back at her occasionally. Corso takes out his US passport in readiness to show it. He looks around for the girl, but there's no sign of her. A taxi drops him off in front of a modest but respectable three-star hotel. He hands some money through the driver's window and heads for the entrance. He walks up to the reception desk, which is presided over by a desk clerk (Gruber). Corso: Hello, Gruber. Gruber: (looks up, acknowledges Corsos presence with a curt nod of the head) Welcome, Mr. Corso. Delighted to see you again. (consults his computer screen) We don't have any vacancies, but I'm sure I'll be able to organize something. Corso: Thank you, Gruber. (discreetly, he slides a 100 franc bill across the desk. Gruber makes it vanish and smiles) Gruber: Thank you, sir. Upstairs in his room, a bottle of Scotch and a glass on a small desk, along with Balkan's 'Nine Gates' and Fargas's charred copy. A cigarette is smoldering in the ashtray beside them. Corso is turning the pages of what remains of Fargas' copy. He pauses at a page of text bearing a distinctive ornamental capital, peers at the gutter, and detects that the page facing it has been torn out. He runs his finger along the rough edge. Then he opens Balkan's copy at the same place. What is missing from the charred copy is the engraving of the hermit with the keys, dog and lantern. He takes a swig of his Scotch and leans back with the cigarette between his lips, thinking hard. Then he glances at his watch and stands up. Corso, canvas bag on shoulder as usual, strides across the bridge toward the Left Bank. He walks up to the entrance of a tall, well-preserved old building overlooking the Seine. A grim-faced concierge is sits in her cubby-hole. She eyes him inquiringly. Concierge: Monsieur? Corso: The Kessler Foundation. She jerks her head in the direction of an old-fashioned elevator like a gilded cage. Kessler Foundation. The secretary looks up at Corso with an inquiringly. Corso: Dean Corso. I have an appointment with Baroness Kessler. Secretary: (consults her appointment book and her watch and rises) This way. (She walks ahead of him down a paneled corridor and stops outside a heavy wooden door.) You have thirty minutes. She knocks on the door and opens it to reveal a spacious room filled with luxuriant potted plants. Beside the window, a large desk is covered with papers and books, some of them open. Corso follows the secretary in. Baroness Kessler, an elegant little white-haired old lady with a scarf draped around her shoulders, turns her electric wheelchair to face him. She speaks with a pronounced German accent. Baroness Kessler: Mr. Corso? Come in. I've heard a great deal about you. (She approaches with her left hand extended. We see that her right arm has been amputated at the elbow.) Corso: Nothing good, I hope. (They shake hands) Baroness: (to the secretary) Merci, Simone. (to Corso) You hope right. The secretary exits, closing the door behind her. Corso: (dryly.) I'm reassured, Baroness. In my trade, to be spoken well of can be professionally disastrous. (He surveys the room. Visible through some open double doors on the right is a vast library. He focuses on it. The Baroness follows the direction of his gaze.) Baroness: Yes, there it is: the Kessler Collection. Corso: Very impressive too. I know your catalog almost by heart. Baroness: Strange we haven't met before. Your name is a byword among dealers and collectors but I imagine you know your own reputation better than I do. Corso: It keeps the wolf from the door. (smiles to change the subject) Were you in the middle of something? Baroness: (beckons him over to the desk. He looks at the array of books and papers) My latest work: 'The Devil: History and Myth' - a kind of biography. It will be published early next year. Corso: Why the Devil? Baroness: (laughs) I saw him one day. I was fifteen years old, and I saw him as plain as I see you now: cutaway, top hat, cane. Very elegant, very handsome. It was love at first sight. Corso: (chuckles, doing his best to charm the old lady) Three hundred years ago they'd have burned you at the stake for saying that. Baroness: Three hundred years ago I wouldn't have said it. (They both laugh) Nor would I have made a million by writing about it. (abruptly businesslike) What is it you wish to discuss, Mr. Corso? Corso: (adjusts his glasses) There's a book in your collection I'd like to examine. (she smiles as if that were already obvious) It's 'The Book of the Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows'. Baroness: (unsurprised): The Nine Gates? An interesting work. Everyone's been asking about it lately. Corso: (stiffens almost imperceptibly): Really? Baroness: (eyes him for a moment) Come with me. (Swinging her wheelchair around, she steers it toward the double doors and into the library beyond them. Corso follows) You really believe in the Devil, Baroness? Baroness: Enough to devote my life and my library to him, not to mention many years of work. Don't you? Corso: Everyone's been asking me that lately. Baroness: (looks mildly amused. She sends her wheelchair gliding over to a bookshelf and removes the third copy of 'The Nine Gates') This book demands a certain amount of faith. Corso: My faith is in short supply. They both go over to a small table in the centre of the room. The Baroness opens the book and turns a few pages. There are handwritten slips of paper inserted throughout.) Baroness: I know this book extremely well. I studied it for years. Corso: Do you have any doubts about its authenticity? Baroness: (glances at him suspiciously) None whatever. Corso: You're sure? Baroness: My knowledge of this book is profound. I wrote a biography of its author. Corso: Aristide Torchia? Baroness: A courageous man. He died for the sake of this very book in 1623. He had spent many years in Prague, a centre of the occult. While there he studied the black arts and acquired a copy of the dread 'Delomelanicon'. This is his adaptation of that work, which was written by Lucifer himself. After they burned him at the stake, a secret society was founded to perpetuate its memory and preserve its secrets: the Brotherhood. Corso: The Brotherhood? Baroness: Yes, a kind of witches' coven. For centuries they have met to read from this book and worship the Prince of Darkness. Today they've degenerated into a social club for bored millionaires. I myself belonged to the Brotherhood many years ago, but time is too precious at my age. I told them to go to the Devil. She laughs at her own little joke. Corso: They still meet? Baroness: Every year. Corso: And you say they read from this book? Baroness: No, I took mine back when Liana Telfer acquired the one in Toledo. Victor Fargas is an unbeliever - he has always refused to participate, so naturally they use the Telfer copy. Not that it has ever worked. (pause) They never do, to be honest. Corso: So Andrew Telfer never took part? Baroness: Never. He knew nothing of these activities until that creature Liana de Saint-Damien married him for money. She used his dollars to buy the book and renovate her chateau. An old and aristocratic family, the Saint-Damiens, but penniless. They have dabbled in witchcraft for hundreds of years. Corso: Telfer hanged himself last week. Baroness: (A brief silence. She looks stunned for a moment) I see. And Fargas? Corso: He was alive the last time we spoke. Baroness: When was that? Corso: Two days ago. Baroness: (digests this, looks at him keenly) Who exactly are you working for, Mr. Corso? Corso: My client's name is irrelevant, Baroness. I'm simply trying to authenticate his copy - the one Telfer sold him before he died. Baroness: (catches on): How stupid of me! I should have guessed! (Angry now, she swings her wheelchair around to face him full on) You've outstayed your welcome, Mr. Corso. Corso: I was hoping to examine your copy in detail. Baroness: Certainly not. Tell your client, who can only be Boris Balkan, to come and examine it himself - if he dares. Tell him not to send any more wolves in sheeps' clothing. And now, kindly leave. (she points to the door with her stump. Her wheelchair hums as she shepherds him out through the office. He opens the door to the corridor) You don't know what you're getting yourself into, Mr. Corso. Get out before it's too late. Corso: I'm afraid it already is, Baroness. Baroness: Some books are dangerous, and this is one. Corso: (smiles wryly): So people keep telling me. Thanks for your time. The Baroness watches him exit. He's hardly out the door when she picks up the phone. *** Corso walks back along the corridor. The secretary gives him a curt nod as he passes. He emerges from the building. As he does, he catches sight of the mustache man leaning against the parapet of the riverside promenade across the way. The man stiffens and straightens up. Corso, with one eye on him, starts walking. The man starts walking too, keeps level with him on the other side of the street. Corso comes to a cafe. For want of a better idea, he goes inside, sits down at a table, orders a drink. Looking out the cafe window, he sees the man leaning against the parapet in his former pose, watching. The man lights a small cigar without taking his eyes off Corso. Corso is still sitting at his table, which now has several checks on it. The lights come on, blotting out his view of the street through the window. All he can now see is a reflection of the cafe's interior, including his own seated figure. He drums his fingers on the table, glances at his watch, and deliberates. He adds up his check and puts some money on the table. Then, settling his bag on his shoulder, he makes for the door. He peers across the street, sees no sign of the man, and exits. Still no sign of the man. He sets off along the sidewalk, glancing across the street as he does so. Then, over his shoulder, he catches sight of a car with dipped headlights - a dark-colored sedan - crawling along the curb some twenty yards behind him. On impulse, he darts across the street to the riverside promenade and dashes down the flight of steps that leads to the quay. The car's headlights blaze up. It accelerates, tires squealing, and swerves across the one-way street in pursuit. Corso races down the steps, hears the car skid to a halt, and sprints off along the quay. A couple of hundred yards along the quay he runs out of steam and slows, turns to look: no sign of the man, no sound of pursuing footsteps. Relieved but still wary, he leans against the embankment wall to catch his breath and light a cigarette. Then, with a final backward look, he walks on to the next flight of steps. He's halfway up them when the man, a tall, menacing figure, appears at the top. He turns to flee, but the man is too quick for him. He darts down the steps and Corso misses the last couple of steps and lands face down on the quayside. The man is on him in a flash. He bends down and yanks the strap of the bag off his shoulder. Corso resists, hugs the bag protectively, gets kicked in the stomach, doubles up and hangs on for dear life. As he lies there with the man kicking him repeatedly and tugging at the strap, he sees, silhouetted against the yellowish, misty glow of the nearest streetlight, a ghostly figure flying down the steps: It's the girl, with her duffel coat streaming out behind her like Superman's cape. The man has finally gotten the bag away from Corso. Just as he straightens up and turns to go, the girl performs a flying leap and kicks him. He grunts and goes sprawling on his back, dropping the bag. The girl is stooping to retrieve the bag when the man scrambles to his feet and lunges at her. He throws a punch at her head. Although she blocks most of its force he catches her a glancing blow on the nose. She reacts like lightning, kicks him in the groin. He yelps and goes into a crouch. Then, with a spin kick, she floors him once more. He lies there, spitting blood and glaring up at her. She seems to have knocked the fight out of him at last. With one wary eye on the man, the girl picks up the shoulder bag and turns to Corso who's struggling to his feet. Beyond her, he sees the man get up and make for the steps. Corso: Hey, he's getting away! The girl merely turns to look. Corso sets off after the man, who has already started up the steps, and just manages to grab one of his legs. The man kicks himself free and continues up the steps with Corso clumsily following a few feet behind. Waiting at the top of the steps, engine idling and passenger door open, is the dark sedan, a Mercedes. Corso reaches street level in time to catch a glimpse of the glamorous blonde behind the wheel: it's Liana Telfer. The man jumps in and slams the door. The car burns rubber as it accelerates away. The girl calmly climbs the last few steps with Corso, bag in one hand and his glasses in the other. She hands them to him. Girl: They're broken. You should be more careful. Corso , leaning back against the promenade wall and breathing heavily, stares at her with his mouth open. He slides down the wall and subsides into a sitting position on the sidewalk. One lens of his glasses cracked, is still sitting on the sidewalk with his back against the wall. The girl is sitting beside him. He produces a crumpled cigarette and lights it. It takes him quite a while, his hands are shaking so badly. The girl's nose is bleeding. She wipes it on her sleeve. Corso produces a handkerchief as crumpled as his cigarette and hands it to her. Corso: When did you learn all that? Girl: What? Corso: (aims a feeble kick in the air) That stuff. Girl: (casually): Oh, ages ago. Corso: No shit. She gets up and holds out her hand. He takes it and rises with an effort. He flicks his cigarette over the parapet. They walk off along the promenade side by side and head for the hotel. Corso goes up to the reception desk, where Gruber is on duty. Corso: I need a favor, Gruber. Gruber: (looks up, registers his broken glasses and disheveled condition and the girl is standing in the background) Certainly, Mr. Corso. Corso: Liana Telfer, maiden name Saint-Damien. Thirtyish, blond, dishy. Probably accompanied by a big man with a Clark Gable mustache. (Gruber make some notes on a pad) I want to know if they're staying at some hotel here in Paris. Gruber: It could take a little time. Corso: Of course. Start with the five-stars. They're the best bet. Gruber: Very good, sir. (pause) Are you feeling all right? Corso: I've felt better. Thanks, Gruber. Let me know if you locate them. Gruber watches Corso and the girl walk to the elevators. In his bedroom, Corso is filling a plastic laundry bag with ice from a tray in the minibar. The girl is sitting on the bed with her head tilted back and a bloodstained handkerchief to her nose. Corso: Here, hold this against your neck and lie back. (sits down beside her and hands her the ice pack. She applies it to the nape of her neck, lies back and shuts her eyes) You were great down there by the river. I haven't really thanked you. (She opens her eyes and smiles at him) Like to tell me what's going on? Girl: (shrugs faintly): Someone's after your book. Corso: They didn't have to kill Fargas to get it. They didn't have to mutilate his copy, either. They tore out the engravings and ditched the rest. There's got to be more to it than that. Girl: (her nose has stopped bleeding) Do you believe in the Devil, Corso? Corso: I'm being paid to. Do you? Girl: (smiles): I'm a bit of a devil myself... She reaches up, removes his glasses, and puts them on the bedside table. Corso eyes her uncertainly. Her nose starts to bleed again. She puts her fingertips to it and inspects the blood on them. Very deliberately, she dabbles them in the blood some more, reaches up, and gently draws four vertical lines down his face from his forehead to his mouth, where her fingertips linger. Corso's face approaches hers. They melt into a passionate kiss, then she pushes him away, rolls him over on his back, unbuttons his shirt, and rests her palms on his chest. Playfully, she runs her forefinger over the imprint of Liana's teeth. Girl: (smiles mischievously): Would you know a devil if you saw one? *** Hotel lobby. Day. Corso, tieless and unshaven, descends the stairs to the lobby carrying his beg. The junior desk clerk, a spotty youth, is dozing on a chair behind the reception desk. Corso goes over and raps on the desk. The junior desk clerk springs to his feet like. Corso jerks his chin at the door behind him. Corso: Do you have a photocopier back there? Clerk: Er, yes, monsieur. Corso: May I use it? Clerk: Are you a guest, monsieur? Corso: You mean I don't look like one? Clerk: Of course, monsieur. This way, monsieur. (He lifts a flap and shows Corso into the back office) Corso: Room 35. And get them to send up breakfast for two. Corso deposits his bag beside the photocopier and takes out Balkan's 'Nine Gates'. He opens it at the first engraving  the knight with a finger to his lips - and inverts it. Positioning it on the photocopier, he shuts the flap and presses the start button. The photocopy glides out into the tray. He goes back to his room, quietly closing the door behind him. The girl is lying sprawled among the rumpled sheets, fast asleep. Her clothes are draped over a chair with her backpack alongside. Stealthily, Corso takes Balkan's 'Nine Gates' from his bag and places it behind the minibar, then goes into the bathroom. Corso, with his hair damp from the shower and a towel around his waist, is halfway through shaving when there's a knock on the bathroom door. One cheek daubed with foam, he opens it to find himself confronted by a floor waiter, check pad and ballpoint in hand. Waiter: Bonjour, monsieur. Votre petit djeuner. Corso: Oh. Sure. Taking the pad, he emerges into the bedroom and scribbles his signature, then stops short: there's a breakfast cart in the middle of the room, but the bed is empty and the girl's clothes and backpack have disappeared. Corso: Where is she? Waiter: Pardon? Corso: Madame, ou elle est? Waiter: Je ne sais pas, m'sieur. He makes for the door and exits. Corso catches hold of the door just as it's closing, puts his head out into the corridor, looks right and left. No one in sight but the floor waiter, who casts a puzzled glance over his shoulder as he walks off. He steps back into the bedroom and shuts the door. He stands there for a moment, frowning at the empty bed. Then, abruptly, he dashes over to the minibar and looks behind it. His fears are groundless: 'The Nine Gates' is still there. Just then the phone rings. He picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear on the clean-shaven side of his face. Corso: Yes? Balkan: (Voice Over) Come down. I'm in the cafe across the street. *** Corso, wearing his crumpled overcoat and carrying his bag, emerges from the hotel and crosses the street to the cafe opposite. He enters and looks around, catches sight of Balkan's sleek gray head at a table in the corner. He goes over to him. Corso: You sure as hell get around. (he sits down with the shoulder bag between his feet. A waiter appears at his elbow) Un caf noir, s'il vous plait. The waiter nods and withdraws. Balkan studies Corso's face through his glasses, notes the glasses with the cracked lens. Balkan: Problems? Corso: Yeah, like someone tried to total me a couple times. Aside from that, three people have died on me since I took this job. (thinks for a moment) Well, two. Telfer was dead already. Balkan: I don't follow you. Corso: It's simple enough. You give me 'The Nine Gates' and they start dropping like flies. I'm thinking of giving it back. Balkan: Who are you talking about? Corso: My pal Bernie Feldman, for one. Balkan: The book dealer? He's dead? Corso: Murdered. He was holding your book for me. Someone was after it. He wouldn't give it to them. A moment of silence. Then Balkan emits a chuckle. The chuckle becomes a guffaw, the guffaw gives way to peal after peal of uproarious laughter. He slaps his thighs and rocks back and forth, his face turns puce, his eyes fill with tears. His hilarity is so deafening that the cafe's other customers turn to stare. Corso, too, stares at Balkan as if he's gone crazy. Balkan's mirth gradually subsides. He removes his glasses and mops his eyes. Eventually, still chuckling. Balkan: Poor fellow. Very creditable of him. Corso: (refrains from commenting on this outburst) Then there's Fargas. The waiter brings Corso's coffee. Balkan waits for him to put it on the table and leave. Balkan: What about Fargas? Corso: Dead too. Balkan: How do you know? Corso: I saw him - and his copy, or what was left of it. Someone had snatched the engravings and tried to burn the rest. Balkan: (stares at him for a moment) How tragic. What about the Kessler copy? Corso: The old woman says it's authentic, but I didn't get a chance to look at it closely. As soon as she guessed you were behind my visit she threw me out. You aren't her flavor of the month. Balkan: You must see her again. You must get me that copy  or examine it, at least. Corso: (derisively): Are you kidding? I'd have to be the Invisible Man. Balkan: (reaches into his black briefcase and produces a big manila envelope) Try this. Corso takes the envelope and looks at it. It's addressed to 'Baroness Friede Kessler'. *** Kessler Building Lobby. Day. Corso, canvas bag on shoulder as usual, hands the envelope to the secretary, who takes it and walks off down the corridor. A black and white photo fills the screen: it shows a young and beautiful Baroness Kessler flanked by two men in SS uniform. One of them is Heinrich Himmler. Baroness Kessler is scowling down at a wartime number of 'Signal', the Nazi propaganda magazine. It's lying open on her desk with Balkan's envelope beside it. The secretary shows Corso in. The baroness addresses her crisply. Baroness: Merci, Simone. The secretary nods and exits. Fixing Corso with a cold, challenging stare, Baroness Kessler feeds the magazine into a shredder beside her desk. She no longer looks such a dear little old lady. In the Kessler library, Corso is seated at a table on which reposes the Kessler copy of 'The Nine Gates'. Beside it lies his notebook and the photocopies of Balkan's engravings. His shoulder bag is hanging on the chairback, his overcoat draped over it. He reaches into his pocket and produces a cigarette, takes out his lighter. Baroness: Blackmail doesn't entitle you to smoke in my library, Mr. Corso. Corso stops short and looks back through the double doors into her office: she's seated behind her desk like a graven image, watching him intently. He reinserts the cigarette in its pack and pockets his lighter. Getting down to work, he opens 'The Nine Gates' and extracts one of the Baroness's handwritten slips, reads it to himself in a low voice. Corso: 'I will recognize your servants, my brethren, by the sign that adorns some part of their body, a scar or mark of your making...' He replaces the slip. The Baroness cranes her body largely obscures her view of the table. Corso turns some pages and comes to the engraving of the knight with a finger to his lips. He compares it with the photocopy: the castle has three towers instead of four. He examines the margin of the engraving through his magnifying glass to ascertain the presence of something he already knows will be there: an 'LF'. He turns to the chart in his notebook, which has already acquired a third row of nine boxes. He writes 'Kessler' beside it and enters an LF in the first box. The second engraving  the hermit with the keys - appears to be identical and the signature is 'AT'. An 'AT' goes down in the second box. The third engraving is different: the angelic archer has an arrow in his quiver, whereas the photocopy of Balkan' s counterpart does not. This one, too, is signed 'LF'. Corso enters an 'LF' in the third box. Camera moves in until the chart fills the screen. A long shot of Corso from behind. He leans back and stretches, glances in the direction of the office: Baroness Kessler is no longer at her desk. Absolute silence reigns. He resumes work, turns to the ninth engraving: the naked woman riding the dragon with a castle ablaze in the background. There's a loud thud, and the engraving sways and blurs. The screen goes black. Fade back in. An electrical hum, punctuated by a strange, rhythmical series of clicks and thuds: click-thud, click-thud, click-thud. Corso, sitting slumped over the table, comes to. He groans and laboriously straightens up, feels his head and winces. The strange sound impinges on his consciousness: he looks around vaguely for its source and discovers it: Baroness Kessler's wheelchair has been left in forward gear. Complete with occupant, it's colliding again and again with the wall beneath a window on the other side of the room. Corso, who can just glimpse the top of the old lady's head from behind, sees it jerk forward at each impact. He struggles to his feet. Corso: Baroness? No answer. Unsteadily, he makes his way over to the wheelchair and swivels it around, starts back with a muffled exclamation. Baroness Kessler has been strangled with her Hermes scarf: her cheeks are blue, her eyes and tongue are protruding. Unobstructed, the laden wheelchair takes off across the library and heads for the double doors, which are now closed. It runs into them full tilt, bursts them open, and continues on its way. Instantly, smoke comes billowing into the library, accompanied by a crackle of flames. The wheelchair disappears into the murk. Corso wildly scans the table for Baroness Kessler's 'Nine Gates', but it's gone. Snatching up his notebook and abandoning his shoulder bag and overcoat, he makes for the office at a run. The office is thick with smoke and illumined by a fiery glow. Corso pauses in the doorway, shielding his face from the heat with one hand, and surveys the scene. The Baroness and her wheelchair have come to rest in the midst of a bonfire of books and papers. Corso can just make out her copy of 'The Nine Gates' on top. The flames are already engulfing it. Corso takes a last look, then dashes through the smoke to the door and exits. With smoke billowing after him, Corso dashes along the corridor, through the lobby, which is deserted, and out onto the landing. On the landing Corso bumps into the secretary, who has just emerged from the elevator. She gives a little shriek and drops a paper bag. Half a dozen oranges go bouncing ahead of Corso as he races down the stairs. In the hallway he almost upends the concierge, who's wielding a broom in her curlers. Leaping aside with a startled yell, she speeds him on his way with some choice words, then peers up the stairwell: the upper stories are already wreathed in smoke, and tenants have come out onto the landings. The secretary comes pelting down the stairs, screaming at the top of her lungs. Outside, Corso douses his head in the basin of a fountain, shakes off the drips and massages his face. Then he leans against the basin and looks around. He's all alone in the little square. He takes out a crumpled cigarette and inserts it between his lips with dripping fingers, gropes for his lighter, and vainly tries to light it. Wearily, he removes the cigarette from his lips and tosses it away. All at once, he spots a huge Great Dane watching him from the mouth of an alleyway. Corso and the Great Dane stare at each other. Then the silence is broken by a fire engine's siren, faint at first but growing louder. He reaches an intersection and looks around the corner. The Kessler building is ablaze. Tongues of flame and clouds of smoke are issuing from the windows of the upper stories. Fire engines and squad cars are drawn up outside, firemen are directing their hoses onto the flames, cordoning off the street and keeping curious spectators away. *** Corso, looking wrung out, crosses the street and makes for the hotel entrance. He's just going through the revolving doors into the lobby when the girl appears on the inside. Hooking her arm through his, she steers him around and back outside again in one continuous movement. Girl: (mutters): Just keep going. (still firmly gripping his arm, she takes him out onto the Sidewalk) Corso: (baffled): What are you playing at? Girl: See those men talking with your friend Gruber? (Corso turns to look. Inside the lobby, two men in trenchcoats are standing at the reception desk in conversation with Gruber) Police. Corso: (at that moment, Gruber looks past them at Corso. He briefly locks eyes with him but shows no sign of recognition) Shit. (He turns and walks off with her at his side. He goes to enter a glass phone booth) Girl: You look better without that old bag and coat of yours. They didn't do anything for you. Corso: (shuts the door in her face. He picks up the receiver, inserts a coin, punches out a number. The girl pulls a funny face at him through the glass. Corso's only response is to turn away and cup his hand around the receiver. Into the phone) Gruber? It's me, Corso. Can you talk? Gruber: No, sir. Corso: But you can listen? Gruber: Certainly, sir. Corso: I'd like you to do something for me. *** Gruber enters a restaurant/bar crowded with lunchtime customers. He spots Corso at the far end of the bar with the girl beside him. She's sucking up some colorful beverage through a straw. Gruber acknowledges her presence with a formal nod. Corso: You don't have it? Gruber: There was nothing in the place you described, sir. I'm sorry. Corso: Goddamit! (He turns to the girl) I suppose you didn't take it? Girl: You still don't trust me, do you? Gruber: (clears his throat) I think I may have the answer, sir. Someone visited your room earlier on, while my young colleague was on duty: your wife. Corso: My wife? I don't have any wife. Gruber: That's what I told him. Corso: Could he describe her? Gruber: (nods): Thirtyish, blond, dishy. Corso: Liana... Gruber: Which reminds me, sir: the lady and gentleman you mentioned - they're staying at the Hotel Crillon, Suite 236-238. Corso: Good for you, Gruber. Thanks a lot. Gruber: Always glad to be of service, Mr. Corso. Corso: I owe you one for those cops, too. Gruber: Ah yes, sir. Interpol. Corso: Interpol! What exactly did they want? Gruber: They expressed an interest in your whereabouts. Corso: And? What did you tell them? Gruber: That you were out. Corso: Anything else? Gruber: They asked if I knew whether you had recently visited Portugal. Corso: And? Gruber: I said that our guests do not make a habit of providing us with their itineraries. Corso: (extracts a 500 franc bill from his billfold and slips it into Gruber's hand. Gruber acknowledges this with a gracious inclination of the head) For what it's worth, Gruber, I don't know what they think I've done, but I'm innocent. Gruber: (impassively): Naturally, Mr. Corso. All our guests are. *** Hotel Crillon, Forecourt. Day. A cab drives up to the entrance. The doorman opens the door, Corso and the girl get out. Corso turns to pay the cabby, the doorman twitches an eyebrow at the girls's jeans and sneakers. Corso and the girl enter the lobby which is bustling with activity. They stand aside as an elevator door opens and some camera-toting tourists emerge. Girl: What'll you do when you see them? Corso: (dryly): Hide behind you, probably. They enter the elevator. The doors glide shut. They walk down the corridor, checking numbers as they go. They've almost reached the door of Suite 236-238 when it opens abruptly. They jump back in alarm. A bellhop emerges backside first, towing a baggage cart laden with suitcases. Corso and the girl hide in a passage a few feet to their rear as the bellhop sets off down the corridor in the opposite direction, leaving the door open. Corso pads silently up to the door and enters with the girl at his heels. A deserted sitting room with an old 'Herald Tribune' lying abandoned on the floor and two dirty coffee cups on the table. The bedroom door is ajar. The girl stands watching as Corso tiptoes over pushes it open. The room is empty, the bed unmade. Corso: Downstairs, quick! They use the stairs for speed's sake. Panting, they halt at the foot of the last flight and scan the spacious but crowded lobby. It's a moment before they catch sight of the man standing at the cashier's desk with Liana beside him. Corso: C'mon. Better grab a cab or we'll lose them. They thread their way across the lobby and make for the exit unobserved. Corso and the girl have stationed themselves at the cab rank on the island. Corso sees a cab approaching amid the stream of traffic and tries to flag it down, but it's taken. Corso: Damn! The doorman hands Liana into the passenger seat of the Mercedes sedan while the man supervises the bellhop as he stows their baggage in the trunk. A Rolls pulls up behind the Mercedes, closely followed by a yellow Lamborghini driven by a smartly dressed, mustachioed Arab with a blond bombshell beside him. The Arab gets out, leaving his keys in the ignition. Nonchalantly signaling to the doorman to park his car, he disappears into the hotel with the blond in tow. The doorman acknowledges his gesture before smilingly accepting a tip from the man, who gets in behind the wheel. Girl: They're going! Corso sights another cab approaching and cavorts into the roadway, waving his arms like a madman. The cab honks and swerves to avoid him, obstructing some other vehicles, which honk in their turn. It's empty. Corso: Bastard! Frustrated yet again, beyond him, we see the Mercedes drive off. With a screech of tires, the yellow Lamborghini takes off fast in reverse. Skirting the island, it backs out into the oncoming traffic. Then, slammed into first, it skids to a halt beside the curb at Corso's elbow. The passenger door opens, the girl cranes over and looks up at him from behind the wheel. Girl: Coming? Corso stares at her for an instant, then jumps in. The Lamborghini sets off after the Mercedes, which is not far ahead. It threads its way into the stream of traffic, pursued for a few yards along the sidewalk by the wildly gesticulating doorman. The girl is expertly piloting the Lamborghini through heavy traffic. The Mercedes can be seen a few cars ahead. Corso: Couldn't you have pinched something a bit less conspicuous? Girl: Don't be so picky. Most people would give their eyeteeth for a ride in this. Corso surveys the car's luxurious interior, opens the glove compartment, removes the contents and inspects them: some CDs, the car papers, a pair of expensive wrap-around sunglasses, an Arab keffiyeh. Visible through the windshield, the Mercedes is cruising along several hundred yards ahead of the Lamborghini. Corso: We can't sit on their tail forever. They're bound to smell a rat. A long shot of the Lamborghini accelerating to draw level with the Mercedes. The Man, with Liana at his elbow, glances sideways. The Mans point of view: the Lamborghini with a figure in shades and a keffiyeh at the wheel. It's the girl. She looks straight ahead as she passes. No sign of Corso. Corso, who has been hiding below door level, sits up. After a quick glance over his shoulder, he settles back in his seat and lights a cigarette, covertly eyeing the girl. Girl: How do I look? Corso: You look like a million. A million barrels of oil. The Lamborghini passes an exit. The girl, who has discarded the keffiyeh and shades, is driving with one eye on the rearview mirror. The Mercedes indicates right, slows, and turns off at the exit. Girl: Sit tight! The girl pulls over onto the shoulder and stands on the brakes. Throwing the car into reverse almost before it's stationary, she hurtles backward along the shoulder. A couple of cars flash their headlights and blare as the Lamborghini reaches the exit and skids to a halt, narrowly missing a large truck that has beaten it to the exit. The Lamborghini crawls along behind the truck as it grinds up the single-lane exit road. Corso: (impatiently): C'mon, c'mon! The girl blasts the truck with her horn and flashes her headlights. The truck's only response is to slow still further before pulling up at a T-junction. Corso: What in hell's the matter with him? Clearly visible in the glare of the Lamborghini's headlights, an arm emerges from the truck's cab window and gives a prolonged, one-fingered salute. The arm disappears, the truck moves off at last and turns left across the bridge spanning the freeway. The Mercedes is nowhere in sight. The Lamborghini moves up to the T-junction and stands there, engine purring. Girl: Take your pick. Corso: No, you. You know everything. Girl: If you say so. She turns off right. Its dark now, and the Lamborghini is speeding along an avenue of poplar trees. No sign of the Mercedes. Girl: We lost them. Corso: Not at this speed. They must have gone the other way. Girl: You mean I don't know everything after all? Corso: Turn around. They pass a small intersection on the right. The girl backs into it but doesn't complete the maneuver. Something catches her eye. Girl: Thirtyish, blond, dishy - what was her name again? Corso: Telfer. Liana Telfer. Girl: No, her maiden name. Corso: Saint-Damien. Girl: Look. Corsos point of view. The Lamborghini's headlights have illuminated a signpost. One of the signs reads: 'ST.-DAMIEN 2 Km.' It points the way they were going. The girl turns out into the road and drives on in the original direction. The girl slows as they pass the 'ST.-DAMIEN' sign at the entrance to the village itself. Girl: Should we drive straight in? Corso: In this thing? We might as well hang a bell around our necks. Park here. Corso and the girl walk gingerly down the old village street. A faint glow emanates from a few windows in the time-worn houses, but the street itself is utterly deserted. They pause at the mouth of a small, equally deserted square, church on one end, village stores shuttered and in darkness, two or three parked cars, none of them the Mercedes. Girl: So? Corso looks around irresolutely, sees light coming from the basement window of a baker's shop. Side by side, Corso and the girl look down through the basement window. inside, a flour-smeared baker is deftly preparing a tray of croissants for the oven. Corso: Monsieur? Baker: (looks up, wipes his hands on his smock, and walks over to the window.) M'sieur? Corso: Nous cherchons la maison de Madame de Saint-Damien. Baker: Le chateau, vous voulez dire. Corso: (to the girl): Chateau! That's it - got to be. (to the baker) Ou il est, le chateau? Baker: (gestures): La route aprs ''gllse, m'sieur. *** The girl is driving slowly along a country road flanked on one side by woods. A pair of ornate wrought-iron gates and a gatehouse loom up on the left. Corso: Keep going. There's a light on in the gatehouse. They glimpse the gatekeeper leaning against his door, smoking, as they cruise past. The Lamborghini backs into the mouth of a farm track. The girl and Corso get out, cross the road, and strike off into the woods. Hugging the trees that border it on one side, Corso and the girl are making their way up a long, straight, graveled driveway. The lighted gatehouse is to their rear, the lights of the chateau can be seen ahead. Hearing the sound of a car behind them, they turn to see its headlights swing in through the gates. They quickly take cover in the trees and watch the car - a big limo - glide past, then emerge and walk on. They observe the chateau, a substantial 17th century mansion, from the edge of the trees. The forecourt, in which come 20 expensive-looking cars are parked, one of them the Mercedes, is illuminated by the the lights inside the building. The limo has pulled up at the foot of the steps, and the occupants, a smartly dressed elderly couple, are being greeted by a tuxedoed butler while their suitcases are removed from the trunk and carried in after them by a manservant. Corso and the girl have worked their way around to the side of the chateau. One of the lighted windows gives them a view of the upper reaches of the chateau's great hall, with its minstrel gallery and lofty, vaulted ceiling. They climb on a stone bench for a better look. Inside, overlooked by an array of ancestral portraits, some 50 guests are inaudibly conversing in groups. Men and women alike are attired in long black robes resembling monks' habits, and all have silver pentacles suspended from their necks on silver chains. Their cowls are thrown back to reveal the heads and faces beneath. A motley assortment of people, most of them middle- or late middle-aged, one or two of oriental origin. No sign of Liana or the Man. Girl: See them anywhere? Corso: No. Girl: They aren't there. Corso and the girl continue to make their way around the house, cautiously. Peering through a semi-basement window, they see two chefs chopping vegetables at a big kitchen table. They pause, at a loss, and look up at the house. Several of the second-floor windows are illuminated, and one of them has some creeper-covered trelliswork running up to its balcony. The girl, with Corso close behind her, has just reached the top of the trelliswork. She clambers over onto the balcony. Corso scales the last few fact, reaches for the balustrade, straddles it and joins her. Together, they peer through the French windows. With them, we see a bedroom decorated in a very feminine style. Two of Liana's suitcases are on the floor near the bed. A third, with her discarded clothes beside it, is lying open on the bed itself. Liana has stripped to her panties. They watch as she slips them off, goes to a wardrobe, and takes out a black robe and silver pentacle like the ones we saw downstairs. Pulling the robe over her head, she smooths it down, dons the pentacle, and inspects herself in a mirror in the corner of the room. Corso takes advantage of her preoccupation to try the French windows. They won't budge. He turns to the girl and shrugs, then raises his foot and kicks the glass in. Liana spins around with a terrified cry and stands there transfixed. Corso reaches inside, turns the knob, opens the French windows and steps into the room. The girl follows. Liana: You! Corso: Where is it? Liana: How dare you! Corso: That book isn't yours, Madame. 1 need it. Liana: Get out of here, both of you! Corso goes over to the bed and empties the suitcase onto the floor. Among its contents is 'The Nine Gates'. Liana instinctively lunges for it, but the girl blocks her. Corso: (to the girl) Careful, she bites! He's stooping to retrieve the book when the door opens and the Man, robed and barefooted, stands framed in the doorway. Corso turns quickly with the book in his hand, The girl stiffens. Liana makes a dive for the bedside table and produces a chrome-plated automatic from the drawer, flips the safety catch. Liana: (to Corso and the girl) Don't move, either of you. (to the Man) Get the book, Bruno. Corso takes a tentative step backward as Bruno approaches him with his left hand extended. He reluctantly surrenders the book. Bruno rewards him for his co-operation with a vicious right hook to the jaw. Corso goes down, losing his glasses yet again. Groggily, he crawls around in search of them. Bruno joins Liana, steering well clear of the girl. He hands her 'The Nine Gates' and carefully transfers the automatic from her hand to his. Liana: Take them downstairs and lock them up. We'll deal with them later, there's no time now. Bruno: (to Corso, Italian accent): Turn around. Corso, who has scrambled to his feet, complies. Bruno applies the muzzle of the automatic to the nape of his neck. Bruno: (to the girl) You. Go first. Any trouble, I blow his brains. The girl makes for the door. Bruno prods Corso into motion. They exit. Liana stares after them for a moment, clasping 'The Nine Gates' to her chest. A long passage lined with more ancestral portraits. The ancient floorboards creek as the girl obediently walks ahead of Corso and Bruno, whose automatic is leveled at Corso's back. They reach the end of the passage. Bruno: Go left. Down the stairs. They descend a staircase to ground level. Another long passage confronts them, much like the first but floored with marble. Bruno: Avanti, avanti! A door at the end leads into a stone-flagged passage with whitewashed walls. They make their way along it until they reach a heavy oak door. Bruno: (to the girl) Open it! The girl does so to reveal a small landing and a flight of stone steps leading downward. She stops short: the steps have no guardrail and the cellar beneath is shrouded in darkness. Bruno prods Corso through the doorway until all three are on the landing, then throws a light switch. Bare bulbs shed little light on the steps but illuminate a large vaulted chamber below. It's the chateau's wine cellar: oak barrels and racks of bottles thick with dust and cobwebs are housed behind an iron grille with a door in it. The door is ajar, the key in the lock. Bruno: (to the girl) Move! She sets off down the steps. Corso follows with Bruno at his heels. Halfway down, Corso pretends to stumble: he crouches and turns in a single movement. Bruno, following close behind, trips over him. Corso seizes his robe and yanks at it, helping him on his way. Corso: (to the girl) Watch out! She plasters herself against the wall to avoid Brunos somersaulting body. The automatic escapes from his hand and slithers across the flagstones as he comes to rest, with a sickening thud, at the foot of the steps. The girl follows him down and picks it up. Corso reaches the foot of the steps and rolls Bruno over on his back. He's out cold, with blood oozing from a broken nose. Girl: (faintly admiring) I didn't know you had it in you. Corso: Another thing you didn't know? (He takes hold of Bruno's ankles and, with the girls assistance, hauls him through the grille into the inner cellar. He stares down at the man for a moment) Hey, give me a hand. I want his gear. He starts to peel off Brunos robe, shuts the grille door, locks it, and tosses the key into a corner. They cautiously retrace their steps along the marble-floored passage. Corso is wearing Bruno's robe and pentacle over his clothes with his shoes and trouser bottoms visible below the hem. They pass the stairs they descended and continue on their way, turning a corner. As they do so, they hear a faint, intermittent hum. They pause to listen, then walk on. The sound grows louder and more distinct: somewhere in the chateau, voices are chanting in unison. Turning another corner, they find themselves in an anteroom that terminates in two massive double doors. The chanting is coming from beyond them. Corso walks over to the doors with the girl at his heels. He grasps the handle. Girl: (hisses) No! Up to the gallery. The chanting is even louder now. They reach the top of some uncarpeted stairs and cautiously open a small door. A wave of sound hits them. They steal through the doorway into the shadowy gallery, and peer over a balustrade. At the far end of the huge room in a dais draped in black with some shallow steps leading up to it. On the wall above the dais hangs an inverted silver crucifix; on the dais itself, which is flanked by a pair of outsize black candles in three-foot silver candlesticks, Liana stands facing the hall from behind a silver lectern on which reposes 'The Nine Gates'. Arrayed in the body of the hall are the 50 guests, each holding a lighted black candle. Liana and the guests are taking it in turns, like priest and congregation, to intone passages from the Latin text of 'The Nine Gates'. Corso: (quietly, to the girl) You stay here and cover me. I'm going down. Pulling the cowl over his head, he sneaks down the spiral staircase, secretes himself in the rear rank of guests, and concentrates on Liana and the book as the litany continues. All at once, unseen by us, the doors swing open with a crash and Balkan's deep bass voice punctures the air on a derisive note. Balkan: Mumbo-jumbo-mumbo-jumbo-mumbo-jumbo!!! The guests stop chanting, and fifty cowled heads turn to look for the source of this unseemly interruption. Up on the dais, Liana freezes. Balkan: Mumbo-jumbo-mumbo-jumbo-mumbo-jumbo!!! Looking over-life-size in his dark and elegant double-breasted suit, he strides toward the dais. Any guests who fail to get out of his way in time are brusquely elbowed aside. Liana watches him, transfixed, as he climbs the steps and turns to face the guests. Balkan: Look around you - yes, all of you. What do you see? (they involuntarily turn to look at each other) I'll tell you: a bunch of buffoons in fancy dress. What are you expecting, an apparition? I'm the only apparition you'll see tonight. You really think the Prince of Darkness would deign to manifest himself to the likes of you? He never has and he never will - never! (He closes 'The Nine Gates' with a snap and holds it up) You read from his book, yes, but you have no conception of its true power. I alone have grasped its secret. I alone have fathomed the Master's grand design. I alone am worthy to enjoy the fruits of that discovery: absolute power to determine my own destiny. Liana: (finding her voice at last) You're insane, Boris. (puts out her hand) Give it back at once! Balkan: (rounds on her) As for you, Liana de Saint-Damien, you're even guiltier than the rest of this pathetic rabble. You have at least some idea of what this book can do in the right hands, yet you lend yourself to these farcical proceedings, these orgies of ageing flesh conducted in the Master's name. You're a charlatan! Liana tries to grab the book, but Balkan holds it above his head. She claws his cheeks in desperation. He clasps his face, dropping the book. Liana makes a dive for it, but Balkan pounces on her. They roll over, struggling fiercely. Balkan grabs her by the throat. She tries to break his grip, but he redoubles it. Halfway down the dais steps with Balkan on top of her, she fights for breath. Her suffocated, agonized face is turned toward the hall. The guests shrink back in horror, some of them dropping their candles. Hysterical screams rend the air. Corso comes to life. Hampered by his robe, he makes for dais as fast as he can, scattering frightened guests in the process. He takes hold of Balkan's shoulders and tries to haul him off Liana. Balkan, still throttling her, turns to look. He glares at Corso through his heavy glasses, his features contorted with rage. Then, removing one hand from Liana's throat, he deals Corso a backhanded blow that sends him reeling. Liana seizes the chance to break free. She crawls away, but Balkan is too quick for her: grabbing her pentacle chain from behind, he proceeds to garrotte her with it. Liana, now on her knees, scrabbles at the chain that is biting into her neck. Her face turns purple, her tongue begins to protrude. Corso looks around wildly for a weapon. He seizes one of the three-foot candlesticks and raises it over his head. Suddenly: Girl: (Off Screen) Don't, Corso! Startled, he lowers the candlestick and looks up. The girl is perched on the gallery balustrade just above him. Too preoccupied with Balkan and Liana to wonder what her game is, Corso raises the candlestick once more. The girl lands on top of Corso, bearing him to the ground, and immobilizes him with a hammerlock. Corso: Get off me! He'll kill her! Girl: Leave them! Balkan completes his grisly work: Liana's purple face is all too reminiscent of Baroness Kessler's. With a final tug at the chain, he plants one foot in the small of Liana's back and sends her limp body sprawling across the floor of the hall. Screams and cries of horror go up from the guests, who have recoiled still further. Balkan straightens up, a somewhat dishevelled but still imposing figure despite the scratches on his cheeks. Even his glasses are still in place. He leans forward, eyes narrowed in a mock menacing way, and stamps his foot. Balkan: (in a voice like thunder) Boooh! With more hysterical screams and cries of dismay, the guests turn tall and flee the hall like a herd of panic-stricken cattle, jostling each other in their eagerness to get out the door. Calmly, without so much as a glance at the girl, Corso, or Liana's corpse, Balkan smoothes his hair down, picks up 'The Nine Gates', and strides majestically after them. Silence falls. The girl releases her grip on Corso's arm, gets off him and rises to her knees. He sits up, nursing his elbow and staring at her with blank incomprehension. Corso: Why did you do it? Girl: Some things are meant to happen. That was one of them. Corso: Don't give me that crap again! You were working for him all along! Girl: Funny, I thought you were. Corso: You played me for a sucker, the two of you. I don't intend to take the rap for that maniac. Girl: He just murdered someone with a roomful of witnesses. That lets you off the hook for the other killings. You should be grateful. Corso: I'm ecstatic. (He gets to his feet. The girl rises too, starts to pat the dust off his robe. Corso impatiently evades her hand) Where's he off to? Girl: What do you care? Your job is done. This is as far as you need to go. Corso: The hell it is! The sonofabitch owes me the other half of my fee. Girl: (ironically) Of course, it's just business. I thought your curiosity had gotten the better of you. Corso: Okay, so what's meant to happen next? Girl: You really want to know? *** The girl, with Corso, red-eyed and unshaven beside her, is driving along a country road bordered by rolling fields wreathed in gray mist. They've appropriated Liana's Mercedes sedan. Corso has taken over the wheel. The girl is fast asleep with her head on his shoulder. Sunset. The girl is back behind the wheel, Corso smoking. Dazzled by the setting sun, she lowers the visor. The Mercedes rounds a bend. Visible in the distance, crisply silhouetted against the afterglow, is a castle. It's the one of which we saw a backlighted photograph on Balkan's wall. The girl pulls up some distance from the archway that was once the castle gate. A dark green Range Rover is already parked beside it. Corso and the girl get out and briefly survey the derelict building. A glimmer of light is issuing from the arrow slits in one of the turrets. They cross the deserted courtyard, which is littered with fallen masonry. They climb a dilapidated flight of stone steps to the battlements and walk along them to the tower. They pause outside the moldering old door and listen. A man's voice is faintly audible. Corso puts his hand on the handle. The girl gropes in the pocket of her duffel coat and produces the chromium-plated automatic, holds it out. Corso hesitates briefly, then stuffs it in his jacket pocket. He opens the door and enters, followed by the girl. They are looking down into the interior of the turret, which forms a cylindrical chamber. They're on a small landing from which a steep flight of unprotected stone steps curves down and around the inner wall to the floor of the chamber. The floor, littered with debris including worm-eaten beams that have fallen from the ceiling far above, consists of massive, age-old planks. A large circle has been chalked in the middle of the floor, and within it a square divided into nine boxes numbered 1-9. Each box contains some unrelated object: a rusty knife, a piece of cord, a stone, a gold ring, a serpentine bracelet, a glass vial, a small pile of earth, a quill pen, an hourglass. The chamber is illuminated by half a dozen kerosene lamps located around the circle but outside it. Also near the circle is a camper's collapsible table with various objects on it: a black briefcase, 'The Nine Gates', a magnifying glass, a vacuum flask and mug. On the floor beside the table is an open suitcase with more books spilling out of it. The voice we heard from outside is that of Balkan, but a Balkan unlike any we have seen before: no jacket or necktie, shirt sleeves rolled ' up, vest half unbuttoned, strands of gray hair falling over his scratched and sweating face, cheeks flushed, eyes ablaze with excitement. He's kneeling in front of the numbered boxes and babbling to himself in an expressionless monotone: Balkan: ... eight doors come before the Serpent that guards the word, Teth, Enea, Novem, Oded, the number nine, which holds the final secret, the mystery of mysteries. The Serpent is the beast that always sleeps with one eye open and is reflected in the Mirror of Knowledge. (giggles triumphantly) Eight engravings plus one, or one plus eight, which coincides with the number that St. John of Patmos attributed to the Beast: 666... Corso: (to the girl) He needs therapy. Balkan: (proceeds to scrawl some numerals on the floor with a piece of chalk) Six plus six plus six equals eighteen. One and eight. (even more triumphantly): One plus eight equals nine! Corso starts to descend the steps. The girl stays behind, sits down on the top step, props her chin on her hand, and watches the proceedings. Balkan rises with chalk dust all over the knees of his pants. He goes to his briefcase and takes out a sheaf of torn engravings. Corso has reached the foot of the steps. Balkan, turning to resume his place in the circle, catches sight of him. He freezes in disbelief, and a long moment passes before he speaks. Balkan: What are you doing here?! Corso: I thought I'd drop in before they put you behind bars. Balkan: Go away! Corso: We had a deal, remember? Balkan: A deal?! What impertinence! You bungled it, damn you! You failed me all along the line! Thanks to your lack of initiative, I was compelled to do my own dirty work. And I did it! I got these myself! See, here they are! (brandishes the engravings, speaks with mounting vehemence) Nine engravings or nine doors, and only an initiate can open them. Each door has two keys, each engraving discloses a number, a secret element and keyword to be interpreted in the light of reason and the Cabbala, the one true philosophy! Corso: I want my money. Balkan: Don't you understand what's going on here? (returns to the circle, kneels down again, and deals out the engravings like playing cards, one to a box, leaving three boxes Empty) You have before you the mystery of which men have dreamed throughout the centuries. Thousands have died an agonizing death in hopes of just a glimpse of what you're about to see! Corso: Yeah? What's that, Old Nick in person? Balkan: Don't be ridiculous! He has never appeared to anyone, never! He's a spirit - the spirit of pure evil. He manifests himself through his servants, of whom I'm proud to be one! (rises, walks quickly over to the little table, and opens 'The Nine Gates' . Turning over several pages, he tears out an engraving) Three copies, but only nine of their twenty-seven engravings hold the key, and I have them all! (tears out two more engravings in quick succession) I have only to complete the sequence. Then the Serpent will enter the seal of Saturn, and I - I shall enter the Ninth Gate! Corso: Cut the crap and write me a cheque. Balkan returns to the circle, kneels down once more and neatly positions the three engravings in the empty boxes. Then he rises, goes' to the table, and pours himself a drink from a flask. He gargles with it, swallows, and shakes himself like a wet dog. Whatever the flask contained, it seems to have invigorated him. He dribbles gasoline around the circle, then picks up one of the kerosene lamps and hurls it at the floor. The lamp smashes and ignites the gasoline. Instantly, he's ringed with fire. He draws himself up and stands erect in the center of the circle with flames dancing all around him. Balkan: I give you my allegiance, Master. I surrender myself unto you body and soul. Let me fear neither noose, nor sword, nor poison. Let me walk unscathed among lepers and the plague-ridden. Erase me from the Book of Life and inscribe me in the black Book of Death. Let it be no! Let it be so now! (ecstatically) Yes, master, yes! Oh, thank you, thank you! I can feel the power flowing through me like an electric current, rendering me capable of any achievement, mental or physical! I could float on air, walk on water. (He stoops and dabbles his hands in the ring of fire) See? I plunge my hands in fire and feel no heat. (picks up the gasoline can, holds it over his head, dousing himself in the contents, then hurls it aside) Corso: Hey, don't be stupid! Balkan: (unhearing) Admay, Eloy, Agla, Zatel, Gebal, Elimi, Ashtoreth, Moloch, Shamash, Dagon... (With a whoosh, he himself catches fire. Flames play over his ecstatic figure) It's miraculous! I feel nothing, nothing at all! He emits another triumphant laugh that soars up the scale until it becomes a high-pitched scream of agony. He starts to caper around, slapping at his clothes, his face, his hair. Corso has regained his feet. He takes the automatic from his pocket and sends it slithering across the floor and through the ring of flames. Corso: Here, you idiot! He retreats up the steps with horror written on his face. The girl has risen to her feet. He takes her hand and, with a last backward glance, hustles her outside. Balkan's wild screams reverberate around the walls as Corso and the girl hurry across the courtyard. They are standing beside the Mercedes. Smoke and tongues of flame are issuing from the arrow slits of Balkan's tower. His screams rise in a crescendo. Then a gunshot cuts them off like a knife. Corso: He really thought it would work. Girl: He wasn't to know it wouldn't. Corso: (stares at her, momentarily puzzled, then at the blazing castle, then back at her) You didn't do anything to help him, Greeneyes, not this time. Girl: I'm your guardian angel, remember? She lays her palm against his cheek, then crooks her hand around the nape of his neck and draws his face toward hers, kisses him tenderly on the lips. Corso returns her kiss. He folds her in his arms and holds her close. The fiery glow dances over their entwined figures. The castle is now ablaze. The flames have spread from Balkan's tower to the rest of the building. Smoke and flames are now belching from it. The sky overhead is tinged with crimson. *** Paris Hotel room. Corsos hair damp from the shower and a towel around his waist, is halfway through shaving when there's a knock on the bathroom door. One cheek daubed with foam, he opens it to find himself confronted by the floor waiter, check pad and ballpoint in hand Waiter: Bonjour, m'sieur. Votre petit djeuner. Corso: Oh. Sure. Taking the pad, he emerges into the bedroom and scribbles his signature, then stops short: there's a breakfast cart in the middle of the room, but the bed is empty. No sign of The Girl or her clothes. Corso: Where is she? Waiter: Pardon? Corso: Madame, ou elle est? Waiter: Je ne ''ai pas vue, m'sieur. He makes for the door and exits. Corso catches hold of the door just as it's closing, puts his head out into the corridor, looks right and left. No one in sight but the floor waiter, who casts a puzzled glance over his shoulder as he walks off. Corso, now dressed but unshaven, hurries over to the reception desk, where Gruber is on duty. Gruber greets him with an almost imperceptible inclination of the head. Gruber: Good morning, Mr. Corso. Corso: Morning, Gruber. The young lady I came with, have you seen her? Gruber: Yea, sir. She went out not long ago. (He reaches behind him and produces a folded message slip from one of the pigeonholes) She asked me to give you this. He hands the slip to Corso, who opens it. With him, we read: 'See you around, maybe.' And below that: 'PS. The 9th Engraving was a forgery.' *** Toledo Street. Alley. Day. Corso's footsteps echo as he walks along one of Toledo's narrow medieval streets. The steel-framed glasses with the cracked lens have been replaced by a new pair with gold frames. He's wearing a smart new overcoat and has a new leather bag slung from his shoulder. He rounds a corner and heads down the deserted alleyway we saw in an earlier scene. No scaffolding, just sandblasted walls and freshly painted window frames and grilles. He reaches the doorway leading to the inner courtyard, hears a woman's strident cries, bumps into the boy, who comes running out as before. Corso crosses the courtyard to the steps that led down to the Cenizas' workshop. He stops short and stares. The old door - 'HERMANOS CENIZA - RESTAURACION DE LIBROS' - has been taken off its hinges and propped on its side against the basement wall. The display window is just a gaping hole: the window frame has been ripped out, exposing the masonry surrounding it. The whirr of a power tool can be heard. Corso, looking puzzled, descends the steps. He pauses in the doorway and surveys the interior. The hand press has disappeared and the floor is littered with debris. Pale rectangular patches on the grey walls indicate where counters and cabinets have been ripped out. Two Spanish workmen are busy detaching an old cabinet from the wall with an electric screwdriver. Corso: Oiga! He has to repeat himself before they interrupt their activities. 1st Workman: Senor? Corso: Los Hermanos Ceniza? 1st Workman: Los Ceniza? (glances at the 2nd Workman) Estan muertos. Corso: Como muertos? Quando? 1st Workman: Oh, hace anos, anos. Corso: ANOS?! 2nd Workman: Ingles? Corso: Americana. 2nd Workman: Ah... They dead, many years. Corso: (more and more puzzled): But they were here not long ago - I spoke with them. The 2nd workman looks at his colleague, shrugs and chuckles as if to convey that Corso is crazy, like most foreigners. 1st Workman: Disculpe. He indicates that Corso is in the way. Utterly disconcerted, Corso backs up as they manhandle the cabinet away from the wall and tilt it forward prior to laying it face down on the floor. As they do so, a dusty piece of paper slides off the top of the cabinet and seesaws to the floor like a falling leaf. Instinctively, Corso stoops and picks it up. He looks at it idly, then more closely. His eyes widen. It's the Ninth Engraving: The woman riding a seven-headed dragon with a castle ablaze in the background. The woman's face bears a strong resemblance to that of The Girl. Corso walks back along the alleyway with the engraving in his hand. His receding figure dwindles to a speck.

	Two "GIANTS", wearing leopard-skin shorts, iron bicep-bands and

	INTERIOR of the MAUSOLEUM.  There is an ornate stone sarcophagus
	in the center of the room, raised up on an altar.  The back wall
	has a mantle with a bust of the Virgin Mary looking downward at

	illuminating the misty fog hanging in the air.

	The giants walk into the Mausoleum.  They lift the heavy stone
	lid off of the coffin, revealing CRISWELL.  He is lying in the
	coffin on his back, with his arms crossed over his chest and 
	eyes closed.  He is wearing black suit pants, a white shirt, a

							FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN.

EXT. HIGHWAY IN WILDERNESS.  "NIGHT"

	A CONVERTIBLE is driving along a DESERT ROAD.  LONG SHOTS of
	the automobile driving are filmed in bright sunlight.  The
	desert hills are clearly visible in the background, with only
	a slight darkening to suggest day-for-night, but the car's
	headlights are on so we clearly understand that it is pitch
	black in the dead of night.
							CUT TO:

	MEDIUM SHOT - BOB AND SHIRLEY IN CAR.  NIGHT

	BOB and SHIRLEY are seated in the CONVERTIBLE, driving through
	the night, on a "date".  They are searching for an ancient
	CEMETERY.  MEDIUM SHOTS have a pitch black background and dark
	shadows across the car.

	Shirley is leaning over in her seat toward Bob, who is
	driving.
	 
	   			SHIRLEY
 		  	We sure picked the wrong night
			to find a cemetery.  Let's turn
			back.
			
				BOB
			No.  It's on a night like this
			when the best ideas come to mind.

	   			SHIRLEY
			But does it have to be in a
			cemetery?

				BOB
			You wouldn't understand.  Seeing
			a cemetery on a night like this
			can stir in the mind the best
			ideas for a good horror story.

	   			SHIRLEY
			But there're so many wonderful
			things to write about, Bob.

				BOB
			Sure there are--and I've tried
			them all.  Plays, love stories,
			westerns, dog stories.  Huh, 
			now there was a good one, that 
			dog story all about--

	   			SHIRLEY
			    (interrupting)
			But horror stories!  Why all the
			time horror stories?

				BOB
			Shirley, I wrote for years 
			without selling a single word.

	Bob lets go of the wheel with his right arm and puts it around 
	Shirley, who leans closer against him.

				BOB
			My monsters have done well for 
			me.  You think I'd give that up 
			just so I could write about 
			trees, or dogs, or daisies?  
			Huhuh--Daisies!  That's it, 
			I'll write about my creatures 
			who are pushing up the daisies.

	Shirley looks up at Bob and smiles.  He tilts his head down and 
	they kiss.
 		   		BOB
			Your puritan upbringing holds
			you back from my monsters, but
			it certainly doesn't hurt your
			art of kissing.
				
				SHIRLEY
			That's life.  My kisses are
			alive.
			
				BOB
			Who's to say my monsters 
			aren't alive?		   			

	LONG SHOT of the car driving down the road

	CUT back to MEDIUM SHOT of Bob and Shirley

				BOB
			All of my books are based on 
			fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps 
			why they're more interesting 
			and sell in the top spots.

				SHIRLEY
			Well, fact or not, I don't 
			see how we're going to find 
			an ancient cemetery in these 
			mountains tonight.  I can't 
			see a thing!  Let's turn back.

				BOB
			There's an old cemetery on
			this road. I've been there 
			before.

	LONG SHOT of car driving up a desert road with a sandy
	mountain in the background.

				SHIRLEY
			I'm getting the jitters!  
			Let's turn back!

				BOB
			   (reluctantly)
			Okay.

	Bob takes his arm from around Shirley and puts it back on the 
	wheel.

				BOB
			Just as soon as I find a 
			place wide enough to turn 
			around.

	CLOSEUP of CAR INTERIOR - DASHBOARD.

	CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley

				SHIRLEY
			Not so fast!

	We hear sounds of tires squealing on the road.

	CLOSEUP of car wheel racing along the road.

	CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley

				SHIRLEY
			    (desperately)
			Not so fast!

	CLOSEUP - CAR PEDALS.  Bob steps hard on the brake,
	then pumps the brake repeatedly.

	CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley.  Shirley screams
	and hides her face with her hands.

	ZOOM IN on a high dirt bank at the roadside, then the screen
	swirls and spins quickly to suggest a dizzying automobile 
	crash.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

	Bob and Shirley are lying on their backs, unconcsious,
	on the ground.  The ground is covered by scattered leaves.  
	Misty fog swirls over them.
				(beat)
	Shirley wakes up and sits upright groggily.  She looks 
	around, then looks down at Bob.  She moves toward him and
	cradles his head in her lap.
							DISSOLVE TO:
	
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Cemetery is filled with fog.  We see a large stone throne
	framed by ornate columns, with an altar beneath it.  There 
	are tombstones in the background, and skulls and bones on 
	the ground.

	CAMERA PANS RIGHT across a small clearing to the MAUSOLEUM.

				CRISWELL (VO)
			It is said on clear nights, 
			beneath	the cold light of the 
			moon, howl the dog and the wolf, 
			and creeping things crawl out
			of the slime.  It is then the 
			ghouls feast in all their
			radiance.

	The Mausoleum doors creak open on their own, and Criswell  
	quickly stalks out across the clearing, hiding his face 
	behind his long black cape which is held up with his bent 
	elbow against his face, in Dracula fashion.

				CRISWELL (VO - Continuing)
			It is on nights like this most
			people prefer to steer clear of,
			uh, Burial Grounds. It is on 
			nights like this, that the 
			creatures are said to appear, 
			and to walk!

							    CUT TO:

	MEDIUM SHOT, CRISWELL CLIMBING ONTO HIS THRONE
	
	Criswell walks up the steps to the altar, across the altar, 
	and then sits down on the stone seat.  He then slowly lowers 
	his cape from his face and regally looks off to the right 
	(at his cue card).	  	 

				CRISWELL
			The day is gone, the night is
			upon us, and the moon, which 
			controls all of the underworld, 
			once again shines...in radiant 
			contentment.
				(beat)
			Come forth, come forth, o
			Princess of Darkness.

	Criswell repeatedly beckons slowly toward himself with his 
	right hand, staring across the clearing at the mausoleum.

	The PRINCESS OF DARKNESS is standing in front of the 
	Mausoleum.  She walks into the clearing with an entrancing 
	demeanor, her arms outstretched straight in front of her.  
	She is wearing a long black low-cut dress with long open 
	sleeves.  The sleeves are lined with red and hang down a
	couple feet from her wrists.  She walks slowly over toward
	Criswell's throne.

	The Princess of Darkness stands beside Criswells throne, 
	crosses her forearms in front of her chest, and bows toward 
	him.  He nods toward her.  She reaches out and places her 
	left hand on Criswell's right hand.
	
				CRISWELL (VO)
			Time seems to stand still.  Not 
			so the ghouls, when a night of 
			Pleasure is at hand!

	Criswell continues to hold the Princess of Darkness's hand, 
	and she looks at him seductively.

				CRISWELL
			If I am not pleased by tonight's
			entertainment, I shall banish 
			their souls to everlasting 
			damnation!

	The Princess of Darkness again crosses her arms in front of 
	her chest and slowly bows to Criswell.

	CUT TO shot of the FULL MOON with dramatic cymbals crashing,
	then back.
	
				CRISWELL
			And who is to be first?

	The Princess of Darkness claps twice, summoning the first of 
	the night's entertainers.  These poor souls must dance for 
	Criswell's approval.  If he is pleased, they can continue to 
	entertain him for centuries, but if not, they will be banished 
	to everlasting damnation by the All-powerful Criswell.

	LONG SHOT OF THE CLEARING.  Huge flames rise from the ground 
	in front of the clearing.  The INDIAN GIRL enters the clearing 
	and begins to Dance.  She is wearing a red Native American-
	style dress and headband.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			One who loved flames.  Her lover
			was killed by flames.  She died 
			in flames.

	The INDIAN GIRL DANCE begins.

	The Indian Girl dances around for awhile, then dances away 
	into the foggy background.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

	Bob slowly wakes up and sits up.  Bob and Shirley look 
	around.

EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

	The Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the 
	mausoleum and begins to speak without moving her lips!  A 
	marvel of filmmaking art.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS 
			    (out of sync with picture)
			One who prowls the lonely streets
			at night in life is bound to prowl 
			them in eternity.

	The STREET WALKER DANCE begins.  The STREET WALKER walks 
	into the clearing wearing a pink dress and purple feather 
	boa, and beckons with her finger as if to say, "Come here, 
	Criswell!"

EXT. WOODS.  NIGHT.

	At the car accident scene with Bob and Shirley, slow jazz 
	music is audible from the nearby festivities in the cemetery. 
	Bob and Shirley are still sitting on the ground, looking 
	toward the source of the music.

				CRISWELL (VO)
			Ahh, the curiousity of youth...
			on the road to ruin!  May it 
			ever be so adventurous!
				
				SHIRLEY
			I'm so frightened.
				
				BOB
			Well we certainly can't stay 
			here. C'mon.	
				
				SHIRLEY
			Where?
				
				BOB
			In there.
				
				SHIRLEY
			It frightens me.
				
				BOB
			Silly, there's nothing in 
			there to be afraid of.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Then..then what's that music?
			
				BOB
			That's what I want to find out.  
			We have to get help.
				
				SHIRLEY
			What help can we possibly find 
			in the cemetery at this time of 
			night?
				
				BOB
			Something's making that music.
			
				SHIRLEY
			I'm not sure I care to find out
			what it is.
				
				BOB
			All right.  Don't worry, I'll
			be right beside you.
				
				SHIRLEY
			What help will that do if 
			something in there isn't dead?
				
				BOB
			Not dead?  In a cemetery?
			
				SHIRLEY
			I can't imagine anything dead 
			playing that music.
				
				BOB
			Well, it's probably just the
			caretaker, and that's exactly 
			who we want to find.  They'll 
			have a telephone.  C'mon.
				
	Bob helps Shirley up from the ground and leads her into the 
	thick bushes.

EXT. CEMETERY, NIGHT

	Criswell nods repeatedly, smiling at the dancer in approval.
	The Street Walker's clothes have suddenly disappeared.

	Bob and Shirley creep beneath the bushes, crouched down low.  
	They reach the edge of the clearing where Criswell and the 
	Princess of Darkness are watching the Street Walker Dance.
	
				SHIRLEY
			Could it be some kind of 
			college initiation?
				
				BOB
			It's an initiation all right, 
			but not of a college as you 
			and I know them.  Nothing 
			alive looks like that!
				
				SHIRLEY
			Can't we get out of here?
				
				BOB
			I'm not sure...
				
				SHIRLEY
			What do you mean?
				
				BOB
			I'm not sure, myself. It's 
			just a feeling I've had 
			since the crash...Like I 
			feel a cold chill all over..
			..Now this!

	The Street Walker dances with a Skeleton that is hanging by 
	the door of the mausoleum.

	The Street Walker dance ends.

				CRISWELL
			I would see for approval, the
			one who in life worshipped 
			gold above all else.

	The Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the
	mausoleum again to start off the next dance.

	The giants walk to the doors, now wearing red and white
	horizontal-striped miniskirts (or ancient egyptian garb?). 
	They pull the iron doors open slowly, and we see the GOLD 
	GIRL DANCER lying on her back on the altar inside.

				SHIRLEY
		       (pointing toward the mausoleum)
			Look!
			
				BOB
			Be careful!--They'll see you.

	The Gold Girl Dancer rises slowly and seductively from the 
	table, then stalkingly dances out into the clearing.  She is 
	wearing a metallic gold tunic-like dress.

	We see a shot of Bob and Shirley watching, and suddenly the 
	Gold Girl's dress has disappeared.

	The Gold Girl Dance continues.

				CRISWELL
			Throw gold at her.
				
	The giants pick up a bucket of gold doubloons and begin 
	slowly sprinkling them over the Gold Girl as she dances. 
	She sits on the ground and reaches for the falling coins.


				CRISWELL
			More gold.
				
	The giants continue dropping gold coins on the Gold Girl.  
	She picks up the gold coins, rubbing them over her body, 
	in ecstasy.

				CRISWELL
			       (excitedly)
			More gold!

	The giants continue, to the delight of Criswell.  The Gold 
	girl tries to scoop all the scattered coins closer to her.
	
				CRISWELL
			      (impatiently)
			More gold!

	The giants continue.  Criswell is thrilled, and begins to 
	LAUGH loudly.
	
				CRISWELL
			    (to the Princess)
			For all eternity, she shall 
			have gold.

	The Princess of Darkness laughs in acknowledgement, then 
	claps her hands twice, commanding the Giants to finish the
	ceremony.
	
	The Giants walk toward the Gold Girl, who is still on the 
	ground playing with the gold coins and rubbing them on her 
	body.  The giants pick up the Gold Girl, who resists, trying 
	to maintain contact with the gold.  She reaches for it as 
	they lift her up.
	
	CLOSEUP of a BUBBLING GIANT CAULDRON full of a substance that 
	is supposed to look like gold.
	
	The Giants dip the Gold Girl feet first into the cauldron,
	submerging her entire body.
	
	A few seconds later, the giants lift the Gold Girl out of the 
	cauldron.  Her body is now entirely gilded, and she is stiff. 
	They lift her onto their shoulders, carrying her like a board, 
	walking in front of Criswell's throne, then back into the 
	mausoleum, laying her body on the altar.
	
	We see Bob and Shirley, looking dismayed.
	
				CRISWELL (VO)
			And both couldn't help but 
			remember a line from one of 
			Bob's stories:  "A sudden wind 
			howls.  The night things are 
			all about me.  Every shadow, a
			beckoning invitation...to 
			disaster.  I know I should 
			think of other things, of 
			pleasant things, but I can't. 
			How can I think of other things, 
			of pleasant things, when I am 
			in a place surrounded by 
			shadows and objects, which can 
			take any shape, here in the 
			darkness...Any shape my mind 
			can conceive."

	Deep in the woods, we see THE WOLF MAN and THE MUMMY, walking 
	quickly.

	Suddenly, Bob and Shirley are grabbed from behind by the WOLF 
	MAN and the MUMMY.  The Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and 
	Shirley over to the clearing near Criswell's throne.
	
	The Princess of Darkness is now seated at Criswell's right 
	side with him on his throne.
	
				CRISWELL
			Bring 'em in!

	The Princess of Darkness stands and walks to the end of the 
	altar below Criswell's throne, then sits on the lower seat at 
	the end of the altar and crosses her legs.

	The Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and Shirley over to the 
	center of the clearing to face Criswell, The Sole Ruler of 
	the Dark World.
	
				CRISWELL
			They are live ones?
				
				THE MUMMY
		    (with audible tape hiss added)
			Yes, Master.
			
				CRISWELL
			Live ones where only the dead 
			should be?
				
				THE MUMMY
			Yes, Master, and we caught 
			them, him and me.
				
	The Mummy motions toward the Wolf Man.

				THE WOLF MAN
			WWWWOOOOOOAAAAAAAUUUUUGGGGHHHHAHAAAA!!!

				CRISWELL
			You shall both be rewarded.
			      (To Princess)
			My Dear Empress of the Night, 
			put these intruders to the 
			test.
	
	Medium Shot of Princess of Darkness.  (Suddenly the Princess 
	of  Darkness is beside the throne again, several feet from the 
	seat at the foot of the altar)
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			But they are not yet one of us.
				
				CRISWELL
			        (happily)
			A situation easily remedied.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			Tie them that they may watch.

	CUT back to long shot of the entire throne and throne altar. 
	The Princess of	Darkness is now seated again at the end of 
	the altar.

	The Wolf Man and The Mummy tie Bob and Shirley to very tall 
	grave stones.
	
	CUT to medium-close shot of Princess of Darkness, whose chest 
	is heaving excitedly as she grips the handle of the long 
	sacrificial dagger tucked into the belt at her waist.
	
				SHIRLEY
			  (desperately, to Criswell)
			Fiend!  Fiend!
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			To love the cat, is to be 
			the cat!
	
	Criswell motions toward The Princess of Darkness, who then 
	walks back up onto the altar and then sits down beside 
	Criswell again.
		
	The CAT GIRL DANCE begins.

	
	
				CRISWELL
			      (jovially)
			A pussycat is born to be 
			whipped.

	The Cat Girl Dance ends.

				CRISWELL
			      (excitedly)
			It will please me very much 
			to see the Slave Girl with 
			her tortures!

	CUT TO interior of the stone mausoleum.  The Ancient Egyptian 
	SLAVE GIRL is chained from her wrists to a high hook on the 
	wall.  One of the "giants" pretends to whip her with a cat 
	o' nine tails.

	CUT back to CRISWELL.

				CRISWELL
			      (excitedly)
			Torture! Torture!  It 
			pleasures me!

	The slave girl pulls with all her might and the chains 
	suddenly pop off the hook.  She then pushes the iron doors 
	open and dances out into the clearing.

	The Slave Dance concludes.

				SHIRLEY
			I'm so frightened.

				BOB
			You've got a right to be.  
			We're trapped by a bunch of 
			fiends.

				SHIRLEY
			Those creatures..!

				BOB
			Don't let them hear you.

				SHIRLEY
			What can we do?

				BOB
			I don't know.  I just don't 
			know. But don't give up.  
			We're not finished yet.

	Shirley closes her eyes and sighs.

				BOB
			Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic 
			won't do us any good!  Let 
			me think. We've got to
			stall for time.

				SHIRLEY
			I'm afraid I'll faint.

				BOB
			Whatever you do, don't do 
			that.

	The Camera zooms back and we see that the Wolf Man and The
	Mummy are hiding behind Bob and Shirley.  The Wolf Man has 
	his hand up to his ear so he can hear what Bob and Shirley 
	are saying.

	The Wolf Man and The Mummy then creep over toward Criswell's 
	throne.

	The Wolf Man whispers into The Princess of Darkness's ear while
	The Mummy and Criswell watch.

	The Princess of Darkness gets up from the throne and walks over 
	to Shirley.  Shirley grimaces.  The Princess of Darkness 
	unbuttons Shirley's blouse, then marks Shirley's abdomen with 
	a red (blood?) cross using her long sharp fingernail.

	Shirley screams.

	The Princess of Darkness pulls her long dagger out of her belt
	and raises it, staring into Shirley's eyes.  Suddenly, Criswell
	yells:

				CRISWELL
			HOLD!

	The Princess of Darkness pauses and looks back at Criswell.

				CRISWELL
			Let her continue to learn.  
			The time is not yet right 
			that they should join with 
			us.

	The Princess of Darkness reluctantly puts her dagger back in 
	her belt and tucks Shirley's blouse back in.

	The Princess of Darkness walks back to Criswell's throne.  
	He pulls a human skull out from behind his seat.

				CRISWELL
			...And what is this?

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			A symbol, Master.

				CRISWELL
			What kind of symbol?

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			She loved the bull ring 
			and the matador.  She 
			danced to their destruction.
			Now she dances to her own 
			destruction.  Her dance is
			of skulls.

	The Princess of Darkness takes the skull from Criswell and 
	throws it dramatically into the clearing.

	The MEXICAN DANCE (SKULL DANCE) ensues.

				CRISWELL
			She came to us on the Day of 
			the Dead.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			El Dia De Los Muertos...A
			celebration in her country.

				CRISWELL				
			Her dance has pleased me.

	The Princess of Darkness snaps her fingers, starting the 
	HAWAIIAN DANCE (SNAKE DANCE).

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			With the loss of her lover, 
			this one cast herself into 
			the Volcano's fire.

	A couple times during the dance, there are abrupt cuts to 
	STOCK FOOTAGE of a rattlesnake in a bright daylight shot in 
	tall dry grass.  (Looks like it was from a documentary)

				CRISWELL
			She was?

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			As I said, a worshipper of 
			snakes, and of smoke, and 
			flames.

				CRISWELL
			Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			It would seem so, Master.

	Hawaiian Dance continues, then cut to The Mummy and The Wolf 
	Man.
	
				THE MUMMY
			I don't like snakes.  I remember 
			the one Cleopatra used.  Cute 
			little rascal until it flicked
			out that red tongue, and those 
			two sharp fangs.  You'd never 
			think such a little thing
			packed such a big wallop.
					
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
					
				THE MUMMY
			Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
			
				THE WOLF MAN
			       (in agreement)
			Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.	

	Hawaiian/Snake Girl continues to dance.
	
				THE MUMMY
			We had lots of snakes in my 
			ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky
			things.
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn.
			AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
				
				THE MUMMY
			When I was alive, they were the
			things nightmares were made of.
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aaarrrgggaahh.
	
	The Hawaiian Dance ends.
				
				CRISWELL
			She pleases me.  Permit her to 
			live in the World of the Snakes.
			   (audible cue card flip)
		
				CRISWELL
	(continuing, after finding his place on the next cue card)
			Now, I will talk...to The 
			Wolf Man...and The Mummy.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			As you wish, Master

	The Princess of Darkness motions for The Wolf Man and The Mummy 
	to come.
				
				THE MUMMY	
			He wants us.
			
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
				
				THE MUMMY
			What do you suppose for?
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
				
				THE MUMMY
			Did you do something to get 
			us into trouble again?
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aannnnaahhnn.
			
				THE MUMMY
			Did you howl off-key at 
			the moon again?
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aannnnaahhnn.

				THE MUMMY
			I can't remember doing 
			anything wrong either.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			COME!
				
				THE MUMMY
			We better go before we 
			make him mad.

	The Wolf Man and The Mummy walk over to Criswell's Throne.

				THE MUMMY
			      (apprehensively)
			We are your servants, Master.

	The Wolf Man bows to Criswell.

				CRISWELL
			Of course you are.

	The Wolf Man and the Mummy crouch in fear as they face Criswell.

				THE MUMMY
			Have we in some way made 
			you angry, Master?

				CRISWELL
			You know better than that.

				THE MUMMY
			We don't know of anything, 
			Master...

				CRISWELL
			Then why do you shake so?

				THE MUMMY
			It's not often an Emperor 
			like you calls on creatures 
			like us.

				CRISWELL
			Well rest easy, I'm not 
			angry with either of you.

				THE MUMMY
				(relieved)
			Aaaahhhh.

	The Mummy Sighs in relief and the Wolf Man nods.

				THE MUMMY
			Then it is some service you 
			desire of us.

				CRISWELL
			You are the keepers of the 
			Damned.  You two know them all.  
			And I am tired of this usual 
			type of entertainment.
			I want...a decided change.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The moon!...is soon gone!
			
	The Princess of Darkness points up at the full moon.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			There is little time left for 
			the remainder of the evening's 
			pleasures.
			
	The Princess of Darkness gets up from the seat at the end of 
	the altar and walks around beside Criswell's throne.

				CRISWELL
			Yes, yes yes I know all that.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			At the first sight of the 
			morning sun's rays, we must 
			be gone.

				CRISWELL
			I suppose most of the others 
			will have to wait for their 
			judgement until after the next 
			full moon.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			It would seem so, Master

				CRISWELL
			Ahh, but I declare there is 
			still time for something.

				THE MUMMY
			There are one or two which 
			should complement the night's 
			entertainment, Master

				CRISWELL
			Ahh, good.  Then I will 
			see them.  Dismiss the rest.

				THE MUMMY
			Yes, sir, Master.

	Bob's hands are wiggling, trying to loosen the rope binding 
	his wrists behind his back around the stone column.
	
				BOB
			The ropes are coming loose.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Be careful!
				
				BOB
			I am--It's our only chance.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Nothing is worth your life.
				
				BOB
			My guess is if we don't 
			take the chance pretty soon,
			we're not going to have much
			life left anyway.
				
				SHIRLEY
			I'm frightened.  I'm so 
			frightened.
				
				BOB
			Hold on just a little 
			longer, Shirley.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Be careful, oh please be 
			careful.  We'll never get 
			out of here alive, I know 
			it.  I just feel it.
				
				BOB
			You do?
				
				SHIRLEY
			Yes I feel it in my bones.
			
				BOB
			You're talking nonsense.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Oh, no I'm not.  These 
			heathens probably have 
			an open grave for us.
			
				BOB
			They wouldn't dare put 
			us in the same grave--
			or would they?
			
				SHIRLEY
			I should hope not.  I 
			hate you!
			
				BOB
			That sudden?
				
				SHIRLEY
			Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't
			for you we wouldn't be hunting 
			for an old cemetery on a 
			night like this.  It's all
			your fault.
			
				BOB
			     (dejected)
			...And I thought you loved me.
			
				
	The Princess of Darkness is leaning over, covering her mouth 
	and whispering into Criswell's ear, looking over her hand back 
	at Shirley.
				
				CRISWELL
			Not yet.  I perhaps have other 
			plans for such a pretty one.  
			No matter, I will tell you when 
			and if you may have her.

	The Princess of Darkness crosses her forearms and bows to 
	Criswell.
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The Wolf Man informs me that 
			the next one is the woman who 
			murdered her husband on their 
			wedding night.  Now she dances
			with his skeleton.
			
	The SKELETON DANCE begins.

	The SKELETON DANCE GIRL, wearing a white dress and long 
	wedding veil, comes into the clearing with a skeleton.  She 
	dances with the skeleton, then dances in the clearing for 
	Criswell.

	The Skeleton Dance concludes.
				
				CRISWELL
			      (to Shirley)
			Have you not enjoyed the 
			evening's festivities?
				
	Shirley is silent and looks downward.
	
				CRISWELL
			Ahh, that will soon change 
			when you become one of us!

	The Wolf Man leans back and howls.  (He tilts his head back so
	far his fake rubber wolfman mask comes up and you can see his 
	skin at the bottom of his neck)
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			WWAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAHHGGGGHHHAAAA-
			AAAAAAAAAHHGGGGGHHHHHHHhhhhhh!
				
				CRISWELL
			It would seem that The 
			Wolf Man would have you 
			for his own!
			
				SHIRLEY
			AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
			
				CRISWELL
			I have promised both The 
			Wolf Man and The Mummy a 
			reward.  It could be that
			you are that reward.
			
				SHIRLEY
			AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
			
				CRISWELL
			You need not worry...Not just 
			now, anyway.
				
				BOB
			Leave her alone, you fiend!
			
				CRISWELL
			Fiend is it!  You will not 
			be so fortunate.  Your 
			existence will cease within 
			moments.  No one wishes to 
			see a man dance...
			   (looking at Shirley)
			And you, my dear, will entertain 
			for centuries to come.
			
				BOB
			If I could get my hands on 
			you...
			
				CRISWELL
			..Oh, You could do nothing!
			    (to Shirley)
			I can save you much pain.
			
				BOB
			Leave her alone, I tell you!
			
				CRISWELL
			    (to Shirley)
			I do not joke in my proposal.
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			She is to be mine!  It is so
			spoken!
			
				CRISWELL
			The Princess of Darkness would 
			have you for her own to join us 
			through extreme pain.
			      (beat)
			Yet I am inclined for one as 
			lovely as you, to be more lenient. 
			I have but to touch you with my 
			finger, and it would mean the end 
			of you, all over, quickly and 
			painlessly...
			
				SHIRLEY
			No. No! No!
			
				CRISWELL
			I repulse you?  Very well.  It
			seems you have chosen your own 
			fate. Live with it!  I should 
			say die with it!

	Bob looks down somberly, then looks over at Shirley.

				BOB
			I've got the ropes loose now.  
			I've got my hands free.  Be 
			careful--Don't change your 
			expression too much.  They 
			must not catch on.
				
				SHIRLEY
			What can we do against them?
			
				BOB
			I don't know, yet.  We'll 
			just have to watch our chance.  
			When it comes I'll know what 
			to do--I hope I'll know what
			to do.
				
				SHIRLEY
			I still don't know what ever
			made me go steady with a 
			crackpot writer like you.
				
				BOB
			All right.  Put it on heavy.
			
				SHIRLEY
			My old boyfriend Tommy would 
			never have gotten me in a 
			mess like this.  At least he's 
			got brains.
			
				BOB
			Him!  I'll bet he sleeps 
			with all the lights on.

				SHIRLEY
			Maybe so.

	CUT TO shot of The Mummy talking to The Wolf Man

				THE MUMMY
			I could make her another 
			Cleopatra...

				THE WOLF MAN
			Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!

				THE MUMMY
			Without the snake, of 
			course.		

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(impatiently)
			Well?

				CRISWELL
			Ahh, she will be yours.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(impatiently)
			When!?
	
				CRISWELL
			At your discretion...But 
			first, I desire more 
			entertainment.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The moon is almost gone!
			
				CRISWELL
			Ahh, there is yet time.
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			At the first sight of the 
			morning's rays' light...
				
				CRISWELL
			   (getting annoyed)
			I know the laws of the night.  
			I state there is still time 
			for yet another.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(forcefully)
			I would have time for my 
			own pleasures!
			
				CRISWELL
				(angrily)
			Your own pleasure comes only 
			after mine, when I desire it.  
			I am the Sole Ruler of the 
			Dark World.  There is no one 
			to challenge my authority here.  
			My word is the law--all powerful.  
			No one is to challenge that 
			authority, no one!.  Is that 
			understood?  It is my command.
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			I understand, Master
			
				CRISWELL
			Then see that it does not 
			happen again, in the penalty of 
			Everlasting Despair.  Now are 
			there others?
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			There are others.
				
				CRISWELL
			Well then let us proceed.
				
	The Princess of Darkness snaps her fingers three times, 
	summoning the Zombie Dance Girl.
	
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			She lived as a zombie in life, 
			so she will remain forever a 
			zombie in death.

	The ZOMBIE DANCE GIRL dances.
			
				BOB
			Easy, Shirley.  Easy!

	The Zombie Dance concludes.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The moon sinks lower into the 
			hills!  We must hurry to the 
			finish.
			
				CRISWELL
			I will decide the conclusion.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(impatiently)
			You had the mummy cancel all 
			the others scheduled for this 
			session.
				
				CRISWELL
				(interrupting)
			Then cancel my order.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The moon is almost gone!
			
				CRISWELL
			There is yet time.  Don't 
			you want your own pleasure?
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			Oh, if there is only time!
				
				CRISWELL
			Hahh, there is always time...
			All in good time...there is 
			always time.  You shall 
			have your pleasure.  THAT...
			I decree
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(looking at Shirley)
			All others were but infinitessimal 
			bits of fluff, compared to her
				(toward the Dancer)
			This one would have died for
			feathers, furs, and fluff...and 
			so she did!

	The FLUFF DANCE Girl dances for approval.
	
	The Fluff Dance ends.
	
	Criswell looks over at the Princess of Darkness.
				CRISWELL
			The time...is short.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			For what!?!
				
				CRISWELL
			Your pleasures of course!
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			You mean...!
				
				CRISWELL
			You may take her now.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			Is there time?
				
				CRISWELL
			You better hope there is.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			Thank you, Master!  Thank 
			you.
				
				CRISWELL
			Now hurry, hurry.  I will 
			watch!  Your desires may be 
			my pleasure also...Our fitting 
			climax to an evening's enter-
			tainment.  You must...hurry 
			now.
			
	The Princess of Darkness begins ceremoniously dancing with 
	her long sacrificial dagger, slowly moving toward shirley, 
	gazing back at Criswell seductively.  She finally gets to 
	Shirley and cuts the button off of Shirley's shirt, which 
	was so tight it was about to burst open anyway.  She unsnaps 
	the front of Shirley's bra.
	
	Bob sees his chance and makes his attempt at a "move," merely
	stepping forward.  He is instantly hammer-fisted on the back 
	of the neck by The Wolf Man, and falls down unconscious.
	
	The Princess of Darkness raises her long dagger high above 
	Shirley's head.  But suddenly, the sun rises (it is already 
	high overhead), and the night creatures lose their power.  The 
	Princess of Darkness clings to Shirley's arm, as she slowly 
	sinks down to the ground, losing all strength.
	
	The Camera pans around, showing Shirley and Bob's faces, then 
	back to the ghouls, all of whom have turned to steaming 
	skeletons.  Only their clothing and bones remain.
	
	Quick Zoom in on Criswell's throne.  Criswell's steaming 
	skeleton still sits, surveying the cemetery, wearing his cape.

							FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN.

EXT. WOODS - MORNING

	At the clearing in the woods near the car wreck, Bob and 
	Shirley are lying on their backs on the ground, just as they 
	were after the crash, before they got up to investigate the 
	strange music that led them to the ghouls.

	There are two DOCTORS examining Bob and Shirley.

	In the foreground, we see a REPORTER's shoulder and hands.  
	He is writing down details of the accident in a small paper 
	pad.

				DOCTOR #1
			Easy, Miss, everything's 
			gonna be alright.

				SHIRLEY
			Bob?  Bob?

				DOCTOR #1
			He's right here beside you. 
			He'll be alright too.

	The reporter walks around and crouches beside Shirley and 
	DOCTOR #1, and continues writing in his pad.

	A Newspaper PHOTOGRAPHER crouches in the foreground to get a 
	shot of the accident scene and victims.

				SHIRLEY
			Where are they, where did 
			they go? They tried to kill 
			me.

				DOCTOR #2
			What's this you say?  Who 
			was going to kill you?

				SHIRLEY
			The ghouls--they all turned 
			into skeletons.
			
				DOCTOR #2
			Take it easy, Miss.
			
				DOCTOR #1
			What she needs is a good
			rest.

				SHIRLEY
			It's true, I tell you, it's 
			true!  They all turned into 
			skeletons.  She-she cut me 
			here.
	
	Shirley points to her abdomen where The Princess of Darkness 
	had made the X with her fingernail.
	
	NURSE crouches down and pulls out a length of medical tape, 
	then hands it to the doctor.  She cuts another piece of
	tape, but the Doctors don't realize this and leave her
	hanging...
			
				DOCTOR #1
			Probably was bruised in the 
			crash.
			
				DOCTOR #2
			You know, you two were very 
			lucky.

				SHIRLEY
			I love you Bob. I really do.  
			Forgive me?

				BOB
			There's nothing to forgive. 
			It was all a dream.

				SHIRLEY
			You love me then?

				BOB
			Of course I do.

	The doctors put Shirley onto a stretcher while the photographer 
	takes more pictures.  They put her into the back of an 
	ambulance.

	Then after the doctor listens to Bob's neck with a stethoscope, 
	Bob just gets up and walks into the back of the ambulance.

				CRISWELL (VO)
			As it is with all the Night 
			People, they are destroyed 
			by the first rays of the sun. 
			But upon the first appearance
			of the deep shadows of the 
			night, and when the moon is 
			full, they will return, to 
			rejoice...in their evil lust, 
			and take back with them any 
			mortal who might happen along.
							CUT TO:

INT. MAUSOLEUM, MORNING.

	Criswell is back in his coffin, sitting upright.
	
				CRISWELL
			Yes, they were lucky, those two 
			young people...May you be so 
			lucky...But do not trust to 
			luck, at the full of the moon, 
			when the night is dark...Make 
			a wide path around the unholy 
			grounds...of the Night People.
			Who can say that we do not
			exist-Can you?
			
			But now, we return to our 
			graves, and you
			  (pointing at audience) 
			may join us soon!
			
	Criswell reclines back into his coffin, crossing his arms, and 
	returning to the slumber of the undead.

                       	    EDWARD D. WOOD, JR.

                     From his novel "Orgy of the Dead"                   







                     Copyright 1965 Astra Productions



















                            "ORGY OF THE DEAD"


FADE IN:

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT.

	CLOSEUP of HEAVY RIVETED IRON DOORS with round handles
	covered by spider webs.

	Two "GIANTS", wearing leopard-skin shorts, iron bicep-bands and
	headbands, pull the heavy iron doors open revealing the
	INTERIOR of the MAUSOLEUM.  There is an ornate stone sarcophagus
	in the center of the room, raised up on an altar.  The back wall
	has a mantle with a bust of the Virgin Mary looking downward at
	the coffin.  There is a round red window in the center of the 
	wall.  A ray of red light shines through the window, 
	illuminating the misty fog hanging in the air.

	The giants walk into the Mausoleum.  They lift the heavy stone
	lid off of the coffin, revealing CRISWELL.  He is lying in the
	coffin on his back, with his arms crossed over his chest and

	We see CRISWELL, Narrator of our tale and SOLE RULER OF THE 
	DARK WORLD, now sitting upright, slouching somewhat in his 
	coffin, glancing offscreen (at his cue card).

	During his monologue, each time Criswell looks up at the camera 
	a DRAMATIC PAUSE is inserted as he then looks back down at the
	cue card and searches for his place in order to continue.


	 			CRISWELL
			I am Criswell!  For years I have

			that some of you may faint.

							FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN.

EXT. HIGHWAY IN WILDERNESS.  "NIGHT"

	A CONVERTIBLE is driving along a DESERT ROAD.  LONG SHOTS of
	the automobile driving are filmed in bright sunlight.  The
	desert hills are clearly visible in the background, with only
	a slight darkening to suggest day-for-night, but the car's
	headlights are on so we clearly understand that it is pitch
	black in the dead of night.
							CUT TO:

	MEDIUM SHOT - BOB AND SHIRLEY IN CAR.  NIGHT

	BOB and SHIRLEY are seated in the CONVERTIBLE, driving through
	the night, on a "date".  They are searching for an ancient
	CEMETERY.  MEDIUM SHOTS have a pitch black background and dark
	shadows across the car.

	Shirley is leaning over in her seat toward Bob, who is
	driving.
	 
	   			SHIRLEY
 		  	We sure picked the wrong night
			to find a cemetery.  Let's turn
			back.
			
				BOB
			No.  It's on a night like this
			when the best ideas come to mind.

	   			SHIRLEY
			But does it have to be in a
			cemetery?

				BOB
			You wouldn't understand.  Seeing
			a cemetery on a night like this
			can stir in the mind the best
			ideas for a good horror story.

	   			SHIRLEY
			But there're so many wonderful
			things to write about, Bob.

				BOB
			Sure there are--and I've tried
			them all.  Plays, love stories,
			westerns, dog stories.  Huh, 
			now there was a good one, that 
			dog story all about--

	   			SHIRLEY
			    (interrupting)
			But horror stories!  Why all the
			time horror stories?

				BOB
			Shirley, I wrote for years 
			without selling a single word.

	Bob lets go of the wheel with his right arm and puts it around 
	Shirley, who leans closer against him.

				BOB
			My monsters have done well for 
			me.  You think I'd give that up 
			just so I could write about 
			trees, or dogs, or daisies?  
			Huhuh--Daisies!  That's it, 
			I'll write about my creatures 
			who are pushing up the daisies.

	Shirley looks up at Bob and smiles.  He tilts his head down and 
	they kiss.
 		   		BOB
			Your puritan upbringing holds
			you back from my monsters, but
			it certainly doesn't hurt your
			art of kissing.
				
				SHIRLEY
			That's life.  My kisses are
			alive.
			
				BOB
			Who's to say my monsters 
			aren't alive?		   			

	LONG SHOT of the car driving down the road

	CUT back to MEDIUM SHOT of Bob and Shirley

				BOB
			All of my books are based on 
			fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps 
			why they're more interesting 
			and sell in the top spots.

				SHIRLEY
			Well, fact or not, I don't 
			see how we're going to find 
			an ancient cemetery in these 
			mountains tonight.  I can't 
			see a thing!  Let's turn back.

				BOB
			There's an old cemetery on
			this road. I've been there 
			before.

	LONG SHOT of car driving up a desert road with a sandy
	mountain in the background.

				SHIRLEY
			I'm getting the jitters!  
			Let's turn back!

				BOB
			   (reluctantly)
			Okay.

	Bob takes his arm from around Shirley and puts it back on the 
	wheel.

				BOB
			Just as soon as I find a 
			place wide enough to turn 
			around.

	CLOSEUP of CAR INTERIOR - DASHBOARD.

	CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley

				SHIRLEY
			Not so fast!

	We hear sounds of tires squealing on the road.

	CLOSEUP of car wheel racing along the road.

	CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley

				SHIRLEY
			    (desperately)
			Not so fast!

	CLOSEUP - CAR PEDALS.  Bob steps hard on the brake,
	then pumps the brake repeatedly.

	CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley.  Shirley screams
	and hides her face with her hands.

	ZOOM IN on a high dirt bank at the roadside, then the screen
	swirls and spins quickly to suggest a dizzying automobile 
	crash.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

	Bob and Shirley are lying on their backs, unconcsious,
	on the ground.  The ground is covered by scattered leaves.  
	Misty fog swirls over them.
				(beat)
	Shirley wakes up and sits upright groggily.  She looks 
	around, then looks down at Bob.  She moves toward him and
	cradles his head in her lap.
							DISSOLVE TO:
	
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Cemetery is filled with fog.  We see a large stone throne
	framed by ornate columns, with an altar beneath it.  There 
	are tombstones in the background, and skulls and bones on 
	the ground.

	CAMERA PANS RIGHT across a small clearing to the MAUSOLEUM.

				CRISWELL (VO)
			It is said on clear nights, 
			beneath	the cold light of the 
			moon, howl the dog and the wolf, 
			and creeping things crawl out
			of the slime.  It is then the 
			ghouls feast in all their
			radiance.

	The Mausoleum doors creak open on their own, and Criswell  
	quickly stalks out across the clearing, hiding his face 
	behind his long black cape which is held up with his bent 
	elbow against his face, in Dracula fashion.

				CRISWELL (VO - Continuing)
			It is on nights like this most
			people prefer to steer clear of,
			uh, Burial Grounds. It is on 
			nights like this, that the 
			creatures are said to appear, 
			and to walk!

							    CUT TO:

	MEDIUM SHOT, CRISWELL CLIMBING ONTO HIS THRONE
	
	Criswell walks up the steps to the altar, across the altar, 
	and then sits down on the stone seat.  He then slowly lowers 
	his cape from his face and regally looks off to the right 
	(at his cue card).	  	 

				CRISWELL
			The day is gone, the night is
			upon us, and the moon, which 
			controls all of the underworld, 
			once again shines...in radiant 
			contentment.
				(beat)
			Come forth, come forth, o
			Princess of Darkness.

	Criswell repeatedly beckons slowly toward himself with his 
	right hand, staring across the clearing at the mausoleum.

	The PRINCESS OF DARKNESS is standing in front of the 
	Mausoleum.  She walks into the clearing with an entrancing 
	demeanor, her arms outstretched straight in front of her.  
	She is wearing a long black low-cut dress with long open 
	sleeves.  The sleeves are lined with red and hang down a
	couple feet from her wrists.  She walks slowly over toward
	Criswell's throne.

	The Princess of Darkness stands beside Criswells throne, 
	crosses her forearms in front of her chest, and bows toward 
	him.  He nods toward her.  She reaches out and places her 
	left hand on Criswell's right hand.
	
				CRISWELL (VO)
			Time seems to stand still.  Not 
			so the ghouls, when a night of 
			Pleasure is at hand!

	Criswell continues to hold the Princess of Darkness's hand, 
	and she looks at him seductively.

				CRISWELL
			If I am not pleased by tonight's
			entertainment, I shall banish 
			their souls to everlasting 
			damnation!

	The Princess of Darkness again crosses her arms in front of 
	her chest and slowly bows to Criswell.

	CUT TO shot of the FULL MOON with dramatic cymbals crashing,
	then back.
	
				CRISWELL
			And who is to be first?

	The Princess of Darkness claps twice, summoning the first of 
	the night's entertainers.  These poor souls must dance for 
	Criswell's approval.  If he is pleased, they can continue to 
	entertain him for centuries, but if not, they will be banished 
	to everlasting damnation by the All-powerful Criswell.

	LONG SHOT OF THE CLEARING.  Huge flames rise from the ground 
	in front of the clearing.  The INDIAN GIRL enters the clearing 
	and begins to Dance.  She is wearing a red Native American-
	style dress and headband.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			One who loved flames.  Her lover
			was killed by flames.  She died 
			in flames.

	The INDIAN GIRL DANCE begins.

	The Indian Girl dances around for awhile, then dances away 
	into the foggy background.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

	Bob slowly wakes up and sits up.  Bob and Shirley look 
	around.

EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

	The Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the 
	mausoleum and begins to speak without moving her lips!  A 
	marvel of filmmaking art.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS 
			    (out of sync with picture)
			One who prowls the lonely streets
			at night in life is bound to prowl 
			them in eternity.

	The STREET WALKER DANCE begins.  The STREET WALKER walks 
	into the clearing wearing a pink dress and purple feather 
	boa, and beckons with her finger as if to say, "Come here, 
	Criswell!"

EXT. WOODS.  NIGHT.

	At the car accident scene with Bob and Shirley, slow jazz 
	music is audible from the nearby festivities in the cemetery. 
	Bob and Shirley are still sitting on the ground, looking 
	toward the source of the music.

				CRISWELL (VO)
			Ahh, the curiousity of youth...
			on the road to ruin!  May it 
			ever be so adventurous!
				
				SHIRLEY
			I'm so frightened.
				
				BOB
			Well we certainly can't stay 
			here. C'mon.	
				
				SHIRLEY
			Where?
				
				BOB
			In there.
				
				SHIRLEY
			It frightens me.
				
				BOB
			Silly, there's nothing in 
			there to be afraid of.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Then..then what's that music?
			
				BOB
			That's what I want to find out.  
			We have to get help.
				
				SHIRLEY
			What help can we possibly find 
			in the cemetery at this time of 
			night?
				
				BOB
			Something's making that music.
			
				SHIRLEY
			I'm not sure I care to find out
			what it is.
				
				BOB
			All right.  Don't worry, I'll
			be right beside you.
				
				SHIRLEY
			What help will that do if 
			something in there isn't dead?
				
				BOB
			Not dead?  In a cemetery?
			
				SHIRLEY
			I can't imagine anything dead 
			playing that music.
				
				BOB
			Well, it's probably just the
			caretaker, and that's exactly 
			who we want to find.  They'll 
			have a telephone.  C'mon.
				
	Bob helps Shirley up from the ground and leads her into the 
	thick bushes.

EXT. CEMETERY, NIGHT

	Criswell nods repeatedly, smiling at the dancer in approval.
	The Street Walker's clothes have suddenly disappeared.

	Bob and Shirley creep beneath the bushes, crouched down low.  
	They reach the edge of the clearing where Criswell and the 
	Princess of Darkness are watching the Street Walker Dance.
	
				SHIRLEY
			Could it be some kind of 
			college initiation?
				
				BOB
			It's an initiation all right, 
			but not of a college as you 
			and I know them.  Nothing 
			alive looks like that!
				
				SHIRLEY
			Can't we get out of here?
				
				BOB
			I'm not sure...
				
				SHIRLEY
			What do you mean?
				
				BOB
			I'm not sure, myself. It's 
			just a feeling I've had 
			since the crash...Like I 
			feel a cold chill all over..
			..Now this!

	The Street Walker dances with a Skeleton that is hanging by 
	the door of the mausoleum.

	The Street Walker dance ends.

				CRISWELL
			I would see for approval, the
			one who in life worshipped 
			gold above all else.

	The Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the
	mausoleum again to start off the next dance.

	The giants walk to the doors, now wearing red and white
	horizontal-striped miniskirts (or ancient egyptian garb?). 
	They pull the iron doors open slowly, and we see the GOLD 
	GIRL DANCER lying on her back on the altar inside.

				SHIRLEY
		       (pointing toward the mausoleum)
			Look!
			
				BOB
			Be careful!--They'll see you.

	The Gold Girl Dancer rises slowly and seductively from the 
	table, then stalkingly dances out into the clearing.  She is 
	wearing a metallic gold tunic-like dress.

	We see a shot of Bob and Shirley watching, and suddenly the 
	Gold Girl's dress has disappeared.

	The Gold Girl Dance continues.

				CRISWELL
			Throw gold at her.
				
	The giants pick up a bucket of gold doubloons and begin 
	slowly sprinkling them over the Gold Girl as she dances. 
	She sits on the ground and reaches for the falling coins.


				CRISWELL
			More gold.
				
	The giants continue dropping gold coins on the Gold Girl.  
	She picks up the gold coins, rubbing them over her body, 
	in ecstasy.

				CRISWELL
			       (excitedly)
			More gold!

	The giants continue, to the delight of Criswell.  The Gold 
	girl tries to scoop all the scattered coins closer to her.
	
				CRISWELL
			      (impatiently)
			More gold!

	The giants continue.  Criswell is thrilled, and begins to 
	LAUGH loudly.
	
				CRISWELL
			    (to the Princess)
			For all eternity, she shall 
			have gold.

	The Princess of Darkness laughs in acknowledgement, then 
	claps her hands twice, commanding the Giants to finish the
	ceremony.
	
	The Giants walk toward the Gold Girl, who is still on the 
	ground playing with the gold coins and rubbing them on her 
	body.  The giants pick up the Gold Girl, who resists, trying 
	to maintain contact with the gold.  She reaches for it as 
	they lift her up.
	
	CLOSEUP of a BUBBLING GIANT CAULDRON full of a substance that 
	is supposed to look like gold.
	
	The Giants dip the Gold Girl feet first into the cauldron,
	submerging her entire body.
	
	A few seconds later, the giants lift the Gold Girl out of the 
	cauldron.  Her body is now entirely gilded, and she is stiff. 
	They lift her onto their shoulders, carrying her like a board, 
	walking in front of Criswell's throne, then back into the 
	mausoleum, laying her body on the altar.
	
	We see Bob and Shirley, looking dismayed.
	
				CRISWELL (VO)
			And both couldn't help but 
			remember a line from one of 
			Bob's stories:  "A sudden wind 
			howls.  The night things are 
			all about me.  Every shadow, a
			beckoning invitation...to 
			disaster.  I know I should 
			think of other things, of 
			pleasant things, but I can't. 
			How can I think of other things, 
			of pleasant things, when I am 
			in a place surrounded by 
			shadows and objects, which can 
			take any shape, here in the 
			darkness...Any shape my mind 
			can conceive."

	Deep in the woods, we see THE WOLF MAN and THE MUMMY, walking 
	quickly.

	Suddenly, Bob and Shirley are grabbed from behind by the WOLF 
	MAN and the MUMMY.  The Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and 
	Shirley over to the clearing near Criswell's throne.
	
	The Princess of Darkness is now seated at Criswell's right 
	side with him on his throne.
	
				CRISWELL
			Bring 'em in!

	The Princess of Darkness stands and walks to the end of the 
	altar below Criswell's throne, then sits on the lower seat at 
	the end of the altar and crosses her legs.

	The Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and Shirley over to the 
	center of the clearing to face Criswell, The Sole Ruler of 
	the Dark World.
	
				CRISWELL
			They are live ones?
				
				THE MUMMY
		    (with audible tape hiss added)
			Yes, Master.
			
				CRISWELL
			Live ones where only the dead 
			should be?
				
				THE MUMMY
			Yes, Master, and we caught 
			them, him and me.
				
	The Mummy motions toward the Wolf Man.

				THE WOLF MAN
			WWWWOOOOOOAAAAAAAUUUUUGGGGHHHHAHAAAA!!!

				CRISWELL
			You shall both be rewarded.
			      (To Princess)
			My Dear Empress of the Night, 
			put these intruders to the 
			test.
	
	Medium Shot of Princess of Darkness.  (Suddenly the Princess 
	of  Darkness is beside the throne again, several feet from the 
	seat at the foot of the altar)
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			But they are not yet one of us.
				
				CRISWELL
			        (happily)
			A situation easily remedied.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			Tie them that they may watch.

	CUT back to long shot of the entire throne and throne altar. 
	The Princess of	Darkness is now seated again at the end of 
	the altar.

	The Wolf Man and The Mummy tie Bob and Shirley to very tall 
	grave stones.
	
	CUT to medium-close shot of Princess of Darkness, whose chest 
	is heaving excitedly as she grips the handle of the long 
	sacrificial dagger tucked into the belt at her waist.
	
				SHIRLEY
			  (desperately, to Criswell)
			Fiend!  Fiend!
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			To love the cat, is to be 
			the cat!
	
	Criswell motions toward The Princess of Darkness, who then 
	walks back up onto the altar and then sits down beside 
	Criswell again.
		
	The CAT GIRL DANCE begins.

	
	
				CRISWELL
			      (jovially)
			A pussycat is born to be 
			whipped.

	The Cat Girl Dance ends.

				CRISWELL
			      (excitedly)
			It will please me very much 
			to see the Slave Girl with 
			her tortures!

	CUT TO interior of the stone mausoleum.  The Ancient Egyptian 
	SLAVE GIRL is chained from her wrists to a high hook on the 
	wall.  One of the "giants" pretends to whip her with a cat 
	o' nine tails.

	CUT back to CRISWELL.

				CRISWELL
			      (excitedly)
			Torture! Torture!  It 
			pleasures me!

	The slave girl pulls with all her might and the chains 
	suddenly pop off the hook.  She then pushes the iron doors 
	open and dances out into the clearing.

	The Slave Dance concludes.

				SHIRLEY
			I'm so frightened.

				BOB
			You've got a right to be.  
			We're trapped by a bunch of 
			fiends.

				SHIRLEY
			Those creatures..!

				BOB
			Don't let them hear you.

				SHIRLEY
			What can we do?

				BOB
			I don't know.  I just don't 
			know. But don't give up.  
			We're not finished yet.

	Shirley closes her eyes and sighs.

				BOB
			Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic 
			won't do us any good!  Let 
			me think. We've got to
			stall for time.

				SHIRLEY
			I'm afraid I'll faint.

				BOB
			Whatever you do, don't do 
			that.

	The Camera zooms back and we see that the Wolf Man and The
	Mummy are hiding behind Bob and Shirley.  The Wolf Man has 
	his hand up to his ear so he can hear what Bob and Shirley 
	are saying.

	The Wolf Man and The Mummy then creep over toward Criswell's 
	throne.

	The Wolf Man whispers into The Princess of Darkness's ear while
	The Mummy and Criswell watch.

	The Princess of Darkness gets up from the throne and walks over 
	to Shirley.  Shirley grimaces.  The Princess of Darkness 
	unbuttons Shirley's blouse, then marks Shirley's abdomen with 
	a red (blood?) cross using her long sharp fingernail.

	Shirley screams.

	The Princess of Darkness pulls her long dagger out of her belt
	and raises it, staring into Shirley's eyes.  Suddenly, Criswell
	yells:

				CRISWELL
			HOLD!

	The Princess of Darkness pauses and looks back at Criswell.

				CRISWELL
			Let her continue to learn.  
			The time is not yet right 
			that they should join with 
			us.

	The Princess of Darkness reluctantly puts her dagger back in 
	her belt and tucks Shirley's blouse back in.

	The Princess of Darkness walks back to Criswell's throne.  
	He pulls a human skull out from behind his seat.

				CRISWELL
			...And what is this?

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			A symbol, Master.

				CRISWELL
			What kind of symbol?

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			She loved the bull ring 
			and the matador.  She 
			danced to their destruction.
			Now she dances to her own 
			destruction.  Her dance is
			of skulls.

	The Princess of Darkness takes the skull from Criswell and 
	throws it dramatically into the clearing.

	The MEXICAN DANCE (SKULL DANCE) ensues.

				CRISWELL
			She came to us on the Day of 
			the Dead.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			El Dia De Los Muertos...A
			celebration in her country.

				CRISWELL				
			Her dance has pleased me.

	The Princess of Darkness snaps her fingers, starting the 
	HAWAIIAN DANCE (SNAKE DANCE).

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			With the loss of her lover, 
			this one cast herself into 
			the Volcano's fire.

	A couple times during the dance, there are abrupt cuts to 
	STOCK FOOTAGE of a rattlesnake in a bright daylight shot in 
	tall dry grass.  (Looks like it was from a documentary)

				CRISWELL
			She was?

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			As I said, a worshipper of 
			snakes, and of smoke, and 
			flames.

				CRISWELL
			Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			It would seem so, Master.

	Hawaiian Dance continues, then cut to The Mummy and The Wolf 
	Man.
	
				THE MUMMY
			I don't like snakes.  I remember 
			the one Cleopatra used.  Cute 
			little rascal until it flicked
			out that red tongue, and those 
			two sharp fangs.  You'd never 
			think such a little thing
			packed such a big wallop.
					
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
					
				THE MUMMY
			Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
			
				THE WOLF MAN
			       (in agreement)
			Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.	

	Hawaiian/Snake Girl continues to dance.
	
				THE MUMMY
			We had lots of snakes in my 
			ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky
			things.
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn.
			AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
				
				THE MUMMY
			When I was alive, they were the
			things nightmares were made of.
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aaarrrgggaahh.
	
	The Hawaiian Dance ends.
				
				CRISWELL
			She pleases me.  Permit her to

				CRISWELL
	(continuing, after finding his place on the next cue card)
			Now, I will talk...to The 
			Wolf Man...and The Mummy.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			As you wish, Master

	The Princess of Darkness motions for The Wolf Man and The Mummy 
	to come.
				
				THE MUMMY	
			He wants us.
			
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
				
				THE MUMMY
			What do you suppose for?
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
				
				THE MUMMY
			Did you do something to get 
			us into trouble again?
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aannnnaahhnn.
			
				THE MUMMY
			Did you howl off-key at 
			the moon again?
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aannnnaahhnn.

				THE MUMMY
			I can't remember doing 
			anything wrong either.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			COME!
				
				THE MUMMY
			We better go before we 
			make him mad.

	The Wolf Man and The Mummy walk over to Criswell's Throne.

				THE MUMMY
			      (apprehensively)
			We are your servants, Master.

	The Wolf Man bows to Criswell.

				CRISWELL
			Of course you are.

	The Wolf Man and the Mummy crouch in fear as they face Criswell.

				THE MUMMY
			Have we in some way made 
			you angry, Master?

				CRISWELL
			You know better than that.

				THE MUMMY
			We don't know of anything, 
			Master...

				CRISWELL
			Then why do you shake so?

				THE MUMMY
			It's not often an Emperor 
			like you calls on creatures 
			like us.

				CRISWELL
			Well rest easy, I'm not 
			angry with either of you.

				THE MUMMY
				(relieved)
			Aaaahhhh.

	The Mummy Sighs in relief and the Wolf Man nods.

				THE MUMMY
			Then it is some service you 
			desire of us.

				CRISWELL
			You are the keepers of the 
			Damned.  You two know them all.  
			And I am tired of this usual 
			type of entertainment.
			I want...a decided change.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The moon!...is soon gone!
			
	The Princess of Darkness points up at the full moon.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			There is little time left for 
			the remainder of the evening's 
			pleasures.
			
	The Princess of Darkness gets up from the seat at the end of 
	the altar and walks around beside Criswell's throne.

				CRISWELL
			Yes, yes yes I know all that.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			At the first sight of the 
			morning sun's rays, we must 
			be gone.

				CRISWELL
			I suppose most of the others 
			will have to wait for their 
			judgement until after the next 
			full moon.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			It would seem so, Master

				CRISWELL
			Ahh, but I declare there is 
			still time for something.

				THE MUMMY
			There are one or two which 
			should complement the night's 
			entertainment, Master

				CRISWELL
			Ahh, good.  Then I will 
			see them.  Dismiss the rest.

				THE MUMMY
			Yes, sir, Master.

	Bob's hands are wiggling, trying to loosen the rope binding 
	his wrists behind his back around the stone column.
	
				BOB
			The ropes are coming loose.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Be careful!
				
				BOB
			I am--It's our only chance.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Nothing is worth your life.
				
				BOB
			My guess is if we don't 
			take the chance pretty soon,
			we're not going to have much
			life left anyway.
				
				SHIRLEY
			I'm frightened.  I'm so 
			frightened.
				
				BOB
			Hold on just a little 
			longer, Shirley.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Be careful, oh please be 
			careful.  We'll never get 
			out of here alive, I know 
			it.  I just feel it.
				
				BOB
			You do?
				
				SHIRLEY
			Yes I feel it in my bones.
			
				BOB
			You're talking nonsense.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Oh, no I'm not.  These 
			heathens probably have 
			an open grave for us.
			
				BOB
			They wouldn't dare put 
			us in the same grave--
			or would they?
			
				SHIRLEY
			I should hope not.  I 
			hate you!
			
				BOB
			That sudden?
				
				SHIRLEY
			Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't
			for you we wouldn't be hunting 
			for an old cemetery on a 
			night like this.  It's all
			your fault.
			
				BOB
			     (dejected)
			...And I thought you loved me.
			
				
	The Princess of Darkness is leaning over, covering her mouth 
	and whispering into Criswell's ear, looking over her hand back 
	at Shirley.
				
				CRISWELL
			Not yet.  I perhaps have other 
			plans for such a pretty one.  
			No matter, I will tell you when 
			and if you may have her.

	The Princess of Darkness crosses her forearms and bows to 
	Criswell.
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The Wolf Man informs me that 
			the next one is the woman who 
			murdered her husband on their 
			wedding night.  Now she dances
			with his skeleton.
			
	The SKELETON DANCE begins.

	The SKELETON DANCE GIRL, wearing a white dress and long 
	wedding veil, comes into the clearing with a skeleton.  She 
	dances with the skeleton, then dances in the clearing for 
	Criswell.

	The Skeleton Dance concludes.
				
				CRISWELL
			      (to Shirley)
			Have you not enjoyed the 
			evening's festivities?
				
	Shirley is silent and looks downward.
	
				CRISWELL
			Ahh, that will soon change 
			when you become one of us!

	The Wolf Man leans back and howls.  (He tilts his head back so
	far his fake rubber wolfman mask comes up and you can see his 
	skin at the bottom of his neck)
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			WWAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAHHGGGGHHHAAAA-
			AAAAAAAAAHHGGGGGHHHHHHHhhhhhh!
				
				CRISWELL
			It would seem that The 
			Wolf Man would have you 
			for his own!
			
				SHIRLEY
			AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
			
				CRISWELL
			I have promised both The 
			Wolf Man and The Mummy a 
			reward.  It could be that
			you are that reward.
			
				SHIRLEY
			AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
			
				CRISWELL
			You need not worry...Not just 
			now, anyway.
				
				BOB
			Leave her alone, you fiend!
			
				CRISWELL
			Fiend is it!  You will not 
			be so fortunate.  Your 
			existence will cease within 
			moments.  No one wishes to 
			see a man dance...
			   (looking at Shirley)
			And you, my dear, will entertain 
			for centuries to come.
			
				BOB
			If I could get my hands on 
			you...
			
				CRISWELL
			..Oh, You could do nothing!
			    (to Shirley)
			I can save you much pain.
			
				BOB
			Leave her alone, I tell you!
			
				CRISWELL
			    (to Shirley)
			I do not joke in my proposal.
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			She is to be mine!  It is so
			spoken!
			
				CRISWELL
			The Princess of Darkness would 
			have you for her own to join us 
			through extreme pain.
			      (beat)
			Yet I am inclined for one as 
			lovely as you, to be more lenient. 
			I have but to touch you with my 
			finger, and it would mean the end 
			of you, all over, quickly and 
			painlessly...
			
				SHIRLEY
			No. No! No!
			
				CRISWELL
			I repulse you?  Very well.  It
			seems you have chosen your own 
			fate. Live with it!  I should 
			say die with it!

	Bob looks down somberly, then looks over at Shirley.

				BOB
			I've got the ropes loose now.  
			I've got my hands free.  Be 
			careful--Don't change your 
			expression too much.  They 
			must not catch on.
				
				SHIRLEY
			What can we do against them?
			
				BOB
			I don't know, yet.  We'll 
			just have to watch our chance.  
			When it comes I'll know what 
			to do--I hope I'll know what
			to do.
				
				SHIRLEY
			I still don't know what ever
			made me go steady with a 
			crackpot writer like you.
				
				BOB
			All right.  Put it on heavy.
			
				SHIRLEY
			My old boyfriend Tommy would 
			never have gotten me in a 
			mess like this.  At least he's 
			got brains.
			
				BOB
			Him!  I'll bet he sleeps 
			with all the lights on.

				SHIRLEY
			Maybe so.

	CUT TO shot of The Mummy talking to The Wolf Man

				THE MUMMY
			I could make her another 
			Cleopatra...

				THE WOLF MAN
			Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!

				THE MUMMY
			Without the snake, of 
			course.		

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(impatiently)
			Well?

				CRISWELL
			Ahh, she will be yours.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(impatiently)
			When!?
	
				CRISWELL
			At your discretion...But 
			first, I desire more 
			entertainment.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The moon is almost gone!
			
				CRISWELL
			Ahh, there is yet time.
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			At the first sight of the 
			morning's rays' light...
				
				CRISWELL
			   (getting annoyed)
			I know the laws of the night.  
			I state there is still time 
			for yet another.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(forcefully)
			I would have time for my 
			own pleasures!
			
				CRISWELL
				(angrily)
			Your own pleasure comes only 
			after mine, when I desire it.  
			I am the Sole Ruler of the 
			Dark World.  There is no one 
			to challenge my authority here.  
			My word is the law--all powerful.  
			No one is to challenge that 
			authority, no one!.  Is that 
			understood?  It is my command.
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			I understand, Master
			
				CRISWELL
			Then see that it does not 
			happen again, in the penalty of 
			Everlasting Despair.  Now are 
			there others?
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			There are others.
				
				CRISWELL
			Well then let us proceed.
				
	The Princess of Darkness snaps her fingers three times, 
	summoning the Zombie Dance Girl.
	
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			She lived as a zombie in life, 
			so she will remain forever a 
			zombie in death.

	The ZOMBIE DANCE GIRL dances.
			
				BOB
			Easy, Shirley.  Easy!

	The Zombie Dance concludes.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The moon sinks lower into the 
			hills!  We must hurry to the 
			finish.
			
				CRISWELL
			I will decide the conclusion.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(impatiently)
			You had the mummy cancel all 
			the others scheduled for this 
			session.
				
				CRISWELL
				(interrupting)
			Then cancel my order.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The moon is almost gone!
			
				CRISWELL
			There is yet time.  Don't 
			you want your own pleasure?
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			Oh, if there is only time!
				
				CRISWELL
			Hahh, there is always time...
			All in good time...there is 
			always time.  You shall 
			have your pleasure.  THAT...
			I decree
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(looking at Shirley)
			All others were but infinitessimal 
			bits of fluff, compared to her
				(toward the Dancer)
			This one would have died for
			feathers, furs, and fluff...and 
			so she did!

	The FLUFF DANCE Girl dances for approval.
	
	The Fluff Dance ends.
	
	Criswell looks over at the Princess of Darkness.
				CRISWELL
			The time...is short.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			For what!?!
				
				CRISWELL
			Your pleasures of course!
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			You mean...!
				
				CRISWELL
			You may take her now.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			Is there time?
				
				CRISWELL
			You better hope there is.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			Thank you, Master!  Thank 
			you.
				
				CRISWELL
			Now hurry, hurry.  I will 
			watch!  Your desires may be 
			my pleasure also...Our fitting 
			climax to an evening's enter-
			tainment.  You must...hurry 
			now.
			
	The Princess of Darkness begins ceremoniously dancing with 
	her long sacrificial dagger, slowly moving toward shirley, 
	gazing back at Criswell seductively.  She finally gets to 
	Shirley and cuts the button off of Shirley's shirt, which 
	was so tight it was about to burst open anyway.  She unsnaps 
	the front of Shirley's bra.
	
	Bob sees his chance and makes his attempt at a "move," merely
	stepping forward.  He is instantly hammer-fisted on the back 
	of the neck by The Wolf Man, and falls down unconscious.
	
	The Princess of Darkness raises her long dagger high above 
	Shirley's head.  But suddenly, the sun rises (it is already 
	high overhead), and the night creatures lose their power.  The 
	Princess of Darkness clings to Shirley's arm, as she slowly 
	sinks down to the ground, losing all strength.
	
	The Camera pans around, showing Shirley and Bob's faces, then 
	back to the ghouls, all of whom have turned to steaming 
	skeletons.  Only their clothing and bones remain.
	
	Quick Zoom in on Criswell's throne.  Criswell's steaming 
	skeleton still sits, surveying the cemetery, wearing his cape.

							FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN.

EXT. WOODS - MORNING

	At the clearing in the woods near the car wreck, Bob and 
	Shirley are lying on their backs on the ground, just as they 
	were after the crash, before they got up to investigate the 
	strange music that led them to the ghouls.

	There are two DOCTORS examining Bob and Shirley.

	In the foreground, we see a REPORTER's shoulder and hands.  
	He is writing down details of the accident in a small paper 
	pad.

				DOCTOR #1
			Easy, Miss, everything's 
			gonna be alright.

				SHIRLEY
			Bob?  Bob?

				DOCTOR #1
			He's right here beside you. 
			He'll be alright too.

	The reporter walks around and crouches beside Shirley and 
	DOCTOR #1, and continues writing in his pad.

	A Newspaper PHOTOGRAPHER crouches in the foreground to get a 
	shot of the accident scene and victims.

				SHIRLEY
			Where are they, where did 
			they go? They tried to kill 
			me.

				DOCTOR #2
			What's this you say?  Who 
			was going to kill you?

				SHIRLEY
			The ghouls--they all turned 
			into skeletons.
			
				DOCTOR #2
			Take it easy, Miss.
			
				DOCTOR #1
			What she needs is a good
			rest.

				SHIRLEY
			It's true, I tell you, it's 
			true!  They all turned into 
			skeletons.  She-she cut me 
			here.
	
	Shirley points to her abdomen where The Princess of Darkness 
	had made the X with her fingernail.
	
	NURSE crouches down and pulls out a length of medical tape, 
	then hands it to the doctor.  She cuts another piece of
	tape, but the Doctors don't realize this and leave her
	hanging...
			
				DOCTOR #1
			Probably was bruised in the 
			crash.
			
				DOCTOR #2
			You know, you two were very 
			lucky.

				SHIRLEY
			I love you Bob. I really do.  
			Forgive me?

				BOB
			There's nothing to forgive. 
			It was all a dream.

				SHIRLEY
			You love me then?

				BOB
			Of course I do.

	The doctors put Shirley onto a stretcher while the photographer 
	takes more pictures.  They put her into the back of an 
	ambulance.

	Then after the doctor listens to Bob's neck with a stethoscope, 
	Bob just gets up and walks into the back of the ambulance.

				CRISWELL (VO)
			As it is with all the Night 
			People, they are destroyed 
			by the first rays of the sun. 
			But upon the first appearance
			of the deep shadows of the 
			night, and when the moon is 
			full, they will return, to 
			rejoice...in their evil lust, 
			and take back with them any 
			mortal who might happen along.
							CUT TO:

INT. MAUSOLEUM, MORNING.

	Criswell is back in his coffin, sitting upright.
	
				CRISWELL
			Yes, they were lucky, those two 
			young people...May you be so 
			lucky...But do not trust to 
			luck, at the full of the moon, 
			when the night is dark...Make 
			a wide path around the unholy 
			grounds...of the Night People.
			Who can say that we do not
			exist-Can you?
			
			But now, we return to our 
			graves, and you
			  (pointing at audience) 
			may join us soon!
			
	Criswell reclines back into his coffin, crossing his arms, and 
	returning to the slumber of the undead.

                                                         February 5, 2007   
          

          FADE IN:
          CLOSE -- KATE COLEMAN (MID 30S )
          She's a simple beauty and very pregnant, propped up in a bed,
          wearing a hospital gown. A heart rate monitor BEEPS. She touches
          her swollen belly, flush with excitement, her eyes full of wonder.

          MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Okayp, just relax.now. This'll be over
          Caitti before you know it.
          Kate looks up. Her smile falters-as we REVEAL:

          INT. DELIVERY ROOM - NIGHT

          Harsh lights overhead. -THUNDER rumbles outside. Kate's on a.
          delivery table, legs already in the stirrups. A sheet hangs-  
          across her belly so we can't see what's going on below her waist.
          A DOCTOR and NURSE snap pn gloves, prepare instruments: SHARP
          BLADES and CURETTES, NEEDLES and FORCEPS. Kate is stricken. She
          tries to sit up.

          KATE
          Wait, I've changed my mind. I don't
          want to do this anymore.
          The Doctor gives the Nurse an exasperated look. The Nurse takes
          Rate's hand, eases her back onto the table.

          NURSE
          Your baby is dead. There's nothing.
          else we can do.
          Kate reels, her world turned upside-dowp. Emotional free-fall.

          KATE
          No, this isn't what's supposed to
          happen. My baby's alive!

          NURSE
          We're so sorry. A terrible loss, we're
          so sorry...

          KATE
          But it's still alive! It's moving!
          Feel it, you can feel it!
          Kate tries to put the Nurse's hand on her.belly but the-Nurse-
          pulls away and hands the Doctor a pair of gleaming.blunt-tipped
          SURGICAL SCISSORS. The Doctor leans between Rate's spread legs,
          disappearing behind the curtain. Rate gasps.

          RATE
          No, stop! I want to be asleep! 
          

          

          2.

          -DOCTOR-
          TOO late for anesthesia.'' The baby's
          coming. You're.going to experience
          some pressure now... -
          Kate winces and bites her lip as the Doctor goes about his unseen
          work. A GOOD-LOOKING MAN in surgical scrubs stands behind him..
          Bizarrely, he's videotaping-the whole thing. He's Kate's husband,
          JOHN (late 30's). He smiles at her from behind -the camera.

          JOHN
          It's okay, honeys You're doing great!
          The Doctor hands the scissors, now slick with gore, to the Nurse.
          H e takes a SUCTION. CATHETER and disappears behind-the curtain
          again. The Nurse - presses a button on a vacuum pump and the
          machine begins to HUM. Kate tightly closes her eyes.

          KATE
          This isn't happening. Wake up, wake
          up, wake up...
          Suddenly -- the thin wail of a BABY CRYING. Rate's eyes go wide
          w ith horror as the smiling Nurse approaches with a wriggling
          bundle wrapped in a blanket. Blood seeps through the pink fabric.
          W e can't see what's inside, but it's moving. And it's CRYING.

          NURSE
          Congratulations, Mrs. Coleman. It's a
          girl .
          The Nurse offers her the bloody, blanketed bundle. Kate screams -

          INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          -- then snaps awake. She's been having a nightmare. John lies
          n ext to her in bed. Be stirs, but doesn't wake. Kate slips out
          of bed and quickly pads to the bathroom;

          INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Kate closes the door. We now see that she's not pregnant in
          reality, only in her nightmare. She slides to the cold floor in
          t he dark, a hand on her flat belly as she starts to cry...

          INT. DOCTOR BROWNING'S OFFICE - DAY

          Water TRICKLES in a little Zen fountain. Kate sits across from
          -DR. -BROWNING, a mousy-haired woman in her 50's.

          DR. BROWNING
          A lot of women experience difficulties
          around the anniversary of the
          miscarriage or the baby's expected due
          date. It's perfectly normal.

          

          

          

          

          3.

          KATE
          I was thinking of" going back to work.
          I really thought 1 was doing better.

          DR. BROWNING
          You are. Think about where you were
          just four months ago. -
          (off Kate's look)
          Are you still sober?
          Kate hesitates. Dr. Browning gives her a penetrating look.

          KATE
          I drove by the wine shop,on my.way.bome
          the other day.

          DR. BROWNING
          Did you stop?

          KATE
          I really wanted to. The thought went
          through m' head, you know. it wasn't
          for me, it just might be nice to have a
          bottle handy in case we had guests.

          DR. BROWNING.
          But you didn't go in?

          KATE
          No.

          DR. BROWNING
          That's all that matters. Let's try to
          stay focused on the. positive. Grief is
          different for everyone. You have to

          we still miss our baby. If this just
          happened to you, I'm sorry you got an

          KATE
          How can I? I saw a pregnant woman
          today on the way home and I almost lost
          it. Just burst into tears with Max
          sitting right there. Daniel barely
          talks to me. You and I haven't had sex
          in over a year now. What if I.never

          children we already have.

          JOHN
          That's not true. The kids understand.
          They just know you're not happy.

          KATE  
          But I should be.

          JOHN -
          Do you want another child?

          -for? Let's do it.

          KATE
          You-don't just adopt a child because
          you're lonely and depressed.

          JOHN
          That's not why we'd be doing..it. We
          wanted a child a year ago and we still
          want one, now..

          KATE
          We can't replace our baby.

          JOHN
          No, 'we can't. But we can take the'
          place we made for her in our hearts and
          our home and give it to a child who
          needs a family.

          good at it and'it makes. us happy. What

          platinum blonde hair spilling to her shoulders. She sits at an
          easel, all alone, painting another extraordinary picture.
          John watches, curious. Suddenly; she senses his presence. She-
          stops humming, the paintbrush freezes mid-stroke. She turns.
          She looks about eight years old, with pale skin and-bright, doe-
          like eyes, her delicate features framed by Shirley Temple curls.
          It's the face- of a porcelain angel, a perfect little laving doll,

          around her neck and one around each wrist. Her'name is ESTHER.

          were so scared because they didn't'have
          a mother or father. But just when they

          found their mother sleeping under this
          tree. And they felt so safe that they
          fell asleep too. Now when-the mother
          lion wakes up, her dream will have come

           Y've just had lots of time to practice,
          I guess. It's so boring here.

          JOAN
          You don't play outside with the other
          girls? Sounds like they're having fun.

          

          

          

          

          13.

          ESTHER
          I like staying inside. That way I
          don't get my clothes dirty.

          JOHN
          (amused) -
          Well, that's very responsible of you,
          but I'll- bet the sisters could find
          something else for you. to wear.

          ESTEER
          You.don't like my dress? - Don't you
          think it's pretty? -

          JOHN
          Your dress is. very pretty. I'm ,just
          saying. you could -probably go outside if
          you really wanted to.

          - ESTHER
          (a beat, hesitant)
          I don't like laying with the other
          .girls. I'm different from everyone.

          JOHN
          There's nothing wrong with different.

          ESTHER
          Yes, there is. Everybody says there's
          not, but it isn't true. I don't care.
          If I'm sad or lonely, I just come in
          here a nd paint a story with a happy
          endingg And when people say they like.
          my paintings, it makes me feel better.
          (off his look)
          I think.peo le should always try to
          take the bad things that happen to them
          and turn them into something good.
          Don't you?
          John is taken aback. Who j t1m1s )dc? Before he can respond:

          .- RATE (O.S.)
          There you are.
          Rate and Sister Abigail stand in the doorway. John waves for Kate
          to enter and Esther sits up eagerly when she does. Abigail's
          expression darkens when she sees who John has been talking to.

          JOHN
          Hey, I'd like you to meet someone. -
          (to Esther).
          Esther, this is my wife, Kate.
          Kate smiles and offers her hand, but instead of shaking it, Esther
          lovingly presses it to her cheek.

          

          

          

          

          14. -

          ESTIIR -
          Motta...
          Kate'and John exchange a beumsed look'.

          JOHN
          She painted these all by herself.

          ' RATE
          Wow, you're quite the little-artist.

          ESTHE'R
          Thank you. You smell nice.
          Kate laughs. Sister Abigail shifts uncomfortably.

          ESTHER
          Would you like me to paint you a
          picture? You can watch me if-you want.
          I'm normally a little shy, but --

          SISTER ABIGAIL'
          Esther, I'm sorry, they don't have time
          for you to paint them a picture.
          (off Esther's look)
          They have to come with me now.
          Yolanda's going home with them
          tomorrow. isn't that wonderful?
          Esther wilts. She releases Rate's hand and musters a weak smile.

          ESTHER
          Yes. I'm sure she'll be very happy.

          KATE
          It was nice meeting you.

          ESTHER -
          The pleasure was mine.

          JOHN
          (to Sister Abigail)
          You've got a real talent on your hands
          here.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          Yes, we're very lucky to have her.
          But there's something -strange-in Abigail's voice -- she definitely
          doesn't un -lucky. Esther watches them go.

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - ENTRY - DAY

          Sister Abigail walks Kate and John to the front door.

          

          

          

          

          I5.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          The notary will be here at.ten for-you-
          to sign the placement agreement.

          KATE
          Thank you so much for all your help.
          Kate gives her a warm hug. But mid-embrace, she notices
          something: Esther is at the end of the hallway, peering at them
          from around a corner. Abigail and John see--her,' too.

          KATE
          What did she say to me.back there? It
          sounded like... "motta?"

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          It's Russian. It means "mother."
          INT.JoHN'S CAR - NIGHT
          John whistles "Whatever Will Be, Will Be" to himself as he drives.
          Kate gives him an amused look, then Jokingly sings along:

          KATE -
          When you were juuust a liuittle

          JOHN
          Sorry, I've got that stuck in my head
          now.

          KATE
          She. made quite an impression on.you.

          JOHN
          I wish you co'uld've heard the things.
          she was saying before you c&me in. I
          Jatow adults who aren't that mature.

          (BEAT)
          I wonder' why they didn't show us her
          case file.

          KATE
          She probably wasn't there when we were
          first ,looking.

          JOHN
          It just blows may mind, a kid could go
          through as much-as she must have and
          still turn out like that.

          KATE
          You sound like you're sorry we're not
          adopting her instead of Yolanda.

          

          

          

          

          16.

          JOHN
          No, of course not. I just hope she.
          gets the right break.
          (off her look)
          I wouldn't trade our littl'e' girl for
          the world. You )maw that.
          Rate gives him an adoring look and squeezes his hand.

          EXT. HOME FOR GIRLS - ESTABLISHING - MORNING .

          The sun is just rising,.warming the sky with an idyllic light.

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - DORMITORY.- MORNING

          The GIRLS (5-7) are busily getting dressed and making their beds.
          The HOUSEMOTHER inspects each of-them in turn. One bed remains
          unmade, its occupant missing. The Housemother turns to the room,
          ready to give a scolding, but can't find who she's looking for:

          HOUSEMOTHER
          Where's Yolanda?

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - WASHROOM - MORNING

          The OLDER GIRLS (8-12) are-brushing their teeth and washing up.
          The Housemother enters and looks around.

          HOUSEMOTHER
          Have any of you seen-Yolanda?
          Nobody has.

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS -- VARIOUS - MORNING

          Sister Abigail leads the NUNS and LAY ASSISTANTS in a search of
          the home, looking for Yolanda. The playroom, art room, chapel,
          classrooms, laundry room, rest rooms.-- they're all empty.

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - BASEMENT - MORNING

          A young-nun, SISTER JUDITH, walks downstairs into -a dark storage-
          area. Lots of hiding places. -

          SISTER JUDITH
          Yolanda? Are you hiding-down here?
          Then she notices a closet behind her. The door. is ajar. She
          reaches out, opens it... and nearly gags at what she sees inside.

          LOW ANGIL - INSIDE THE CLOSET
           A child's bare feet dangle in mi , , a .,im3. The "Travel Turtle" is on
          the floor beneath them. - A chair lies on its side nearby.

          

          

          

          

          17.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING -

          Kate dries her' hair in the bathroom. The PHONE RINGS O.S. She
          pauses, suddenly concerned for some reason. She opens the door.
          As John reaches for-the phone, CAMERA MOVES IN on Kate. She
          watches from the doorway, her  face already registering dread. She
          knows. Even before he answers the phone, somehow she knows.

          JOHN (0,S-)
          Bello?

          EXT. HOTEL ROOM BALCONY - DAY

          The sky has turned gray. Kate stares out at the hotel parking-
          lot, smoking a cigarette.  - Her eyes are red;- but she's long since
          cried-herself out. John stands by the open-sliding glass door.

          JOHN
          .The birth family is claiming her body.
          They're planning a private service.
          He looks to Kate for a reaction, but she has none. He continues:

          JOHN
          Sister Abigail thinks she might have
          been playing something called "The
          Choking Game." It's a kind of
          schoolyard dare. You try to get a rush
          by having someone choke you until you
          almost pass out. There have been cases
          where kids have tried it alone and
          accidentally hanged themselves.
          A beat. Kate's voice is distant, as;

          KATE
          So that's it? She just vanishes from
          our lives?

          JOHN
          We can have our awn-service. I think
          .it's important that we -

          KATE
          I've been' in grief counseling for
          almost a year-and-a-half.. If you say
          the word "closure,." I'm going to-claw
          your eyes out.
          She's not angry, just matter-of-fact. Be wants to say something,
          but holds his tongue. Silence hangs heavy between them.

          KATE
          Maybe we're not supposed.to do this.

          

          

          

          

          18.

          - JOHN..
          No. Don't say that. -

          RATE- -
          we -try to .have a baby and I have a
          'third-trimester miscarriage that leaves.
          me sterile. 'We try to adopt and she
          dies the night before we bring her
          home. That doesn't sound like'
          somebody's trying to tell us. something?

          JOHN   -
          Yolanda didn' t the to.teach us a
          lesson.. We didn't make this-happen.

          KATE '
          It doesn't make.anndifference. I
          can't go through this again.

          JOHN
          so let's not. Let's adopt.Bather.
          This brings Kate back to reality. She eyes him coolly.

          KATE
          Her body's barely cold and you're
          already thinking about replacing her?

          JOHN .
          We can't replace Yolanda any more than
          We can replace Jessie. But we can't
          help her anymore, either. Esther is
          alive and needs a family. Right now.

          KATE
          We have to at least wait until.--

          JOHN
          -Until what? I don't want to waste
          .a nother year of our lives wishing for
          something that we.can't-have.
          (beat).
          I want us to feel like a family again.
          Kate regards him for a beat, conflicted. Then:

          KATE
          Let's see what Sister Abigail thinks.

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - SISTER ABIGAIL'S OFFICE - DAY -

          Sister Abigail hands Rate and John a folder with a Polaroid of
          Esther stapled to it. Her- case file.

          

          

          

          

          19.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          For the most -part, she's an'ideal
          child. She's originally from Russia,
          but her English is flawless, Smart as
          a.tvhip and very mature Â°for her age. I
          don't think I've-ever had to tell her
          .anything-twice and I've never had to
          clean-up after her.. She's a bit of a-
          nQat-freak.

          JOHN
          I think we can handle that.

          SISTER.ABIGAIL
          She's also fiercely independent.,
          Whatever the other-children want to do,
          she wants to.dc the opposite.

          JOHN
          She told me they make fun of her.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          I'm sure they do, but she doesn't make-
          things any easier on herself. She just
          doesn't seem interested in friends..
          She doesn't even play like a normal
          child. She just reads and paints.
          Most of the time she barely-speaks.

            KATE  
          Why do'you think that is?

          SISTER ABIGAIL .
          Well, like most of the girls here,
          there's been no shortage of hardship in
          her life.- She's been orphaned twice--
          her birthmother died of AIDS, then the
          American family who adopted her was-
          killed in.a house fire. And I strongly
          suspect that she's been sexually abused
          as well.

          KATE
          By who?

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          I don't know. There's nothing in her
          -history, but that doesn't necessarily
          mean anything. Russian adoption -
          records. are notoriously unreliable.

          JOHN
          Then what are you basing this on?
          Sister Abigail hesitates. Deciding how much to say.

          

          

          

          

          20.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          I wish I knew. There's just something
          missing with her. A-spark you see in a
          child's eyes that isn't there. I've
          only seen that-before in cases where
          the child had been severely
          traumatized. It might also explain -
          some of her idiosyncratic behaviors.

          JOHN
          Like what?

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          She refuses to shower or change clothes
          with the other girls.' She won't even
          allow the housemother in-the bathroom
          with her. She.'.s also very concerned
          with her physical appearance for her
          age. She's like a teenager getting
          ready for a date every morning. She
          insists on wearing dresses-every day.
          The ribbons around her wrists and neck
          stay on day and night. . The only
          trouble we ever had with her was when
          we tried to take them off. She kicked
          two of Sister Francis' teeth-out.
          Kate and Tohn are taken. aback. Abigail sighs.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          I'm sorry. I'm 'not trying to
          discourage you. If you're serious,
          I'll do everything I can to-expedite
          the process, given the circumstances.

          (BEAT)
          My one reservation is..this. When-an
          adoption fails, it's usually because
          the parents didn't know what to expect.
          -And'in this case, I can't' tell you what
          to expect because the plain fact of the-
          matter is that-I don't knaw.

          INT: HOME FOR GIRLS - CHAPEL DAY
          Esther is happily-helping a NUN clean the sanctuary. Kate and
          John sit in a pew near the back of the empty chapel.

          KATE
          She really did open up with us, didn't
          she?

          JOHN
          She latched. right onto you. We're
          probably the best chance she has at a.
          normal life.
          Esther looks up from her work and waves at them. They wave back.

          

          

          

          

          21.

          KATE
          A normal life..' That sounds really
          good,',doesn't it? -
          She smiles. and takes John- .'s hand.

          CAXERA FOLLOWS Esther's feet, saddle shoes CLICKING on -the walk.
          Kate walks beside her, holding her hand. In Esther's free hand,
          she clutches a DOG-EARED BIBLE held together with a rubber band.
          Activity on the playground stops as the girls watch Esther leave.
          None of them look sorry to see her go. She ignores them.
          John puts.Esther's things ---- a small suitcase and her-paintings
          in the trunk of the car.. Sister-Abigail sees them off.-

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          If you ever need anything, please don't
          hesitate to call.
          Before Kate. can respond, Esther tugs on her arm.

          smile fades. She seems'vaguely troubled as they drive away...

          INT./EXT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY

          Headed for home. Kate is showing Esther some SIGN LANGUAGE.
          Esther makes the sign for each letter as she says it aloud:

          ESTHER

          E-S-T-

          KATE
          Put your thumb here.
          She makes the sign for 'T." Esther. sees her mistake, corrects it.

          Esther smiles and practices=it a few times.- Outside, the LEAVES
          have turned color. Esther gazes out in-wonder. -

          ESTHER
          It's so beautiful, motta.

          KATE
          Sweetie, here we say "Mont" or. "mommy."

          ESTHER
          Kate and John exchange-a warm look.

          EXT. PRIVATE ROAD - DAY

          John's car turns at a GATE and drives down the road leading-to
          their private community. The secluded road winds through the
          forest and crosses the little BROOK we saw earlier.

          EXT. NEIGHBORBOOD' - DAY

          The Coleman's neighborhood 3.s surrounded by forest,-an upscale
          community of big houses and manicured lawns. A POSTMAN delivers
          the mail. A HISPANIC NANNY pushes a BABY in a stroller.
          GARDENERS tend someone's flowers. Esther
          -soaks it all in.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - DAY

          They pull into the driveway and get out. Esther's mouth
          practically hangs open at the sight of their beautiful house.
          The front door opens and Max runs out to meet them. Daniel
          appears in the doorway-with DORIS COLEMAN (arid-60's), their
          grandmother. Daniel stands aghast at the sight of the strange,
          pale girl with the Goldilocks curls and frilly white dress.

          DANIEL

          (SOFTLY)
          -Holy shit:..
          Max. runs straight into Kate's arms and gets a big hug.

          KATE
          Oh, we missed you so muchll
          Kate gives Max a kiss, then turns to Esther: Max hangs back, a
          little shy. Esther signs' to Max without speaking: -

          ESTHER

          HELLO, MAX. MY NAME IS ESTHER.
          Max gives Kate an excited smile.

          KATE
          She's been practicing the whole way.

          

          

          

          

          23.
          Kate takes the girls' hands and they all walk up'to the house.
          Esther notices Man's hearing aid.

          EST-HER -
          What's that?

          KATE .
          That's a hearing aid. It helps her
          hear.a little so she can read lips.
          John gives Doris a Use on the cheek.

          JOHN
          Hi, Mont. Thanks for watching them.
          (to Esther)
          Esther, this is Grandma Doris.

          Esther surprises everyone by giving her a perfect ltttle rtse
          Daniel fails to suppress a laugh. Kate silences him with a look.

          DORIS
          How precious! It's a pleasure-to meet
          you, too.

          JUN

          And this is our son, Daniel.
          Esther smiles and puts out her hand. Daniel grudgingly takes it.

          ESTHER
          Hello, Daniel.

          DANIEL
          Hey.

          INT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - VARIOUS - DAY

          Esther walks from room to room, in awe of her luxurious new home.
          Kate and the rest of the family follow her.

          ESTHER
          Everything's so bigi
          As Esther moves on to the next room, Daniel hangs back and
          whispers to John, too loud:

          DANIEL
          Why is she dressed like that?

          JOHN
          Don't be rude.

          

          

          

          

          24.
          Esther overhears them, but pretends she didn't. Kate sees this-
          and tries to distract her. -

          KATE
          Would you like to see-your room?
          Esther smiles and nods eagerly. But on the way up the stairs, she
          eyes Daniel furtively, sizing him up...

          INT. ESTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Kate pushes the door open and Esther enters. We recognize the
          room by the arched windows -- this used to be the-nursery.- It's
          been completely made over as a little girl's room, complete with a
          lacy white canopy bed covered with a mountain of STUFFED ANIMALS..
          Esther turns to Kate and John with a toothpaste-commercial smile.

          ESTHER
          It's perfect.

          INT. ESTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          KATE
          I love you, too, sweetie.
          She kisses Esther on the forehead. John leans in for a kiss and
          Esther,hugs -him tight. Then he and Kate turn out the light and
          close the door. Esther watches them go...-

          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Kate and John walk to their room, arms lovingly around each other.
          They close their door, leaving the hallway empty and dark. Then:
          CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES back down the hall toward.the closed door of
          Esther's_room, PUSHING IN'on the doorknob, lingering there fora
          long beat... Then we hear the lock CLICK shut.

          INT. ESTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Kate and Esther are decorating. Esther pins up some of her  
          paintings. Kate spreads out a selection of wallpaper borders.

          KATE
          Okay, which one do you like?

          ESTHER
          These are for a'younger child. Did you
          pick them out for Yolanda?
          Kate is taken aback. She stammers for a beat.

          KATE
          I'm sorry. I'll take them back and
          pick some just for you.

          ESTHER
          It's all right. I rather like this
          one.
          Esther points out her.favorite and goes back to pinning up her
          paintings. Kate sighs. As she rolls up the samples, she notices
          the same Gothic mansion in several of Esther's older paintings.

          KATE
          '1s that a real place?

          ESTHER
          No. I just made it up. It's a haunted
          castle where a beautiful- princess was
          locked away. She waited so long and
          was so sad that she filled the moat
          with her tears, but then a handsome
          prince swam ,across it and rescued her.

          (SMILES)
          I like happy ending's. Don't you?

          INS'. SHOPPING MALL - DAY
          Sliding doors open. Rate and the girls enter. Esther looks
          around, dazzled by three stories of glass-ceilinged extravagance.
          It's totally alien to her. -

          KATE
          These are cute.

          ESTHER
          -Jeans are ugly.

          KATE
          But sweetie, you have to have something
          you can play outside in.

          ESTHER
          That doesn't mean I have to look like a
          boy.

          INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

          Kate leads the girls through the mall, carrying BAGS of purchases.
          Something catches Esther's eye. She hangs back, distracted.
          It's a pet store. ' In the display is an aguarium filled with
          TROPICAL. FISH, their vibrant colors illuminated by a black light
          in the tank. Esther gazes in, nose practically against the glass.

          RATE
          You like fish?

          ESTHER
          I like all beautiful things.
          Kate taps Max's shoulder and signs to her.

          KATE
          You should show her Hodgepodge when we
          get home.
          Max nods eagerly. Esther givee.them a curious look.

          ESTHER
          Hodgepodge? What's that?

          INT. MAX'S 13EDROOM -- DAY

          HODGEPODGE is a hamster. Esther kneels in front of his cage for a
          closer look. Kate stands behind her. Max beams proudly.

          KATE
          Max. takes care of him all bir herself.
          It's her big girl responsibility.

          ESTHER
          Aaaww,-can I pet him?

          KATE
          Sure. But you have to promise not to-
          let him out of his. cage .unless- Hcumey or
          Daddy is,here to hold him.

          ESTEER
          Why? -

          KATE
          Because he's very delicate and you
          could hurt him. Okay?
          Esther xiods. Kate scoops.flodgepodge up and kneels between the
          girls. Esther and Max share a  smile as they stroke his-fur.

          KATE
          Too fast.

          DORIS
          So what are your plans now?

          KATE
          Well, we'll get Esther settled, then
          I'll probably go back, to work.

          DORIS
          Oh, so you think.they'll take you back?
          Kate's eyes flicker with irritation.

          KATE
          I'm not talking about Yale. I'm going
          to teach piano lessons from home.

          DORIS
          I see. That was such a good position
          you had at Yale. It's a. shame.

          KATE
          I didn't quit because I wanted to. I
          quit because.I couldn't work anymore.

          (BEAT)
          Bow's Maxine feeling?

          KATE
          She's fine.
          Kate's pointedly not making eye contact with Doris now.

          DORIS
          Well, it's a shame that it took
          something like that for you to :get
          help, but I'm glad you did.
          Kate takes. the plate of food and leaves without looking at her.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - POOL - NIGHT -

          Dinner's over. Daniel has changed into swim trunks and SPLASHES
          around in the pool. Everyone else is gathered around Esther,
          who's opening a few small presents. She unwraps a BOOK OF SIGN
          LANGUAGE and gasps excitedly.

          ESTHER ,
          This is perfect! Thank you! Eiow do I
          say "thank you?"
          Kate shows her. Esther turns and makes the sign to Max.

          MAX

          YOU'RE WELCOME.
          Behind them, Daniel climbs out of the pool and runs out to the end
          of the diving board, poised to jump back in.-

          DANIEL,
          Dad! Watch this!
          But John is focused on Esther.- She's opening a big present
          la1aled "FROMi DADDY." Daniel can't get his attention.

          DANIEL
          Dad! 'Dad!! Dad, look!!
          John distractedly glances over his shoulder at him and Daniel does
          a huge cannonball into the pool. SPLASH!
          Suddenly, Esther squeals with glee. She's unwrapped an IIRT EASEL
          and NEW PAINTING SUPPLIES. By the time Daniel-'s smiling face pops
          out of the water, he's disappointed to find that Esther has drawn
          John's attention again, barraging him with-hugs and kisses.
          She looks at Daniel over John's shoulder and hticks her tongue out
          at him. Daniel fumes.

          Esther nods excitedly. John uncovers her eyes. Esther stops
          short in awe. It's the FISH TAN C from the shopping, mall.
          Esther kneels before it, entranced. She turns the black light on
          and off, marveling at- how it makes her dzess glow and the colors

          MRS. GROSSE, is introducing her. Esther's wearing a pretty little
          dress'and Shirley Temple curls, but her usually unflappable smile
          seems wary, uncertain in the face of these staring third graders.

          MRS. CROSSE
          This is our new student. Her name is
          Esther Coleman and I want you all to

          Brenda folds her hands and makes an earnest, mocking face:

          BRENDA
          Dear Jesus, please help me to not dress
          like such a freak tomorrow.
          The girls laugh. Esther pays no attention.

          of-war, then the rubber band SNAPS and the Bible flies apart,
          pages and hp otos scattering everywhere.
          Esther gasps in horror and dives to the floor, desperately
          scooping up the loose pages. A"crowd gathers, watching and
          snickering, Daniel and Trevor among them. Esther looks to Daniel
          for help, but he just stands there, watching uncomfortably.

          to see. And that was one of them.
          Esther keeps painting. She still hasn't looked at her. -

          KATE
          Esther, I need you to listen to me..
          Esther pauses. She deliberately sets her paintbrush down and
          turns to Kate. An awkward beat.

          KATE
          See, when two grown-ups love each other
          very, very much, they like to. show that
          love to each other --
          Iknow.- They fuck.
          Kate is dumbfounded. Esther regards her with a bored, aloof-look.

          INT. JOHN'S DEN - DAY

          John is troubled by what Kate has told him.

          JOHN
          - She could nave picked it up anywhere.
          Bell, she probably heard it at school.

          KATE
          This wasn't something she overheard.
          She knew what it meant. And the way
          she said'it. I don't even think she
          expected to get in trouble over it.

          JOHN
          We'll talk to her about it tonight.

          KATE
          You think that's enough?

          JOHN'  
          What do you suggest?

          KATE '
          I could take her to Doctor Browning.

          JOHN
          It was one dirty word. I don't think
          we need to call in the shrink just-yet.

          KATE    
          Maybe. It just reminded The of what
          Sister Abigail said.. We really don't
          know that much about her.'- The last
          'family she-was with could have been -
          like, "Pass the fucking potatoes" at
          the dinner table for all we know. '

          JOHN
          Iget it, I just- don ''t want to make a
          bigger deal out of it than it is.

          KATE
          If she's saying "fuck" to my face,
          what's she doing when we're not around?
          We have to be thinking about what kind
          of influence she's having-on Daniel and
          Max. Particularly Max.

          JOHN
          I wouldn't worry about it. You're
          right, we don't know how she was
          raised, but we do know she's a good
          kid. if Danny and Max want to start
          acting.like her, that's fine with me.

          It's Brenda. She pretends to not see Bather, just rides right by.
          Esther watches, her face strangely slack... then starts to follow

          BRENDA .
          What are you looking at?
          No response. Max tug on Esther's arm, but she's rooted in place,
          staring blankly at Brenda. Finally, Brenda can't take it. She
          climbs off the jungle gym and walks away. Esther watches 'her go..
          Brenda gets on a swing, but just as she starts to get some height,
          Ester' right there,.star n ,_p a her again. Max happily grabs

          away. Esther calmly walks after her.

          BRENDA
          Go-away! Stop following me, freak!
          Max sees Esther following Brenda and grudgingly gets off the
          swing, hurrying to -catch up. Brenda gives them an angry look.

          about what's going on.. Brenda heads for. the tall corkscrew slide.
          Steep stairs lead to the enclosed top, the tip of the rocket ship.
          Brenda starts up the stairs, then pauses. She turns to Esther.

          BRENDA
          You go first.
          Esther doesn't move, but Max gladly takes her turn. After a beat,
          Esther follows Max up the stairs. Brenda stays behind, watching.
          Max goes down the spiraling slide, but Esther just stands at the
          top, looking down at Brenda.

          BRENDA
          Gol!
          Esther, continues to stare down at her for a beat, then turns and
          -disappears from eight. only. then does Brenda climb up.
          Max runs to the stairs for- another turn. Brenda reaches the top
          and looks around. She sees Max.' But where's Esther? She turns.

          

          

          

          

          42.
          Suddenly, Es er is right in ,AIL of her.   She didn't' go down the
          slide, she was just crouched out of sight. Brenda gasps --
          -- then Este spits Jn her face acrd ush hex dawn the airs.
          Brenda SCREAMS as she falls,-limbs flailing, out-of-control. She
          lands hard in the dirt and just lies there crying, clutching her
          arm and bleeding from a gash in her forehead.
          Brenda's scream draws alarmed looks. The Homeless Guy startles
          awake. one of the playground mothers comes running to help. But
          Max stands frozen, gaping at Esther in total shock. Esther stares
          blankly down.at Brenda from atop the slide. Utterly emotionless.

          EXT. PARK - DAY (TIMCUT)

          BRENDA'S FATHER arrives on the scene. Brenda says something. to
          -him and points at Esther and Max, who watch from a distance.

          ESTHER
          Are you going to tell on me?
          Max shrugs.

          ESTHER
          I didn't mean to hurt her. I just
          wanted her-to stop picking on me.
          (off Max's look)
          Don't you hate it when someone is mean
          to you for no reason? Wouldn't you do
          almost anything to make them stop?
          A best. Max nods. Esther offers her hand and Max takes it.

          INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Esther and Max sit at the table. Kate and John eye them sternly.

          JOHN
          Brenda says you pushed her.

          ESTHER
          That's not true! We were just playing
          and she tripped! I swear!

          KATE
          (to Max)
          Did you see what happened?
          Esther eyes Max expectantly. Max hesitates. Then:

          MAX

          IT .WAS AN ACCIDENT.
          Kate sighs, not entirely convinced...

          Kate carefully tends the memorial orchid, spraying it with a fine
          mist of water.--

          INT. SUNROOM - DAY -

          Kate's watering the plants when she feels something on'her hand.
          There's an ANT on it. She flicks it off. Then she seed ANOTHER,
          this one crawling up her arm. She makes a face and looks down.
          Thg g are ante arwl ng loon a-: arou her feet. She
          quickly steps back,- brushing at her- arms and legs. She looks
          under one of the plant tables to'see what's attracted them:
          It's Hodgepodge. He's been dead for several days, his body
          swarming with ants and MAGGOTS.

          EXT.-COLEMAN RESIDENCE ï¿½ GARDEN - NIGHT

          A hole has been dug in the backyard flower garden. Kate, John,
          Esther, and Max stand around it. Max places a shoebox with
          "HODGEPODGE" written on it in the hole and lays a flower on top of
          it. John starts shoveling dirt into the bole.
          Esther and Max exchange a knowing look...

          INT. MAX'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Esther and Max are giggling and playing dress-up. Clothes are
          strewn everywhere. They're both trying to look grown-up. They're
          even wearing makeup -- heavy mascara and pink, painted cheeks.
          Daniel walks by and sees Max putting on lipstick. He takes it
          away from her.

          DANIEL
          Hey, you're not allowed to wear makeup.
          Does mom know you have this?

          ESTHER
          Give it-back.

          DANIEL,
          Make me.

          ESTHER
          Give it back'or I'll tell Daddy, that
          you hit her and then you'll be in
          trouble.
          Max smiles. Daniel-scowls at Esther, then gives Max the lipstick.
          He leaves. Max gives Esther a hug. Best friends forever.

          

          

          

          

          44.
          f l iT. SUPERMARKET - DAY
          Kate waits in line -at the check-out. Esther and-Max are with her.
          Aw .Kate pushes her cart up to the-counter, she looks over and sees
          the nearby'"WINE & SPIRITS" aisle. No big. deal, just a passing
          glance, a flash of idle distraction. Her eyes unreadable. Then:

          ESTHER (O.S.)
          What kind of sex do men crave most?
          Kate-looks back, shocked. Esther has picked up a "COSMOPOLITAN"
          from the newsstand and is'reading the cover aloud-to Max.

          KATE
          Put that away. Don't look at those.
          Kate puts the magazine back. There are several others just like
          it at kids-eye level. "Orgasms UNLIMITED!" "Thrill EVERY INCH- Of
          Him J" Kate'sighs and-'starts putting groceries on the conveyer.-

          ESTHER
          "How To Hit Your G-spot Every Time."
          Kate whirls. Esther has picked up the same magazine. Kate
          angrily snatches it and pulls Esther toward her. Max startles.

          KATE
          Stand where I can see yowl

           
          The CASHIER and a couple CUSTOMERS turn to look at her. Kate
          ignores them. Esther can't suppress a little smile.

          INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          The family is eating dinner. Esther makes a face and pushes her
          plate away half-finished.  

          ESTHER
          May I be excused?

          KATE  
          At least eat your chicken.

          ESTHER
          I'm not going to eat something that I
          don't like just to make you feel
          better. That's ridiculous.

          JOUN
          Esther, stop it. Eat the chicken and
          then you can be excused.

          ESTHER
          Yes, sir.
          Esther starts eating. Kate gives John an exasperatedlook.

          No explanation necessary. I don't
          think there e'anything that girl could
          say that would surprise me.

          KATE.
          She dropped the 't--bomb on me a few
          weeks ago.
          'Sister Abigail raises her eyebrows in comic, exaggerated surprise.

          SISTER ABYGAYL

          nowhere near as bad as we expected.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          What kinds of things is she doing?

          -KATE
          Talking back to me. Purposefully
          disobeying. She took Max to the park
          without ppesrmission the other day. That
          was the biggie. A girl they were
          playing with got hurt.
          A beat. Sister Abigail is suddenly apprehensive, tries to cover.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          Really? is the girl all right?

          RATE
          She broke her arm and had to have
          something like eleven stitches, I
          think. She was lucky.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          She doesn't. sound very lucky.

          JOHN
          She's lucky she didn't break her neck.
          Sister Abigail seems troubled by this.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - DAY

          Sister Abigail walks out to her car, concerned. She doesn't see
          Esther spying down from her bedroom.window, just staring at her

          JOHN
          That's right. You both are.
          As they head home, they see JOYCE 'PATTERSON (late 30's) jogging
          toward them. A blonde with dark roots and an overdone boob job.,
          wearing a skimpy sports bra and mini shorts. She waves to tem.

          JOYCE -

          Hanging in there. Hey,,. I've got. a
          chair X want moved upstairs. You think
          you could come over and give me a hand?
          John glances toward home. Kate's at the door, waving goodbye to
          the College Student.- She sees John talking to Joyce and gives
          them an unreadable look before going back inside.

          JOHN
          Uh, yeah. Maybe Kate and I -could help
          you -out.

          JOYCE

          After hours. Sister Abigail is at her desk. She opens a file and

          ELEMENTARY ANNUAL HALLOWEEN HOOT." The place is packed with
          excited children in Halloween costumes.
          The school is at the'top of a steep hill. Kate and John walk up

          Max starts to look cared. She nearly leaps. out of her skin when
          a RUBBER--MASTED GHOUL jumps out at them. But Esther just laughs
          at it. Max sees that she's not afraid and soon they're both
          giggling at the CHEESY SPOOKS that try to scare them.

          EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT

          Moments later,-Kate and John appear. Rate-nervously looks around.

          RATE
          Where's Max?

          ESTHER
          I don't know. I was trying to hold her

          KATE
          Oh,.my God...

          JOHN
          It's okay. Did YOU see where she went?

          ESTHER
          This way, I think.
          She points the wrong way. Kate takes her hand and they quickly
          move through the crowd, looking for Max. John stands on a bench
          for a better vantage, Kate grabs passersby:

          KATE
          Have you seen a little girl in-a fish
          costume? She has short brown hair?
          Nobody's seen her. Kate grows frantic. Esther watches with a
          nonchalant smile, enjoying the drama.- She tugs on Kate's arm.

          Then Kate spots Daniel approaching, holding Max's hand.' Kate
          breathes a sigh of.relief and rushes to give Max a fierce hug.

          KATE
          Are you all right?- Don't you ever run
          off like that[ What were you thinking?

          She looks like she's going, to cry. John sighs, then turns to Kate
          and Max. Esther gives Daniel a hateful look through her tears.

          Why does she have to'dress like that?

          KATE -
          She just likes the 'attention.

          ESTHER
          Well, I think it's immodest. I don't
          know why Daddy -likes her so much.

          KATE .
          (a beat, apprehensive)-
          What do you mean?

          ESTHER
          He's always smiling at her and talking
          to her. She wants him to come over to
          her house. Did you know that?
          (off Kate's look))
          Please don't tell Aaddy I told. I
          don't want him to be mad at me.-
          Kate doesn't respond, clearly disturbed.

          

          

          

          

          52..

          I EXT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - PARKING' LOT - DAY

          Kate gets out Of the minivan, but Esther stays put'-in her seat.
          Rate sighs, frazzled and distracted.

          KATE
          Esther, come on.

          ESTHER
          X told you, I don't like the de ntist.

          KATE
          There's nothing to be afraid of.

          ESTHER -
          I know. Because I'm not- going-

          KATE
          Esther, get out of the cart Righ t now!
          For a moment, they just glare at each other. Mexican stand-off..
          Then Esther sticks her nose in the air and does as she's told.

          INT.-DENTIST'S OFFICE - EXAM ROOM -- DAY

          The DENTIST lowers Esther back in the chair, pulls on rubber
          gloves. The HYGIENIST clips a dental bib around Esther's neck.

          HYGIENIST
          She hasn't had a check-up in about two
          years, so she's a little nervous.

          -DENTIST
          she doesn't look to me. Now
          let's have a look at those co ppers.
          Esther just looks at the ceiling with her mouth tightly shut.

          DENTIST.
          Come on, darling, open wide.
          -Esther eyes him anxiously; then reluctantly opens. Just a bit.

          DENTIST
          That a girl: Little wider...
          She opens more. He leans in to take a look...
          Suddenly, she SHdMPS dawnn his jinx s hard Pnou h to draw blo-mss fr
          and locks ï¿½n like Rottweileï¿½] The Hygienist is frozen in shock.

          DENTIST
          Aaagh! Goddammit!! Help me with her !
          The Hygienist holds her down while the Dentist tries to pry her
          mouth open. Finally, he yanks his fingers free, cradling them

          

          

          

          

          53.
          painfully. Esther HISSES at ldm like a cat, lips flecked with
          blood. The Dentist and Hygienist exchange a startled. lock.

          INT. DENTIST'S-OFFICE - WAITING ROOM -- DAY

          Canned MUSAK.. Kate bits waiting. The Hygienist enters.

          HYGIENIST -
          Mrs. Coleman?
          Kate gives her a confused look. Then she notices Esther htanding
          behind the Hygienist with a-smug grin on'her face.

          INT./EXT. KATE'S MINIVAN - DAY

          Driving home.. Kate stews, on her last frayed nerve. Esther gazes
          out the window, seemingly oblivious, singing a little nonsense
          song under her breath: "La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La--la-la ..."
          Kate stops at a traffic light. Glances outside.
          She's stopped next to a LIQUOR.STORE. Kate quickly looks .away,
          her temptation real enough to startle her. The light turns green
          and she drives off without looking back. Esther keeps SINGING..
          A few blocks later, they pass a BAR. Then a bus shelter with a
          big ABSOLUTE VODKA AD. Kate probably drives by them every day,
          but now they're popping out at her, sly old enemies that never
          really left, re-emerging from the shadowy recesses of her mind.
          She tries to focus on the road, Esther's VOICE grating in her
          head... "La-la-la, la-la-la-la:.. La-la-la, la-la-la-la..."

          INT. FOYER -- DAY

          Kate and Esther enter. Esther skips upstairs. Kate sighs, angry
          and frustrated. She plays a message on the ANSWERING MACHINE.

          SISTER ABIGAIL (V.0.)
          Hello, this is Sister Abigail calling
          for John and Kate. Please call me as
          soon as you get this message. I have.
          something that we need to discuss in
          person. It's regarding. Esther.

          UPSTAIRS
          Esther stands at the top of the stairs, listening to-the message-
          She's heard everything. And she's scared. Scared and pissed.

          INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BEDROOM.- NIGHT

          Kate and John get ready for bed.

          KATE
          He's been our dentist for ten years.
          Why would he lie to us?

          

          

          

          

          54.

          JQAN
          I didn't say he's lying. I just think
          Ws-blowing it out of proportion,

          KATE
          I saw the bite marks. We're lucky he's
          not suing us.

          JOHN
          Fine, but I don't believe for a"second
          that she just did it for no reason.

          RATE
          That's because she's always on her best
          behavior with you.

          JOHN'
          That's. not true. I've had to deal with
          her at her worst..

          - KATE
          What you think is her worst is what
          she's like with me all the time. She's
          completely- different with me than she
          is with you'.,

          JOHN
          So you've seen her haul off'and bite
          someone like an animal?

          KATE
          No, but she threw that fit at school

          JOEN
          Yeah, because the other kids were
          harassing her. It's the same thing
          here.
          (off her reaction)
          She's from a completely different
          culture Kate. She has to be taught
          that this. behavior isn't appropriate
          but there's nothing malicious about it.
          If'she says she bit him because she was
          scared and he was hurting her, I don't
          see any reason not to believe her.
          A beat. Kate looks at him. She's stewing hbaut something.

          KATE
          So should .1 believe her when she says
          you've been hitting on Joyce Patterson?

          JOHN'
          (taken aback)
          Did she say that?
          t.

           

          

          

          

          

          55.

          ]CATS
          Is it true?

          JOHN
          of course not!

          KATE
          Did-she invite You over?'

          JOHN
          She wanted me to help her move a chair.

          KATE
          Oh, - come on.

          JOHN

          ON
          All right, she was obviously coming
          to me. But I shut her down.

          KATE
          Then why didn't you tell me?

          JOHN
          Because I knew how you'd reactl

          KATE
          Really? You sure it wasn't because you
          were coming-on to her so obviously that
          an eight-year-old picked upon it?
          A long-beat. John sighs, resigned.-

          JOHN
          How-long are you going to keep this
          hanging over me? It was ten years ago.

          KATE
          You keep-saying that. But it's only
          been about two years since you told me.
          (a tense beat)
          Having another child was -supposed to
          bring us together.

          JOHN
          I'm sorry I didn't tell you-about it-
          x just feel like I've earned a little
          trust here.

          KATE -
          I don't know what you expect from me.
          I might never completely trust you
          again. Not like before.

          JOHN  
          I gave you a second chance.

          ï¿½4

          

          

          

          

          56.
          Kate stops short. IIis words-are like a phybical blow.

          - KATE -
          That's not fair.

          JOHN
          So-you can keep bringing uP my . mistakes
          over and Over, but we're not even
          allowed to discuss yours?

          KATE
          I was sick! You were just an asshole
          who wanted to fuck somebody else!

          JOHN
          You were a danger to our children. If
          I didn't want to. make this work, I
          could have left months ago and nobody
          would have blamed me.

          KATE
          Nice. Is that-what-your mother told
          you?
          Angry tears well in her eyes. He realizes be went too far.. Kate
          goes into the bathroom and SLAMS the door.

          INT. MAX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT -

          It's late. Esther and Max sit on the bed in their nightgowns.
          Only the bedside light is on. They're signing to one anothe r.

          ESTHER
          THE MAN LADY YS Comm TOMORROW.

          MAX

          I' M AFRAID. I DON'T WANT HER TO TAKE

          YOU BACK TO THE HOME.

          NEITUER DO 1. WE HAVE TO SCARE HER

          AWAY. WILL YOU HELP ME?
          Max anxiously nods her head. Esther smiles.

          INT..JOHN'S DEN'- NIGHT

          The room is dark. The girls sneak in, still in their nightgowns,
          and close the door. Esther turns on a :reading lamp.

          ESTHER '
          Look for the key to the treehouse.'
          -Max nods and they start searching the room. Esther rifles through
          John 's desk. - Nothing.  She looks in a closet. A DARK PLASTIC
          CASE with Two PADLOCKS on it catches her eye...

          

          

          

          

          57.
          Max opens a. keepsake chest and finds SEVERAL KEYS on:a ring. She
          excitedly shows them to Esther. Esther smiles and takes them. As
          they're about to leave,.Esther. Uses. She looks back at the-
          closed closet. Then looks at the keys. Max eyes her curiously.
          Esther slides a chair over to. the closet and opens it.. She stands
          on the chair, pulls down the case with the padlocks on it, and
          sets it on the floor. She tries a couple of.keys. Then -- CLICK.
          There's a GUN inside. A shiny revolver and a BOX OF AMMUNITION.
          Esther's face lights up. She.carefully picks up the gun{-turns it
          over, looks at it. Max's eyes nearly pop out. Esther gives her a
          sly look, then loads a single bullet, SPINS. the cylinder...
          .and points the cmn at ax. Ri.aht between the Bye

          ESTHER
          Do you -want to_ play? -
          A beat. Max shakes her head. Esther smiles, fingers the trigger.
          After a long, awful, pants wetting eternity, she lowers the gun.

          ESTHER
          You're right. We'd better not.

          (BEAT)
          Not yet. -

          INT. LIVING ROOM -- DAY

          Sister Abigail sits across from Kate and John with a grave look.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          When you first asked about adopting
          Esther, I expressed some misgivings.
          But I wasn't completely straightforward
          with you. You see, I love children.
          I've worked with them my entire life.
          And the thing about love is that it
          sometimes clouds your judgement.

          (BEAT)
          But the truth is that I knew there was
          something wrong with Esther from the
          moment I laid eyes on her.
          Kate sits up, concerned. John bristles.

          - KATE
          You said you suspected, some kind of
          abuse.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          Yes, but there was something else. It
          was hard to say chat it was at first.
          Just-a feeling that she was a
          profoundly damaged little girl.

          After you told me about the gir
          broke her arm, -:E -started wondering
          again. I called the achool:Esther went
          to while she was with the Wallaces and
          asked if there'd been any serious
          accidents while she.Was there.. One
          incident was still fresh in everyone's
          minds. A boy in one of her classes was
          stabbed in the throat with a pair of
          'scissors. All the kids-who saw it
          happen said it was an accident, that he
          was running with the scissors and fell.
          But once again, Esther, was there.

          ANGLE - ESTHER
          is eavesdropping from around the corner. She slips away.

          BACK TO SCENE

          JOAN
          But none of these things were her
          fault.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          That's; g I was reluc!tant to t
          anything bef ore. Now'I think th at may a
          have been a mistake.
          (off their-looks)
          Children like Esther, who've spent
          their entire lives-in institutions,
            have never had' a chance to 'form normal,
          lasting bonds.. The longterm effects
          of 'this- can be devastating.   In the
          very worst cases, children who fail to
          form early attachments are unable to
          learn the difference between'right and
          wrong. They can lie, cheat, steal ---
          .or worse -and and have no remorse
          whatsoever for their actions.' They
          view other human beings as objects,
          pawns for their amusement. And they
          can-be potentially very dangerous.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          A severely character-disturbed child
          can appear to be -completely normal,
          -even exceptional. It's like they have
          two faces one-they show the outside
          world in order'to get what they want,
          and the other, their true face, lying
          just beneath the surface.

          INT. MAX'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Max sits on her bed, wearing a jacket and clutching her "Bello.

          Let's go.

          INT. LIVING ROOM  - DAY -


          KATE
          What about the orphanage in Russia
          where she was raised? Wouldn't they
          have been able to tell?

          SISTER ABIGAIL -
          I've put in a call to the director
          there, but she could have easily
          slipped through the. cracks.

          JOHN -
          So the bottom line here is that you
          don't have proof of any of this.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          That's true,-I don't. But I believe
          the circumstantial evidence is enough
          to warrant taking the next step.

          RATE
          Which is what? -

          SISTER -ABIGAIL
          Get Esther out of'the house.
          Kate and John are stunned.

          JOHN
          You want to disrupt the adoption over
          this?!

          

          

          

          

          - 60.

          SISTER ABIGAIL -
          If I'm-wrong, she-can come back home.
          But you need to get her to a therapist
          who can tell you what you're dealing

          WITH

          JOHN
          She's just a kids -  

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          She's also the sole-survivor of a house
          fire that killed her last family.
          (off their looks)
          It was arson. I did some checking.
          Someone deliberately set that fire.
          They-never caught who did it.

          JOHN
          Wait a minute, you're not suggesting --

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          Pyromania is one of the warning signs
          of a character--disturbed child.
          Rate blanches, realizing:

          KATE
          Do you think she had something to do
          with'what happened to Yolanda?
          A long beat. Sister Abigail hesitates, reluctant to answer.

          SISTER ABIGAIL -
          The thought that a child could cougnit
          such a monstrous crime flies in the
          face of everything I hold dear. But in
          my opinion, at'a a possibility that you
          need to take very seriously.

          We can take her to Doctor -Browning. -
          Kate suggested doing that weeks ago.
          But I don't want to send her away. Not
          without at least some kind of proof.
          Sister Abigail.sighs, frustrated. Kate turns to him:

          

          

          

          

          61.

          KATE
          But what if 'the doctor says she's
          dangerous?
          A beat. He considers, uncertain and emotional.

          JOH1
          Then I guess we.won't.bave any choice.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Daniel sits near.the brook, sullenly throwing rocks in the water.
          He hears something behind him and turns. Esther and Max are
          running off through.the woods, leaves CRASHING under their feet.'
          Neither of them ree him. He eyes them curiously.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - DAY

          Sister Abigail ie leaving. Rate and John stand by the front door,
          'troubled, watching her go.

          EXT. PRIVATE ROAD -- DAY

          Esther and Max run toward'the bridge where. the road into the
          neighborhood crosses the brook. They climb an embankment and
          crouch. by the bridge abutment, out of breath. Esther looks both
          ways. There's no traffic. She and Max hide behind the abutment.

          INT./EXT. SISTER ABIGAIL'S CAR - DAY

          Sister Abigail drives away., troubled. She takes a pack of
          cigarettes from the glove compartment and lights one.

          EXT. PRIVATE ROAD - DAY

          The girlb wait by the abutment. The only sound is the RIPPLING
          brook. Max looks nervous. Esther gives her a reassuring smile.

          ESTHER -
          It's going' to be fine. Just wave your
          arms and make sure she stops.
          Max nods. Then Esther hears a CAR coming. She peers out'from
          behind the abutment. It's Sister Abigail's car. Esther quickly
          ducks out of sight.

          ESTHER
          Here she. comes. Wait until she gets
          close.
          Max nervously peers out from behind the abutment. Esther stands
          behind her. The car starts across the-bridge. Suddenly --
          -- sthe pusbes Max it into the Load. stumbles and falls
          ri ht ,m. on of the _speedï¿½ car.

          

          

          

          

          62.
          Sister Abigail gasps and SLAMS on the brakes, 'TIRES SQUEALING,
          stopping the car mere feet from where Max lies in the road. She
          frantically. jumps out of the car and kneels next to Max.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          Dear Lord! Are you okay, honey?
          Max looks up at her,-stunned, but unhurt. Sister Abigai1 is taken
          aback. She recognizes her.

           SISTER ABIGAIL -
           Max...?! - -
           A SHADOW falls on Abigail from behind. She turns and looks "up.
           Esther looms.over her, a CLAW HAMMER raised above her head.
          efor is a Abigail Va e a , Esther angrily hits her in tie ' l
           head as hard as she can with the hammer. CRUNCF#.
          Max startles,'eyes wide with shock. Sister Abigail falls and lies
          twitching on the pavement. Eyes staring blankly, one pupil wide
          from the head trauma. Blood trickles from under her headdress.
          As Max stares at. the body, paralyzed with fear, Esther scurries
          into Sister Abigail's car and finds her purse. She flips through
          her wallet. Cash, credit cards. Takes it all. Finds her rosary
          beads. Grabs them, too. Then she hurries back to the body.

          ESTHER
          Help me get her off the road.
          Max looks up blankly, then staggers .to her feet. They each take a
          hand and start dragging Sister Abigail's body, but she's heavy and
          they're little. It's all they can do to slowly move her.
          Then Esther hears something. There's ANOTHER CAR coming. It's
          still out of sight through the trees, but closing.
          Esther and Max hurriedly drag the body, struggling it to the side
          of the road, just as the car rounds the bend. Esther gives the'
          body a kick,, sending it rolling down the embankment.
          The car is almost on them. Esther and Max quickly hide under the
          bridge.. Esther grabs Max's backpack and pulls u wig _cm.
          The car reaches the bridge. Esther listens to it cross, tense,
          gun . ready... . but it passes Abigail's car and continues without
          stopping. Esther breathes a sigh of relief.
          Suddenly, there's a CROARING_noise from behind them.' Esther
          turns. It's Sister Abigail. She's still alive. She's trying to
          speak, but all that comes out is an awful'MOAN.
          Esther scowls and grabs the hammer. Sister Abigail looks up at
          her,' moaning louder. Then Esther brings-the hammer down. CRUNCH.
          The moans stop. Esther hits her AGAIN and AGAIN.

          ESTHER
          Good. Let's get her covered up.
          Esther starts scooping leaves and debris onto Sister Abigail's
          corpse. Max just watches fora long beat... then shuffles over
          like a zombie and helps her. Esther smiles..

          Esther is wearing a clean dress. -- She stuffs Max's "Hello Kitty"

          ESTHER.
          That doesn't matter. 'They'll send you
          to jail just for helping me bury her.
          Max starts to cry. Esther moves closer, comforting.

          ESTHER
          She wanted to take me away from you.

          It's Esther. She smiles  at the. vendor and walks away. She- spots
          the Homeless Guy across the park and casually heads toward him.
          As she approaches, we see that she's carrying the -plastic yrocery
          bag with the bloody hammer and sister Abigail's things in t.
          She carefully looks around to snake sure nobody is watching, then
          nonchalantly tosses the incriminating bag into the Homeless Guy's

           Esther leans in, her face wild-and terrifying. Daniel lies there

          John breathes a sigh of relief. Kate gives-a dubious smile.

          KATE
          She's not dangerous?

          DR. BROWNING
          No, of course not.

          Thank God.

          Esther. fidgets, impatient. She turns to the Secretary:

          ESTRER
          May I go to the restroom?

          INT. DOCTOR BROWNING'S OFFICE.- DAY

          Dr. Browning continues. Kate' can't believe what 'she's hearing:

          DR. BROWNING
          I was able to coax her into admitting
          that there's been some tension between
          the two of-you. She's really tr!ing
          very hard to please you. The problem
          is that you're blocking her attempts-to
          attach-with you. That's why whenever
          something bad happens, you blame her,
          whether it's really her fault or not.

          KATE
          But that's not what's.been happening.

          DR. BROWNING
          I doubt you're even aware that you're
          doing it. But subconsciously you t aunt
          her to be bad because' demonizing her is
          your way of covering your own feelings _
          of inadequacy as a mother.

          KATE
          I don't feel inadequate.

          DR. BROWNING
          But you do have doubts. You worry that'
          you Could relapse.

          KATE
          What does that have to do with'Esther?

          DR. BROWNING
          Frankly, everything. Your guilt over
          what happened with Max is preventing-
          you from bonding with Esther.
          Kate turns to John, aghast, but he's taking this very seriously.

          DR. BROWNING
          It's made you doubt your fitness as a
          mother. And that terrifies you. So
          you're having trouble with Esther,
          alonV comes Sister Abigail with these

          Esther, Daniel was there first. -
          Daniel eyes Esther. Wary, but defiant. She sighs and makes a

          John sighs. A tense-beat.

          JOHN
          I know you were. upset. But we have to
          at least consider the possibility that
          she's right about this.

          KATE
          No, we don't. Why does everybody

          someone to help you with the kids if
          it's getting to be too much.

          KATE
          I don't need help. All I want is for a

          -we first met her, but we can't see what she's doing to it. The

          JOHN -
          She didn't really believe that.

          RATS
          She didn't want to believe it. But she
          was worried enough-to think we should
          put her in foster care until we found
          out for sure.

          JOHN
          For all, her good intentions, sister
          Abigail was not a trained psychologist.
          She'had certain suspicions about Esther
          and they turned out to be wrong. Why
          is can't you accept that?

          KATE
          (a beat, thin)ts)
          What if somebody else thought there was
          something wrong with her? Like the
          director of the orphanage in Russia?
          Esther stops painting and listens, suddenly apprehensive.

          KATE
          if it's a dead end, I'll drop it. - But
          if they say the same thine, then we'd
          have to get.a second opinion.
          John considers. He doesn't want to be unreasonable. He nods.

          All right.- See what you can find out.

          I hate it. Nobody likes me there.
          Nobody ever likes me.

          ESTHER
          It's all right. I understand if she
          doesn't. It must be difficult to love
          an adopted child as much as- your own..

          JOHN
          Sweetheart, .you are just as much a part
          of this family- as Danny. and Max are.
          Mommy doesn't love'you any less because
          you're adopted. Do you understand?
          She nods, but doesn't look convinced. John thinks.

          JOHN
          Why don't you do something special for
          her? So she can see what a good girl
          you are. I'll bet she'd like that.

          paintings in her lap, obliviously prattling:

          ESTHER
          I can't wait for show-and-tell. I hope
          Mrs. Grosse. likes my paintings. I did
          one especially for her..
          .Nobody responds. Kate's blocking her out. Esther doesn't mind.

          EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL/INT. KATE'S MINIVAN - MORNING

          Kate drives up the hill and pulls to the curb. Daniel gets out,
          but'Esther struggles, her wrist cast making her clumsy, and she
          awkwardly fumbles her paintings.. They land in the gutter and
          start-blowing away. She gives Kate a horrible,-pleading-look

          ESTHER
          Moumiy! My paintings!
          Kate eyes her accusingly.

          KATE
          You dropped them on purpose.

          ESTHER  
          No, I didn't! I swear!. -
          Kate doesn't believe it for a second, but sees a CROSSING GUARD
          and a FEW KIDS hurrying to grab the paintings as they're carried
          off by the wind. Kate shoots Esther a dirty look, then sets the
          parking brake with an exasperated sigh and gets out to help...

          INT .'. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
           Rate sits across from John and Dr. Browning.The mood fa grim:

           KATE
          I set the brake. . Bven if I hadn'tr the
          police said it wouldn't have.:rolled
          unless it was put in neutral.

          DR. BROWNING.
          But Max says she didn't see Esther do
          anything wrong.
          Max is cover.ng for her. And X don't
          think it's the first time.

          DR. BROWNING
          It also-wouldn't be the first time that
          you've tried to blame Esther for.
          something that was really your fault.

          XATE
          This. isn-'t all in my head. Sister
          Abigail was right. There is something
          wrong with Esther. And I don't care
          anymore if I can't prove it. I'want
          her out of this house.
          John and Dr. Browning exchange a dark look.

          DR. B' OWNING
          So you're at a place where you would
          actually let somebody take her away?

          KATE
          I'll do whatever I have to,do to
          protect my children.

          JOHN
          56 will 1.
          (re: Dr. Browning)
          That's why she's here.
          something in his voice makes Kate apprehensive. An uneasy beat.

          DR. BROWNING
          I have an opening held for you at a
          residential rehabilitation clinic about
          forty-five miles from here. They
          specialize in extended treatment for
          women who are relapsed alcoholics.
          Kate is stunned silent. She gapes at. them. with a mix of anger and
          fear, unable to stop' a flash of guilt. How much do they know...?.

          

          

          

          

          .82..

          KATE .
          What are you talking.about?

          -JOHN
          I'll stand by you through this for as
          long as it takes. My mom'a already
          agreed., to 'help look after the - kids . .

          RATS
          Tell her not to bother.
          (to Dr. Browning)
          I'd like you to leave now.

          JOHN
          Kate, don't.
          John stands and takes something from inside the sideboard. Ile
          : sets it on the coffee table between them...
          qtr, s
          the wine bottl g she hid " he closet. Kate is stricken.
          She looks at it like it was a poisonous spider.

          JOHN
          The girls found it while they were
          playing in your. closet.

          KATE
          The girls?" You mean Esther found it.

          JOHN
          Yes, Esther found it. Does that make a
          difference? Is she lying?
          A beat. Kate's silence-is answer enough.

          KATE
          I didn't... I bought two bottles. I
          poured the other one down-the sink.

          JOHN
          But not this onie.
          Again, no answer necessary.. Kate looks defeated, tears welling.

          KATE
          I'm not going to rehab.

          JQHN
          I'm not going to leave you-alone with
          the kids again until you do. - .

          KATE
          I haven't had a drink in almost a year.
          John sighs, frustrated.- Dr. Browning intervenes, her voice
          infuriatingly even. and calm.'

          

          

          

          

          83.

          DR. DROWNING
          Relapse is very common in early
          sobriety. We can help you. But not
          until you drop the charade. -

          KATE
          It's not a charade. I wanted to- drink
          i t. You have no fucking idea how.badly
          I wanted to drink it. But I didn't.
          (off John's look)
          I know 1 should have told you..  I was
          just afraid of what you'd do.

          JOHN
          I wanted you to come to me. That's why
          ,I didn't confront you with it last
          night. If Max had gotten hurt this
          morning, it. would've been because I
          trusted you tell me if there was a
          problem.

          RATE
          What happened this morning had nothing
          to do with this!

          JOHN
          l f ow do you expect me to believe that?

           KATE
          Max and Daniel are the only reason I'm
          still sober. I would never do anything
          that would hurt them.

          DR. BROWNING
          You don't think this behavior effects
          them?

          KATE
          You know damn.well what I'm talking
          about.
          _ Her voice is brittle now, barely controlled. A beat. The tears
          sta rt to spill.

          KATE
          When I look out at the pool and
          think...
          (to John)
          When I try to imagine what would have
          happened if you hadn't come home early
          that day... it makes me want to kill
          myself. I would the before I let
          something like that happen again.

          JOHN
          Then why-not throw both bottles away?

          

          

          

          

          84,

          KATE-
          Becauso"I need help. i thought I could
          handle it myself, but I can't. I'll go
          back to-therapy. I'll start going to
          A.A. meetings.

          JOHN
          That's not enough anymore.' I told you
          last time what I'd do if this'ever
          happened again. I'm trying to give you
          another chance.

          KATE -
          You haven't heard.a word I've said.

          JOHN
          I've heard enough. If it was just the
          two of us, that would be one thing.
          But I can't let you be in a position
          where you could hurt the kids.

          KATE
          I'm not the one you need to be worried
          aboutt Seven people close to Esther
          have died in the past year. Max was
          almost the eighth. now many more
          coincidences are you willing to ignore?

          JOHN
          Kate, stop it. You're talking about an
          eight-year-old girl. And right now
          she's making a lot more sense than you
          are.

          KATE
          I know I haven't given you any reason
          to believe me. But you have to. I'm
          begging you.

          JOHN
          I'm sorry. Maybe if you'd been honest
          with me from the start. But not now.

          ANGLE -- MAX AND ESTHER
          peer around the corner, watching them argue. Max is crying.

          JOHN
          You either check into rehab this week
          or I leave and I take the kids with me.
          Esther leans close and whispers into Max's hearing aid:

          ESTHER
          I'll kill her it you tell..

          

          

          

          

          85.
          Max gives her a frightened look.- Just then, Doris.appears with a
          bowl of popcorn. She quickly ehoos the girls away.

          DORIS
          Come on, you two. Let's go watch TV.
          Max wipes her eyes. Esther takes her hand and leads her away.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE -- NIGHT -

          John walks Doris out to her car.-He gives her a hug.

          JOHN -
          You sure you don't mind? She's not
          going to appreciate your being around.

          DORIS
          .I don't care what she appreciates. You
          can't leave those kids alone with her
          while you're at work all day.
          (off his look)
          You're doing the right thing. Don't
          let her change your mind.

          JOHN
          I'll see you tomorrow.
          Doris gets In her car. John looks conflicted.

          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Bedtime. Esther can be heard HUMMING through the closed bathroom
          door. Daniel listens as he sneaks down the hall in his pajamas...

          INT. MAX'S BEDRROM - NIGHT

          Max's eyes are red from crying. She's drawing a picture, but
          hides it under some other papers when Daniel enters. Be closes
          the door. Esther's HUMMING can be heard O.S. A tense beat.

          DANIEL
          Are you okay?'
          Max nods. Daniel sits down next to her. He lowers his voice.

          DANIEL
          Did Esther do something to the van?
          Max turns away and shakes her bead.

          DANIEL
          It's okay. You can tell no. I saw her
          jump out before .it started to roll.
          Max gives him a startled look, suddenly frightened.

          

          

          

          

          86..

          MAX

          DID XOD: TELL ON !3ER?

          DANIEL
          No way. Dad won't believe me. You
          have to do it with me.
          Max shakes her head and starts signing, but Daniel can't keep up.

          DANIEL
          Slow down, 'I don't understand. Did she
          make the van crash?
          A long beat. Max reluctantly nods'. -

          DANIEL
          Then we have to tell Mom and Dad.
          Max starts crying. She signs, but Daniel doesn't understand.
          Frustrated, Max starts hitting him. Daniel grabs her arms

          DANIEL
          -Stop it!- She's going to kill us if we
          don't tell! Morn and Dad can protect
          us!
          Max. shakes her head. Daniel releases her.

          DANIEL
          Why not?

          MAX

          NOBODY CAN.
          Daniel stops short. Max hesitates, then gets up and shows him the
          pictures that she hid from him when he first came in.
          They're crude crayon drawings of Max and Esther. In the first,
          Esther stands atop the rocket ship slide and pushes Brenda down
          the stairs while Max watches..
          The= next one turns Daniel's blood cold. X &'s of Sister Abigail's
          murder. Esther stands over Sister Abigail with a bloody hammer
          wh e r e Max cowers under the bridge. The last one is of Esther and
          Max in the treehouse. Esther is covered in blood.

          DANIEL
          What did she do in the treehouse?

          MAX

          SHE PUT TEE BAD THINGS THERE.
          Suddenly, Esther's O.S."humming STOPS. Daniel looks up, alarmed.

          DANIEL

          'Max quickly hides the. pictures-. Daniel scrambles to the door, but
          -pauses and signs to Max as best he can.

          DANIEL
          Everything's going to be all right.

          INT.'UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Daniel hurries back to his room and closes the door, just as
          Esther emerges from the bathroom. She pauses, suspicious.

           Kate and John are in bed. It's 3:23 a.m.' They both appear to be

           She looks over at John, slowly push the covers back, and inches

          Kate slips inside, closes the door; and starts toward Max's bed...-
          Suddenly, a desk light comes on. It's Bather. She's been sitting
          there in the dark. The light casts strange shadows on her face.

          ESTHER..
          Going somewhere, Kate?
          Kate startles and whirls to check on Max. She's. fast asleep.

          ESTHER
          She's fine. Lot's not wake her.

          KATE
          What are you doing in here?

          ESTHER
          1-couldn't sleep. I was-afraid you
          might try to take Daniel and Max away.
          Kate stands frozen, frustrated and'angry.

          KATE
          Go to your room.

          ESTHER

           KATE
           (a beat, stricken)
           Who told you about that. -
           Esther holds up Kate's journal:: Kate blanches.

           ESTHER
           It's in your journal. I found ï¿½it a few
           weeks ago.. It's very intimate. 3
          learned so much about you. Your
          marital troubles, your drinking
          problem. Where you hide your wine
          bottles. You have lovely handwriting,
          by the way. Would you like to bear my
          favorite part?
          Esther has a page marked. She reads:

          ESTHER
          "Eight weeks before my due date,
          Jessica died-from several undiagnosed
          birth defects. I hadn't felt her move
          for days, but now that I knew she was
          dead, I started-to feel her kick again.
          It's called phantom fetal movement,
          like the pain felt in a missing limb.
          I was an amputee and my baby was the
          lost part of me. Because of other
          complications, Doctor Kosgrove didn't
          want to induce. So I had to wait to go
          into labor. For sixteen days I carried
          Jessica's body and felt her ghostnow a kicking in my-belly. y womb
          coffin and inside me slept a corpse."
          (to Kate)
          How perfectly hideous. No wonder you
          turned into a nasty, smelly drunk.
          Kate is dumbfounded, trembling with impotent rage and raw emotion.

          ESTHER

          continues to BEEP, registering her heartbeat instead of his.

          carefully straddles him and takes a pillow from under his head.

          Nurse cover his body with a sheet. Kate collapses to the floor,
          weak with horror and grief. John tries to comfort her.

          John nods. He waits for Dr. Rajan and the Nurse to leave, then
          walks over and looks,down at Kate. She's fighting to stay awake.

          JOHN

          to call out, but doesn't have the strength. - She sees the girls
          waiting in-the hallway. Max has been crying. She looks scared.

          She's wearing the dress we saw her choose, but with some
          alterations. The ruffles are gone, so are-the sleeves. It's low
          cut and too grown up. Her hair is perfectly curled and her face
          is caked with makeup --- powder, red lipstick, thick mascara, dark
          eyeliner -- giving her a grotesque, woman-child, eight-year-old-
          beauty-queen look. JonBenet Ramsey by way of Angelina Jolie.
          John is stupefied. She szailes at him. Outside, THUNDER RUMBLES.

          Get down from there. That knife's too
          sharp for you to be playing with.
          Esther climbs down from the chair and nonchalantly carries the
          cheese and cracker plate to the dining room, as-if he hadn't said
          anything. John follows her, dumbfounded...

          INT. DINING ROOM.- NIGHT

          There are TWO GLASSES and a bottle of SPARKLING WATER on the
          dining room table. Dim lighting and romantic MUSIC. John is

          pretty for you-as she is.

          Esther is touched. She gazes up at. him lovingly.

          ESTHER
          You really mean that, don't you?

          JOHN
          of course. Why don't you go wash your
          face and we'll tuck you back into bed.

          ESTHER -
          But-1 worked so hard. Can't we stay up
          just a little longer?
          She gives him the big, sad eyes. They're a little disconcerting

          and then off -to bed.

          starts pouring sparkling water into the glasses.

          ESTHER
          We really. should be drinking that
          bottle-of wine, but I couldn't find it.

          You're not the first to have been
          fooled. She's even-been adopted
          before. A family here in Estonia took
          her in.and lived with her fog over six.
          months. They never suspected.
          Kate-hesitatesa'b.eat, almost afraid to ask:

          KATE
          But why was ahe at your hospital?

          DA. VARAVA
          Veera is dangerously insane.. She was
          molested by her father and sexualized
          at a very early age. When. he. took
          another lover, he told Veera it was
          because she could heverbe a real
          woman. Veera murdered them both.

          ESTHER
          just stares at herself in the mirror. With her scars revealed,
          her face scratched, her mascara streaked down 'to her chin, and her
          awful, yellow, snaggletoothed sneer, she looks like a monster.

          DR. VARAVA
          She now sees herself as trapped in the
          body of a. child and it disgusts her.
          She wants to. be what her father
          considered to be a "real woman." She t
          wants o be a wife, a mother, a lover.
          She wants to grow up. -
          Suddenly, -she grabs her chair and SMASHES the mirror with it.
          Then she whirls and swings the chair into her aquarium with a
          'feral scream --= CRASH! Water-and fish flood onto the floor.

          DR. VARAVA
          When she was adopted here in Estonia,
          = she tried to find love where she had
          found as a child. With her new lather.

                         DEEP SPACE

          A darkness like no other, a silence that is unsettling.
          Sharp pinholes of light show a sea of distant stars across
          the void of outer space. Our own motion is only realized as
          an enormous object slowly moves towards us, taking shape.
          A SPACE SHIP of unimaginable size, a tubular freighter easily
          ten times larger then any aircraft carrier. At first glance
          it appears lifeless and adrift, but slowly the small glow of
          cockpit windows come into view as we move closer.
          Moonlight cuts across the hull, displaying the name; EDEN.

          BOWER (V.0.)
          Where were you... when Eden was lost?
          Like every other kid on my block, I was
          in the middle of a dream, envious of
          those who were chosen to be part of
          mankind's greatest quest. Dreaming of
          the unknown and trying to imagine what
          only the lucky few would encounter.
           We PUSH IN towards the cockpit windows and...

                          DISSOLVE THRU:

          INT. COCKPIT (EDEN) - CONT.

          Inside the flight deck it's ghostly vacant, rows of empty
          flight chairs and numerous guidance computers gently
          blinking. With half filled coffee-cups and jackets hung over
          the seat backs... it appears the control deck has been
          suddenly evacuated.
          Muffled SCREAMS are heard somewhere deeper inside the ship.

          BOWER.(V.0.)
          As the entire world watched in wonder,
          there were only a few, skeptical of the
          journey's success.

                         (BEAT)
          Only a few... who would be right.
          The further we move into the ship... signs of violence
          appear, smears of dark blood sharply standing out on the
          bright white paneling and several broken computer screens.
          The muffled SCREAMS grow louder and clearer... an argument
          between men, panicked rage over-lapping.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          CAMERA slowly moves past a corner to see the middle-of a
          violent confrontation. One OFFICER is locked inside a sleep
          chamber, banging on the glass and pleading with panic.
          Another OFFICER is on the floor, mortally wounded, his body
          still twitching with his head bashed in. The INSANE OFFICER,
          a young corporal is moving from terminal to terminal, typing
          in commands with a casual and emotionless nature.
          Blood streams have run down his face from both ears and nose
          as he continues to type commands into the flight computer...
          heightening the trapped OFFICER'S muffled,. screams.

                         TRAPPED OFFICER

                         (IN FRENCH)

          STOP IT! STOP FOR GOD'S SAKES! PLEASE!

          GOD NO!
          The INSANE OFFICER hits the final command key and warning
          buzzers ignite with flashing lights. He closes his eyes,
          taking a breath of relief.

                         TRAPPED OFFCIER

                         (IN FRENCH)

          STOP IT! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS WILL

          DO TO- YOU'RE NOT- STOP! YOU'RE GOING

          TO FUCKING KILL US ALL!
          The trapped OFFICER begins pounding on the glass with a
          crazed panic as the INSANE OFFICER calmly goes to his own
          sleep-pod and climbs inside, sealing the hatch.

          TRAPPED OFFCIER (CONT-D)

                         (IN FRENCH)

          PLEASE GOD! NO! NO GOD DAMMIT!
          Control panels flash and hydraulics ignite. Like a row of
          tumbling dominos, each of the sleep-chamber pods shift
          positions with a SHUSH of hydraulics and then... they are
          launched with a ROAR of micro-jets.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SHIP "EDEN" - CONT.

          We're suddenly back into the unsettling silence as... like a
          bee hive that's exploded, thousands of coffin-sized sleep
          pods are ejected from the ship in unison. They are sent
          tumbling into open space in every direction as the ship
          slowly continues its unaffected course.

                         CONTINUED:
          The trapped OFFICER is seen SCREAMING in silence inside his
          own pod.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. OUTER SPACE

          We slowly float towards an astroid field. As we grow closer
          it's the sea of sleep pods slowly floating through space.

          BOWER (P.O.)
          Where was I... when I heard we'd lost
          Eden? Just like every other kid on my
          block... I was dreaming... of being one
          who would be chosen to follow.
          As we move closer to the asteroid field of sleep pods, it's
          obvious that time has passed, a single skeleton inside each
          of the pods, hands in a clawing position towards the glass.
          We PUSH IN towards one pod, moving towards the SKULL, still
          locked in a SCREAMING position, wide mouthed and...

                         CUT TO:

          M. HYPER-SLEEP CHAMBER
          A RUMBLE passes... EYELIDS TWITCH... A GASP.
          Inside a coffin-size chamber, a dim glow of light seeps
          through a small glass porthole. A MAN is asleep, a mask
          attached to his face, tubes of liquid feeding into his arms.
          CORPORAL BOWER, military physique, chiseled features. His
          chest lightly expanding, blood pulsating through his veins.
          Lights FLICKER PAST and his body comes to life, muscles
          flinching, breath quickening. He squirms with discomfort,
          ripping away the mask. He gasps, trying to SCREAM.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - CONT.

          His scream is muffled under three inches of glass. The hatch
          door is hit with a THUD and white gases erupt from the edges.
          THUD, THUD... THUD! The door bursts open and BOWER scampers
          out, struggling to rip away the feeding tubes. He HITS the
          floor, naked and gasping. His pores ignite, dripping sweat.
          He tries to get to his feet, but his legs wobble underneath
          him, collapsing. He yells at the floor.

                         BOWER
          Burns are red! Bruises... blue-
          His voice echoes into the dark, alone in a cavernous room as
          he pauses, struggling for orientation. He gets to his feet,
          muscles twitching. His short-cropped hair is... pure white.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Hey...? HEY!!? Someone?
          A constant low RUMBLE is present, joined by the occasional
          MOAN and CREAK of a large ship. A SHUDDER travels through
          the room with a random FLICKER of LIGHTS to reveal...
          A massive steel compartment, tangled with technology. It's
          cold and institutional. High-tech computer terminals slope
          out of the floor. The FLICKER passes, taking us into black.
          We hear him: fumbling through the room, switches are thrown
          with no result and compartments are pulled opened and...
          SNAP! A glow stick comes to life.
          He squints at his darkened surroundings with confusion. A
          drip of liquid catches his eye and he staggers back to his
          sleep pod. He grabs the dangling tubes that were ripped from
          his arm and he sucks on the tube, pulling as much liquid into
          his mouth as possible.
          After a few heavy gulps, he suddenly heaves towards the
          floor. He painfully forces himself to drink, gasping.
          He looks up to notice two sleep chambers next to his own. He
          leans closer with the glow stick to see the first one, the
          name plate reading; 2nd Lt. Cooper. It's EMPTY.
          The third pod's name plate reads; LT. PAYTON. Deep inside
          there is the figure of a man, asleep under a mask.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Payton? Lieutenant... Payton?
          He turns back to his own pod, seeing the name plate that
          reads; CORPORAL BOWER. Even this name doesn't seem familiar.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Bower? Bower...?
          The loss of memory heightens his fear even more as a shiver
          travels through his body while he staggers towards a nearby
          computer terminal. He taps the keys on a computer terminal.
          Nothing. He frowns, leaning closer.

          As he taps the keyboard, powder blooms out from under his
          fingers. He wipes the surface of the panel to see a thick
          layer of dust. Under the smear is...
          Elysium - Flight Systems - Operation Terminal #87153-D.
          He pulls focus to see... his FINGERS are trembling
          uncontrollably, an odd vibration of nerves. He slowly makes
          a fist with concern.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          BOWER walks along a row of storage lockers reading each name
          plate. He stops at the locker labelled; Corp. Bower. He
          pauses, mumbling the name once again with no recognition.

                         BOWER
          Bower.
          He opens the locker to see an assortment of personalized
          belongings, uniform and gear, none of it seeming familiar.
          He uses a towel to wipe off the layer of sweat and oily
          substance coating his body, pausing to see an identification
          tattoo on his forearm that reads: FLT>>005Â»015.
          He pulls on a black flight suit, emblems and military
          markings of rank on the chest. He pulls on shoes and a tool
          belt with a high powered pen-lamp.
          On the inside of the locker is a emergency manual card with
          block figures displaying breathing and stretching exercises,
          labelled; Hyper-Sleep Disorientation Recovery Procedures.

          beautiful young woman smiling towards camera. He stares at
          the-photo, his frown deepening with confusion. He checks the
          back for a name, but nothing. He tucks the photo into a
          pocket and exits.

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - LATER

          BOWER waves his hand over a sensor... no power. He steps in
          front of a heavy set of steel doors, flipping several
          switches and... nothing.

                         CUT TO:
          BOWER breaks open a storage bin, pulling out beverage packets
          and a cup, taking a seat at the control desk. With Evalon's
          photograph leaned against the console, he becomes lost in a
          gaze as he gulps down nutrient pills and stirs an instant
          coffee as we...

                         PUSH IN
          There is a conflict in his eyes, memories trying to return.

                         FLASH CUT
          An image FLASHES past, EVALON smiling as BOWER kneels next to
          her, gripping her hands.
          BOWER'S gaze remains hollow, frown deepening as he sips the
          cup and... winces with disgust.

                         BOWER
          Faa-uck!
          Distant THUMPS. He pans the pen-lamp across the ceiling and
          toward the sounds... PAYTON'S sleep chamber.
          THUMP, THUMP, THUMP: Muffled and desperate. CRACK! Bower
          jumps back as someone kicks their way out from inside, the
          hatch bursting open. Out climbs...
          PAYTON, a man in his forties, but the rugged physique of a
          man half his age, lean and agile. His military-style hair
          cut is also pure white. Gasping for breath, he hits the
          floor as BOWER tries to help him. PAYTON jerks with shock.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Whoa! Hey... easy! Lt. Payton? You're-
          Sir... whoa!
          PAYTON chokes and gasps, then glances up, giving Bower a once
          over with a frown and a sobering tone.

          in the com and I can't even-

                         PAYTON
          Where's the... rest of the crew? It's
          our shift? Our rotation-

                         BOWER
          I believe so.

          Aren't they suppose to be here... to wake
          us?

                         BOWER
          Sir... I don't know where anyone is.
          PAYTON takes breaths, trying to regain his senses, glancing
          around at their darkened surroundings.

                         PAYTON
          Hit the lights, will ya?

                         BOWER
          Ah... we're having some power problems-

                         PAYTON
          Who woke you up?

                         BOWER
          Umm, not sure. It had to have been the
          flight computer. There's no one here...
          (off his look)
          .except us.

                         PAYTON
          Cold in here.
          BOWER grabs him a towel and water container, turning back to
          see PAYTON doesn't waste any time, stretching his limbs.

                         BOWER
          There's no power coming off the main
          grid. Can't fire any of the...
          (searching for word)
          Dynos. Can't even open the doors.
          PAYTON glances to the other empty sleep-chamber with a frown.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          (off his look)
          Our 2nd Lieutenant? I don't know where
          he is. It was empty when I woke up.
          None of the systems are on-line.
          Mainframe is down, so I don't know how or
          why it engaged independently-

          gonna have to repeat all this shit, so
          let's just idle here for a bit.

                         BOWER
          Sorry. I just- Just glad to see you
          awake. i was... a little concerned. I
          didn't know what to do if-
          PAYTON gets to his feet, stumbling. BOWER catches him under
          the arm as they stagger into the wall.

          BOWER (CONT`D)
          Easy... Lieutenant. Easy.

                         PAYTON
          Coffee?

                         BOWER
          I'm on it.

                         PAYTON
          Good man.
          BOWER helps him to the locker room as LIGHTS FLICKER past.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          PAYTON staggers along the row of storage lockers as BOWER
          helps guide him with the flashlight beam. PAYTON pauses with
          a frown as he glances across the name-plates, none of them
          seeming familiar. BOWER gestures toward the locker, the name-
          plate reads: LT. PAYTON.

                         BOWER
          This is you, sir.

                         PAYTON
          How do you know that?

                         BOWER
          1 It's... the name on your sleep pod, sir.
          PAYTON opens the door to see his belongings inside, a photo
          of WIFE (MARIANNE) inside the door. He stares at it with
          utter confusion. BOWER takes this in, looking to the memory
          recovery card inside the locker.

          it says that the memory loss is only
          suppose to be a momentary loss that's-

                         PAYTON
          Very reassuring. I guess when you gamma
          the brain into extended REM, sometimes it
          can take a while to get it back.
          PAYTON pulls on his flight uniform and squeezes his feet into
          his shoes. BOWER notices the identification tattoo on his
          forearm, partially obscured from view;
          FLT>>00... (obscured by grime, hair and angle). Unlike his
          own, PAYTON'S tattoo is faded with age.

                         BOWER
          I've been awake for at least an hour and
          I still can't remember my... anything.

                         PAYTON
          Listen, the last time I crawled out of a
          hyper bunk, it took me... quite a while
          to get it all back.
          BOWER holds his frown as PAYTON squeezes his finger into a
          wedding ring.

                         BOWER
          What was... your last flight, sir?

                         PAYTON

                         (BEAT)
          Don't recall. The Kuiper Belt odyssey?
          Don't worry, it'll come back, eventually.
          PAYTON kisses the photo of his wife.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          I've gone through this before. I just
          can't remember why I would agree to do it
          again.
          PAYTON goes to close his locker and BOWER motions with a
          serious tone.

                         BOWER
          Sir? I know this is going to sound
          strange, but do you even know where we're
          going? I can remember the training,
          but... not the mission. Know the
          procedures, not the... destination.

                         BOWER
          Didn't even know the ship's name until I
          saw it-on the console. For all I know
          this was another damn training exercise-

                         PAYTON
          Trust me, it's not. if this is a
          simulation...
          PAYTON notices both of their reflections off the mirrored
          panel inside the locker... revealing their WHITE HAIR.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          Someone is taking the joke a little far.
          He shuts the locker and they exit, the flashlight's beam
          panning away, taking us into darkness.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT/CONTROL DESK - LATER

          BOWER and PAYTON are standing at the control console, the
          screens flickering with distortion. BOWER hands him a coffee
          and PAYTON takes a sip... with a wince of disgust.

                         BOWER
          None of the activators are working.

                         PAYTON
          Figures. We can ride two hundred
          thousand tons of space freighter across
          the galaxy without a dent in the hood,
          but can't get one good cup of coffee.
          PAYTON flips a few switches with no result of power.

                         BOWER
          Without the mainframe, we can't connect.
          I don't know how we'll ever be able to-
          PAYTON is in his element at the control desk, flipping open
          an emergency auxiliary-power panel. He snaps open a handle
          and he forcefully gives it several rotations with a MOAN of
          whirling magnetos. The hand-crank allows a dim glow of
          electricity to the light panels.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Oh, I- didn't even think of that.

          PAYTON gives him a look with a grin and flips a switch.

          Payton of flight Team...? Shit-

          Five.

                         PAYTON
          Five? How do you know that?
          BOWER pulls up his sleeve, exposing his tattoo ID. PAYTON
          nods, "good thinking."

                         PAYTON (CONT-D)
          Lt. Payton of Flight Team Five. Does
          anyone copy? Anyone... respond? Anyone
          awake up there?
          Dead static.

                         BOWER
          Team Four suppose to be here for the
          shift rotation. Where could they be?

                         PAYTON
          Fucking teamsters. Maybe they couldn't
          get to us.
          BOWER eyes the third empty sleep-chamber.

                         BOWER
          Where could he have gone?
          PAYTON gazes off blankly. A RUMBLE of FLICKERING LIGHTS pass
          and the computer screens slowly fade, going black.

                         PAYTON
          The power systems must be free-floating
          off blown circuits or something. The
          over-ride grid won't even lock in.

                         BOWER
          Whatta ya think?

                         PAYTON
          I think we need to find a deck of cards
          and call the union.
          Distant THUMPS are heard overhead and they freeze... watching
          the ceiling with uncertainty.

          Hmm. Ventilation... maybe. Systems keep
          re-booting after each surge. That could
          be anything.
          THUMPS fade as the ship eerily MOANS and CREAKS.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          I say we get out of here. I'd rather be
          up and out then stuck in the trunk.
          The room is blocked by the two heavy steel doors on either
          end, security doors ten feet wide. PAYTON leads the way
          towards one end, gesturing towards the doors.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          We're not far from the bridge but without
          the circuits locked in... I don't know
          how we could ever get this thing open.
          As they approach, their flashlight beams pan across the door
          to see jagged chips and scratches all along the edges. Tools
          are scattered on the floor, the control panel ripped open.

                         BOWER
          Jesus. Somebody was trying to get out.

                         PAYTON
          Ironic. I think it was built to protect
          us.

                         BOWER
          (gesturing to the third pod)
          Well, he got out... some how.
          A RUMBLE approaches... another SHUDDER that FLICKERS the
          lights. They watch the ceiling as BOWER counts in his head
          as it fades.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Cycle is broken.

          What?

                         BOWER
          It's not circuitry. Reactor timing is
          off-set in the core. Seems sporadic, but
          it's not. Each revolution decreasing
          before starting over from the beginning.

          How the hell do you know that?

                         BOWER
          I dunno. I can't remember my own- but I
          know everything there is to know about
          that damn reactor.

          Another SHUDDER approaches.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          That's twelve revolutions, before
          recycling. And this one will only last-
          As they watch the ceiling, their flashlight beams stop on a
          small ventilation shaft that's been ripped open. They
          exchange a look and...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER

          Their lights spill inside an endless steel shaft only a foot
          and a half in diameter, leading into darkness.

                         PAYTON
          Now if we only had a monkey and a rope.
          PAYTON climbs down as BOWER rotates his jaw with eagerness.

                         BOWER
          Our 2nd Lieutenant must have gone this
          way. Don't you think?

          Must have.

                         BOWER
          It's the only way out.

          holds the pen-lamp in his teeth and begins to crawl, pushing
          himself forward on his stomach, only several inches at a time
          in a rhythmic motion.

          BOWER panics as he begins to slide forward into a downward
          sloping shaft, clawing at the walls. The flashlight falls,
          rolling and sliding into the darkened abyss. He frantically
          tries to grip a pipe, but his hand slips, picking up speed.

          BOWER (CONT`D)
          No, no... N00000!
          He slides head first into a vertical drop, the shaft
          tightening like a funnel, crushing his lungs and SLAM! He
          crashes into a steel grate where his flashlight lays. It's a
          nightmarish head stand, his neck twisted with all his weight
          on top of himself, squirming with no where to squirm.

          BOWER!?
          The flashlight falls through the grate and he watches in
          horror as the light drops, fading from sight, taking him into
          darkness.

                         BOWER

          All he can hear is the muffled, panicked struggle. The

          The RUMBLE approaches. A SHUDDER that sends a domino effect
          of metallic CLANKS towards him from below. Small shafts of
          light break through as small vents open in the side walls.
          His fingers dig the envelope opener from his pocket as the
          RUMBLE fades, CLANKING the vents shut just as...
          He stabs the envelope opener into an open vent. Metal bends.
          He begins to BANG his elbow against the vent, over and over.

          the direction of the valves and guesses, picking a direction.
          He walks to the edge of the next corridor and pauses with a
          frown. Glancing down the side corridor, fifty yards away,
          something is off. Within the symmetrical framing of steel,
          there is a rounded shape that is out of place.
          Be cautiously steps closer as the object takes the shape
          of... a MAN, standing at the edge of a doorway, head slightly

          MAN is dead, hanging from a cable around his neck, naked and
          gutted like an animal, his feet hanging an inch off the
          floor. His face is brutally beaten.

          He continues his search across the radio channels, keeping

          Hundreds of lunch tables and chairs. Random SPARKS of light

          As he moves across the massive room, the neatly lined rows
          gradually become more dishevelled, chairs knocked over and
          unknown liquid dripping from the tables. Garbage litters the
          floor, a dim glow of light emerging from the galley.
          He crawls along the edge of the counter and peeks inside the
          galley, horribly ran-sacked. In the midst of the wreckage, a
          darkened FIGURE is seen scavenging through the cupboards,
          angrily tossing empty containers aside.
          The FIGURE pauses, sensing a presence and glances back as...
          BOWER ducks. He contemplates, pulling out the envelope
          opener and slowly peeks back out and...
          POW! He's HIT in the face, blood spraying, slamming onto his
          back. The pen-lamp and envelope opener spin across the
          floor. BOWER tries to get up and he's grabbed by the hair, a
          blade pressed against his neck.

                         I
          A woman's voice growls into his ear, in German.

          She quickly pats him down, stealing tools. All he can see is
          her bare feet, blackened from oil. He frowns to see her toe-
          nails painted with bright pink polish.
          NADIA, a torn jump suit, snarled hair hiding her face, skin
          smeared with oil. A beautiful woman underneath an
          apocalyptic smear of grunge. Her hair is pure white, high-

          the fight through the flicker of light.
          CRACK! BOWER'S hit, sent flying and he looks up to see her
          silhouette approaching, edged weapon in her hand.

                         BOWER
          Stop! Stop it! Listen to me! Hold it!
          she attacks and he frantically throws dishes and chairs to
          fend her off. She throws the blade, the blunt end deflecting
          off his forearm.

          attack abruptly halts, slowly back pedalling with fright.
          BOWER is confused, realizing her eyes are looking past him.
          A BLUISH GLOW seeps in from the doorway, approaching from the
          corridor. He looks back to see NADIA is running for the
          kitchen... gone.

          He ducks below the tables as a FIGURE slowly enters the room,
          carrying a long steel spear-like device with a splinter of
          blinding BLUE FIRE on the tip, fueled with a chemical sprayer
          like a welder's torch.
          His obstructed view reveals the FIGURE as a tribal warrior,
          scantily clad, elongated muscular frames, pale skin coated in
          hydraulic fluid. Bald head with clumps of tangled hair. It
          moves smoothly and silently, jabbing the tip of the flaming
          device into each corner and crevasse, as if flushing out
          anything hidden.

                         BOWER (CONT-D)
          (under his breath)
          What the hell is-
          The FIGURE quickly spins his direction and SNAPS a lever on
          the spear-device, killing the blue flame and taking us
          instantly into darkness.
          BOWER holds his breath with fright, back pedalling on his
          knees as his eyes try to adjust to the dark. He takes an
          uneasy breath to realize... there is more then one.
          Slowly moving out of the shadows, four more HUNTERS slowly
          emerge, like a unified pack on the prowl. They carry an
          assortment of crudely made weapons, spears and blades of
          sharpened metal.
          The apparent leader of the pack is HEFLIN, the largest and
          strongest of the group and he directs the pack with an
          assortment of odd vocal sounds, deep HISSES from the throat
          and gargled CACKLES.
          On command, the one HUNTER flips a lever and the BLUE FLAME
          crackles back to life with a burst of flammable liquid. The
          hunt continues, the pack weaving through the debris,
          following NADIA'S path.
          As the BLUISH GLOW fades, BOWER is left bewildered and
          terrified. Suddenly, his radio sounds...

          PAYTON (ON RADIO)
          Is that you!? Bower--

          The only clear view is off an overturned bowl that shows
          WEASEL'S face, oddly contorted in the rounded reflection.
          WEASEL is headed directly for BOWER until.., a HISS from
          HEFLIN calls him back. WEASEL takes one last look before
          turning back, the torch fades from view, taking us into
          black.

          begins to crawl away.

          simple as that. A systems malfunction.
          BOWER pauses his climb, looking up towards the "apparent
          window", inside what appears to be a bluish moon, dotted with
          craters. He eagerly continues his climb, growing closer.

          That was the report... but don't you
          remember the story of the one flight
          officer... the real story? They say he
          went lunar, launched the entire ship,
          five thousand people killed with the flip
          of a switch. All from a bad case of
          cabin fever-?

                         PAYTON
          spook story, along with a million others.
          Eden was mechanical failure, not human
          error. A. glitch... that was remedied way
          before we ever-

                         BOWER
          And why did they switch the rotation
          shifts from three years to two? And they
          eliminated the manual over-ride-

                         PAYTON
          They did that for obvious reasons, not
          because of Eden.
          BOWER pauses... within reach of the window only to realize it
          was an illusion. A glass compartment door left slightly ajar
          was reflecting a circular light panel, smeared with oil to
          give the illusion of craters. His shoulders drop in defeat.

                         BOWER
          Well, at least we didn't wake up...
          floating away in a coffin.

          BOWER climbs down, peering out into the corridor.

                         BOWER
          Something happened to the other team?
          Maybe there was... Pandorum.
          BOWER looks to his own hand, cradling the weapon... his
          FINGERS gently TREMBLING. He makes a fist and shakes his
          hand, firmly grabbing the weapon.

          BOWER heads down the corridor, making a turn as...

                         ANGLE ON
          A shadowed FIGURE steps into view, slowly following his path
          into darkness.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK

          PAYTON is lost in thought as he watches the computer screens
          slowly fade with power. He grabs the hand-crank lever, but
          pauses to hear the sounds are returning, muffled and distant.

          THUMP, SCRAPE... RATTLE.
          He turns his light towards the ceiling and wall, which almost
          seems to silence the sounds. The crackle of the radio snaps
          him from his thoughts...

          INT. CORRIDOR

          BOWER is crouched in the corridor, panning his light down the
          corridor with shifting eyes of confusion.

                         BOWER
          Have I done a circle or am I doubling
          back?

                         BOWER
          I've seen this before. This-
          We follow his flashlight to reveal... a BODY tangled in a
          wire snare. It appears to be the same dead body he witnessed
          before, but as he steps closer, it's different. This body
          has ripped clothing and isn't gutted.
          It's... SHEPARD, a thin-framed man in a torn crew uniform,
          tangled in a wire snare wrapped tightly under his arm and
          around his neck.

          SHEPARD'S eyes POP open wide with a terrified expression,
          completely silent until BOWER sees him. BOWER jumps with
          fright and SHEPARD wildly squirms, SCREAMING bloody-murder.

                         SHEPARD

          AAAAEEEE IH !
          His SCREAMS echo down the corridor, desperately fighting
          back, like an animal caught in a trap.

                         BOWER
          Stop it! Jesus, I'm not gonna- SHUT-UP!

                         SHEPARD

          NO! PLEASE!! AAAERRGH!
          BOWER hits him in the gut, knocking the air from his lungs.
          SHEPARD crumbles, wheezing for air, going silent.

                         BOWER

          thing. But, you have to be quiet,
          understand?
          SHEPARD'S gaze is hollow and disturbed, deeply traumatized.
          BOWER pulls on the wire that's rigged to the hydraulics of a
          nearby doorway, SHEPARD moans.

          Bower, you sure that's a good idea? He

          floor gasping. BOWER kneels over him to help, but SHEPARD
          erupts with a shriek, like a hyper-sensitive rape victim.

          PAYTON (ON RADIO) (CONT'D)

          BOWER hesitates, the flashlight reveals SHEPARD'S

          soaked bandages. It reads; FLT//006//017

          Hey? You with me? You're gonna be
          alright. Hear me?
          Squinting past the glare of the flashlight, SHEPARD notices
          BOWER'S clean uniform and the radio boom on his chin. He
          begins to weep, tears of joy and agony.

                         SHEPARD

          i SHEPARD feels along the pipes until he finds one leaking oil.
          He vigorously begins to rub the oil onto his body.

          SHEPARD rubs oil across his neck and then goes to check the
          corner, wrapping a strap around his fist to secure a
          screwdriver into his hand.

                         SHEPARD

          both look to see... the GLOW of BLUE TORCFE'S growing.
          SHEPARD begins to tremble, backing away. BOWER sets his jaw,
          stepping out into the corridor and slowly cranks the power-

          BOWER turns and runs, trying to follow SHEPARD as SHADOWED
          HUNTERS move past the end of the corridor.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FILTRATION COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          BOWER has a difficult time trying to keep up as SHEPARD
          weaves through a compartment filled with filtration units and
          a maze of piping.
          BOWER spots a clear path but BUMPS into glass. He realizes
          the compartment is separated by thick glass dividers. He
          changes directions and sees SHEPARD crawling through a vent.
          He tries to follow as... a BLUE TORCH moves past the doorway,
          bare feet running across steel. A collection of HISS and
          CACKLES grow louder.
          BOWER crawls under piping to hide. He notices the activation
          lights on his weapon fading... and he quietly tries to give
          the energy lever a few turns... but the WHINE seems too loud.
          He spots SHEPARD twenty feet away, hidden behind a console.
          I They exchange a look and SHEPARD angrily waves him away.

                         SHEPARD

          Don't follow me! I can't help you-
          SHANK! A wire noose SNAPS tight around SHEPARD'S neck. Much
          like a pole and wire rig used to wrangle alligators, the wire
          is released from the rig and SHEPARD bursts into a wild
          frenzy, trying to run while on a thirty foot long leash. The
          wire loops and tangles around the piping as...
          HUNTERS move in from every direction, blades whirling.
          SHEPARD'S SCREAM intensifies as the HUNTERS huddle over him.
          BOWER viciously cranks the energy lever on the weapon and
          climbs out of his hiding place as... SCREAMS intensify
          within the brutal attack as the HUNTERS begin to feed.
          SEEPARD'S neck is twisted far enough to SNAP!

          I BOWER raises the gun towards the back of the lead hunter,
          only fifteen feet away. He pulls the trigger and rusted
          metal SCREECHES! Jammed.

          He panics, grabbing the gun with both hands, checking for a
          safety switch and... KA-WHAP! The weapon discharges a
          tremendous BLAST of energy off to the side.
          -The weapon is designed to destroy biological and organic
          material, but for safety precautions, it's unable to
          penetrate man-made materials like lead, glass or steel. It's
          unable to puncture the ship's hull.
          The energy blast is an electrical discharge that CRACKS like
          lightening and echoes like thunder. The blast HITS the side
          of the wall with a deafening RIPPLE of aftershocks,
          shattering anything fragile and knocking over anything not
          fastened down within a thirty foot radius. This little thing
          packs a punch.
          The HUNTERS turn towards BOWER, the lead hunter turning to
          reveal itself as...
          } HEFLIN, a muscular-frame larger then the rest, skin
          glistening with a layer of hydraulic fluid along with tribal
          I scars and distorted war paint. His eyes hidden under shadow.
          He slowly lifts his shoulders while lowering his head, much
          like the fluid motions of a reptilian predator.
          BOWER frantically cranks the energy lever and raises it
          toward HEFLIN, completely unaffected by the threat. He
          squeezes the trigger and...
          KA-WHAP! The gunshot is THUNDEROUS, HITTING the unseen glass
          divider between them. The safety glass absorbs the blast,
          sending a SHUDDER through the hull.
          HEFLIN barely flinches, stepping closer with a HISS. Off his
          command, the HUNTERS take chase, swarming in every direction,
          searching for a route around the glass divider.
          BOWER runs for his life.

          BOWER is running like a madman, ricochetting off doorways and
          tripping over pipes in the darkness.

                         BOWER
          They got him! They fucking ripped him
          apart! They're-

          PAYTON (ON RADIO)
          Don't look back! Hear me? Just go! GO!
          BOWER finds an open corridor and sprints as...
          Blades SCRAPE across metal, Blue.torches ROAR, HISSES echo.
          BOWER gasps heavily, hyper-ventilating as he catches glimpses
          of HUNTERS on his trail and running parallel in adjacent
          corridors, closing in with unnatural agility and speed.

          I He runs through a doorway and a thin metal strip HITS him in
          the legs... SHANK! Wires SNAP and HYDRAULICS MOAN. Hitting
          the booby-trap at full speed causes the wire to rip out of
          the door frame and...
          BOWER tumbles as the wire loops around his leg and he FALLS
          off the edge of a loading shaft, into an open elevator shaft
          that drops into darkness.
          The wire tightens and he's swung by the foot back into an
          open corridor, two floors below, like a demented base-jumper.
          He SLAMS into the ceiling and spins wildly over the open
          shaft as his transmitter falls all the way to the bottom
          exploding on IMPACT.

          Aaaargh!
          Footsteps are heard approaching overhead. On the floor below
          him are his weapon and flashlight. He stretches for the
          gun... too far from his reach.
          The flashlight is "on", illuminating the area. He pushes off
          the wall and reaches for it... fingers touching, but unable
          to grab it.
          The GLOW of torches grows in the loading shaft and BOWER
          pushes off, reaching for the flashlight. Unable to retrieve
          it, instead he pushes it... into the open loading shaft. It
          drops all the way to the bottom as...

                         ANGLE ON
          HUNTERS step up to the edge of the shaft, looking down to see
          the flashlight fall from sight...

                         ANGLE ON
          BOWER swings back, grabs the wall and freezes.

                         ANGLE ON
          The HUNTERS hear the flashlight HIT the bottom of the shaft
          and then slowly double back. Torches fading.

          ANGLE ON/CLOSE UP
          BOWER'S face fills with blood as he hangs upside down, trying
          to catch his breath. His grip is weakening as he looks up to
          see... a shadowed FIGURE crouched with a spear in hand,
          leering at him from the shadows, approaching. With no time
          to defend himself and no where to go...

          SCREECH!
          The cable is violently tugged from above, jerking BOWER
          upward, pulling him away from the wall. He spins wildly
          trying to grab back onto the wall as...

          SCREECH!
          The cable yanks BOWER upwards with enough force to hit the
          ceiling and swing toward the open shaft. His fingers claw at
          the wall as he's literally being reeled in like a fish. He
          sees the FIGURE charging with a bladed spear. He's knows
          he's done for and...

          SNAP! The wire is slashed, BOWER breaks free hitting the
          floor as the cable is jerked up and out of sight.

                         ANGLE ON
          The silhouettes of the HUNTERS on the ledge, several levels
          above, inspect the loose cable and after a HISS, they turn
          back, fading into the shadows.
          BOWER lays on his back, squirming in the tangled wire as the
          FIGURE hovers over him, spinning a bladed weapon in his hand.

          BOWER (CONT' D )
          Please... don't- Please, listen-
          The FIGURE slashes BOWER'S sleeve, rips away the fabric and
          looks at his identification tattoo.
          BOWER quits squirming as the FIGURE leans closer into the
          light with a curious frown.
          TANAKA, a Japanese man in ripped and modified clothing.
          Unlike the awkward gauntness of the HUNTERS, he has a full-
          framed, hard-edged physique and soft brown eyes.

          TANAKA is dead pan. BOWER flinches as TANAKA picks up the
          energy gun and then... flips it over, handing it back to him.
          BOWER cautiously accepts as he climbs to his feet.

          idiocy. TANAKA nods, but with obviously no clue what was
          1 just said. They stare at one another in silence.
          TANAKA hands him a flashlight. BOWER does his best charades,
          gesturing to himself and pointing to the ship.

          The SOUNDS remain muffled, deeper within the wall, possibly
          from inside the ventilation shaft.
          PAYTON contemplates, eyes panicked. He climbs up the wall
          and wedges the panel cover over the shaft opening, jamming it
          closed with a screwdriver. He backs away, gripping the
          weapon, ready for anything. He tries to control his
          breathing as he sits... watches... and waits.

          TRAP.

          steps through a doorway and into...
          A rec room with several rows of pool tables, video games and
          a ran-sacked bar. The floor is heavily littered with broken
          glass and BOWER wipes his finger across a wet surface on the

          TANAKA has come to his rescue, twirling a pipe across his
          palms. The ATTACKER rolls to her feet to reveal... NADIA.
          She snatches a pool ball off the table and throws it directly
          into TANAKA'S chest.

          She rolls across the floor, grabbing her knife and... BOWER
          BLINDS her with his flashlight, raising the gun with a quick
          whirl of the energy lever, laser sights flaring brightly.

          BOWER ducks as a broken bottle WHIZZES past his face,
          smashing against the wall. He raises the gun and...
          KA-RAAAACK! A deliberate warning shot goes past NADIA and
          HITS the bar, SHATTERING every piece of glass that's near by
          and NADIA and TANAKA are both blown off their feet.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          As long as we understand each other.
          They head out of the room as... NADIA watches from the
          shadows with a curious frown.

          INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

          BOWER and TANAKA head down the corridor, both of them
          checking their backs as they come to a sealed doorway.
          TANAKA is still wincing, rubbing his chest with pain.

                         TANAKA

                         (BITTERLY)

                         BOWER
          Yeah... well no sympathy here. She left
          me with a few sore spots too, pal.
          They both go to work, attempting to wedge the door open with
          pipes. BOWER looks back to see... NADIA. They back pedal
          with weapons in hand and NADIA is unaffected, watching them
          with a frown.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Listen, lady. We don't want any-

          Yeah. I'm... a corporal, I'm-

                         NADIA
          I didn't think there was any flight crew
          left. What's happened to us?

                         BOWER
          That's what I'm trying to figure out.
          Malfunction of some sort-

                         NADIA
          Gee, you think? Where are you going?

                         BOWER
          I'm heading for the reactor bay.

                         NADIA
          You just wake up?

                         BOWER
          Just joining the program already in
          progress, yeah.
          She eyes him over and TANAKA keeps the pipe raised.

                         NADIA
          You'll never make it.

                         BOWER
          Oh yeah? And why is that?

                         NADIA
          You're going the wrong direction.
          She grimaces and turns, heading back up the corridor. BOWER
          and TANAKA exchange a look. BOWER chases after her.

                         BOWER
          Hey? Wait a second- HEY?

                         NADIR

          Wait- Can't join the team without a
          name.

                         NADIA
          Team? Why would I want to join?

                         BOWER
          Because I need you to show me the way.

                         NADIA
          To the reactor? No thanks. Don't like
          going that fax down. No one ever comes
          back.
          She continues up the corridor and BOWER grabs her arm. She
          yanks away from his touch, squaring off, weapon in hand.

                         BOWER
          Hold on. Please- There's not much time
          left before we lose everything onboard.
          You understand what I'm trying to-

                         I NADIA
          Do you know where this ship is headed?

                         BOWER
          I'm working on it.

                         NADIA
          Can you fly it?

                         BOWER
          Huh?

                         NADIA
          Can you fly it... if you have to?

                         (NOT SURE)
          Sure.
          NADIA eyes him over, sizing him up.

                         NADIR
          I'll get you as close to it as I can.
          But, I won't wait for you.

          LIGHTS FLICKER past as...
          NADIA leads them down a long corridor that widens into an
          atrium of shafts going into the darkness in every direction.
          The further their lights pan across the shafts... a strange
          assortment of odd colored algae and moss is revealed growing
          up the walls of the shafts.
          TANAKA keeps a watchful eye as BOWER frowns at the
          surroundings.

                         BOLTER
          You know where you're going? This

          How long have you been awake?

                         NADIA
          Don't know. There's no way to tell time
          in here. Two... maybe three months.

                         BOWER

          MONTHS!?
          His voice echoes across the cavernous atrium and she glares-

                         NADIA
          Quiet! You wanna get us killed!?

          NADIA stops at the foot of a large steel door, gesturing for
          them to crouch in the shadows, watching the corridor.

                         BOWER
          Where are we going? What are we doing-

                         NADIA
          i Shush! We're waiting.

          Quiet!
          At the far end of the corridor, a faint BLUISH GLOW grows
          stronger. Shadows are moving, growing closer.

                         SHIT-
          NADIA gestures for them to stay put. TANAKA wants to leave,
          but BOWER grabs his shoulder. They both grip weapons,
          glancing to NADIA as the HUNTERS seem to be headed their way.

          The HISS and CACKLES of the HUNTERS grow closer and it seems
          they're shortly going to be cornered and done for until...
          A SHUDDER is felt, a FLICKER of LIGHTS approaching. She goes
          to a control panel, holds down a switch and presses her palm
          F across a scanner.
          As the power SURGE passes, the control panel activates,
          scanning her hand and the steel door activates with a MOAN of
          hydraulics. BOWER notices her ID tattoo; BIO-T>>218>>076.

          the lock with a CLANK.

          Never quite felt like sticking around to
          find out. Running... is always the best
          option. Believe me.

                         BOWER
          They're not- They can't be from this
          ship. They don't seem... human. Do you
          think something got on board or maybe
          I something...
          He turns to follow her and pauses to see...
          The BIO-VAULT. A large lab storage compartment that has been
          "lived-in" for a long time. A bed has been created from
          assorted chair cushions and there is a collection of
          scavenged items. NADIA adds to the items, dumping the
          belongings of her bag onto the floor.
          BOWER is in awe as he approaches an entire wall of glass test
          tubes, a maze of micro-biological containers, glimmering with
          condensation.

          NADIA checks a few gauges on the wall of tubes and makes
          adjustments on the monitoring system. He senses her
          meticulous care for the material.

          You've been living in here? You're...

          It' seems to be the only living thing left
          on this ship worth protecting.
          Regardless of the situation, we still
          have a mission. We've only lost about
          thirty percent of the specimens, mostly
          reptilian class. Never was big into
          snakes anyway.
          BOWER doesn't share the attempt at humor, wandering towards a
          darkened digital screen on the wall, displaying a charted
          graph of the new planet, TANIS.

                         BOWER

          You couldn't remember?

                         BOWER
          No, I- I didn't remember just how far
          away it is... until now. This was a
          hundred and twenty-three year flight.
          NADIA begins to gather a few items shoving them into a bag.
          TANAKKA leans closer to the glass display with fascination,
          tapping the tubes to see movement inside.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          How could I have forgotten that?

                         NADIA
          It comes only in pieces. Even after a
          few months. I know everything about this
          vault and its systems... but I still
          can't remember where I grew up. Or my
          brother's name. Only pieces... And the
          training comes back first. For good
          reason, I guess.

          consoles coated in algae.

          couple years to turn coal into fucking
          diamonds.

                         BOWER
          You think we've over slept?

          then you may think.
          BOWER tosses the orange brick. to TANAKA and he sniffs it with
          a grin, breaking off a piece. NADIA finishes gathering tools
          and she slings the bag over her shoulder, "ready to go".

          You want in? Come and get it you fu-
          The screwdriver SNAPS and the panel hits the floor. PAYTON
          raises the pipe, preparing to fight and... A desperate gasp
          is heard from inside the shaft.

          GALLO (O.S.)
          Help... me!
          PAYTON pauses, angling the light inside to see... GALLO, a
          young flight officer, boyish innocence, short-cropped hair,
          heavily coated in sweat, desperation in his eyes. His hair
          is dark brown, the only person without pure white hair.

                         PAYTON
          Who the hell... are you!?
          GALLO is tightly wedged inside the shaft, squirming to crawl
          out, trembling with fear and exhaustion.

                         GALLO
          Help me- I'm part- of the flight crew!
          I'm- Please- HELP ME!
          PAYTON oddly hesitates... before lowering the weapon. He
          digs into the shaft grabbing GALLO'S hand, pulling him out.
          GALLO collapses onto the floor, crumbling into a fetal
          position, naked. His hands are locked in claw-like grips,
          trembling uncontrollably. His gasps are rapid and unsteady.

          Easy... Easy. You're all right.
          PAYTON runs to grab a towel and water. As he turns back he
          notices GALLO'S hip and legs are sprayed with dried blood.
          PAYTON kneels over him and GALLO spasms from his touch.

                         GALLO

          PAAARRRGH !

                         PAYTON
          EASY! I'm here to help you!
          PAYTON lifts the bottle to his lips, but the water runs down
          his face, GALLO is frozen in shock.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          Com'on. Try to drink a little. Here.
          GALLO is unresponsive, wide eyes locked in a trance.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          What's your name? Huh? Can you hear me?

                         GALLO

                         (MUMBLING)
          Gallo.

                         PAYTON
          What's that? Gallo...?
          PAYTON frowns, mumbling the name with a hint of recognition.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          Corporal... Gallo?

                         GALLO

          Yes, sir.

                         PAYTON
          Where did you come from, Gallo?

                         GALLO
          The... bridge.
          Saying the words seems to send him into a terrified trance.

                         PAYTON
          The bridge!? Where are we? What's
          happened? Can you tell me-

          The more PAYTON inquires, the more GALLO begins to unravel,
          emotionally. His eyes widen with terror, breath quickening.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          Corporal?

          GASP, GASP, GASP...

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          Tell me... what happened?
          GALLO is hyper-ventilating, eyes wide with terror. A droplet
          of blood slowly builds in his nostril, refusing to drip. A
          low whine is heard in his throat as... LIGHTS FLICKER past.

          INT. VENTILATION SHAFT -- LATER

          A hatch is broken open and BOWER'S flashlight beam peers into
          a ventilation shaft. Twenty feet inside the shaft the walls
          are collapsed, blocking passage. NADIA sighs with dread.

                         NADIA
          We can't get through this way.

                         BOWER
          I'd prefer to stay on foot.

                         NADIA
          It's the safest way to travel. And
          there's only one other way to get through
          that I know of.

                         BOWER

          She leads the way along the wall and into a compartment of
          unimaginable size, fifty foot high steel walls that channel
          through the room. The walls are lined with hundreds of sleep
          chambers, stacked ten high on either side.
          They round a corner into the main atrium to see dishevelled
          equipment and smashed control consoles, scarred from battle.
          Old blood stains are worn deeply into the floor.

                         BOWER
          Jesus...
          As they venture deeper inside they see numerous sleep-
          chambers, open hatches and empty. The further they move
          along the wall, more and more empty pods, too many to count.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          My God. They're... empty. They're all-

          As the dozens and dozens of nameplates move past his
          flashlight, BOWER pauses.

          No, wait. My wife could be in here.
          BOWER'S focus completely shifts, turning towards the pods,
          reading name plates.

                         NADIA
          What does she do? What's her specialty?

                         BOWER
          She's not part of the crew, but spouses
          were brought with. I remember there were-

          They look to see TANAKA has fallen behind, crouched and
          peering off towards the dark. He's poised like a dog on the
          prowl that's caught a bad scent. They crouch and crawl to
          the adjacent corner.

                         BOWER
          I don't see what he's looking at, do you?

                         NADIA
          We have to keep moving. We don't want to
          stay out in the open for too long.

          Hey...? Let's go!
          Distant THUMPS are heard somewhere in the room and they
          tighten up with their weapons, eyes scanning. TANAKA refuses
          to look away, poised like a hunter.

                         NADIA
          We can't stay herel
          NADIA heads across the main floor and BOWER tries to wave him
          on, but TANAKA is locked onto something, refusing to waver.

                         BOWER
          Let's get out of here! Com'on-
          The THUMPS grow louder and TANAKA heads into the shadows.
          BOWER hesitates, turning to follow NADIA through a barricade
          of dishevelled equipment, leaving TANAKA behind.

          INT. PROCESSING DOCK -CONT.

          BOWER emerges from the barricades into a processing center
          for loading passengers, darkened and in shambles. NADIA is
          scanning the corridors ahead, choosing her path as BOWER
          rushes to catch her.

                         BOWER
          We can't just leave him. We have to wait-

          I NADIA quickly heads deeper into the room and down a darkened
          and narrowing tunnel. BOWER hesitates with frustration.
          Having to choose, he turns and chases after NADIA.
          I They crawl through a maze of machinery and NADIA'S pace is
          difficult for BOWER to keep up.

                         BOWER
          Wait! I'm coming-
          There's a CRUNCH under his foot. He lowers his light,
          picking up a small white object. He brings it closer to the
          light to realize it's... A HUMAN FINGER BONE.

          Behind BOWER is a massive stack of human skeletons and
          carcasses. They've just crawled into a pit of human remains.
          They both back away with horror only to see a mountain of
          carcasses on both sides. The only route is upward and they
          begin to crawl up the slope on their bellies, over dead
          remains.

          NADIA suddenly grabs him, a quick jerk to silence him. A
          SHADOW passes with a CACKLING HISS. They freeze, laying on
          top of the remains, the bones CRINKLING underneath them.
          The HISS grows stronger... and they look up to see a
          silhouetted HUNTER crouched over like a gargoyle on a rafter,
          leering in their direction.

                         (WHISPER)
          Don't move.
          They try to remain motionless, but the slope of the remains
          i CRINKLES underneath them and the hill of remains begins to
          slide. The HISS grows stronger.
          They hold their position until... a SHUDDER approaches with
          FLICKERING LIGHTS. The power surge is enough to ignite a
          small landslide underneath them.

                         SHIT-
          NADIA grabs his arm as bones snap and they slide helplessly
          to the bottom within a landslide of bones and flesh.
          The finally slide to a stop at the bottom of the slope and
          BOWER quickly raises his weapon towards the rafters to see...
          the HUNTER is gone.

          from five feet away. BOWER is STRUCK with enough force to
          send him flying, CRASHING into a pile of bones.
          NADIA spins around with a bladed pipe in her hands... but the
          HUNTER is already gone. She spins back and... THWAP! She's
          HIT from behind and sent with break-neck force into the
          floor. The HUNTER pounces onto her back and a claw-like hand
          grabs her hair... teeth opening towards her neck and...
          POW! BOWER charges into the HUNTER, tackling it and they
          spin into a brutal and distorted fight, seen under the
          FLICKERING LIGHT. Even though the HUNTER is a smaller one,of
          the pack, smaller then BOWER, its speed and strength is in-
          human. It grabs BOWER by the head with a GROWL and...

          with his bladed pipe into the HUNTER'S face. It's a hit that
          would normally kill anything, nearly taking its head off.
          The HUNTER stumbles, staggers and... HIIIISSSSSST! It HITS
          TANAKA, sending him airborne, nearly knocking him out.
          Under the FLICKERING LIGHT, BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA all
          attack the lone HUNTER, taking all three of them to bring it
          to the floor. They viciously pound it with pipes and blades
          until it finally stops flinching beneath them.
          Its pale white skin seeps a thick black colored blood. The
          three of them back away, gasping and coated in its blood.

          Its face is smashed beyond recognition, but its facial
          features are horrifically distorted, no sign of eyes under
          the shredded tissue.

          What the... what the hell is it!?
          The HUNTER flinches and our gang back pedals with fright.
          NADIA continues back pedalling, looking towards the rafters
          to see... HEFLIN silhouetted, leering towards them.

          clank through the hull.

          the walls come to life, HUNTERS swarming onto their path like
          a pack of wild dogs.
          Before diving through the barricade, BOWER looks back to see
          HEFLIN and his pack have paused... to eat the fallen HUNTER.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/MAIN CORRIDOR - CONT.

          It's a panicked and mad dash through the dark as they crawl
          through the barricade and run back into the main corridor of
          sleep chambers. HUNTERS can be heard closing on their trail.
          They round a corner and NADIA jumps inside an empty sleep-
          chamber, frantically trying to pull the hatch closed. TANAKA
          follows suite, jumping inside another chamber and BOWER
          scrambles, in search of an open door as footsteps are heard
          quickly approaching.
          In a frenzied panic, BOWER dives into the chamber with NADIA,
          tugging the hatch closed.

                         FOLLOW THRU:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER - CONT.

          BOWER and NADIA are cheek to cheek in the cramped space, both
          gasping for breath and dripping sweat with terror.
          Through the porthole... silhouetted HUNTERS move past with
          weapons in hand, search and destroy style. One HUNTER steps
          up only a few feet from their porthole and they freeze,
          holding their breath. Slowly the HUNTERS continue past, the
          shadows slowly fading from sight.

                         BOWER
          What the hell happened to them!? What
          the hell are those things!?

                         NADIA
          Shut-up!
          They listen for a long moment... hearing nothing as BOWER
          looks at his hand, finger tips trembling.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

          INT. SLEEPING CHAMBER/MAIN CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER

          The hatch door inches open and BOWER peeks out. He and NADIA
          crawl out quietly to see TANAKA waiting for them.

                         TANAKA
          Japanese - No subtitles.

                         BOWER
          I second that. Let's get the fuck out of
          here. Which way did we come from?

                         NADIA
          You want to go back?

                         BOWER
          No, I mean... let's just go!

                         NADIA
          We should go back. Find a different
          path. I don't think we can get through
          to the reactor bay from-

                         BOWER
          You said there was no other path.

                         NADIA
          I'm ready to explore other options-

                         BOWER
          Which way did they go-?

                         NADIA
          You really want to discuss it here!?
          A RUMBLE is heard approaching and they all crouch in unison.
          It's a power surge that sends FLICKERING LIGHTS across the
          massive corridor and a BLINKING LIGHT is activated on a
          nearby sleep-chamber. And then...
          BANG! The hatch door is KICKED from the inside, white gas
          erupting from the seam. Our gang quickly crawls toward the
          shadows, crouching behind equipment to watch as...
          Another KICK bursts open the hatch and a BIG PASSENGER crawls
          out, slamming onto the floor with a shiver of agony, gasping
          for breath, muscles twitching.

                         BIG PASSENGER

          AA.AAAA.RGH !

          73.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BIG PASSENGER tries to get to his feet, gasping and
          heaving, mumbling in Russian. BOWER tries to stand but NADIA
          pulls him back.

                         NADIA
          What are you doing-!?

                         BOWER
          They'll hear him- They'll- We've got to

                         HELP HIM-
          Footsteps thunder across the floor and... WHACK! The BIG
          PASSENGER is STRUCK by a single blow from HEFLIN. The
          HUNTERS have returned in full force and they come out of the
          shadows from every direction, bladed weapons spinning.
          BOWER pulls away from NADIA'S grip and prepares to intervene,
          but TANAKA suddenly grabs him, holding him back with force.
          With the BIG PASSENGER wounded and moaning on the floor, the
          HUNTERS gather in a circle in ceremonial fashion, praying
          thanks for the feast the ship has presented.
          They watch helplessly as the BIG PASSENGER is then brutally
          attacked and eaten alive. WEASEL leads other HUNTERS under
          the flickering light in a demented and twisted celebratory
          dance, a frenzy of pure evil.
          This attack is heard more then it is seen, under flickering
          lights, obscured view and most of the camera angles on Bower
          and the groups reactions.
          Frozen in horror, BOWER is tugged by TANAKA, following NADIA
          to the corner where she's lifted a grate in the floor. They
          climb into a shaft under the floor and into the dark as...
          The SCREAMS and HISSES echo through the hull.

          FADE THRU BLACK:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - LATER

          PAYTON is seated at the control desk, scrolling across radio
          frequencies, talking softly into the boom mic.

          PAYTON (INTO RADIO)
          Bower? Do you copy? You out there?
          Dead static. He sighs and glances toward GALLO, passed out
          on a nearby bunk. He hesitates, holding the pipe as a
          weapon, tucking it away and cautiously approached GALLO for a
          closer inspection.

                         CONTINUED:
          He feels his neck for a pulse. He notices the dried blood
          under his nose then gently pulls aside the blanket to see
          GALLO'S identification tattoo, reading; FLT>>004>>012.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          (frowning to himself)
          Team Four. Flight Team... Four?
          He glances up to see GALLO is now awake, staring at him.

                         GALLO
          What are you doing?

                         PAYTON
          Just... checking you.
          GALLO narrows his eyes, pulling the blanket tighter.

                         GALLO
          For what?

                         PAYTON
          To make sure you're... alright. You...
          passed out. You-

                         GALLO
          Who the hell are you?

                         PAYTON
          Payton... Lieutenant Payton.

                         GALLO
          Lieutenant? You're... a lieutenant?

                         PAYTON
          That's right. You're Team Four? You're
          suppose to be... my predecessor.
          GALLO deepens his frown, glancing around with disorientation.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          You said... you came from the bridge?
          GALLO shifts his eyes back on him, a bad topic.

                         GALLO

                         (LEERY)
          Yeah. So...?

                         PAYTON
          Where are we? I can't get guidance off
          this system and I have no idea where-

                         GALLO
          I don't know.

                         PAYTON
          Well, what did you see? How did--

                         GALLO
          Listen, I'm not a navigator. Stars all
          look alike. I don't know! How the hell
          would I know!?
          Sensing GALLO is about to break down again, PAYTON tries a
          calmer approach.

                         PAYTON
          Easy. I just want to make sure...
          GALLO'S hands are trembling, uncontrollably.

                         PAYTON (CONT'D)
          .you're okay-
          GALLO tucks his shaking hands under the blanket, defensively.

                         GALLO
          I'm fine.
          PAYTON lowers his stare, hesitating, glancing across the
          dried blood still splattered across his legs.

                         PAYTON
          Is this your blood... Corporal?

                         GALLO
          Some of it is... sir.

                         PAYTON
          Whose blood is it?
          GALLOholds his stare, jaw muscles tightening.

                         GALLO
          They didn't give me any choice.

                         PAYTON
          Who didn't?

                         GALLO
          There was something wrong with them.

                         PAYTON
          i Something was wrong with who?

                         CONTINUED: (3)
          Off his stare, he understands the implication.

          PAYTON (CONT' D )
          Your crew?

                         GALLO
          It was... Pandorum.
          (off his look)
          Of the worst sort. They were- I
          couldn't even- I had to defend myself.

                         PAYTON
          Pandorum. Both of them-?

                         GALLO
          You don't believe me?

                         PAYTON

                         (UNCONVINCED)
          I believe you.
          PAYTON goes to a nearby compartment, popping open a First-Aid
          case; inside is a pistol-gripped syringe. He turns back and
          GALLO squares off, clenched fists.

                         GALLO
          What are you doing? What is that?

                         PAYTON
          It's just a sedative. Help you relax-
          GALLO lifts his fists with a threatening posture.

                         GALLO
          Then you take it... and relax.
          PAYTON backs off, setting the syringe aside.

                         PAYTON
          Take it easy. We're on the same team
          here. Alright?

                         GALLO

                         (FLATLY)
          Sure, Lieutenant.
          PAYTON turns back to the control console and continues his
          search across the radio frequencies. He discreetly pulls the
          pipe weapon closer to his seat.
          GALLO holds a hollow stare on the back of his head.

          LIGHTS FLICKER past...

          FLICKER CUT TO:

          INT. SUB-LEVEL SHAFT - LATER

          A FLICKER of LIGHT passes to reveal... BOWER crouched inside
          a three-foot high, narrow passageway, a crawl space beneath a
          steel grated floor. He follows the tunnel into a large silo
          lined with octagonal filters.
          TANAKA and NADIA are both looking for a way out, jabbing
          pipes into the grate overhead, unable to budge it.

                         BOWER
          Didn't we come through here already?

                         NADIA
          We gotta find a way out.

                         BOWER
          Out? Why did we come iii-?

                         NADIA
          I was trying to get us out of there alive-

                         BOWER
          I thought you knew where you were going.

                         NADIA
          I was trying to save our asses-

                         BOWER
          Could've mentioned that after the first
          mile. If I would have known we'd be
          doing laps down here-
          She angrily turns towards him, pipe in her hand.

                         NADIA
          I didn't need to help you at all! You
          and the Hong-Kong Express would still be
          playing ding-dong-ditch on level eight if
          it weren't for me!
          Their heightening confrontation is halted by...

          They pause to hear... CLASSICAL MUSIC echoing from below.

                         BOWER
          What the hell is that?
          They climb down the shaft, jumping from filter to filter. At
          one level they follow the sound into a shaft opening and
          towards the soft, warm GLOW of YELLOW LIGHT.
          They reach an open hatch, peering inside to see...
          Inside an empty storage tank, a comfortable living space has
          been created; numerous chairs surround a make-shift dinner
          table made from storage crates with hand-made candles and
          various food containers. The tank appears empty.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          What is this!?
          BOWER and TANAKA begin to climb through and NADIA hesitates
          with uncertainty. They crawl through the hatch...

                         FOLLOW THRU:

          INT. TANK - CONT.

          They climb into the empty tank, lined with valves and
          filtration screens. The music is playing from crackling
          speakers hidden in the darkened circular catwalk overhead.
          TANAKA goes straight for the food and as soon as NADIA steps
          through the hatch... a wire SNAPS! Levers clank and a mouse-
          trap has triggered... SLAMMING the hatch closed. Trapped!
          They instantly turn back to the door, yanking and tugging in
          a panic. BOWER pans his light towards the catwalk only to
          see a FIGURE (LELAND) scampering through the shadows.
          Another lever is turned and... F00000SH! A stream of vapor
          shoots out of several vents along the wall. The colorless
          gas hits them and they instantly gag, choking for air.
          With the slanted walls of the tank, there seems to be no
          escape, but TANAKA runs up the wall, diving and grabbing onto
          a pipe, climbing upward toward the catwalk.
          The shadowed FIGURE (LELAND) quickly hobbles to the railing.

                         LELAND
          No, no, no. Back in der' big boy!

          LELAND uses a spear to jab TANAKA'S hand. He loses his grip
          and tumbles back to the bottom of the tank. BOWER pulls
          NADIR out of the way of the hatch.

                         BOWER
          Get back! BACK!
          BOWER whirls the magneto lever on the weapon and he raises
          the barrel towards the hatch, nearly point blank.
          KA-CRAAAACK! The energy blast from the weapon hits the hatch
          like a lightening bolt sending a tremendous JOLT through the
          entire tank. A spark IGNITES the chemical gas and there's a
          BURST of flammable gas that rolls upward into the catwalks.
          LELAND is knocked off his feet and he GASPS with shock.

                         LELAND
          Whoa... WHOA! What the hell was that!?
          LELAND is exposed from his hiding place, waving the smoke
          from his face, bewildered. He's an older man who's lost all
          vanity over survival. A thin-framed, spidery little man with
          assorted clothing and a clutter of tools on his belt.

                         LELAND (CONT'D)
          What did you do!?
          BOWER whirls the lever on the weapon and points it at him.

                         BOWER
          Shut off the gas!

                         LELAND
          Where did you get that?
          BOWER angles the barrel towards a vent blowing out the
          chemical gas and LELAND jumps with fright.

                         LELAND (CONT'D)

          NO-NO! HO-HO!

                         BOWER

          SHUT IT OFF!
          LELAND scampers across the catwalk and quickly lifts levers
          and twists nozzles, shutting off the flow of chemical gas.
          His frown transforms to a grin, raising an eye brow as he
          stares into the barrel of BOWER'S weapon.

          CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLANK? LELAND cranks an energy lever that
          ignites a string of auxiliary lights around the tank,
          widening their view of the unusual living space. Several
          crates and an assortment of mechanical junk and supplies.

          watching it for a friend.
          LELAND is excited to have guests as he runs along the
          catwalks, lighting candles and sealing valves. They watch
          him with leery suspicion, weapons still in hand.

                         BOWER
          You... live here?

          Umm, up on B-Deck. Some on C. A few

          LELAND laughs to himself, digging through supplies. BOWER
          scans the walls, seeing no way up to the catwalks.

          Why don't you come on down so we can meet

          to the dust bug and who knows where yawl
          have been. No offense. There's

          LELAND lowers down a bin filled with assorted food items,

          suspicion.

          INT. WATER PROCESSOR - LATER

          A small propane flame is lit. LELAND hovers over a make-
          shift stove, heating a can of water. He pours in some powder
          and stirs it up with the meticulous nature of a chef
          preparing fine cuisine.

                         LELAND
          It's tough to properly season with a
          motor oil base. But if you use your
          imagination, kinda tastes like...

                         (SIP)
          Herb and garlic dog shit.
          Below the catwalks, TANAKA has found a spot to rest, NADIR is
          using water to clean a wound and BOWER is peering through a
          slit in a vent.

                         BOWER
          How long have you been awake?

                         LELAND
          Mmmm. Lemme think. What's today,
          Tuesday? That would be about, mmm...
          He counts in his head and across his fingers, carefully
          calculating, then a grin.

                         LELAND (CONT'D)
          No idea.
          He turns back to his make-shift stove, chuckling to himself.

                         LELAND (CONT-D)
          I quit counting after the band broke up,
          ooooh twenty... thirty years ago.
          BOWER and NADIR exchange a look of uncertainty. The
          classical music begins to SKIP and without even looking
          LELAND kicks a piece of equipment, correcting the music.

                         LELAND (CONT-D)
          Then again, an hour in this place feels
          more like... one-fifteen, one-twenty.

          LELAND sets several bowls of soup into the bin and lowers it
          to them with the cable. T_ANAKA is the only one interested,
          sniffing the soup with a glare. LELAND winks.
          BOWER takes a seat, showing exhaustion and defeat.

                         BOWER
          Those things out there. Could it have
          been something... that crawled out of
          your lab? Something that-

                         NADIA
          No. That's... not possible.

                         BOWER
          Then something got on board. Some kind
          of life form. Something that-

                         NADIA
          Or something that was already on board,
          with us in the hyper-bunks.

                         BOWER
          What does that mean?

                         NADIR
          it could have been the accelerator.

                         BOWER
          What?

                         NADIA
          It's the only theory I can come up with.
          The synthetic enzyme in our feeding
          tubes. The accelerator that would help
          our bodies adjust and adapt to the
          environmental conditions on Tanis. From
          what I've seen... these things have
          adapted... to the ship instead.

                         BOWER
          But, why would- You're saying we'll
          become like them? Why would they be
          affected like that and we're not-

          GALLO'S gaze is hollow and translucent as he stares through
          the glass porthole in the empty sleep chamber, his mind is
          deeply pondering. Pupils dilated.

          GALLO is looking at the empty sleep chambers while PAYTON
          remains at the control console, determined not to give up on
          contacting BOWER.

          It's not something you can easily detect.
          Starts with a shiver. An itch. A slow
          boil... and without being able to get off
          the ship... there's no shutting off the
          heat. It'll boil over, no matter what
          you do.
          GALLO is slowly pacing the room and PAYTON watches him with
          uneasiness out of the corner of his eye.

                         GALLO (CONT'D)

          You can see why I was hesitant... to tell

          INT. LADDER SHAFT/CORRIDOR - LATER

          A flashlight beams cut into a shaft. It appears as if the
          gang is crawling backwards toward us, until our perspective
          realizes they're crawling down a long ladder.
          They reach the bottom level where a distant RUMBLE has grown
          louder. They follow the sound through a field of debris to a
          clear path leading to an open hatchway.
          BOWER checks the marker over the door and leads them down the
          corridor, preparing to step through and TANAKA grabs him,
          pulling him back.

                         BOWER
          What?
          TANAKA motions toward the hatchway, shaking his head. He
          i gestures for them to follow and leads them over debris and
          through a hole, hidden in the paneling.

                         TANAKA
          (Japanese - No Subtitles)

                         LELAND
          What did he say?

                         BOWER
          I dunno. But do what he says.
          They follow TANAKA, crawling through the hole and into...

          INT. LOADING PLATFORM

          As they head across a loading dock, the room gradually grows
          more disturbed and dishevelled. Battle scars and centuries
          of wear and tear grow more and more evident as they cross.
          The BLUE GLOW of light can be seen through the passageway and
          a low RUMBLE grows louder as they approach. They crouch
          behind a large industrial condensers to catch their breath.
          I BOWER glances up to the surface of the condenser with a frown
          and he touches it with his fingers to find an odd-colored
          algae. He looks up to see it's grown all the way to...
          Be freezes to see a small shadowed FIGURE in the rafters
          above them, a smaller gargoyle-type silhouette, possibly some
          type of guard outside the entrance to the reactor bay.

          They exchange silent gestures and TANAKA heads one direction
          as BOWER heads the other... to corner it. The FIGURE begins
          to move across the rafter as TANAKA flushes it out.
          The FIGURE is forced to climb down, hopping to the floor,
          BOWER waits with his gun raised. Out of the shadows steps...
          A ten-year-old CHILD HUNTER.
          BOWER flinches with shock. The CHILD is a younger version of
          the hunters, awkward physique, pale skin coated with
          hydraulic fluid, oblong shaped head, eyes hidden in shadow.
          NADIR lowers her weapon.

                         NADIA

                         (DEVASTATED)
          Oh... my... God...
          The CHILD suddenly crouches in a fighting stance with a
          i gargled HISS from its throat, the light catching its eyes to
          reveal WHITE RETINAS deeply hidden under a thin membrane of
          I skin. Everyone is too stunned to react except for TANAKA,
           who instantly raises his weapon, preparing to kill it.

                          NADIA (CONT-D)
           stop it! STOP IT! Are you crazy? It's
           just a child!

                         BOWER
          Child! ? That's no child! What the hell
          is it!?
          TANAKA lunges, but NADIA blocks his attack. The CHILD HUNTER
          erupts with a horrific SCREECH, HISSING at them before
          turning and leaping back up and over the rafters,
          disappearing into the shadows. They are speechless.

                         LELAND
          Not as cute when they're little, are
          they?
          TANAKA runs after it. It takes a moment for the rest to
          react, chasing after.

          The CHILD runs up a wall of tubing and ducks through a small
          hole punctured in the vents. TANAKA sighs with defeat.

                         NADIA
          My God. They're... breeding.

                         BOWER
          What!? What do you mean they? How could
          they- That's impossible.
          It appears the CHILD has alerted his group as the BLUISH GLOW
          of flame can be seen growing stronger in the corridor, the
          sounds of CACKLES and HISSES approaching.

                         LELAND
          Little bastard rang the bell.

          be leading the group, silhouettes passing, more HUNTERS then
          they've ever seen together before.
          They silently share the horror of the possible numbers
          they're up against.

                         LELAND
          This isn't going to work. Too many of
          them. Have to turn back.

          There's no where to turn back to. We
          can't give up-

                         LELAND
          Told you this wouldn't fly.

                         NADIA
          You didn't tell us anything. You never
          said that. You said you'd love to come-

          panel, preparing for a hot-wire.
          GALLO watches him while slowly pacing the room.

          What are you doing?

                         PAYTON
          I think the direct channels are fried.

          The bridge. As soon as we're up we'll be
          able to take control of guidance. But
          only from on the bridge.
          GALLO continues pacing, throwing glances toward the empty
          sleep chambers.

          This ship is not dying.

          that kid will be able to save this ship?

          He can do it.

                         GALLO
          Twelve hours ago, he didn't know his own
          name. Now, you think he's ready to re-

                         PAYTON
          He's the only shot we have. Gotta have a
          little faith.

                         GALLO

          That's why I came. There was nothing

          Well, then... she saved your life.
          BOWER frowns on the thought, slowly nodding in agreement.

          We can still launch ourselves in the

          BOWER ignores his pleas, heading down a ladder into the
          darkness, TANAKA and NADIA follow, pushing past him.

                         LELAND (CONT'D)
          You're crazy... You can't-

                         NADLA
          Shut-up! Move!
          LELAND stays behind, watching as they begin a perilous
          descent down the walls of the reactor bay wall. Clinging
          onto the pipes and railings of the catwalks, the odd-colored
          algae grows more and more dense... a dim glow slowly coming
          into view from below.
          With a gap in the catwalk, BOWER leaps across, nearly losing
          his grip. He looks down to see an odd pattern of white
          shapes near the bottom.
          Squinting into the darkness, he's unable to make out what
          he's looking at and he manages to crawl down further,
          reaching a gangplank that crosses to the towering reactor.
          He motions for NADIA and TANAKA to stay put and begins
          crawling across... towards a darkened control panel.

                         1
          LELAND is nervously watching from above, leaning further over
          the railing and... a pen-lamp slips free from his belt.
          The pen-lamp CLANKS off one of the catwalks and tumbles past
          BOWER... dropping to the bottom... hitting the floor and
          illuminating the strange white objects covering the floor
          as... DOZENS of HUNTERS, all sleeping. Their pale white
          bodies are intertwined and over-lapped resembling an orgy of
          the living dead.

                         BOWER

                         CHRIST ALMIGHTY-
          The fall of the pen-lamp causes one HUNTER to instantly
          spring to its feet, lifting its nose towards the air like a
          guard dog checking the scent.
          BOWER remains frozen, gripping the gangplank that hangs
          twenty feet above the field of sleeping HUNTERS.
          I Slowly the HUNTER returns to sleep, slithering its way back
          into the folds of flesh and BOWER continues his crawl
          across... reaching the control panel.
          Upon seeing the sleeping HUNTERS, LELAND fearfully backs
          away, exiting the room. NADIA and TANAKA grip the ladders,
          watching BOWER, holding their breath in fright.

          BOWER grabs a vine, but it breaks away and he dangles over
          the side, losing his grip. NADIA jumps across the gap and
          climbs down, extending her weapon for him to grab. Together
          they cling to the side of the reactor and BOWER taps the
          control panel switches and... nothing.
          His eyes widen with horror, quickly searching for a solution.
          He slowly pumps a primer switch and... the light panel
          flickers gently under centuries of dust and vegetation...

          MATCH CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK

          A light gently blinks on the control console and PAYTON spots
          it with a frown, running back from the door.

                         PAYTON
          He's in! That's the reactor's activator
          panel. We're going to make it out of

                         I
          this. Trust me.
          No response. GALLO'S shadow moves behind him, his voice
          taking on a slight raspier and "older" tone.

                         I

                         GALLO
          Trust you? How can I trust someone who
          isn't even honest with himself. Tell me?
          PAYTON refuses to acknowledge him, continuing to monitor the
          control panel. He discreetly slides his hand closer to the
          pipe weapon as he senses GALLO'S presence behind him.

                         PAYTON
          Gallo... you have to listen to me...
          Carefully. You don't haveâ¢to-
          GALLO steps closer behind him, his shadowed outline showing
          an imposing posture, his voice is forced and unsteady.

                         GALLO
          Don't do that.
          TRAP... TRAP... THAP. Blood drops hit the floor heavily.

                         PAYTON
          Don't... do what?
          PAYTON slides his hand further across the console, reaching
          for the pipe weapon, eyes on the screen.

          Don't talk to me like some child that
          needs reassurance. Think I don't know
          the risks? Think I don't know this ship?

                         PAYTON
          Take it easy-
          GALLO'S presence is felt behind him, his voice seeming to
          grow raspier and uneven with breath, anger simmering.

                         GALLO
          I know this ship and what she's capable
          of better then anyone. I know her... and
          I know what she can and can't do.

                         PAYTON
          Easy...

                         GALLO
          And this... she can't do! Why are we
          even arguing. You know it-

                         PAYTON
          I'm giving you an order...

                         GALLO
          You wanna stay here to die, that's your
          choice, not mine!

                         GALLO

          NOT MINE!
          PAYTON shoves himself out of his chair, reaching for the pipe
          weapon to find nothing! He spins to see GALLO holding the
          pipe and the pistol-gripped syringe, glaring down at him.
          The heavy streams of blood are oozing from his nose and ears,
          insanity shown in his hollow gaze.

          GALLO (CONT`D)
          Who's being irrational here, Lieutenant?
          Tell me? Who's being delusional!? Hmm?
          PAYTON raises his hands, calmly submitting.

                         PAYTON

          Another panel on the console begins to gently blink as...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. REACTOR CONTROL TERMINAL - CONT.

          BOWER and NADIA cling to the side of the reactor, quietly
          flipping switches and entering codes as... the sea of HUNTERS
          sleep below them.
          BOWER unfolds the auxiliary power lever, each movement
          creating a CREAK of rusted metal. He grips the handle and
          slowly begins to turn the magneto crank. The CREAKS of
          rusted metal and the low WHINE of magnetos grows louder.
          HUNTERS begin to stir in their sleep as NADIA watches them
          with fright.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL, DESK

          GALLO is jabbing the pistol-gripped syringe towards PAYTON,
          motioning him closer to the sleep pods. He motions and
          PAYTON kneels at the panel... entering the code.

                         PAYTON
          This won't work...

                         GALLO
          Shut-up.
          GALLO jabs the syringe gun towards the back of PAYTON'S head
          while putting one foot inside the pod.

                         PAYTON
          just think about what you're doing-

                         GALLO

          SHUT-UP!
          PAYTON continues entering the launch code as GALLO steps
          inside with his other foot.

                         PAYTON
          It wasn't the crew that was sick, was it?

                         GALLO

          FINISH IT!
          PAYTON hits a key and LIGHTS BLINK. GALLO looks away for a
          second and PAYTON suddenly grabs the hatch lever... SLAMMING
          it closed. He cranks the latch, locking GALLO inside.

                         GALLO (CONT-D)

          WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?
          PAYTON wedges a pipe through the handle as GALLO violently
          kicks the hatch.

                         PAYTON
          For your own good-

                         PAYTON
          Your mind... has turned against itself.
          GALLO EXPLODES with RAGE... POUNDING on the hatch with a jack-
          hammer of fists, bones shattering in his own hands. PAYTON
          ignores his screams, going back to the console and typing
          I into the keyboard.

          INT. REACTOR CONTROL TERMINAL

          BOWER cranks the hand lever faster and faster, the MOAN of
          magnetos growing louder and louder. He gives one last spin
          and hits the primer switch. A split-second of nothing and
          then the panels brightly come to life. The digital panel
          reads: >> ROTATION SEQUENCE >> CODE INITIATE TO PROCEED >>
          BOWER takes a sigh of relief and glances to see NADIA is
          frozen with fright. He follows their eye-line to see the
          entire floor of HUNTERS are awake, heads turned towards them.
          HEFLIN steps closer in their direction with a HISS.
          BOWER gasps and the entire pack of HUNTERS moves toward them
          and... suddenly, TANAKA bangs his bladed weapon against the
          railing with a heavy CLANK! The HUNTERS instantly turn
          toward his direction and TANAKA throws his weapon, HITTING
          one of the HUNTERS directly in the head.
          TANAKA jumps to the neighboring catwalk and breaks through a
          hatch, coated with vines and vegetation. HEFLIN screeches a
          command and the HUNTERS ignite in a chain-reaction, grabbing
          their weapons and taking chase like a swarm of attack dogs.
          They climb the wall with inhuman speed and rush out the
          hatch, following TANAKA.

                         NADIA
          Hurry! Go!
          BOWER turns back to the panel, flipping more switches and

          equipment and weaving through debris as the pack of enraged
          HUNTERS emerge from every direction to follow his path.
          One HUNTER gains quickly at a sprinter's pace and TANAKA runs
          directly for the open hatchway. (The hatchway they detoured
          earlier.) He dives through as the sprinting HUNTER is almost
          upon him.
          A booby-trap is sprung, hydraulic pistons SNAP a razor-wire
          that "clotheslines" the HUNTER, nearly ripping him in half as
          TANAKA hits the floor, rolls to his feet and keeps running.
          HEFLIN and the HUNTERS slash the tangled snare with their
          weapons, trying to break through.

          to see... WEASEL and numerous HUNTERS have them surrounded,
          waiting to pounce. With nowhere to go, they are done for as
          WEASEL CACKLES a command, the HUNTERS moving in, just as...
          SHIIIISSSSH! High pressure steam erupts from the reactor's
          pressure relief valves. The HUNTERS back pedal in fear as
          the ventilation system ignites... fresh oxygen hits the blue
          torches... BURSTING into BRILLIANT ORANGE FIREBALLS..
          The HUNTER'S scatter in a panic as the BRIGHT FLAMES are

          TNT. REACTOR BAY - CONT.
          Other HUNTERS have retreated away from the reactor, cowering
          in fear with the exception of WEASEL, enraged by the temple's
          disturbance. He HISSES as he lunges for BOWER. Trying to
          duck, they SLAM into the reactor wall and CRASH to the
          catwalk below.

          WEASEL has incredibly quick reflexes as he springs back to
          his feet just as BOWER charges into him, slamming into a wall
          of burning algae. The fire quickly spreads across WEASEL'S
          skin, igniting the oil that's been rubbed across his body.
          With WEASEL SCREECHING wildly and engulfed in flame, BOWER
          viciously continues pummeling him, throwing a rage of blows
          until the body stops twitching. The flames begin to catch on
          BOWER'S arms and NADIA pulls him back.
          They look to see most of the HUNTERS fleeing the room, but
          others have grabbed weapons. BOWER grabs her arm, pulling
          her towards the hatch.

          As BOWER and NADIA run, the ship comes to life all around
          them, every LIGHT FLASHING and every mechanism ENGAGING at
          full power. A startling contrast of blinding white walls and
          glowing floors as they run down the corridor.

          Slowly, TANAKA emerges from a hiding place, dropping down
          from the rafters overhead. With a grin he turns to head back
          the other direction to see...
          HEFLIN waiting for him.
          They stare one another down, both raising their bladed
          weapons as LIGHTS shatter and implode around them from their
          own intensity.
          HEFLIN lunges with a HISS and blades CLASH!

          The control panel on a sleep-chamber is FLASHING as a
          passenger KICKS his hatch open from the inside. The haggard
          and bewildered passenger crawls out to find himself in the
          middle of CHAOS. Before he can get a breath he's attacked by

          HUNTERS.
          What was once a dark and haunting chamber of metal, is now a
          disco tech from hell as lights FLASH across the corridor in
          what appears to be a massive riot, PASSENGERS and HUNTERS
          fighting.

          ANGLE ON/CRANE UP
          BOWER and NADIA run across the top of the sleep chamber wall,
          thirty feet above the havoc that's ensuing below. A LIGHT

          INT_ ATRIUM - CONT.
          Metal blades SPARK as they connect between HEFLIN and TANAKA.
          The sword play is crude, but powerful and brutal. HEFLIN
          can't match his skills and pile-drives him, ripping into him
          with his own bare hands and a horrific SCREECH.

          TANAKA tries to grab a hold of him, but HEFLIN digs in with
          his teeth, biting into his stomach. TANAKA screams, hitting
          HEFLIN'S head with everything he's got, but he won't let go.
          TANAKA lifts HEFLIN'S feet and ROARS as he charges himself
          directly into the wall, neck bones SNAPPING! HEFLIN goes
          limp, dropping to the floor dead as TANAKA gasps... looking
          down to see the damage has been done, blood flowing heavily.
          He takes a breath, turns to exit FREEZING to see... the CHILD
          HUNTER standing alone, sensing the death of HEFLIN with
          almost an expression of sorrow. TANAKA lowers his weapon
          and... THWACK! The CHILD stabs TANAKA in the chest with a
          small bladed weapon.
          TANAKA gasps with shock, collapsing to his knees, eyes wide
          before going to the floor. The CHILD begins to feed.

          already climbing above them.

                         BOWER
          Go... GO! GO!
          Half way up, LELAND looks back to see them coming with
          HUNTERS close behind. He gives them a look before closing
          the hatch and latching it.

          Inside the door at the far end... PAYTON is at the control
          console, quickly typing into the keyboard. He hears the
          E hatch CRACK open and he spins to see GALLO, out of the pod,
          with a twisted grin, holding the pistol-gripped syringe.

          PAYTON lunges with the weapon, RAGE in his EYES as... GALLO
          jabs with the pistol-syringe, they lock hands, grabbing one
          anothers wrists... slamming into the wall.
          Upon IMPACT with the wall, GALLO suddenly appears slightly
          older, his voice lowering in level.

                         GALLO
          Corporal...
          PAYTON slams him against the wall, making him older.

                         (RAGE SIMMERING)

          STOP IT!
          PAYTON slams him again, a FLASH that reveals GALLO has aged
          almost matching PAYTON, their voices sounding the same...

                         GALLO
          Your mind... has turned against itself,

          Within the struggle, hands grab at weapons, a wrist is
          twisted... lining up both of their identification tattoos to
          be identical... FLT>>004>>012>>.
          The syringe is stabbed into skin. The trigger fires liquid,
          injecting the chemical into someone's arm as their voices
          converge, over-lapping at first and becoming one voice...

                         GALLO & PAYTON
          It's for the best... Corporal.

          PAYTON is ALONE. He's just injected the syringe into his own
          wrist. He's the only person in the room. Heavy blood
          streams are running from his nose and ears.
          Y77e will now refer to PAYTON by his real name, GALLO.
          LELAND and GALLO exchange a look... GALLO seeming to snap out
          of his trance. LELAND approaches, wheezing for air.

                         LELAND
          We made it! We- I'm with your boy. I
          was the one helping with-
          GALLO suddenly SLASHES his throat! LELAND reels back in
          shock, throttling his own neck in horror, blood gushing.
          GALLO casually turns back to the console, continuing to type
          as LELAND tries to cry out, his voice gargled with blood as
          he staggers, collapsing to the floor. GALLO hits a key and
          LIGHTS IGNITE, the last door finally engaging.
          GALLO sigh with relief as the doors slide open revealing a
          corridor of stairs leading to the bridge. A warm and gentle
          smile widens on his face.

                         I PAYTON
          Captain on the bridge.
          He heads toward the bridge, while flipping another switch
          that ignites the opposite doors just as...

                         ANGLE ON
          BOWER and NADIA angrily burst through the hatch in the floor,
          jamming it behind them and run up the corridor. They see the
          doors sliding shut.

                         BOWER
          That's it! GO! Go for it!
          With HUNTERS hot on their trail... they run full sprint
          towards the sliding doors. HUNTERS lunge out of side
          corridors with SCREECHING HISSES as BOWER and NADIA dive
          through the sliding doors...
          One HUNTER is crushed by the doors., split nearly in half with
          a heavy THUD of steel and a MOAN of hydraulics. The HUNTER
          spasms wildly, kicking and clawing as BOWER and NADIA back
          pedal into the room. HUNTERS gather at the gap, stabbing
          weapons between the doors, trying to crawl through with
          SCREECHES and HISSES of rage.

          BOWER and NADIA back further away, turning to see the room.
          The original room that BOWER woke up in now looks quite
          different with all the systems engaged, BLINDING LIGHT coming
          from the monitors and computer terminals.
          They move through the room, passing the empty sleep chambers
          and the control console, seeing the entire pathway of dripped
          blood across the floor.

                         NADIA
          Where's... your lieutenant?

                         BOWER
          He's not my lieutenant.
          She frowns off his look and turns to see... LELAND on the
          floor in a pool of blood, throat slashed, dead.
          BOWER pulls the gun and heads into the open doorway leading
          towards the bridge as NADIA follows behind.

          INT. COMMAND BRIDGE - CONT.

          A tunneled stairwell widens out into the main flight bridge.
          A stunning sight, a split-level glass control deck, rows of
          blinking control panels and flight chairs. It appears
          undisturbed, a thin layer of silt floats out from under their
          footsteps.
          BOWER leads the way, panning the weapon throughout the room
          with no sign of GALLO. On the far wall; cockpit windows
          coated with a black fungus that obscures the view, but hints
          to the illusion of outer space, a haze of cosmic dust without
          stars.

          What's happened... to us? Where are we?
          BOWER goes to the nearest control console, tapping the
          keyboard. The computer instantly responds, data scrolling
          across the screen.

                         BOWER
          Flight log. It'll tell us how long we've
          I been out... and how far we've gone.
          BOWER types in a command and the computer begins to scroll
          through the flight computer's time-code. Starting with the
          launch date and time the numbers begin to roll faster and
          faster. BLIP... BLIP... BLIP.

          NADIA walks towards the windows and suddenly jumps back with
          fright to realize one of the flight control chairs has a
          FIGURE sitting in it. GALLO, motionless and gazing toward
          the windows.
          Off her gasp, BOWER grabs his gun and approaches as the
          computer time-code continues to roll even faster with no sign
          of slowing... months becoming years.
          BOWER approaches from behind GALLO... his identification
          tatto now clearly visible... FLT>>004>>012>>. He cranks the
          lever on the gun with a WHINE of magnetos and the laser
          sights flare brightly onto GALLO'S back.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          Seems my little memory lapse has finally
          worn off... "Lieutenant".
          BOWER slowly approaches, moving closer to his profile, the
          stream of blood from GALLO'S ear shown running down his neck.

                         GALLO

                         (DRYLY)
          Mine too.

          Who the hell are you?
          GALLO keeps his gaze towards the windows, emotionless.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          You're team four. Why would you...
          switch bunks? Pretend to be someone
          else? What would you be wanting to hide?
          Who the hell are you?

                         GALLO
          I was younger then you when I first came
          on board. Funny, I can't even remember
          what it was like... before this flight
          began. It's all I know.

                         BOWER
          You were the one... who first received
          the final transmission. Who refused to
          go back to sleep. You stayed awake...
          for all those years. What were you
          doing... what crimes were you hiding from
          when you took Payton's bunk?
          The time-code display rolls faster, years rolling into
          decades... BLIP, BLIP, BLIP.

          Is it true? What have you done to us?
          Where are we now?
          GALLO lazily nods towards the windows.

                         GALLO
          Go ahead. Take a peek. You tell me.
          BOWER hesitates, looking toward the darkened windows. He
          stays with the weapon on GALLO as NADIA wanders toward the
          front control console, towards the glass.
          With the lights fading on the weapon, BOWER gives the lever a
          quick whirl, motioning the barrel closer.

          GALLO (CONT ' D )
          What are. you gonna do, Bower? There's no
          one left to hand out merit badges. No
          one left at all.

                         BOWER
          And that makes it okay? To play God?

                         GALLO
          You think God survived? He's gone...
          with the rest. There's no one left to
          judge you, Bower.
          NADIA approaches the glass, squinting towards the heavily
          smudged glass. She frowns, trying to wipe away the layer of
          sludge.

                         BOWER
          Judgement will come for you. You think
          you could cover it? Your victims
          survived. Evolved. That's your creation
          out there. Your crime.
          BOWER jabs the gun into his back with force.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          And you thought you'd be able to hide it?
          Who would ever suspect that? Who would
          ever remember? I remember.
          NADIA rubs the glass with her hand, squinting into the
          darkness. The time-code display rolls faster, decades into
          centuries... BLIP, BLIP, BLIP.

                         GALLO
          No world left. No law. No order. Only
          us. You the law now? You gonna be the
          one that brings order to what's left?
          Wanna take a shot at it? I did my best
          with what I was given. Wanna be King for
          a day? Give it a whirl, Corporal. I'd
          like to see how you fare.
          With the laser sights fading on the weapon, BOWER quickly
          cranks the power lever, keeping the gun raised-
          A slow grin spreads across GALLO'S face as he finally looks
          to him, revealing the thick streams of blood that have
          dripped from his nose, coating his chin and neck.

          GALLO (CONT`D)
          Try to imagine it. Imagine... yourself
          for five minutes without morality. I'll
          bet you'd surprise even yourself, kid-

                         BOWER
          Shut-up.

                         (TO NADIA)
          What's out there?
          NADIA shakes her head, rubbing away the sludge from the
          glass, squinting harder.

                         GALLO
          Imagine... us both. What's left to stop
          you? I offer you the kingdom and you-

                         BOWER

                         SHUT-UP-

                         GALLO
          There's still quite a few sleeping
          beauties down there... a thousand
          flavors. You up for a little window
          shopping?

                         BOWER
          Shut-up!

                         GALLO

          I wanna see it. I'll bet you'd be a

                         REEEEAL TIGER-
          BOWER suddenly shoves him out of the chair, slamming him to
          the floor, jabbing the barrel into the back of his neck.

          There will be law... in whatever world we
          create. And you'll pay for what you've
          done. Believe me.
          GALLO chuckles with his face pressed to the floor.

                         GALLO
          A real boy scout, is that it, kiddo?

                         BOWER

          HEAR ME ASSHOLE?!
          NADIA suddenly GASPS... flinching away from the cockpit
          windows, having just seen what's outside. Her expression is
          ghostly as she back pedals.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          What is it?
          GALLO looks up with a blood-soaked grin.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          What do you see!?

                         I

                         GALLO
          You ready for the new world, corporal?
          BOWER keeps the gun on him as he goes to the windows. NADIA
          has a ghostly expression, unable to speak. BOWER leans
          toward the glass, squinting into the darkness and...
          SWISH! An object moves past the outside of the glass. He
          leans closer, squinting to see... a school of ALIEN FISH dart
          past. The shin is underwater.
          BOWER staggers in shock, back pedalling as GALLO continues to
          chuckle.

                         BOWER

                         (DISBELIEF)
          We've... we've already crashed. We've
          already... we're...
          The time-code display rolls centuries past, more then a
          thousand years accounted for as it finally slows to a stop.

          BLIP... BLIP... BLIP.

                         BOWER (CONT'D)
          We've been... down here... all this
          time!? All this... time-

                         CONTINUED: (5)
          BOWER staggers against the console in shock,. the weapon
          lowering to his side.

                         GALLO
          I guess this thing does land itself.
          Just doesn't float too well.
          BOWER lunges towards him and GALLO is ready for this one,
          quickly countering his move and SLAMMING BOWER into the
          console. He unleashes a vicious BLOW into BOWER'S throat.
          BOWER collapses, choking for air and GALLO kicks the gun
          away. He kneels over BOWER, slowly pulling out a blade.

          G_ALLO (CONT'D)
          And you thought you could be King!?
          He slides the blade under BOWER'S neck and... there's a WHIRL
          of magnetos.
          He looks up to see NADIA cranking the lever on the energy
          gun. She tries to turn the gun towards him and...

                         I
          GALLO lunges toward her just as she's able to FIRE! The
          BLA..ST of energy goes into the console with a CRACK of
          1 THUNDER, knocking everyone off their feet. Shattered glass
          and metal HIT the cockpit window like a spray of shrapnel...

                         CLOSE UP
          .sending a thin crack across the surface of the glass.
          She struggles to crank the lever again as GALLO charges,
          hitting the gun away. He SLAMS her over the console.

                         GALLO (CONT'D)
          My apologies. Ladies first... of course.

          ANGLE ON/CLOSE UP
          The crack on the window begins to spiderweb across...

                         ANGLE ON
          GALLO grabs her hair to expose her neck and angles the blade
          upward, forcing her to take a GASP as...
          BOSSSH! Water explodes through the windows, hitting the room
          like a hundred fire hoses. GALLO is hit directly and thrown
          across the room as NADIA and BOWER are engulfed by the blast
          of black water, sent tumbling.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          123.

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - CONT.

          The tremendous ROAR of rushing water rolls them down the
          stairwell and into the sleep chamber compartment in a raging
          torrent, a tidal wave slams into the wall.
          BOWER grabs onto NADIA and they claw themselves along the
          wall as computer terminals SPARK and LIGHTS go black. He
          pulls her to a sleep-chamber and he jumps inside the open
          hatch, pulling her with.

                         NADIA
          NO!? Are you crazy-

                         BOWER

          GET IN!
          He pulls her inside and turns to the control panel. He hits
          the keypad to read: >>> DETACHMENT INITIATED >>>
          BOWER struggles to close the hatch as water rushes in,
          SLAMMING it shut on top of them.
          GALLO struggles to keep his head above water as the fast
          moving current SLAMS him into the edge of the doorway. His
          I fingers claw at the manual lever for the door, tugging and
          tugging with no effect as the water rises above his head.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER

          BOWER and NADIA are squeezed together inside the pod as water
          quickly rises above the porthole.

                         NADIA

                         (GASPING)
          Not like this! I can't- like this!

                         BOWER
          Hold on!
          Under the roar of the rushing water, hydraulics ignite.
          Micro-jets FIRE and WHOOSH! The pod launches, shooting down
          a tunnel until they're HIT with a tremendous JOLT.
          They are sent spinning into a wild tumble as bubbles and gas
          erupt across the outer surface. BOWER and NADIA slam into
          one another as the chamber turns end over end.
          Its roll seems to slow for a brief moment and BOWER squints
          toward the porthole to see...

                         POV
          They are pulling away from the side of the ship. The
          exterior hull of the massive space ship slides past at a high
          rate of speed with a swirl of ocean water and bubbles.
          BAM! The pod SLAMS into something as SPARKS fly and seals
          are ruptured as WATER sprays in with a blinding BLAST. The
          chamber is sent into another violent roll as NADIA and BOWER
          tumble head over feet, as if caught within a washing machine.
          The chamber finally steadies as water washes across the
          control panel, one last burst of sparks knocks out the
          lights, taking them into BLACK.
          Only their gasps are heard as they squirm towards the upper
          corner... only a foot of air remaining.
          He grabs the mask connected to tubes in the side and pulls
          the straps over her head.

                         NADIA
          I What are you doing!?

                         BOWER
          1 Put it on!

                         NADIA
          No! I can't- Not like this! I'm not
          going to wake up and drowned-

                         BOWER

          PUT IT ON!
          He pulls it over her face as the water rises with only
          several inches of air inside the chamber. BOWER gasps
          desperately into the corner.
          NADIA gasps the air through the mask, making her eye-lids
          droop, slowly going unconscious. BOWER gasps one last breath
          and the water rises over his head.
          BOWER watches her body go limp and squirms for air as... a
          warm GLOW of WHITE LIGHT grows brighter through the porthole.
          As sunlight dances through the porthole, he kicks at the
          hatch and...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY

          BOWER kicks open the hatch, gasping for breath. A gentle
          breeze ripples across the water with a sunlight flickering
          across the surface of an ocean.
          He pulls NADIA out of the chamber, ripping the mask off her
          face. Her eye-lids slowly begin to flicker back to
          consciousness.

                         BOWER
          Hey...? Hey?
          She chokes on the air and struggles to orientate herself,
          looking up to see him gazing down at her, coated with bright
          sunlight.

                         NADIA

                         (GASPING)
          Where are we? What happened?

                         BOWER

                         (GRIN)
          It's all right. It's safe to wake up
          this time.

                         I
          With eyes of disbelief, they turn to see...

                         WIDE ANGLE
          They sit on the edge of the sleep chamber as it lightly bobs
          within the ocean waves. They're just off shore from a
          stretch of mountainous tropical islands with waves crashing
          against the beaches. The unusual shape of the islands and
          their geography are nothing like we've ever seen on Earth.
          Several moons dot the sky and the sun is rising with a
          brilliant glow on the horizon.

          FADE TO BLACK:

          INT. COMMAND DECK

          Pitch black. A low CHURNING is heard, a motor that is
          pumping as the water lowers, allowing us to see across the
          dishevelled command platform, the walls dripping with water.
          The water is being drained through the grates in the floor as
          unseen bilge pumps are heard loudly WHIRLING. The pump
          motors whine down and shut off as...

                         CONTROL CONSOLE
          A hand flips off the switch for the ventilation ducts. It's

                         CONTINUED:
          standing at the console, having changed clothes and recovered
          from the ordeal. He examines the empty tank where BOWER'S
          sleep chamber once sat. He eyes the other sleep-chambers,
          deeply contemplating.
          He goes back to the control console, scanning across the
          numerous surveillance monitors that reveal...
          PASSENGERS and HUNTERS engaged in a variety of activities all
          across the ship. Some are seen fighting, some searching for
          food, some searching for a way out, some alone weeping. A
          kingdom, for the taking.
          He pulls out a coffee packet and slowly begins mixing himself
          a cup, deeply contemplating as he looks across the screens.
          He glances over to see... YOUNG GALLO, the younger version of
          himself, who is seated nearby, watching with a grin. The
          blood is gone from his face, appearing clean-cut, clean
          uniform.

                         YOUNG GALLO
          Well, if you're gonna be captain... what
          are we gonna do now?
          Off his look...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - LATER

          SHUSH... THUD. Doors open to another sleep chamber
          compartment, completely undisturbed. Four undisturbed sleep-
          chambers are lined against the wall.
          GALLO enters, now wearing the CAPTAIN'S uniform, he
          straightens his collar and kneels next to one of the pods,
          typing into the panel. A grin appears as he removes the
          wedding ring (PAYTON'S ring) he'd forgotten he's still
          wearing.

                         GALLO
          What is a King... without his Queen.
          He hits the control panel switch and...

          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER

          A FEMALE CREW MEMBER, a beautiful young woman, deep in hyper--
          slumber suddenly twitches... her EYES opening wide with a
          GASP as she stares into CAMERA.

               The screen remains dark for a moment.

               In the darkness WE HEAR the film's THEME MUSIC - a gentle 
               whirring purring noise. Nothing to be alarmed about. It 
               might be a small contented motor.

               FADE IN:

               EXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT

               LONG SHOT of the solitary figure of a WOMAN standing 
               professionally alone at the end of the street.

               It is a bright, still night. We can HEAR the Woman whistling 
               'Stardust' merrily to herself.

               CAMERA TRACKS around her. A Man's footsteps are overlaid.

               We HEAR the Man start to whistle 'Stardust' under his breath - 
               haltingly at first, then in time with the Woman.

               As we approach, she glances at us over her shoulder - then 
               turns round for a better look.

               Her whistling stops - so, at the same moment, does the 
               man's.

               CLOSE SHOT of DORA - a plump, attractive brunette - still 
               young enough to need two glances at the customers.

               She smiles at us - and is pleased with the reception. She 
               hesitates for a long moment, weighing us up carefully... 
               and then - half defiantly, half expecting to be laughed 
               at.

                                     DORA
                         It'll be two quid...

               Evidently we have two quid.  

               She beams with relief - throws her fur over her shoulders, 
               jerks her head towards the right - and sets off.

               CAMERA TRACKS after her.  Overlaid is the sound of the 
               man's footsteps.

               Dora resumes her whistling. So, under his breath, does the 
               man who is following her.

               EXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT

               A wider street than the last - but just as empty.  

               Dora sways her way towards a small house. CAMERA FOLLOWS 
               at a respectful distance.

               CAMERA PANS from Dora's hips to an overflowing dustbin.  

               CLOSE SHOT of a man's hand throwing something into the 
               dustbin. It is an empty packet marked Kodak Film.  CAMERA 
               PANS to Dora's house. It stands next to a chemist shop.

               Dora climbs the few steps which lead to her front door - 
               glances round at us encouragingly - then unlocks the door.

               INT. HALLWAY OF DORA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               She switches on a light - and hurries up a flight of stairs. 

               CAMERA TRACKS after her.

               She changes her tune to 'Goodnight Sweetheart'... and so - 
               under his breath - does the Man who is following her.  

               A woman with hair like a two-toned car comes down the 
               stairs, winks at Dora - looks at us for a moment with great 
               curiosity... winks... then passes out of camera.

               Dora reaches the landing - we are close behind her.

               INT. LANDING OF DORA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Dora unlocks the door of her room - and goes inside.

               INT. DORA'S ROOM - NIGHT

               She switches on the light, throws her fur onto a chair, 
               lights the gas fire  then turns round.

               CLOSE SHOT of Dora. She holds out her hand-smiling.

               And suddenly. There is a gentle whirring purring sound.

               CAMERA HOLDS ON Dora - she is staring at something with 
               great curiosity.

               It turns quickly to bewilderment - and the bewilderment to 
               fear. She steps back from CAMERA - but CAMERA won't have 
               it.

               Dora is now staring at something in horror - she opens her 
               mouth to scream - a shadow falls across her face.

               The sound purrs on.

                                                              FADE OUT:

               BLACK AND WHITE FILM SEQUENCE

               The solitary figure of Dora standing professionally alone 
               at the end of a street. WE SEE her turn towards CAMERA - 
               and smile at us.

               We are watching her on a 16mm screen - projected in BLACK 
               AND WHITE.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to show the surround in natural colour.

               INT. MARK'S ROOM - NIGHT

               A darkened room in natural COLOUR. The movie screen images 
               are in BLACK AND WHITE.  

               We can SEE the back of a Man's head as he bends intently 
               over a projector. He is watching Dora on the screen. He is 
               breathing quickly.

               We see Dora's hips waggling their way home.

               The Man raises his head, so that we cannot see the screen.

               When he lowers it again, we see the Woman with the two-
               toned hair winking at Dora... then we see Dora throwing 
               her fur onto a chair - and turning towards us.

               WE SEE her staring at something in bewilderment... then 
               backing away from CAMERA in fear.

               WE HEAR the Man breathing as if at the end of a very long 
               race.

               As Dora opens her mouth to scream, and a shadow falls across 
               her face - the title:

                                      PEEPING TOM

               Blots out what is happening to her.

               OTHER CREDITS FOLLOW... behind them we can see Dora's hands 
               pushing something away.

               Before the DIRECTOR'S CREDIT:

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. A PARK - NIGHT

               It is very dark.

               CLOSE SHOT of a stack of deck chairs.

               Two forms behind it - a MAN'S and a WOMAN'S.

               They are intertwined and motionless... suddenly a brilliant 
               shaft of light is trained onto them.

               Overlaid is a gentle, whirring sound.

               CAMERA PANS quickly to a nearby tree.

               CLOSE SHOT of the lens of a cine-camera - the motor 
               purring... a blinding spotlight.

               CAMERA PANS to the couple - the whirring of the camera is 
               overlaid.

               The Man leaps up - shielding his eyes against the light.

               He advances towards the tree.

                                     MAN
                         Hey, you peeping...

               The spotlight goes out. There is the sound of footsteps 
               running away  and the night is at peace again.

               And now WE SEE who DIRECTED the picture.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               LONG SHOT. AMBULANCE - DAY

               It is standing in the roadway outside Dora's house.

               WE SEE it through the finder of a small cine-camera.

               EXT. STREETS BY DORA'S HOUSE - DAY

               A crowd has gathered outside the house - and we are watching 
               them from a corner of the street (ALWAYS THROUGH THE FINDER-
               MATTE).

               WE SEE several Policemen holding back the crowd as two 
               Ambulance Men hurry into the house, carrying an empty 
               stretcher.

               Gentle, whirring sound is overlaid.

               WE SEE children staring curiously into the empty ambulance - 
               and a group of Women talking excitedly to a Reporter.

               CLOSE SHOT of a SMALL MAN looking at us curiously as he 
               approaches (FILLING THE SCREEN WITHIN THE MATTE).

                                     SMALL MAN
                         What paper are you from?

               The finder is lowered.

               CLOSE SHOT of a Young Man (MARK) sighting a cine-camera. 

               He lowers the camera - and turns politely to his 
               interrogator.

               He seems to have slight difficulty informing his words.

                                     MARK
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     SMALL MAN
                         What paper are you from?

               Mark smiles at him pleasantly.

                                     MARK
                         The Observer.

               The Ambulance Men come out of the house carrying the 
               stretcher... there is a body on it covered by a sheet.  
               Mark raises his cine-camera and photographs them. He 
               photographs the ambulance as it drives off. He photographs 
               the Policemen dispersing the crowd. He photographs his 
               Interrogator, who gladly poses for him.

               Then he slings his camera over his shoulder, and strolls 
               away.

               CLOSE SHOT of Dora, smiling happily.  

               Her photograph is on the front page of a newspaper.  

               Above it is a caption: BRUTALLY MURDERED.  

               CAMERA PULLS BACK - to show sexy magazines alongside the 
               newspaper.

               EXT. A NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - DAY

               Mark is staring at a newspaper in the window of a small 
               newsagent's shop.  

               He glances distastefully at an array of film magazines - 
               showing actresses showing everything - then hurries into 
               the shop.

               INT. NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - DAY

               A plump, bald-headed Man stares at Mark.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         You're late!

                                     MARK
                         Sorry, sir.

               He turns towards a small door at the end of the shop.

                                     MR. PETERS
                              (quietly)
                         Hold on, Mark.

               Mark turns round.

               Mr. Peters hesitates, drumming his fingers on the counter.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He starts to drum his fingers on a 
               shelf.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         Mark... I've a question for you.

               He stops drumming his fingers. So, at that moment, does 
               Mark.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         Which magazines sell the most 
                         copies?

                                     MARK
                         Those with girls on the front covers - 
                         and no front covers on the girls.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         Exactly!... And it's just the same 
                         with the work you do for me.

               Overlaid is the sound of the door opening.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         Look busy.

               Mark busies himself sorting some newspapers. 

               A whole row of Doras smile up at him.

               CAMERA PANS to doorway of the shop.

               An ELDERLY GENTLEMAN is standing there.

                                     ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
                         The Times, please.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         Certainly, sir.

                                     ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
                         And The Telegraph.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         Certainly, sir - anything else?

               The Elderly Gentleman hesitates - glancing at Mark's back.  
               Then:

                                     ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
                         I... er... have been told by a 
                         friend that you... er... have some 
                         views for sale?

                                     MR. PETERS
                         What sort of views, sir?

                                     ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
                         Well, er...

                                     MR. PETERS
                         This sort, sir?

               From under the counter he produces a thick book. Mark turns 
               round.

               From his POV WE SEE the Elderly Gentleman open the book. 
               He - er- seems - er - more than a little interested.

                                     ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
                         I, er... how much each?

                                     MR. PETERS
                         Five shillings, sir.

                                     ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
                         I'll take this one... and, er... 
                         this one... and, er... how much 
                         would the lot be?

                                     MR. PETERS
                         To you - five pounds, sir...

               The Elderly Gentleman hesitates.  Mr. Peters turns over a 
               page... and the Elderly Gentleman almost turns over with 
               it.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         Tell you what, sir. Four pounds 
                         ten - and I'll throw in The Times 
                         and Telegraph... how's that?

                                     ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
                         Well, er... thank you very much.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         Let me wrap it for you, sir.

               He puts it in a wrapper which says 'Educational Books'.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         Shall I put you on our mailing 
                         list?

                                     ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
                         Oh no! But I'll look in again...

                                     MR. PETERS
                         By all means, sir.

               He holds open the door for the Elderly Gentleman, and 
               watches him leave.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         He won't be doing the crossword 
                         tonight!

               He turns triumphantly to Mark.

                                     MR. PETERS
                              (counting out money 
                              from wallet)
                         Those pictures he chose... were 
                         all yours!
                              (handing notes)
                         This is yours!

               Mark pockets them without counting them. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

                                     MR. PETERS
                              (in a very different 
                              tone)
                         And this is yours too...

               He picks up a postcard - holds it towards Mark.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         And that's what I want to talk to 
                         you about. It's a clever picture - 
                         because you're a clever lad... 
                         but, Mark...
                              (pathetically)
                         It's all face.

               Mark looks at the postcard in silence.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         I don't want to hurt your feelings, 
                         son - but if people want the Mona 
                         Lisa they go to the National 
                         Gallery.

                                     MARK
                         The Louvre.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         Well, wherever they go, they don't 
                         come here... so no more of this 
                         fancy stuff...

               He pats Mark's arm.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         ... now get upstairs - the girls 
                         are waiting... and so is a bonus 
                         if you give me what I want.

                                     MARK
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     MR. PETERS
                              (amused)
                         What do you do with all your money?

                                     MARK
                         Buy cameras.

               He opens a door at the far end of the room. We catch a 
               glimpse of a winding staircase. He starts to climb it.

               INT. REAR OF NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - DAY

               At the top of the staircase is a door. Mark and his camera 
               trudge towards it. The door opens suddenly. A vivacious 
               young redhead - Milly - pokes her head round. She has a 
               towel round her shoulders.

                                     MILLY
                         Well look who's here! Cecil Beaton!

               From REVERSE ANGLE WE SEE Mark venture a shy smile at Milly. 
               Milly opens the door impatiently.

                                     MILLY
                         Come on, sonny... make us famous.

               Through the half-open door we catch a glimpse of a second 
               Girl (LORRAINE). She is staring out of a window, her back 
               to camera. She is naked except for a shawl draped round 
               her shoulders.  

               Mark enters the room... the door begins to close. CAMERA 
               TRACKS towards the door. On the threshold of the room, a 
               hood is thrown over our faces. THE SCREEN BLACKS OUT.

               In the darkness WE HEAR Milly's voice.

                                     MILLY (O.S.)
                         Did you read about that girl who 
                         was murdered last night?

               INT. STUDIO ABOVE NEWSAGENT'S - DAY

               We are with Mark under the hood of an antiquated camera. 
               Through the ground-glass of the camera WE SEE a SMALL 
               INVERTED IMAGE of Milly.

                                     MILLY (O.S.)
                         The same thing nearly happened to 
                         me!

               We hear Lorraine's voice - muffled, and very far away.

                                     LORRAINE (O.S.)
                         When?

                                     MILLY (O.S.)
                         Last night! I went out with my 
                         boyfriend... We're getting married 
                         next month... trouble was my fiance 
                         saw us.

               The SMALL INVERTED IMAGE of Milly peers anxiously into the 
               camera.

                                     MILLY
                         can you fix it so the bruises don't 
                         show?

               The ground-glass camera begins travelling slowly down 
               Milly's back.

               CLOSE SHOT of Milly. She is on a couch, lying on her stomach 
               at a slightly oblique angle. All that WE CAN SEE are her 
               face and naked shoulders.

               From Milly's POV WE SEE Mark under the hood of an antiquated 
               camera.

                                     MILLY
                         Well, can you?

               Mark's voice is MUFFLED under the hood.

                                     MARK
                         ...think so, Milly.

                                     MILLY
                         Then be quick about it, sonny! I'm 
                         freezing.

               CLOSE SHOT of her naked toes. They start to wriggle.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark's toes - in sandals, next to the tripod 
               of the camera. They start to wriggle. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine. We watch her in profile as she 
               stares out of the window - clutching her shawl. She has 
               outstandingly beautiful features. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is standing by the side of the 
               camera, studying us thoughtfully. He is holding a remote-
               control switch panel in his hand. He clicks off several 
               lights and then switches several others on... then he ducks 
               back under the hood.

                                     MILLY
                         There he goes again! What have you 
                         got under there? A girlfriend?

               We join Mark under the hood.  

               WE SEE a small INVERTED IMAGE of Milly on the ground-glass. 
               Her shoulders are now white and glistening, her spine 
               caressed by shadows. She is staring into the camera.

                                     MILLY
                         I suppose you have a girlfriend?

               He adjusts the focus. We can see more clearly the contempt 
               on Milly's face.

                                     MARK
                         No, Milly. 

                                     MILLY
                         Hear that, Lorraine? He's available.

               From Milly's POV WE SEE Mark come round to the front of 
               the camera, and insert a dark slide.

                                     MARK
                         Raise your head, please - and look 
                         at the sea.

                                     MILLY (O.S.)
                         What sea?

               Mark presses a rubber bulb - the shutter clicks.

                                     MILLY
                         What sea?

               Mark inserts another dark slide.

                                     MARK
                         I just wanted that puzzled look.

                                     MILLY (O.S.)
                         Oh, did you? Well if you want it 
                         again, I'll think of you!

               CAMERA PULLS BACK

               from Milly's viewpoint, WE SEE Mark holding the rubber 
               bulb. cine-camera is on a ledge behind him.

                                     MILLY
                         You're a puzzle and a half.

               Mark presses the rubber bulb - the shutters click. 

                                     MILLY
                         This is a spare time job for you, 
                         isn't it?

                                     MARK
                         Yes, Milly.

               He inserts another slide.

                                     MILLY
                         Well, what do you do for a living?

                                     MARK
                         Take pictures.

               He presses the bulb - the shutters click.

                                     MILLY
                         This sort?

                                     MARK
                         No, Milly.

               He inserts another slide.

                                     MILLY
                         Don't you like this sort?

                                     MARK
                         No, Milly.

               He presses the bulb - the shutters click.

                                     MILLY
                         Well what sort do you like?

               Mark looks at her thoughtfully for a long moment.

                                     MARK
                         I may show you - one day.

                                     MILLY
                         That'll be a treat, I'm sure.

               Mark smiles at her shyly.

                                     MARK
                         That's all, Milly.

                                     MILLY
                         Oh no, sonny! Now take one I can 
                         show my mother.

               Mark inserts another slide.

                                     MARK
                         Think of her then.

               There is a gentle KNOCK at the door, and Mr. Peters enters. 
               He carries a tray of coffee. He keeps his eyes modestly 
               lowered.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         On the house.

               He lays the tray on a table, still keeping his eyes lowered, 
               and goes out.

                                     MILLY
                         Some house! Hope it falls on his 
                         ruddy earhole!

               She glances over her shoulder.

                                     MILLY
                         It's your turn now, love...

               CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine staring out of the window. She 
               stiffens. Milly's voice is overlaid.

                                     MILLY (O.S.)
                              (in a whisper)
                         ... it's her first time.

               Lorraine clutches her shawl tightly.

                                     MILLY
                         Come on, love. Don't be shy.

               Lorraine turns round.  

               The left side of her face is classical in its beauty. She 
               has a hare lip, which twists and distorts the whole of the 
               right side. Her eyes are large - and beautiful - and 
               defiant.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark looking at her.

               CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine.

                                     LORRAINE
                         He said... you needn't photograph 
                         my face!

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

                                     MARK
                         I want to.

               CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine. Beautiful in profile.

                                     LORRAINE
                         I suppose you'll fix my bruises 
                         too?

                                     MARK
                         I want to...

                                     MILLY
                         What about the customers?

               CLOSE SHOT of the shawl round Lorraine's shoulders.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

                                     MARK
                         You needn't be shy... of me... 
                         it's my first time too.

               CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine's eyes - puzzled.

                                     LORRAINE
                         Yours?

                                     MARK
                         In front of eyes... like...

               He tries to go on - but words are a foreign language to 
               him.

                                     MARK
                         ...eyes... as full of...

               In a sudden rush:

                                     MARK
                         Lorraine - let my camera tell you.

               CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine standing very still  looking at 
               him in silence.

               Milly shrugs and reaches for the coffee pot.

               Overlaid is the gentle purring of a cine-camera.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK

               INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING - TOWARDS SUNSET

               The hand filling the glass is a woman's (MRS. STEPHENS). 
               She is sitting in a high-backed chair, and we cannot see 
               her face. Over her shoulder we watch a party in progress. 
               A group of Young people have surrounded someone to whom 
               they are singing:

                                     YOUNG PEOPLE
                              (singing)
                         Happy birthday to you, 
                         Happy birthday to you,

               CAMERA TRACKS towards them.

               CLOSE SHOT of TONY HUNTER, a well-built youngster in his 
               middle twenties.

                                     TONY
                         Happy birthday... dear Helen

               He obviously means it.

                                     TONY
                         happy birthday to you.

               CLOSE SHOT of 'dear HELEN'. A sensitive, intelligent, and 
               extremely attractive girl, who  as the encircling 
               youngsters now inform us in song - is:

                                     YOUNG PEOPLE
                         Twenty-one today,
                         She's twenty-one today,
                         She's got the key of the door,
                         She's never been twenty-one before.

               CLOSE SHOT of the glass by Mrs. Stephens' side. It is half 
               empty. An elderly lady leans across to her. She is Mrs. 
               Partridge, slightly high on a glass of sherry.

                                     MRS. PARTRIDGE
                         You must be very proud of your 
                         daughter, Mrs. Stephens.

               Mrs. Stephens grunts. Someone switches on a gramophone and 
               the young couples start dancing at once. Tony hurries up 
               to Helen.

                                     TONY
                         May I?

               Helen goes towards him. A YOUNG MAN calls out sharply:

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Look!

               He is pointing at something out of camera. All heads - 
               except Mrs. Stephens' - follow the direction of his gaze.  
               Mrs. Stephens continues to sit motionless in the high-backed 
               chair.

               CAMERA PANS to the window. Mark is standing there.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at Mark. We watch him over her 
               shoulder - Tony's arm encircling it.

                                     TONY (O.S.)
                         It's that chap from upstairs.

               EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - EVENING - LOW SUN

               The chap from upstairs presses his face to the window. 
               From his POV WE SEE Helen's eyes looking at him - the key 
               of the door in them - looking at him, not staring. Suddenly 
               the rest comes into focus - Tony's arm around Helen's 
               shoulder... the high-backed chair in the foreground with 
               the back of that motionless head... a young couple giggling 
               as they stare at him. Mark steps away, and the CAMERA PULLS 
               BACK with him.

               We catch a glimpse of the house - large, sprawling, but 
               with a touch of quality about it, in a quiet, unpretentious 
               street.

               Mark hurries towards a side entrance.

               INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at the empty window.

                                     HELEN
                         I'll ask him in...

               CLOSE SHOT of Tony - frowning.

               CAMERA PANS to Mrs. Stephens' glass... the hand which 
               refills it has begun to tremble.

               INT. REAR OF HOUSE - NIGHT

               The lights are on.

               WE FOLLOW Mark (and his camera) along a small passage which 
               leads to the hall. The sound of a dance record can be heard. 
               Mark starts to whistle it under his breath.

               INT. HALL - NIGHT

               Over his shoulder we see a staircase, and beyond it the 
               door of Helen's sitting room. The sound of Helen's party 
               fills the hall.

               Mark reaches the staircase. There is the sound of a door 
               opening. Helen's voice is overlaid:

                                     HELEN (O.S.)
                         Excuse me!

               Mark hesitates, then turns round. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - smiling at him.

                                     HELEN
                         I don't know how many times we've 
                         passed each other on the stairs?

               Mark looks at her as if he does.

                                     HELEN
                         ... but tonight I'm determined at 
                         least to say hello to you! So hello!

               Her directness is natural, consistent and very hard to 
               resist.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - smiling.

                                     HELEN
                         I'm Helen Stephens.

               She glances with unconcealed interest at the camera over 
               his shoulder.

                                     HELEN
                         I'm having a party - and the other 
                         tenants are there...  And a few 
                         friends. We'd like you to join us.

                                     MARK
                         Mark... 

                                     HELEN
                         Pardon?

                                     MARK
                         I'm Mark...

                                     HELEN
                         Hallo, Mark.

               She holds out her hand... he takes it gently.

                                     HELEN
                         Please come in... you'll meet the 
                         others who live here, and...

                                     MARK
                         Thank you, but... work.

                                     HELEN
                         Oh...

               She glances again at his camera.

                                     HELEN
                         Well, I hope to keep it going for 
                         hours yet... so when you've finished 
                         why not look in?

               She realizes that this is not the happiest of phrases.

                                     HELEN
                         ...Mark?

               He hesitates. 

               CAMERA PANS to Helen's door. Tony stands there.

                                     TONY
                         Darling, your cake - everyone's 
                         waiting.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - looking at her.

                                     MARK
                         Thank you.

               He turns away.

                                     MARK
                         Happy Birthday.

               He hurries up the stairs.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen. She stares after him for a moment. 
               Then returns thoughtfully to her party.

                                                               FADE OUT:

               The screen remains dark for a moment. We are with Mark in 
               a darkened room. He is giving a film show - and we are the 
               screen.

               INT. MARK'S DARK-ROOM - NIGHT

               His cine-projector points straight at us.  A flickering 
               light shines in our eyes. We can see him crouching behind 
               the projector.

               Mark leans forward, watching the screen intently... 
               Perspiration trickles down his forehead. He is breathing 
               very quickly. The sounds of the party seep up from 
               downstairs - music, laughter, and a Girl's yelp.

               There is a knock on the door. Mark does not hear it.  

               CAMERA PANS to the door of the room. It is blacked-out 
               like a photographic dark-room. The knock is repeated.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He switches off the projector instantly.

               CAMERA PANS to an open cupboard in the corner.

               CLOSE SHOT of the shelves. They are stacked with spools of 
               film.

               CAMERA travels slowly over these spools. WE SEE Mark's 
               hand add two more to the collection; his Voice is overlaid.

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         ...minute...

               He closes the cupboard door.

               INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               Mark comes out of the dark-room behind him - the light is 
               kept out by a baffle and a curtain. He has a pleasant, 
               normally untidy bedsitting room.

               He wipes his handkerchief across his forehead - then hurries 
               to the door. He opens it - Helen is standing there.

                                     HELEN
                         I hope I'm not disturbing you?

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - shaking his head, smiling shyly.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen.

                                     HELEN
                         I knew you wouldn't come down... 
                         so I've brought you this.

               She holds out a plate on which is a piece of birthday cake.

                                     MARK
                         Thank you...

               He takes the plate.

                                     MARK
                         ... very much...

                                     HELEN
                         I mustn't keep you from your work 

               She turns to go.

                                     MARK
                         I'd like to offer you a drink.

               She turns round.

                                     HELEN
                         Thank you, Mark.

                                     MARK
                         I haven't one.

                                     HELEN
                         I'd adore some water.

               She smiles.

                                     HELEN
                         a hostess can't drink water at her 
                         own party, it looks like a hint to 
                         the guests.

                                     MARK
                         Will you... would you... like to 
                         come in?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, Mark...

               She steps over the threshold. The door closes behind her.

               INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round the room.

               Mark's voice is overlaid.

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         There's milk... if you'd like some?

                                     HELEN
                         Very much... if you can spare it?

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         Yes.

               Helen glances towards the inner room. He holds out a glass 
               of milk to her.

                                     HELEN
                         Thank you, Mark...

               She drinks it with relish. He watches her in silence.

                                     HELEN
                         This is a pleasant room... and 
                         you've another inside?

                                     MARK
                         Yes.

                                     HELEN
                         How long have you lived here?

                                     MARK
                         All my life.

               She looks at him in surprise.

                                     MARK
                         I was born in this house Oh?

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

                                     MARK
                         It's my father's.

                                     HELEN
                         Do you mean I've at last found out 
                         who our landlord is? Your father?

                                     MARK
                         Well - no... he's dead!

               He hesitates.

                                     MARK
                         I'm the landlord.

               She looks at him in astonishment.

                                     HELEN
                         YOU?

                                     MARK
                         Yes.

                                     HELEN
                         But you walk about as if you haven't 
                         paid the rent.

                                     MARK
                         I haven't.

                                     HELEN
                         I meant...

                                     MARK
                         I know.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

                                     MARK
                         It's his house - and I'll never 
                         sell it... but I can't afford the 
                         upkeep, so I let rooms.

               He looks at her anxiously.

                                     MARK
                         ... if I charge too much, tell me 
                         and I'll tell the agents.

                                     HELEN
                         The rent's very reasonable, but 
                         don't say anything to the others 
                         or you'll have no peace.

                                     MARK
                         Peace...? 

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen.

                                     HELEN
                         Mark, what do you do?

                                     MARK
                              (slowly)
                         Most of the time, I work in a film 
                         studio.

                                     HELEN
                         On the photographic side, I'll 
                         bet.

                                     MARK
                         I hope to be a film director... 
                         very soon.

                                     HELEN
                         How exciting.

                                     MARK
                         I have some spare time jobs... as 
                         well.

                                     HELEN
                         To do with photography?

                                     MARK
                         More milk?

                                     HELEN
                         No thank you... to do with 
                         photography?

                                     MARK
                         Yes... to do with photography...

                                     HELEN
                         When I came in were you looking at 
                         some films?

                                     MARK
                         Yes. 

                                     HELEN
                         Of yours? 

                                     MARK
                         Yes.

                                     HELEN
                         I'd like to see them...

               He looks at her in silence.

                                     HELEN
                         Know I'm being rude... but I really 
                         would like to see them...
                              (she smiles.)
                         ...it would be a birthday present... 
                         from you to me.

                                     MARK
                         Would it?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, Mark.

                                     MARK
                         Oh...

                                     HELEN
                         But I suppose you're too busy?

               She puts down the glass, turns to the door.

                                     MARK
                         Will you... would you... like to 
                         see them now?

               She turns round. He is standing by the entrance to the 
               inner room.

                                     HELEN
                         Thank you...

                                     MARK
                         I'll... go first.

               He leads the way - she follows. For a moment the screen is 
               in darkness. A dark-room darkness.

               INT. THE INNER ROOM - NIGHT

               We can HEAR - faintly  the dance music from downstairs.  
               There is a click - and the walls are suddenly bathed in 
               diffused light, throwing the room into delicate shadow. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round in amazement.

               As certain events of possible interest are to take place 
               in this room, here, in detail, is what amazes Helen.

               The room is the product of three rooms which have been 
               knocked into one. It is very large and extremely well 
               constructed (as we are soon to learn, it was originally a 
               laboratory). One half of the room is used for processing, 
               and the other half for filming - and for trade shows. The 
               two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are perched 
               all shapes and sizes of cameras, their spectacles glinting 
               in the light.

               In the processing half two benches (a 'dry' bench and a 
               'wet' bench) face each other against opposite walls. There 
               are three sinks above the 'wet' bench and an outburst of 
               equipment above the 'dry'.

               This part of the room is lit by two dark-room lamps frowning 
               in the ceiling above the benches.

               The other part of the room has a window at the far end of 
               it. Heavy drapes are putted across it.

               Mark's projector rests on a small table in front of the 
               16mm screen.  Two banks of floods and a variety of spots 
               light this part of the room. There is a small control panel 
               on the wall.  

               Some of the equipment is ancient - but none of it is old. 
               All of it glistens with the affection of its owner.

               There is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone 
               except an adult... the kind who starts to wonder who paid 
               for it all.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He stands by the lighting panel, 
               watching Helen.

               From his POV WE SEE her brushing the hair out of her eyes 
               as she looks slowly round. He brushes the hair out of his. 
               For a moment she turns her back to him. He presses a switch 
               on the wall. A gentle light ripples through the back of 
               Helen's hair.

               SHOT of Helen. She turns to him. She is very nearly at a 
               loss for words.

                                     HELEN
                         This is so... well - so many 
                         things... but above all - it's 
                         so...

               She takes a final look round.

                                     HELEN
                         ...completely unexpected! 

               She looks at him searchingly.

                                     HELEN
                         Is all of it yours?

                                     MARK
                         Yes.

                                     HELEN
                         I mean... is it designed by you? 
                         Furnished by you? Tell me about 
                         this room.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.  

                                     MARK
                         It belonged to my father 

                                     HELEN
                         What was he?  

                                     MARK
                         Scientist...

                                     HELEN
                         Then this equipment was his?

                                     MARK
                         No...

               He hesitates.

                                     MARK
                         Sold his to buy it...

                                     HELEN
                         But it seems to be so... technical.

               She looks at him with renewed interest.

                                     HELEN
                         If this is where you work, I can't 
                         wait to see what you work at.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - in difficulties.

                                     MARK
                         Don't know what to show you?

                                     HELEN
                         Well... what were you looking at 
                         when I interrupted you?

               He looks at her thoughtfully.

                                     MARK
                         All right!

               He crosses to the corner cupboard - opens the door.

               CLOSE SHOT of the cupboard.  WE SEE Mark's hand reach for 
               a spool of film... then hesitate, poised above another 
               spool.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - watching with interest.

               REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mark. He closes the cupboard, and 
               turns round... there is a spool of film in his hand.

               He walks slowly towards his projector... he seems  for 
               the moment  to have forgotten she is there.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - watching him thread the film into 
               the projector.

                                     MARK
                         This is the first... twenty-first 
                         birthday present... I'll ever have 
                         given.

                                     HELEN
                         It's the first I've ever asked 
                         for...

               He places a chair a few feet away from the screen - and, 
               with an oddly courteous bow, beckons her into it. She sits 
               down.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He looks at her intently for a moment - 
               then turns off the lights. Over Helen's shoulder We can 
               just make out the empty screen. Mark switches on the 
               projector.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - the light flickering on her face. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at Helen's face.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen. WE SEE her expression of surprise. 
               Over Mark's shoulder WE SEE the surprise growing. Over 
               Helen's shoulder we see the screen. We are looking at a 
               small boy. He is lying in his bed asleep. Although the 
               print is old, we can see that he is a remarkably handsome 
               boy.

                                     HELEN
                         Mark, what a beautiful child.

               The boy turns restlessly in his sleep... one of his pillows 
               falls to the floor.

                                     HELEN
                         Who is he?

                                     MARK
                         Me

                                     HELEN
                         Of course it is!  Then who took 
                         this film?

                                     MARK
                              (quietly)
                         My Father. 

               A light - as if from a small torch  starts to shine on 
               the child's eyes. He moves restlessly.

                                     HELEN
                         What a wonderful idea...

               The light plays on the child's left eye, then on his right. 
               It is growing brighter.

                                     HELEN
                         You'll be able to show it to your 
                         own chi...

               The child wakes up suddenly. He stares at something... 
               then starts to scream.

                                     HELEN
                         You must have had a bad dream...

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching her in silence.

                                     HELEN
                         ...but what was that light?  ...The 
                         camera, I suppose?  

               Mark does not answer. The small screen is filled with the 
               face of the screaming, terrified child.

               (Mark's father now tries a not altogether successful 
               dissolve:)

               WE NOW SEE the little boy standing in front of a garden 
               wall. He tries hard to climb to the top of the wall, but 
               falls over. Helen laughs. Mark watches her in silence. 
               Small Mark tries again - and again - to scale the wall... 
               At last he succeeds.

                                     HELEN
                         Whatever are you after?  

               WE SEE the little boy lying flat on the wall staring at 
               something... rapt, motionless.  

               The cine-camera which is taking this picture now tracks 
               rather clumsily towards the wall.

               HIGH ANGLE SHOT over the wall of what is fascinating young 
               Mark - A man and woman are lying on the ground, kissing. 

               The CINE-CAMERA PANS - again rather clumsily - to young 
               Mark... staring intently.

                                     HELEN
                         Naughty boy I hope you were spanked!

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen. It suddenly occurs to her.

                                     HELEN
                         ... but, Mark... what a strange 
                         thing for your father to photograph.

                                     MARK
                         Switch off?

                                     HELEN
                         No.

               She stares again at that lonely figure perched on the wall.

                                     HELEN
                         No. 

               The small screen begins to dissolve ...so does the large 
               one.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               Over Mrs. Stephens' shoulder WE SEE the party in progress. 
               The glass by her side is full again. Tony is dancing with 
               an attractive blonde.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Tony!

               He turns round.

                                     TONY
                         Me, Mrs. Stephens?

               The head nods.

               Tony advances reluctantly towards her.

               REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens.

               Over Tony's shoulder WE SEE a powerfully built and once 
               lovely woman.

               She is so perpetually drunk as almost to be sober. The few 
               movements she makes are slow - deliberate - and give nothing 
               away. The voice articulates so carefully that the slur 
               scarcely shows.

               The fact that she is blind almost helps to conceal the 
               fact that she is drunk. Her sightless eyes stare out the 
               camera as Tony reaches her.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         I want a word with you.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen's eyes. The light from the projector 
               flickering into them.

                                     HELEN
                         I hate people who chatter in films - 
                         but there's so much I want to ask.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK

               INT. THE INNER ROOM - NIGHT

               She is leaning forward, her face cupped in her hand, 
               watching the small screen intently.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. His face is cupped in his hand as he 
               watches her intently.

               Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE Mark in the making.

               The child is again asleep... this time he is being 
               photographed from the head of the bed - the CAMERA POINTING 
               STRAIGHT DOWN AT HIS FACE.

               A beam of light starts to shine onto his eyes, first onto 
               the left, then onto the right.

                                     HELEN
                              (in a whisper)
                         Again?

               Mark looks at her in silence.

               The boy moves restlessly, then turns over onto his face, 
               pulling the bedclothes round him. His right hand is limp 
               on the pillow. The light shines for a moment on this hand, 
               then goes out.  Helen half turns towards Mark.

                                     HELEN
                         Mark, this isn't some kind of jo...

               Her attention is suddenly riveted on the screen.

                                     MARK
                              (in a whisper)
                         No, Helen. 

               Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE something drop onto the child's 
               bed... something which stays quite still for a moment, 
               then starts crawling towards the counterpane. It is a small 
               lizard.

                                     HELEN
                         Mark, whatever is that?

               Her voice trails away. She stares - repelled and fascinated - 
               at the screen.

               WE SEE Mark reach for his cine-camera. 

               Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE the lizard reach the 
               counterpane. It stretches itself out on the floral design - 
               its body is pointed towards the child's hand.

               WE HEAR a click - and suddenly a spotlight falls onto 
               Helen's face.

               OVERLAID is the GENTLE PURRING of Mark's cine-camera. She 
               wheels towards him - blotting out the small screen.

                                     HELEN
                         What are you...

                                     MARK
                         wanted to photograph you... 
                         watching...

                                     HELEN
                         No, Mark!

               The camera purrs on.

                                     HELEN
                         No!

               He switches off the spot... the purring of the camera dies 
               away. She turns towards the small screen.

                                     HELEN
                         help me to understand this... this 
                         nightmare...

               The small boy is sitting upright... screaming with terror... 
               there is no sign of the lizard.

               A handkerchief is thrown onto the boy's bed. He continues 
               crying - looking up into someone's face.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching the screen.

               We hear a man's deep voice overlaid.

                                     MAN'S DEEP VOICE (O.S.)
                         That'll do Mark... dry your eyes 
                         and stop being silly.

               Small Mark reaches for the handkerchief and wipes his 
               eyes... his hands are trembling.

               The small screen trembles with them into a clumsy dissolve.

               Helen turns to Mark.

                                     HELEN
                         All right... now look... Mark - 
                         what was all that about?

               He looks at her helplessly.

                                     HELEN
                         ... that was a lizard, wasn't it? 
                         Or a...

                                     MARK
                         Liz...

                                     HELEN
                         Well how did it get there?... How 
                         did it get there Mark?...  Was it 
                         a pet?

                                     MARK
                         Not mine...

                                     HELEN
                         Won't you try to explain?

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at the screen.

                                     MARK
                         You'd better go!

                                     HELEN
                         I like to understand what I'm shown!

               She turns to the screen.

                                     HELEN
                         What was your father trying to 
                         do?... Photographing you at nigh...

               Her voice trails away.

                                     MARK
                         better go...

               From Helen's POV WE SEE the screen.

               Small Mark is wearing a dark suit and a black tie.

               He is standing at the foot of a four-poster bed, staring 
               at something in horror and disbelief... his hands clasp 
               the bedrail tightly.

               Slowly - very slowly - he walks towards the head of the 
               bed, staring.

               His lips begin to quiver. He bends forward over the bed. 
               WE CAN SEE the back of his bowed head.

                                     HELEN
                         Mark... what is this?

                                     MARK
                         I am saying... goodbye... my 
                         mother...

               We catch a glimpse of a woman's hands folded in front of 
               her.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen.

                                     HELEN
                              (in a whisper)
                         He... photographed... that...?

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

                                     MARK
                         Yes.

               Suddenly - and healthily - his temper snaps.

                                     MARK
                         ...and this!

               He pushes a lever on his projector as far forward as it 
               will go.

               The film is now shown at tremendous speed - We catch a 
               glimpse of a long line of cars.

                                     MARK
                         ...her funeral!

               It speeds by.

                                     MARK
                         ...and this!

               A confused picture of earth and flowers.

                                     MARK
                         ...her burial!

               The briefest glimpse of a little boy with a spade.

                                     MARK
                         ...and this!

               WE SEE a girl in a bikini by sand-dunes. Mark offers no 
               comment.

                                     HELEN
                         Mark, who is that?

                                     MARK
                         Her successor.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen.

                                     HELEN
                         Suc-?

                                     MARK
                         He married her... six weeks after... 
                         the previous sequence.

               He pulls back the lever of his projector... the film returns 
               to its normal speed.

               WE SEE the same attractive young woman standing in a garden. 
               She is holding a bewildered and defiant Mark by the hand.

               Suddenly the girl runs towards camera - leaving Mark 
               standing alone.

                                     MARK
                         She filmed... what comes now.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen watching intently.  It's out of focus!

               From Helen's POV WE SEE a tall man in a black coat walking 
               away from camera. He hurries towards small Mark - who 
               watches him anxiously.

                                     HELEN
                         Is that your father?

                                     MARK
                         The morning that he left for his 
                         honeymoon.

               The back of Mark's father suddenly obscures our view of 
               small Mark... all we can see is that tall figure looking 
               downwards standing very still.

               Camera wobbles - as if the person holding it is laughing.

                                     HELEN
                         What is he doing?

                                     MARK
                         Giving me a present...

                                     HELEN
                         What was it?

               Mark stares at the blurred screen, perspiration trickling 
               down his forehead.

                                     MARK
                         Can't you guess?

               The small screen comes back into focus - and suddenly our 
               camera rushes towards it.

               WE SEE a CLOSE SHOT of a CLOSE SHOT - and at the moment we 
               see it, Mark's Voice is overlaid... A whisper which echoes 
               round the room.

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         A camera...

               We are looking at a close shot of a camera in a small boy's 
               hands.

               There is a single shrill chord of music on the sound track.

               CLOSE SHOT of the shelf which encircles Mark's room.  

               We are looking at the very same camera which the small boy 
               is holding.

               CLOSE SHOT of the camera in small Mark's hands.

               His father's finger points lo the view-finder.

               Small Mark stares into it. Small Mark begins to smile.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching himself being born.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen watching Mark.

                                     HELEN
                         Switch it off!

               He continues to stare at the screen.

                                     HELEN
                         Switch it off, Mark!

               She turns to the projector - touches the wrong switch.

               Small Mark and his father go rapidly backwards.

               Mark turns off the projector abruptly. 

               The room is in darkness.

               WE CAN HEAR both of them breathing quickly. 

               The light goes on. Mark is standing by the exit - he keeps 
               his face averted.

               Helen walks slowly towards the exit. She glances round 
               once, over her shoulder, then goes into the other room. 

               Mark stares after her.

               INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               She walks towards the door... turns round suddenly - almost 
               in anger.

                                     HELEN
                         So he was a scientist?

               He keeps his face averted.

                                     HELEN
                         What kind of scientist, Mark?

                                     MARK
                         Biologist.

                                     HELEN
                         What was he trying to do to you?

               He doesn't answer.

                                     HELEN
                         Mark!...

               He turns round slowly. From his POV WE SEE the willingness 
               to understand on her face.

                                     HELEN
                         What was he trying to do to you?

                                     MARK
                         Watch me... grow up...

               She walks towards him... takes his handkerchief from his 
               jacket pocket and wipes his forehead.

                                     MARK
                         He wanted a record of a growing 
                         child... complete in every detail - 
                         if such a thing were possible - 
                         and he tried to make it possible 
                         by training a camera on me... at 
                         all times...

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

                                     MARK
                         I never knew... the whole of my 
                         childhood... one moment's privacy...

                                     HELEN
                         And those lights in your eyes?... 
                         and that - thing?

                                     MARK
                         He was interested ... in the 
                         reactions of the nervous system... 
                         to fear...  Fear?

                                     HELEN
                         Fear? 

                                     MARK
                         Fear.

               CLOSE SHOT of the word 'fear'. 

               CAMERA PULLS BACK

               We are looking at the spine of a book on Mark's shelf. The 
               full title reads: The Physiology of Fear by Professor A. 
               N. Lewis.

               MARK'S VOICE IS OVERLAID:

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         Especially fear in children - and 
                         how they react to it.

               CLOSE SHOT of the word 'fear' on the next book.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK

               The full title reads: FEAR AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, PART I. 
               PROFESSOR A. N. LEWIS.  There is a row of such books all 
               by Professor Lewis.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

                                     MARK
                         I think he learned a lot... from 
                         me... I'd wake up... screaming... 
                         sometimes... and he'd be there... 
                         taking notes... and pictures... 
                         and I'm sure good came of it... 
                         for some people... He was brilliant.

                                     HELEN
                         A scientist drops a lizard onto a 
                         child's bed - and good comes of 
                         it?

                                     MARK
                         I don't know... if he did... but 
                         if he did... he'll have learned 
                         something of value...

                                     HELEN
                         If only about lizards!  Mark - it 
                         sounds to me as if your father 
                         was...

                                     MARK
                         He founded clinics.

                                     HELEN
                         He sounds completely...

                                     MARK
                         He was famous! Professor A. N. 
                         Lewis... three clinics.

                                     HELEN
                         Why do you still live in his 
                         house... and watch his films?

                                     MARK
                         They helped make me... what I am.

                                     HELEN
                         A photographer? It's no wonder, is 
                         it? But you still haven't shown me 
                         anything you've photographed!

               He looks at her in silence.

                                     HELEN
                         Will you?

               There is a knock on the door.

                                     MARK
                         One day...

               He hurries to the door, and opens it. 

               Tony is standing there.

                                     TONY
                         Excuse me, but...

               From Tony's POV WE SEE Helen looking at the door of the 
               dark room.

                                     TONY
                         Oh, there you are, Helen.

               She turns towards him.

                                     TONY
                         The party looks like breaking up, 
                         and we were wondering if...

                                     HELEN
                         I'm coming.

               She turns to Mark.

                                     HELEN
                         I wish you'd join us.

               Mark shakes his head.

                                     MARK
                         Thanks... work.

                                     HELEN
                         I hope that you...

               She is suddenly aware of Tony watching her. She glances at 
               the birthday cake on the table.

                                     HELEN
                         ... have a sweet tooth!

               She smiles at him.

                                     HELEN
                         Thank you... for my present.

               She goes into the passage.

                                     TONY
                         Good night, old boy.

               He puts his arm round Helen, and closes the door. 

               Mark stares after them, motionless.

               The CAMERA LINGERS on the birthday cake.

               As the light fades, a voice yells: Cut!

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. FILM STUDIO - DAY

               HIGH ANGLE SHOT of a set showing part of a large West End 
               store.

               A blonde is lying unconscious in front of a lift - and a 
               crowd of extras surround her. 

               As the word 'cut' dies away, the extras relax - and the 
               blonde (DIANE ASHLEY) props herself onto her elbow, looking 
               towards the Director.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Director (ARTHUR BADEN) standing beside 
               the camera.

                                     BADEN
                         OK. Print that one!

               He glances at the CHIEF CAMERAMAN (PHILIP TALE), who nods 
               his head in agreement.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark standing at the back of the camera crew. 
               He shakes his head in disagreement.

               The Chief Cameraman spots Mark's small mutiny and wags his 
               finger at him. As the Chief Cameraman turns away, Mark's 
               finger automatically wags back.

               CLOSE SHOT of Baden looking at his watch. He sighs, then 
               nods to the Assistant Director who stands beside him.

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                         All right, everyone! Back at two!

               Baden walks out without a word to anyone. A hubbub of 
               chatter breaks out. The unit downs tools and begins to 
               disperse.

               CLOSE SHOT of one of the extras (VIVIAN) - a small, 
               vivacious, brunette with delicate, attractive features.

               She edges towards the camera crew.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching her.

               Over his shoulder WE SEE Vivian glance towards him. He 
               nods almost imperceptibly.

               Vivian hurries towards the exit.

               Mark turns to a shelf behind him - picks up his cine-camera 
               and a little full string bag containing his lunch.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. STUDIO GROUNDS - DAY

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian munching a sandwich.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK

               She is leaning against a wall in a corner of an exterior 
               set - a Chinese temple or a medieval castle (or a 
               combination of each like a Pinewood drawing-room).  

               Beside her she has a small tape-recorder, or record-player. 
               We hear music - modem rhythms.

               There are several people strolling about - but no one in 
               the immediate vicinity. No one... except Mark.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - settling down on the other side of 
               the wall (where they can talk without being seen together).

                                     VIVIAN
                         Mark?

                                     MARK
                         Hallo...  

                                     VIVIAN
                         Were you spotted?  

                                     MARK
                         Don't think so.

                                     VIVIAN
                              (switches off music)
                         Is it tonight? 

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

                                     MARK
                         Yes.

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Mark...

                                     MARK
                         Yes?

                                     VIVIAN
                         You're sure we won't be caught?

                                     MARK
                         Not if you do as I tell you.

                                     VIVIAN
                         I will, I promise.

                                     MARK
                         You haven't... said anything... to 
                         anyone?

                                     VIVIAN
                         Of course not.

                                     MARK
                         Good... like some cake?

                                     VIVIAN
                         Thank you.

               We see him break off a piece of birthday cake, and pass it 
               over to her.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Mark... I want to be quite clear 
                         about this...

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at his cake.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Tonight, when the studio's empty... 
                         I'm to come back-and you're going 
                         to give me a film test... right?

                                     MARK
                         Right.

                                     VIVIAN
                         You'll then print the film - so I 
                         can show it to my agent and anyone 
                         else who matters - right?

                                     MARK
                         Right.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Mark...

               She hesitates.

                                     VIVIAN
                         I've been offered film tests 
                         before... but I haven't liked the 
                         terms.

                                     MARK
                         There aren't any.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Then why are you doing this? Risking 
                         your job and...

                                     MARK
                         Not just for you... Viv... I have 
                         an agent too - and I want to show 
                         him what I can do... I want to 
                         direct...

                                     VIVIAN
                              (switching on music 
                              again)
                         There's someone coming.

               Mark lies motionless behind the wall. A young male EXTRA 
               comes towards Vivian.

                                     EXTRA
                         Hallo - lousy morning's work, wasn't 
                         it?

                                     VIVIAN
                         Yes. 

                                     EXTRA
                         Thought I saw you talking to 
                         somebody...

                                     VIVIAN
                         I was learning my lines.

                                     EXTRA
                         Didn't know you had any...

               He glances at his watch.

                                     EXTRA
                         Want a drink? Dutch?

                                     VIVIAN
                         Later... perhaps.

                                     EXTRA

               He wanders off.

                         Mark...

                                     MARK
                         Yes?

                                     VIVIAN
                              (switching off music 
                              again)
                         You didn't mind me asking?

                                     MARK
                         No, more cake?

                                     VIVIAN
                         No... you want to direct... more 
                         badly than anything don't you?

               Mark is silent, staring at the sky.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Don't you, Mark?

                                     MARK
                         I want... to photograph... the 
                         impossible...

                                     VIVIAN
                         What is impossible?

                                     MARK
                         Something... that has never been 
                         photographed before.

                                     VIVIAN
                         What?

                                     MARK
                         You really want to know...?

                                     VIVIAN
                         Very much, especially if there's a 
                         part for me.

                                     MARK
                         I want... to photograph a murder... 
                         while it's being committed.

                                     VIVIAN
                         No part for me then.

                                     MARK
                         But that... isn't enough.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Is this a new script?

                                     MARK
                         I want... to frighten... someone... 
                         to death... and photograph... their 
                         expression of fear...

                                     VIVIAN
                         Mark! What's this story called?

                                     MARK
                         That is something... he never 
                         photographed...

                                     VIVIAN
                         Who?

               Mark is silent.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Who is he, Mark?

                                     MARK
                         Anyone.

                                     VIVIAN
                         No one could... they'd be caught!

                                     MARK
                         I wouldn't care... if I had my 
                         picture.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Besides, how would you frighten 
                         anyone to death?

                                     MARK
                         There's a way.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Well, what?

                                     MARK
                         There's a way.

                                     VIVIAN
                         You'd better not tell me! I'll be 
                         scared to death tonight as it is!

               A hooter.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Back on the set - shall I go first?

                                     MARK
                         Please.

               She rises to her feet. From behind the wall comes a gentle 
               whirring purring sound.

                                     VIVIAN
                         What are you doing?

                                     MARK
                         Getting into practice.

               She smiles down at him.

                                     VIVIAN
                         See you tonight!

                                     MARK
                         See you tonight!

               She walks away. And the gentle purring continues. CAMERA

               An arc lamp beating down on the set.

               INT. STUDIO - DAY

               Baden bears down on the Assistant Director.

                                     BADEN
                         Would you enquire if our leading 
                         lady is ready to start leading.

               A cry goes up,

                                     ASSISTANT (O.S.)
                         Miss Diane Ashley, please!...

               Miss.  DIANE ASHLEY appears... among the many qualities 
               she radiates is goodwill - especially towards Miss Diane 
               Ashley.

                                     DIANE
                         How are you, Sparks? Chippy? Bob?

                              in the scaffolding)
                         How are you, Pete...?

                                     VOICE
                         Hi, Di!

               She reaches Baden - and completely ignores him.

                                     BADEN
                         Darling, you've only been playing 
                         this part for three weeks, so in 
                         case you haven't yet had a chance 
                         to read the script...

               She ignores this.

                                     BADEN
                         ... may I remind you that you're a 
                         girl with an irresistible impulse!

               She looks at him - then at her hand - and nods.

                                     BADEN
                         a kleptomaniac! Who cannot help 
                         stealing... Get inside her, 
                         Diane!... What - in all the world - 
                         do you most want to steal?

                                     DIANE
                         The limelight!

               Baden sighs.

                                     BADEN
                         We'll run the scene where you catch 
                         sight of the store detective and 
                         faint... Where's the girl who plays 
                         the bystander?

               Vivian steps forward.

                                     BADEN
                         How are you?

                         Hallo, Diane...

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian taking her position in front of the 
               lift. She glances at her watch.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark standing by the side of the studio 
               camera. He glances at his watch.

               CAMERA TRACKS towards the lift.

               From Mark's POV WE SEE Diane catch sight of the Store 
               Detective - and crumple in a faint.

                                     BADEN
                         Hit that floor with a thud!

               A timid knock is overlaid before we dare enter.

               INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE - AFTERNOON

               CLOSE SHOT of a pile of scripts on a great man's desk.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK

               MR. JARVIS is immersed in reading a script... his eyes 
               race across the page.

               Over his shoulder WE SEE what he is reading... a sheet of 
               figures attached to the script.

               At the same time Mr. Jarvis is holding a telephone receiver 
               to his ear - and we hear an enthusiastic VOICE FILTERED 
               THROUGH IT: VOICE (OFF-SCREEN)

                                     VOICE (O.S. FILTERED)
                         ...it's a wonderful subject, D.J.... 
                         Paramount wants it, M.G.M. wants 
                         it, Columbia wants it.

                                     JARVIS
                         But is it commercial?

                                     VOICE (O.S. FILTERED)
                         Danny Angel wants it!

               Still reading the script, Mr. Jarvis lays the receiver on 
               his desk and picks up another.

                                     JARVIS
                         Are those budgets ready? Well bring 
                         'em in.

               He replaces this receiver and picks up the original.

               The voice is still talking - something about 'a wonderful 
               part for Kenny or Alec'...

                                     VOICE (O.S. FILTERED)
                         Send me a memo - we'll discuss it 
                         next week. 

               He replaces the receiver.  MISS SIMPSON enters. She hands 
               him some folders... her smile curtsies. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Mr. Jarvis opening a folder.

               Over his shoulder WE SEE a page covered with row upon row 
               of figures.

               The great man's finger skims along the figures like a tailor 
               feeling cloth.

                                     JARVIS
                         There's an error!  The total should 
                         be a hundred and fifty thousand 
                         pounds fourteen shillings and 
                         sixpence - not thirteen and 
                         ninepence... That could mean the 
                         difference between profit and loss 
                         on a first feature!

                                     MISS SIMPSON
                         Sorry, D.J.

               He glowers at her - but his day is made.

                                     JARVIS
                         Any units working late tonight?

                                     MISS SIMPSON
                         Only one, sir. Night exteriors on 
                         the lot. The Elephant with two...

                                     JARVIS
                         That animal needs a stick of 
                         dynamite!

               CLOSE SHOT of Jarvis.

                                     JARVIS
                         Remind me to pay them a visit 
                         tonight.

                                     MISS SIMPSON
                         Yes, D.J.  

               She makes a note in her little book.

                                     JARVIS
                         Now, Miss Simpson... take a memo 
                         to all department heads...

               Over his shoulder WE SEE an open window. CAMERA TRACKS 
               towards it.

                                     JARVIS (O.S.)
                         In light of the new economy drive...

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

                                     BADEN
                         Again, please... and, darling...

               He turns to Diane, who is wearily picking herself up off 
               the floor.

                                     BADEN
                         ... just this once... will you 
                         please make an effort to forget 
                         that you're stunning, and try to 
                         look as if you're stunned...?

                                     DIANE
                         Say one kind word - and I would 
                         be!

                                     ASSISTANT
                              (hastily)
                         Positions, everyone!

               MONTAGE SEQUENCE:

               Camera crew on a tracking shot. Mark is operating the Selsen 
               motor.  

               Baden - shaking his head.  

               Diane - picking herself up off the floor.  

               Clapper Boy's board  reading: Take 57.  

               Vivian - glancing at her watch.  

               Mark - glancing at his.  

               Diane - picking herself up off the floor.

                         If I have to faint once more I 
                         shall faint!

               CLOSE SHOT of Baden - triumphant at last.

                                     BADEN
                         Cut! How was that?...
                              (thumbs up all round - 
                              with one exception)
                         Mark?

               Mark nods perfunctorily.

                                     BADEN
                         Print it!  

               He glances at his watch - then nods to the Assistant 
               Director.

                                     ASSISTANT
                         That's it, boys and girls . . . 
                         wrap it up! Night-night everyone! 
                         Baden puts his arm round Diane's 
                         shoulder.

                                     BADEN
                         How are you, darling?

               She makes a hobbling exit.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian hurrying towards the exit carrying 
               her little recorder.

               In a burst of chatter, the unit starts to disperse.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark picking up his cine-camera and his lunch 
               bag.

               The CLAPPER BOY comes up to him.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         Catching the bus?

                         Not tonight... meeting someone... 
                         for a drink.

                                     MARK
                         I hope so.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         Good night, Mark.

                                     MARK
                         Good night.

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian. She is sitting at a dressing-room 
               table... making-up with care.

               INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               Three other girls share the dressing room with her.

               There is a knock at the door - and the Young Extra who 
               spoke to Vivian in the grounds pokes his head round.

                                     EXTRA
                         Greetings... lousy afternoon's 
                         work, wasn't it? Who wants a lift 
                         to town?

                         colleague's car... there's room 
                         for two on my lap - three at a 
                         pinch.

                                     1ST GIRL
                         Which is what we'd get.

                                     2ND GIRL
                         You, Viv?

                                     VIVIAN
                         No, thanks... I've a date... at 
                         the Local.

                                     1ST GIRL
                         Us two then?

                                     2ND GIRL
                         I'm game... might as well get 
                         pinched in a car as squeezed in a 
                         tube.

               EXT. THE CAR PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

               The cars are streaming towards the gate.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Baden driving a small new car.  

               CLOSE SHOT of the Chief Cameraman driving a large old one.

               INT. DON JARVIS' OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

               He is still immersed in his figures.  

               Miss Simpson is walking to the door. She glances at her 
               little book.

                                     MISS SIMPSON
                         I'm to remind you to pay a surprise 
                         visit tonight to The Elephant 
                         with...

               He grunts.

                                     MISS SIMPSON
                         Good night, D.J. 

               Jarvis goes on reading...

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian.

               INT. DRESSING ROOM

               Music playing. Vivian moves about nervously in front of a 
               mirror in the deserted dressing room. She wears slacks and 
               a shirt. She glances at her watch - her hands are trembling -
               looks at watch, hears the fireman coming, then switches 
               off the music and hides in the big cupboard -

               INT. CORRIDOR

               Fireman making his rounds, turning off lights.

               EXT. THE CAR PARK - EARLY EVENING

               Only a few cars now remain. It is beginning to grow dark.

               INT. STUDIO CORRIDORS - EARLY EVENING

               The long corridors are dim and deserted.

               INT. PASSAGE - EARLY EVENING

               The fireman is making his rounds.

               INT. DRESSING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Vivian is standing in the cupboard - the lights are on.

               INT. CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING

               Fireman opening the dressing-room doors - and glancing 
               inside.

               INT. POWER HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

               Two electricians are smoking.

               INT. CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING

               Fireman opens the door of Vivian's dressing room.

               INT. DRESSING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               From Vivian's POV WE SEE the lights go out.

               WE HEAR the sound of the door closing - and the Fireman's 
               footsteps disappearing down the corridor.

               INT. DON JARVIS' OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

               The great man closing up his folder... glancing at his 
               watch... turning out the light.

               INT. CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING

               Vivian is hurrying along a deserted corridor... and the 
               little recorder.  

               She pauses - and glances out of a door.

               She carries her case Over her shoulder WE SEE the studio 
               lot - in a blaze of light we can see a crowd of people 
               hanging about in solar topees and tropical kit. 

               REVERSE SHOT of Vivian watching anxiously. 

               She turns away - and hurries down the corridor.

               EXT. THE COURTYARD. EARLY EVENING

               Don Jarvis strides across the courtyard. We can almost 
               hear - and perhaps we do - a cash register ringing up.

               One of the white-clad figures lounging indolently in the 
               doorway glances round, sees the Inquisition approaching 
               and freezes. His degree of terror might satisfy Mark.

               The great man strides on.

               INT. ENTRANCE TO STAGE E. - EARLY EVENING

               Vivian pauses in front of the entrance to the set.  

               Above the note is a notice: 'NO ADMITTANCE WHILE RED LIGHT 
               IS ON'.

               The light is out.  

               Vivian looks round - there is no one in sight.

               Vivian slips in quietly, and closes the door behind her.

               INT. STUDIO - EARLY EVENING

               The set is in darkness.

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian looking round.

                                     VIVIAN
                              (in a whisper)
                         Mark...?

               No reply.  Vivian hesitates... then edges slowly forward.

               Ahead of her are shadowy counters full of merchandise. 
               Beyond them is the door of the lift.  

               CLOSE SHOT of the studio camera and the Director's empty 
               chair beside it.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian edging forward.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Mark...? 

               She reaches one of the counters - and leans against it, 
               looking around.  

               REVERSE ANGLE shot of Vivian. She is leaning against the 
               counter of the trunk department. Trunks and suitcases at 
               'greatly reduced prices' are piled behind her.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian. She starts whistling nervously under 
               her breath.

               Very faintly overlaid is the sound of Mark whistling under 
               his.

               Vivian stops whistling - and so does Mark.

               She listens intently for a moment - then peers at her watch.

               CLOSE SHOT of the watch on Mark's wrist.

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian. She shivers suddenly... then looks 
               at her watch again. She hesitates... then turns towards 
               the exit, and starts to edge back. She trips over a cable 
               and almost falls.

               Suddenly she is bathed in light.

               She wheels round. One of the big spots is beating down on 
               her.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Mark...?

               No sign of him. Overlaid is a gentle purring sound.  Where 
               are another light comes on, shining through her hair.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Mark!

               The sound of his steps is overlaid.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Listen... we must...

               His footsteps stop... she looks round.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Where are you? 

               His voice is quietly overlaid.

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         Here, Viv...

               She wheels round.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark sitting in the Director's chair. He is 
               holding in his lap his cine-camera, and a black bag.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian breathing quickly.

                                     VIVIAN
                         You frightened me!

               He looks at her in silence.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Now listen... they're working late 
                         on the lot.

                                     MARK
                         I know. They're branched off this 
                         stage - I'm using their juice.

               He nods, staring at her intently.

                                     VIVIAN
                         We must call it off... someone's 
                         bound to see us.

                                     MARK
                         They might...
                              (rising slowly)
                         ... but they won't interrupt us 
                         while we're filming... I've put 
                         the red light on.

               INT. ENTRANCE TO SET - EARLY EVENING

               CLOSE SHOT of the red light - burning.

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian.

                         They won't come in.

                                     VIVIAN
                         They'll wait outside... what's the 
                         difference?

                                     MARK
                         The difference is... a perfect 
                         film...

               Over his shoulder WE SEE the studio camera.

                                     MARK
                         ... have waited... a long time... 
                         for this... and so have you ... no 
                         one... must interrupt it.

               She glances round at the brazenly burning lights; shakes 
               her head despairingly.

                                     VIVIAN
                         We'll be caught.

                                     MARK
                         What does that matter?

                                     VIVIAN
                         Matter!

                                     MARK
                         You stand to lose... a job as an 
                         extra... I stand to lose... nothing.

               She looks at him in silence.

                                     MARK
                         ...the results must be so perfect... 
                         that the risks don't count...  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

                                     MARK
                         So perfect... that even he ...
                              (he hesitates)
                         ... even he... would say...

                                     VIVIAN
                         Who Don Jarvis!?

               He looks at her, then nods.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Oh! He'd say:
                              (imitating the great 
                              man's voice)
                         Sign on the dotted line, kiddies! 
                         You can use my pen, but bring your 
                         own ink!
                              (her excitement is 
                              growing)
                         Mark... if you're sure it's worth 
                         it?

                                     MARK
                         It's time to find out, Viv...

               He walks slowly towards the studio camera.  

               She prepares for the test by switching on music and warming 
               up with dance movements.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Come on! Get hot!
                              (she accents the 
                              rhythm)

               Mark puts the cine-camera and the black cloth bag on the 
               dolly, slowly mounts the platform, closes the blimp - and 
               swings the camera.

               We watch him from the top of the studio, from the door of 
               the studio, from the Director's chair. And finally WE WATCH 
               HIM from Vivian's POV. She stops dancing but the music 
               continues.

                                     MARK
                         You belong there...  

               He stares ahead of him, his mind far, far away... then 
               bends and looks into the finder.  

               There is a single harsh chord of music - and the screen 
               goes dark. It remains dark for a moment.

               Suddenly the darkness parts like curtains - and in the 
               centre WE SEE Vivian's face in the finder of the studio 
               camera. (Unlike the ground-glass of the newsagent's camera, 
               we see everything the right way up and in perfect 
               perspective.)

               Mark hooks a filler-light below the camera and switches it 
               on. He adjusts the finder until he has made of Vivian's 
               delicate features a radiant miniature.

               The miniature smiles shyly at him. She has stopped dancing 
               and is looking directly at the camera. Music continues.

                                     VIVIAN
                         I do feel alone in front of it...
                              (she hesitates)
                         I suppose stars never do?

                                     MARK
                         They feel alone without it...
                              (he looks in the 
                              eyepiece)

               Through the film, we can see only her eyes - large and 
               wistful.

                                     MARK
                         ... and the great ones... feel 
                         alone... all the time...

               She becomes the uninhibited Vivian again.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Then I'm great, boy! What is it 
                         you want me to act?
                              (she strikes an 
                              attitude a, la 
                              Rabbins)

               He looks up from the camera; she smiles and starts keeping 
               time to the rhythm again.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Being frightened to death?

                                     MARK
                         You remembered?

                                     VIVIAN
                         Yes - and I'll have a go!

               We hear his quick breathing.

                                     VIVIAN
                         I've been wondering all the 
                         afternoon how you'd do it!  I'll 
                         bet you've thought of a wonderful 
                         twist!
                              (she does a wonderful 
                              twist)

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He looks down - a little sadly - and 
               peers into the finder. (The camera dolly is on tracks - he 
               tracks forward.)

               Music continues - piano.  

               In the finder WE SEE a large trunk - 'at greatly reduced 
               prices'  on the shelf behind Vivian.

               From Vivian's POV WE SEE Mark leave the studio camera  
               and hurry towards the trunks. She watches him wide-eyed.

                                     VIVIAN
                         What are you doing?

                                     MARK
                         Building us a set.

               He reaches for the largest trunk.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Why not pull the studio down while 
                         you're about it? They can only 
                         hang you once.

                                     MARK
                         Exactly.

               He carries the trunk towards the studio camera, and lays 
               it carefully on the floor.

               Music continues.

               Vivian peers into the front-glass of the studio camera  
               as if it were a mirror. The rhythm of the music changes.

                                     VIVIAN
                         If only Don Jarvis could see me 
                         now!

               She jumps onto the trunk and taps.  

                                     VIVIAN
                         If only I could see Don Jarvis 
                         now!

               She giggles again.

                                     VIVIAN
                         I warn you, Mark - I'm hysterical... 
                         I'd rather act dying of laughter, 
                         if it's all the same to you...

               She jumps off the trunk onto the floor.

               He opens the trunk. she jumps into it. Her laughter echoes 
               round the deserted studio.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. POWER HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

               The two electricians are roaring with laughter. One of 
               them is making tea.

                                     1ST ELECTRICIAN
                         So he did it again! Now you tell 
                         one.

               CAMERA PANS to a dial on the wall... one of the needles 
               flickers slightly.

                                     2ND ELECTRICIAN
                         Half a mo...

                                     1ST ELECTRICIAN (O.S.)
                         One lump or two?

                                     2ND ELECTRICIAN
                         As the starlet said to the casting 
                         director... 

               He turns away from the dials, and grasps at the outstretched 
               mug.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian recording - her little recorder is 
               twittering back at great speed.

                                     VIVIAN
                              (to Mark, over her 
                              shoulder)
                         What are you doing?

               She restarts music.

               INT. STUDIO - EARLY EVENING

               She is watching Mark curiously as he arranges the lighting.

                                     MARK
                         Be patient, Viv... it's going to 
                         be worth it.

               CLOSE SHOT of the studio camera. In front of it - fixed on 
               a small hook - is a tape measure.

               Mark reaches for it... then carefully measures the distance 
               between the trunk and the camera... then he takes apiece 
               of chalk from his pocket and makes a small cross on the 
               floor.

               The music continues.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Oh well! I've stood alone in front 
                         of a studio camera! That's more 
                         than most have.

                                     MARK
                         Ever stood... behind one?  

               He glances at a nearby dial - only a few feet away from 
               the one which is flickering.

                                     VIVIAN
                         No.

                                     MARK
                         Help yourself.

               She goes around the camera out of sight - and he is out of 
               hers. He glances into the trunk - it is deep, and very 
               empty.

                                     VIVIAN
                              (accenting the rhythm)
                         I can see you, Mark... perfectly!

                                     MARK
                         Good...

                                     VIVIAN
                         Yes, sir! I'll bet I'm the best 
                         camerawoman in the business! . . .
                              (beating time with 
                              her feet)

               Mark hurries to the side of the studio camera and picks up 
               his cine-camera.

                                     VIVIAN (O.S.)
                         I've lost you!

                                     MARK
                         I'll be back.

               Suddenly Mark's face appears in the finder.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Welcome, stranger!

               We see Mark raise his cine-camera. He seems to be pointing 
               it straight at us.  We hear a gentle purring.

                                     VIVIAN
                         What are you doing?

                                     MARK
                         Photographing you photographing 
                         me...

               High angle shot of Mark standing in front of the studio 
               camera - photographing her photographing him.

                                     VIVIAN
                              (in mock awe)
                         Mark, you're brilliant...

               He walks slowly towards her, holding his cine-camera to 
               his eyes.  In the finder of Mark's cine-camera WE SEE Vivian 
               at the studio camera. She comes closer and closer.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Lost you again!

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         Never mind.

               We see him standing almost on top of her - his cine-camera 
               trained on her.

                                     MARK
                         I'm ready now, Viv...

               She looks up slowly - and a little hesitantly. Music, all 
               drums.

                                     MARK
                         Go and stand on that cross, will 
                         you?

                                     VIVIAN
                              (solemnly)
                         Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir.

               He watches her in silence as she walks to the front of the 
               studio camera and takes up her position. while the drum-
               beat continues.

               EXT. COURTYARD - EARLY EVENING

               Don Jarvis is leaving the unit working on the lot. It is 
               now bustling with activity.

               A girl comes up to him... She raises her cigarette for a 
               light - and looks into his eyes.  

               He hands her a box of matches... and walks away.  Over his 
               shoulder we see the other stages - apparently empty. Don 
               Jarvis hesitates, then strides towards one.

               INT. POWER HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

               CLOSE SHOT of a dial - the needle flickering slightly. 
               Overlaid is the voice of the 1st Electrician.

                                     1ST ELECTRICIAN (O.S.)
                         ...and here's one of the wife and 
                         nipper...

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. STUDIO - EARLY EVENING

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian staring at the trunk on the floor 
               behind her. The recorded rhythm continues.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Am I supposed to imagine someone 
                         is going to put me in there?

               Mark is watching her over the top of the studio camera.

                                     MARK
                         Yes, Viv...

               He peers into the viewfinder. In the finder we see Vivian 
               looking rather pathetically into camera.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Mark - I hope I won't let you 
                         down... I know you're trying to 
                         create atmosphere for me - but... 
                         I just don't feel frightened! 
                         Wouldn't it be better if I just 
                         did my number?

                                     MARK
                              (shaking head)
                         Later.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Oh all right! I could do anything - 
                         I feel so relaxed - and that's due 
                         to you... You're so at home with 
                         that camera you make me feel at 
                         home too... you have it in you, 
                         boy!

               From her POV WE SEE see him raise his head slightly.

                                     MARK
                         Ready, Viv?

                                     MARK VIVIAN
                              (great effort)
                         Well-I'll try -

               In the finder we see her wrinkling her brow.

                                     MARK VIVIAN
                         But what... would... frighten me 
                         to death?
                              (looking appealingly 
                              into camera)
                         Set the mood for me, Mark...

                                     MARK
                         Well...

               He goes and switches off the recorder. The sudden silence 
               is startling.

                                     MARK
                         Imagine someone... coming towards 
                         you... who's going to kill you - 
                         regardless of consequences...

                                     VIVIAN
                         A madman?

                                     MARK
                         Yes - but he knows it... and you 
                         don't... and just to kill you... 
                         isn't enough for him.

                                     VIVIAN
                         But how would he frighten me to?  

               She stares into focusing screen - intrigued, but not 
               frightened, not even by the silence and shadowy vastness 
               around her.

                                     MARK
                         Stay there, Viv... you're... just 
                         right.

               She stands motionless - staring into camera.

               INT. CORRIDOR IN STUDIO - EARLY EVENING

               CLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis. He is standing motionless, staring 
               down a corridor.

               What he is staring at is out of camera - and it is puzzling 
               the great man.

               He walks quietly along the corridor. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian.

                                     VIVIAN
                         I can't imagine what you've thought 
                         of!

               INT. STUDIO - EARLY EVENING

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He raises his head slowly - and locks 
               the studio camera off. Then he walks slowly towards her.

               HIGH ANGLE SHOT of Mark walking towards Vivian.

               CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN to the trunk behind her. Mark's voice is 
               overlaid:

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         Suppose this... were one of his 
                         weapons...

               CLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis.

               INT. CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING

               The great man is poised for the kill. He is moving forward 
               stealthily... and suddenly breaks into a run. 

               CAMERA PANS - and WE SEE the object of his attentions. A 
               wisp of smoke is coming from behind an alcove.

               CLOSE SHOT of a Fireman - smoking a cigarette. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis - smoking!  

               CLOSE SHOT of the Fireman's terror as he sees Don Jarvis.

                                     JARVIS
                         Smoking on duty!

               The Fireman opens his mouth to explain  and smoke exudes.

                                     JARVIS
                         Come with me!

               The Fireman follows him meekly.

               CAMERA PANS.

               So near - yet a lifetime away - a red light is burning 
               above a closed door.

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian - puzzled.

                                     VIVIAN
                         That..?

               INT. STUDIO E. - EARLY EVENING

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

               He is holding his cine-camera; fixed to it is a collapsible 
               tripod. 

               Suddenly he pulls one leg of the tripod out. WE SEE that a 
               very sharp spike protrudes from the end of it.

               From Mark's POV WE SEE Vivian looking at the spike.

               He raises it towards her - until the spike is only inches 
               from her throat.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Yes... that would be frightening!

                                     MARK
                         But... there's something else...

               We can hear his heart pounding as if it will burst - and 
               gradually Vivian, too, becomes aware of it.

                                     VIVIAN
                         Well? What is it?

               Just for a moment Mark's arm moves. His back hides what he 
               is doing. Suddenly WE SEE Vivian turn her head sharply - 
               she is looking at something out of camera.

                                     VIVIAN
                              (in a whisper)
                         That...?

               The spike is very close to her throat - but Vivian ignores 
               it, staring out of camera.

               Over Mark's shoulder we concentrate on Vivian's face.

                                     VIVIAN
                              (in a whisper)
                         Mark... take it...

               The fear on her face is rapidly growing...

                                     VIVIAN
                         ... away!

               She tries to move back - but the trunk prevents her.

                                     VIVIAN
                         MARK - YOU!

               It is almost a scream.

               We can hear Mark breathing quickly. 

               Vivian raises her hands to push something away from her.  

               Suddenly the screen is filled with her eyes. WE SEE them 
               dilating with terror. There is a sudden crash as the big 
               power switches go out in the roof.

               The lights go out.

               There is a scream in the darkness.

               Then silence.

               The darkness acquires a grey, opaque quality as if one is 
               seeing the world through a curtain - it is the world of 
               Mrs. Stephens.  

               A bright light is felt, rather than seen, beating against 
               our eyelids. It looms closer and stronger.

                                     HELEN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         And that, darling, is the end of 
                         the news! Unless you want the 
                         football results?

               CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens, a large glass of whisky - and 
               the bottle - beside her. It is night.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         No thank you.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen. 'She's Got the Key of the Door' is 
               overlaid.

                                     HELEN
                         What else can I read you?

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         The label on this whisky bottle!  
                         Are you sure it says seventy per 
                         cent proof?

                                     HELEN
                         Certain.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         They're bigger liars than the press!

               From Helen's POV WE SEE her reach for her glass with a 
               steady hand.

                                     HELEN
                         Is that your last tonight?

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         I doubt it.

                                     HELEN
                         Your last but one?

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Don't haggle.

                                     HELEN
                              (producing a coin)
                         Toss me double or nothing?

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Done!

               Helen spins the coin on the table Mrs. Stephens listens 
               intently... the coin stops spinning.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Heads.

               Her fingers shoot out and feel the surface of the coin.

                                     HELEN
                         Bad luck, darling.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Huh.

               She turns the coin over and carefully feels the other side. 
               Helen watches her with a smile - then looks thoughtfully 
               at the ceiling.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         What are you looking at?

                                     HELEN
                         The ceiling!

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Wondering if that young man is 
                         home?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes. 

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Well he is... I heard him come 
                         in... four paragraphs ago.

               From Helen's POV WE SEE the sightless eyes staring at her.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Do you like him?

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen.

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, darling.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Why?

                                     HELEN
                         He has a quality...

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                              (sipping her glass)
                         Wish this had.

                                     HELEN
                         ... and I think he could help me.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         With your photographs?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes...

               CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Helen...

                                     HELEN
                         Yes?

               Mrs. Stephens hesitates - which is rare.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                              (abruptly)
                         It doesn't matter. 

                                     HELEN
                              (quickly)
                         Mummy, what's worrying you?

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         The price of whisky.

                                     HELEN
                         What else?

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         What else matters?

                                     HELEN
                         Don't you like Mark?

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Haven't met him.

                                     HELEN
                         You don't like him! Now why not?

               CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. Again she hesitates.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         I distrust a man who walks quietly.

                                     HELEN
                         He's shy!

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         His footsteps aren't! They're 
                         stealthy...

                                     HELEN
                         Now darling.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Are you going up to him?

                                     HELEN
                         May I?

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         We both have the key of the door... 
                         Mine needs oiling - and yours needs 
                         exercise... Off you go.

                                     HELEN
                         Thank you.

               She kisses her - and glances at the whisky glass.

                                     HELEN
                         remember that you lost the toss.

               She walks to the door.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Helen...

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, darling?

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         If you're back in five minutes... 
                         I won't even finish this.

                                     HELEN
                         Done!

               She hurries out. Mrs. Stephens instantly refills her glass. 
               CLOSE SHOT of her hand. It has begun to tremble.

               MARK'S DARK-ROOM

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark's hands, in the green light of the dark-
               room. He is busy unloading and winding film onto a 
               developing rack.

               He puts the rack of exposed film into the tank and starts 
               the time clock.

               CLOSE SHOT of the time clock ticking.

               A knock is heard off.

               Mark looks up.

                                     MARK
                         Who is it?

                                     HELEN (O.S.)
                         Helen...

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.  Faintly overlaid is 'She's Got the 
               Key of the Door'.  He looks down at the clock.

                                     MARK
                              (calling)
                         Come in, Helen!

               INT. PASSAGE - EVENING

               Helen opens the door of Mark's sitting room. We hear Mark 
               call out from the inner room:

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         Would you... please... wait in 
                         there?... Developing.

               Helen goes in, closing the door behind her.

               INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING

               Helen enters. She speaks loudly to be heard in the dark-
               room.

                                     HELEN
                         Mother heard you come in - so I 
                         guessed you wouldn't be in bed ...

               No reply from the inner room.

                                     HELEN
                         Are you sure this is conven...

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         Won't be long!

               Helen glances at her watch... then looks curiously round 
               the room.

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian's recorder, placed on a chair.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen. She picks it up and looks at it, 
               curiously, fingering the stops.

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         Hallo.

               Helen turns round. Mark is standing on the threshold of 
               the dark-room.

                                     HELEN
                         Hallo, Mark...

               He walks towards her... he stops suddenly. He is staring 
               at the recorder in her hand.

                                     HELEN
                         I hope you don't mind - is it a 
                         tape-recorder?

                                     MARK
                         Yes.

               Gently he takes it from her - as if it is a cup with which 
               she has finished - and replaces it on the shelf.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen.

                                     HELEN
                         I'm sure I'm being a nuisance... 
                         but, Mark, I very much want to...

               Her voice trails away.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is holding out a small package.

                                     MARK
                         Happy birthday.

                                     HELEN
                         Mark! That's very sweet of you - 
                         but really.

                                     MARK
                         It isn't much... I don't know 
                         anything about... presents for 
                         twenty-one... but I saw it this 
                         morning... so... please.

                                     HELEN
                              (gently)
                         Thank you...

               She takes the package, and unwraps it. Inside is a slender 
               brooch

                                     HELEN
                         It's beautiful... 

                                     MARK
                         I like the design... More milk?

                                     HELEN
                         More?... No, thank you, Mark... 
                         and I really appreciate this... 
                         I'm going to put it on now.

               He watches her hold it against her dress.

                                     HELEN
                         There?... Or there?...

                                     MARK
                         The first place...

                                     HELEN
                         I think so too!...

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen pinning it on. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark touching his lapel. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen glancing at her watch.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark glancing at his. He thinks of the ticking 
               clock in the dark-room.  

               Helen looks up, and sees him.

                                     HELEN
                         I am keeping you. 

                                     MARK
                         No... I promise.

                                     HELEN
                         Mark, I'm here for some advice.

                                     MARK
                         From me?  Please...

               He looks as if he has just been voted the best cameraman 
               of the year (unanimously) - and the two films he directed 
               have both won Oscars (though Don Jarvis understood them).  

               His delighted astonishment is such that she has to smile.

                                     HELEN
                         ... I work in a public library - 
                         in the children's section... I'm 
                         telling you that to postpone 
                         admitting what always embarrasses 
                         me...

               She takes a deep breath.

                                     HELEN
                         In my spare time... I write.

                                     MARK
                         What's embar...

                                     HELEN
                         I write stories for children... 
                         but so did Grimm... Hans Andersen... 
                         Lewis Carroll...

                                     MARK
                         Had any published?

                                     HELEN
                         Some short stories.

                                     MARK
                         I'd like to read...

                                     HELEN
                         I learned today... that my first 
                         book... has been accepted! ... For 
                         publication in the spring...

                                     MARK
                         But that's wonderful... what's it 
                         about?

                                     HELEN
                         A magic camera - and what it 
                         photographs...

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

                                     MARK
                         Whatever made you... think of that?

                                     HELEN
                         I'll tell you one day - I promise...

                                     MARK
                         Well what does it photograph?

                                     HELEN
                         I'll tell you that too - but, 
                         Mark... this is the problem... The 
                         children who read the book will 
                         want to see the pictures the camera 
                         takes - but the publishers say 
                         they're impossible to photograph, 
                         and suggest drawings... but I don't 
                         agree.

                                     MARK
                         No - nothing's impossible.

                                     HELEN
                         was hoping you'd say that! There 
                         must be photographs - however 
                         difficult to take - and I was 
                         wondering, Mark - if you'd...

                                     MARK
                         Oh yes.

                                     HELEN
                         discuss it with me.

                                     MARK
                         take them.

                                     HELEN
                         Mark - I can't ask you to do that...

               They have cancelled his Oscar.

                                     HELEN
                         I mean... the publisher's mightn't 
                         agree.

                                     MARK
                         I'd take them... for you.

                                     HELEN
                         Yes but... the money.

                                     MARK
                         There are some things... which I 
                         photograph... for nothing.

                                     HELEN
                         I didn't mean to offend you.

                                     MARK
                         Offend?  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

                                     MARK
                         Helen... if you knew what it 
                         meant... for something to happen 
                         to me... that I don't have to make 
                         happen... it's like... you've given 
                         me a twenty-first birthday...

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at him... 

                                     MARK
                         What does your camera photograph?

                                     HELEN
                         Mark - I must go... I just wanted 
                         to know... if you'd talk it over 
                         with me.

                                     MARK
                         When please?

                                     HELEN
                         That's up to you.

                                     MARK
                         Helen ... I don't know much about... 
                         dinner out... but would you come 
                         with me?

                                     HELEN
                         Thank you.

                                     MARK
                         Thank you.

                                     HELEN
                         When?

                                     MARK
                         Oh...  

                                     HELEN
                         What's the matter?  

                                     MARK
                         It had better be soon...

                                     HELEN
                         Are you going away?  

                                     MARK
                         Almost for certain! ...

                                     HELEN
                         Oh... well you suggest when.

                                     MARK
                         Are you free... tomorrow night?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes. 

                                     MARK
                         I hope I am!

                                     HELEN
                         I'll understand if you're not.

                                     MARK
                         I'll try to be - I'll try my hardest 
                         to be.

                                     HELEN
                         Thank you for listening... and for 
                         my present.

                                     MARK
                         and for mine.

               They look at each other in silence.

                                     HELEN
                         Good night, Mark...
                              (turning to the 
                              door)

                                     MARK
                         Good night... Helen...

               He watches her leave, standing very still.

               Offstage, the time clock explodes.

               CLOSE SHOT - the excited clock. Mark's hand silences it.

               INT. DARK-ROOM - GREEN LIGHT

               Mark opens the developing tank, lifts out the rack of film, 
               drops it into the fixing bath.

               He switches light from green to red.  

               CLOSE SHOT - green to red dark-room lamp.  

               Mark lifts the rack of glistening film out of the fixing 
               bath and scans the image.

               CLOSE SHOT - Mark's face and the tell-tale black and white 
               images.

               CLOSE SHOT - the film. A pile of trunks. 

               In the darkness we hear a man enquire softly:

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         Looking for a trunk?

               CLOSE SHOT of a Tall Man with a severe face. He is standing 
               in front of a familiar pile of trunks marked at 'Specially 
               Reduced Prices'.  

               CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY - and WE SEE whom he is addressing. 
               It is Diane.

               CAMERA PULLS FURTHER BACK and WE SEE that we are in a small 
               theatre watching rushes...

               INT. THEATRE IN STUDIO - DAY

               CAMERA PANS across Baden's disgruntled face... the Chief 
               Cameraman's bored face... the Script Girl's puzzled face... 
               to Diane's expression of rapture as she watches herself on 
               the screen.

                                     DIANE (O.S.)
                         I'd like to see that one.

               From Diane's POV WE WATCH the screen. We see the Tall Man 
               (SHOP ASSISTANT) reaching for a trunk and laying it on the 
               counter. He opens it with a flourish. Vivian passes across 
               the screen - glances casually at the trunk - and wanders 
               off.

                                     BADEN
                         No - no - no - we must get some 
                         comedy into this...!

               The Assistant Director nods.

                                     BADEN
                         We'll retake it this morning...

               CAMERA LINGERS for a moment on the screen as Diane (on-
               screen) smiles at the Assistant.

                                     DIANE
                              (she pockets a small 
                              item)
                         I'll take it.

               The Assistant bows and closes the trunk. We dissolve to 
               the set itself -

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. STUDIO - DAY

               The Assistant is leaning over the counter, listening 
               intently. Diane stands in front of the counter, receiving 
               the attentions of the Make-up Man.  

               Baden's voice is overlaid:

                                     BADEN
                         I want some comedy in this scene...

               CAMERA PULLS BACK 

               The unit is busy preparing for a retake. The studio camera 
               (and its crew) are off camera, and we concentrate on Baden 
               briefing his artistes.  

               He is clutching a script as if afraid that opening it might 
               be indecent exposure.

                                     BADEN
                         Instead of taking the first trunk 
                         you see, I want you, darling... to 
                         ask for a blue trunk - and when he 
                         brings it to you, to ask for a red 
                         one - and when he brings that, to 
                         ask for a white one...
                              (turns to the 
                              Assistant)
                         And you, Michael... get the trunks 
                         one by one - growing more and more 
                         fed up - and we'll end on a gag 
                         which I'll think of in a minute - 
                         all right?

                                     DIANE
                         I don't feel it!

                                     BADEN
                         Don't feel it! Do it!

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                              (hastily)
                         Positions, everyone!

               Over Mark's shoulder - behind the camera - WE WATCH the 
               Unit taking up positions.

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                         Anyone seen Vivian?

                                     BADEN
                         Who?

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                         The red-headed bystander - Viv.

                                     BADEN
                              (impatiently)
                         Never mind - I'm cutting her out 
                         of this scene... Let's run it.

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                              (shouting)
                         Quiet, everyone!

               From Mark's POV WE WATCH the scene being rehearsed. Diane 
               approaches the trunk counter and the Assistant smiles at 
               her.

                                     ASSISTANT
                         Can I interest you in a trunk?

                                     DIANE
                         Thank you...
                              (pointing)
                         I'd like to see that one...

                                     ASSISTANT
                         Certainly, madam...  

               He turns away. She pockets a small item from the counter. 
               He heaves a trunk forward.

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                         It's beautifully fitted -
                              (he opens it)

               She takes a perfunctory glance -

                                     DIANE
                         I'd like to see one in red.

                                     ASSISTANT
                         Certainly, madam.

               She pockets another item.  He turns and wrestles with 
               another trunk... brings it forward and opens it

                                     DIANE
                         ... do you have one in white?

                                     ASSISTANT
                         Certainly, madam.

               Mark walks away quietly from the back of the Camera Crew. 
               He hurries to the shelf where he keeps his cine-camera and 
               a lunch basket. He reaches for his camera.  

               Diane's voice is overlaid.

                                     DIANE (O.S.)
                         Do you have one in blue?

                                     ASSISTANT (O.S.)
                         Certainly, madam...

               Mark turns towards the rehearsal and raises his cine-camera. 
               WE SEE the Assistant try to lift a blue trunk - and half 
               collapse with the weight of it.

               CLOSE SHOT of Baden - beaming.

               The Assistant manages to drag the trunk forward. He leans 
               over it - exhausted - then starts to open it.

               Mark moves round until Diane's face is in the finder.

               As the lid of the trunk is opened we can see only her eyes 
               above the rim of the lid... WE HEAR her scream.

               CLOSE SHOT of Baden - freezing.  

               There is the sound of a body falling to the ground.

                                     BADEN
                         The silly bitch! She's fainted in 
                         the wrong scene...

                                                               FADE OUT:

               In the darkness WE HEAR a telephone ringing... and then 
               another... and then another... then they all merge into 
               one big blast.

               FADE IN:

               CAMERA TRACKS quickly towards a door marked PUBLICITY 
               DEPARTMENT.

               INT. PUBLICITY DEPARTMENT - DAY

               The Head of publicity has a receiver to his ear.

                                     HEAD OF PUBLICITY
                         is this a gag?... A girl in a 
                         trunk!... Who is she?... Well, 
                         which unit?... The walls are closing 
                         in?... What a break for them!... I 
                         mean what a heartbreak!
                              (he is already 
                              speaking into 
                              another telephone)
                         call a press conference.
                              (he turns to the 
                              original telephone)
                         I'm on my way down!

               EXT. LONDON - DAY

               A police car. There are two men seated at the back.

               INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

               CHIEF INSPECTOR GREGG is reading a file. A plain-clothes 
               SERGEANT (MILLER) is seated next to him. The Sergeant 
               glances at his Chief apprehensively.

                                     SERGEANT MILLER
                         Excuse me, Chief.

                                     CHIEF INSPECTOR
                         Mm?

                                     SERGEANT MILLER
                         We pass my house when we reach the 
                         bypass. Would you mind if I drop 
                         off for a minute?

                                     CHIEF INSPECTOR
                              (without raising 
                              his eyes)
                         To collect your kid's autograph 
                         book?

                                     SERGEANT MILLER
                         Yes, Chief!... If the nipper hears 
                         where I've been...

                                     CHIEF INSPECTOR
                              (turns to the driver)
                         All right, Dawson - anything to 
                         help the Sergeant...
                              (stares down at the 
                              folder)
                         ... and it's about time the Sergeant 
                         helped me - we're getting nowhere 
                         with this.

               Over his shoulder WE SEE what he is looking at - it is a 
               photograph of Dora in her furs and finery.

                                     SERGEANT
                         What about that man the landlady 
                         passed?

                                     CHIEF INSPECTOR
                         She couldn't describe him - except 
                         to say that he was carrying 
                         something that she couldn't see.

                                     SERGEANT
                         That's a help.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector staring at the folder.

                                     CHIEF INSPECTOR
                         Sergeant, I've been on the force 
                         thirty odd years... and I have 
                         never seen such fear on anyone's 
                         face as on this girl's...
                              (almost to himself)
                         What was it she saw?

                                     SERGEANT
                         Surely, Chief... a man coming at 
                         her - with a sharp weapon.

                                     CHIEF INSPECTOR
                         I'm familiar with that kind of 
                         terror. This is something new to 
                         me... but what?

               The Sergeant glances at Dora's photograph.

                                     CHIEF INSPECTOR
                         ...now take a look at how we found 
                         her.

               He starts to turn the page

               A door with a sign on it: CANTEEN CLOSED TODAY. 

               CAMERA TRACKS TOWARDS it.

               INT. CANTEEN - DAY

               Mark is sitting by an open window at the far end of the 
               canteen. His cine-camera and lunch basket are by his side.

               From Mark's POV WE SEE that the unit (with the exception 
               of Diane and Baden) is crowded into the canteen.

               They have formed themselves into small groups and are 
               talking in whispers.  The Assistant Director is standing 
               with his back to the door. A GIRL calls out:

                                     GIRL (O.S.)
                         How much longer must we wait in 
                         here?

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                         Till the police arrive... D.J.'s 
                         orders.

               Mark glances at a group in the comer. The Trunk Assistant 
               is encircled by eager listeners.

                                     ASSISTANT
                         and when she opened that trunk... 
                         and I saw what was inside... my 
                         dears - I nearly fainted with her -
                              (he runs a delicate 
                              hand across a 
                              delicate forehead)
                         and do you know what horrified me 
                         most?

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                         D.J. says not to discuss it.

                                     ASSISTANT
                         Any more sauce from D.J. and I 
                         shall refuse to sign for seven 
                         years! My dears... that poor girl's 
                         expression.

               Mark glances out of the window.

               From his POV WE SEE a police car driving across the 
               courtyard. Mark watches with great interest - then reaches 
               for his cine-camera.

               He photographs the police, then puts his cine-camera on to 
               the table and sits back... waiting. CAMERA LINGERS for a 
               moment on the folded tripod.

               INT. SET - DAY

               The set is completely deserted. It is lit by a single lamp. 
               A solitary trunk stands on the counter, its lid closed.  

               WE SEE Don Jarvis enter, followed by the two Policemen. 
               Baden and the Publicity man bring up the rear.

               Don Jarvis points towards the trunks department. The Chief 
               Inspector nods, then he and the Sergeant approach the 
               counter.

               Carefully the Inspector raises the lid of the trunk - he 
               looks inside.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector - over the top of the lid. His 
               expression is mainly one of surprise.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Sergeant staring into the trunk. He is 
               also surprised - but there is nausea in his face.  

               They look up at almost the same moment... their eyes meet.

                                     SERGEANT
                              (in a whisper)
                         Chief, it's exactly the...

                                     INSPECTOR
                         I know...
                              (he closes the trunk 
                              quickly. Quietly)
                         ... don't say anything.
                              (he faces Don Jarvis)
                         Well, sir... we shall probably 
                         have to interview everyone at the 
                         studio, so we'd better plan a 
                         campaign that won't interfere too 
                         much with your productions.

                                     JARVIS

                              once)
                         Thank you, Chief Inspector... if 
                         you knew what even a single day's 
                         delay could cost.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         Oh, we do sir.
                              (his eyes are on 
                              the trunk)

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

               INT. CANTEEN - DAY

               He is looking out of the window - his camera at the ready.  
               Overlaid is the sound of a door opening... the buzz of 
               conversation dies away. We hear Don Jarvis' voice.

                                     JARVIS (O.S.)
                         If I may have your attention, 
                         please.

               A hand tugs at Mark's elbow. He turns round. The Clapper 
               Boy looks at him waringly.

               From Mark's POV WE SEE Don Jarvis standing in the doorway -
               facing a suddenly hushed room. The great man's hands are 
               folded in front of him -

                                     JARVIS
                         The police wish to interview each 
                         of you individually... after which 
                         you will be at liberty to leave.

               From D.J.'s POV WE SEE the upturned faces - the light from 
               the window falls upon Mark, listening to him with rapt 
               attention. Mark's hands are folded in front of him.

                                     JARVIS
                         There will, of course, be no 
                         shooting today... but work will be 
                         resumed, as usual, tomorrow... 
                         with, I hope, all of you present.

               CLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis.

                         I look to you to give the police 
                         your fullest cooperation.
                              (he turns abruptly 
                              and leaves')

               Sergeant Miller enters with a smile.

                                     SERGEANT MILLER
                         Well now... let's get ourselves 
                         organized...

               The Young Extra who spoke to Vivian in the exterior set 
               points excitedly to the wall where Vivian and Mark lay.  

               The Inspector and Sergeant carefully examine both sides of 
               the wall. The Inspector stoops, picks up something with a 
               pair of tweezers and puts it in an envelope.

               A few passers-by look on from a distance. One of them is

               The Policemen and the Extra are walking away from camera

               without a glance. One of these (A GIRL) smiles into camera.

               As the Inspector opens the door of the dressing room, Mark 
               hurries past. He raises his cine-camera and photographs 
               the Sergeant. The Sergeant turns to close the door. He 
               sees Mark. straightens his tie and looks as severe as he 
               can.

               The Crew-member hurries into the office, and closes the

               Mark and the Clapper Boy are left sitting side by side.

                         Yes, I've a few quite interesting 
                         shots of them - it's a chance I 
                         never expected!

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         A chance for what?

                                     MARK
                         To photograph... an investigation... 
                         or as much of it as I can.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         What on earth for?

                                     MARK
                         It will complete a documentary I'm 
                         making.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         documentary?

               Mark nods.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         What's it about?

                                     MARK
                         I'd rather not tell you till it's 
                         finished. And it soon will be ...

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         But suppose they catch you?

                                     MARK
                         Oh they will - they look very 
                         efficient.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         Don't you mind?

                                     MARK
                         No.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         But they might confiscate your 
                         camera.

                                     MARK
                         I'm afraid they will! But by then... 
                         I'll have finished with it.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         I don't...

               The door of the small room opens, and the Crew-member comes 
               out.

                                     CREW-MEMBER
                         You, Mark?

                                     MARK
                         Thanks...

               He rises slowly... the cine-camera is over his shoulder.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         Mark, hadn't you better leave that 
                         with me?

                                     MARK
                         No, John.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         I'd look after it.

                                     MARK
                         I'm sure of that - but I'd like to 
                         photograph them while they're 
                         questioning me.

               The Clapper Boy looks at him in amazement.

                                     MARK
                         I don't suppose they'll let me.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         Mark, are you potty?

                                     MARK
                         Yes, do you think they'll notice?

               The Clapper Boy laughs.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         Don't get into any trouble for 
                         heaven's sake  I want to discuss 
                         that film at the Everyman...

                                     MARK
                         Yes... I'd like that...

               He walks slowly towards the door.

               The Clapper Boy takes out a copy of Sight and Sound and 
               starts to read it.

               INT. SMALL OFFICE - DAY

               The Inspector is seated at a desk, reading some notes. The 
               Sergeant is seated by the side of the desk, a pile of papers 
               in front of him.

               There is a gentle knock on the door. The Sergeant glances 
               at a list.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Mark Lewis - focus-puller... 
                         Whatever that may be?

               The Inspector nods.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Come in.

               He puts a tick on the list. There is the sound of a door 
               opening. The Inspector looks up...

               From his POV WE SEE a young man with a camera over his 
               shoulder advancing shyly towards him.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         Mr. Lewis?

                                     MARK
                         Yes, sir...

                                     INSPECTOR
                         I'm Chief Inspector Gregg and this 
                         is Sergeant Miller. Grab a chair.

               The Sergeant glances up.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Ah! My photographer.

                                     MARK
                         I've brought the camera in case 
                         you want to take the film away.

               He holds out his camera.  The Sergeant glances enquiringly 
               at the Inspector.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         That's all right, Mr. Lewis - as 
                         long as we don't appear at the 
                         Odeon next week in place of the 
                         cartoon.

               Mark smiles.

                                     MARK
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         Well now; have you anything to 
                         tell us?

                                     MARK
                         Don't think so, sir.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         Did you know the girl?

                                     MARK
                         Yes, sir...

                                     INSPECTOR
                         How well?  

                                     MARK
                         Mainly by sight.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         When did you see her last?

               He picks up a pencil  taps it idly on the desk.

                                     MARK
                         Yesterday afternoon - when we 
                         broke...

                                     INSPECTOR
                         Speak to her?

                                     MARK
                         Called out good night - don't know 
                         if she heard?

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark's fingers... tapping on his knee in 
               time to the pencil.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         What did you do then?

                                     MARK
                         Took sqme shots, sir - for a film 
                         I'm making.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         Oh... where?

                                     MARK
                         All over the place, sir... it's a 
                         documentary.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         Anyone with you?

                                     MARK
                         No, sir. Just my camera.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         What time did you arrive home, Mr. 
                         Lewis?

                                     MARK
                         About ten... ten-thirty...

                                     INSPECTOR
                         Anyone see you?

                                     MARK
                         Yes... the people downstairs.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         I see.

               The telephone rings.  The Sergeant promptly answers it.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Sergeant Miller - Right, I'll tell 
                         him...

               He replaces the receiver, turns to the Inspector.

                                     SERGEANT
                         The doctor's finished his examin...

               The Inspector rises at once.

                                     SERGEANT
                         ...wants to see you -

                                     INSPECTOR
                         Right.
                              (he glances at Mark)
                         That'll be all for the moment, Mr. 
                         Lewis - thank you.

                                     MARK
                              (he turns to the 
                              door)
                         Thank you, sir ...

                                     INSPECTOR
                         Wait a minute.

               Mark stands very still.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         direct me to that set of yours, 
                         will you? I'd probably end on 
                         location.

                                     MARK
                         I'll take you there, sir.
                              (he opens the door)

                                     INSPECTOR
                         Thanks.
                              (he glances at the 
                              Sergeant)
                         Carry on with the interviews, 
                         Sergeant.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Yes, sir.

               From the Sergeant's POV WE SEE Mark turn to go into the 
               passage.

               The Sergeant stares at the camera on his shoulder... then 
               the door closes.

               The Sergeant makes a note on a piece of paper.

               INT. PASSAGE - DAY

               The Inspector and Mark walk side by side along the passage. 
               The Clapper Boy comes into view - still reading Sight and 
               Sound.

               The Clapper Boy glances up - just in time to see the 
               Inspector and Mark walk side by side to the end of the 
               corridor.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                              (staring after them)
                         I warned him to be careful!

               INT. ENTRANCE TO SET - DAY

               A Constable is standing outside the entrance to the set.  
               From his POV WE SEE the Inspector and Mark approach.  The 
               Constable stiffens...  From Mark's POV WE SEE the Constable 
               barring the entrance.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         I think I can find my way now...

               Mark smiles.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         ...thanks for the escort

               The Inspector hurries towards the door of the set. 

               The Constable opens it - and the Inspector goes inside. 

               The Constable closes the door - and stands in front of it. 

               Mark turns away quickly.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

               The carpark is jammed with cars - but there is hardly anyone 
               in sight. Mark hurries towards the large sliding doors of 
               Stage E - they are a few feet apart. He looks round 
               carefully, then slips inside.

               INT. STAGE E. - DAY

               Facing Mark is the darkened set of an hotel bedroom. Beyond 
               this is another set - also in darkness - and beyond this 
               yet another. Only in the far comer of the studio - in the 
               furthermost set - is there a light burning. Voices can 
               faintly be heard coming from this set. 

               Mark walks quietly towards a long ladder which leads up to 
               the gantry. Carefully - rung by rung - he starts to climb 
               the ladder. At the top of the ladder is a gallery. Mark 
               moves along the maze of bridges until he is nearly above 
               the Policemen.

               Mark raises his head cautiously - and looks down.

               Far below WE CAN SEE the Inspector standing next to the 
               Doctor - a tall, silver haired man - who is peering into 
               an open trunk. Detectives are photographing the set. Mark 
               raises his cine-camera... its gentle purring seems to echo 
               round the studio.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark's jacket pocket. A row of pencils is 
               sticking out. As he leans forward the pencils tilt. 

               Through the finder-matte of Mark's camera WE SEE the 
               Inspector - very far away - peering into the trunk and 
               nodding.

               A faint echo of conversation is overlaid.

                                     DOCTOR (O.S.)
                         No doubt at all... wounds were 
                         caused by the same instrument...

               Mark changes lens (and alters the finder to a 75mm lens). 
               The Doctor's face - thin and impersonal - appears in the 
               finder over the lid of the trunk.

                                     DOCTOR (O.S.)
                         ... both women... subjected to the 
                         most violent shock...

                                     INSPECTOR (O.S.)
                         What sort of shock?

                                     DOCTOR
                         ...still cannot determine - but 
                         look!

               He points to something in the trunk - out of the camera's 
               eye-line.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

               He balances carefully - then raises the camera above his 
               head. As he leans forward, the pencils fall. WE SEE them 
               shooting like small torpedoes into the darkness below. 
               They make three separate landings.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector. Looking up.

               From his POV WE SEE tiers of scaffolding deep in shadow...

                                     INSPECTOR
                         Quiet, everyone.  Please...

               The Detectives make as much noise to become quiet as the 
               normal occupants of the studio - and then there is complete 
               silence.

               Complete, except for the Doctor's asthmatic breathing... 
               And then - so gently that it might almost be in our own 
               minds - WE HEAR a purring sound from the shadows above. 
               The Inspector listens intently.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         I thought I heard a putty cat!

               There is a burst of laughter - the Inspector frowns.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         I don't want to spoil anyone's 
                         fun, but we do have a maniac on 
                         our hands, and if we don't get him 
                         quickly there'll be a third unsolved 
                         murder to report to the 
                         Commissioner. So let's hurry things 
                         up, shall we?

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Sorry, Chief!

               The 'putty cat' Detective raises his flashlamp towards the 
               trunk counter. In the brilliant flash of light that ensues, 
               we glimpse a shadowy figure moving towards a ladder high 
               in the scaffolding... But then we are looking for it - no 
               one else is. The flashlight dies away.  

               The scene fades with it.  

               CLOSE SHOT of a knitting-needle held upwards.

               Another knitting-needle scales down it like a fireman 
               descending a ladder.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK

               INT. HELEN S SITTING ROOM - DAY

               Mrs. Stephens is doing her knitting. The inevitable glass 
               stands on the table beside her. Helen is seated opposite, 
               reading from a newspaper.

                                     HELEN
                         she was appearing in Arthur Baden's 
                         new film The Walls Are Closing In, 
                         starring Diane Ashley.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens listening intently.

                                     HELEN
                         a spokesman at the studio said 
                         that her performance in the film 
                         showed such promise, that her role 
                         was to have been built up... All 
                         work at the studio ceased today as 
                         a tribute to her memory!

               Mrs. Stephens sips from her glass.  The Prime Minister to 
               visit Athens.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Mark is in films, isn't he?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, darling... It is reliably...

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         I wonder if he knew her?

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking up.

                                     HELEN
                         I'll ask him tonight...

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Is he taking you out?

                                     HELEN
                         If he's free.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         That's very chivalrous of him. 
                         Where's he taking you?

                                     HELEN
                         I've no idea - and I don't suppose 
                         he has...

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Which studio does he work at?

                                     HELEN
                         I'll ask him.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         If he's free.

               Behind her back we see that her fingers are crossed.

                                     HELEN
                         I'll bring him in and introduce 
                         you if...

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         I feel I know him.

                                     HELEN
                         Now how can you?

               Mrs. Stephens stiffens suddenly.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         He's here.

               CLOSE SHOT of the window.

               Mark is standing outside - looking in.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Why don't we make him a present of 
                         the window? He practically lives 
                         there!

               Helen beckons to Mark to come in. We see him nod eagerly - 
               and leave the window.

                                     HELEN
                         How did you know where he was 
                         standing?

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         The back of my neck told me... the 
                         part that I talk out of!

               Helen hurries to the door of the sitting room.

               INT. HALL - DAY

               Mark closes the front door behind him.

               From his POV WE SEE the door of Helen's sitting room open - 
               and she stands on the threshold.

                                     HELEN
                         Hallo...

                                     MARK
                         Free?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes.

                                     MARK
                         Good! So am I...

                                     HELEN
                         I'd like you to come in for a moment - 
                         and meet my mother.

                                     MARK
                         Yes, please...

               She holds open the door. He goes inside.  The screen 
               suddenly greys out into the veiled images of Mrs. Stephens' 
               world. We hear Helen's voice.

                                     HELEN (O.S.)
                         Darling, this is Mark... Mark, my 
                         mother.

               WE HEAR the sound of footsteps shuffling shyly forward - 
               and then Mark's voice, every intake of breath magnified.

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         How do you do... Mrs. Stephens...

               WE HEAR the pounding of someone's heart - and then Mrs. 
               Stephens' voice.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS (O.S.)
                         Hallo, Mark.

               As her voice dies away.

               FADE IN:

               INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark's hand clasping Mrs. Stephens'.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark looking at her, fascinated.

               From Mark's POV WE SEE the sightless eyes turned towards 
               his. Mrs. Stephens' other hand gently feels the surface of 
               his.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Have you been running, young man?

                                     MARK
                         Yes...
                              (he hesitates)
                         ... didn't want to be late for 
                         Helen.

                                     HELEN
                         Thank you, Mark - You deserve a 
                         drink for that! What would you 
                         like?

                                     MARK
                         Nothing - thank you... very much...

               Mrs. Stephens grunts, and reaches for her glass.

                                     HELEN
                         Darling, I've left your supper in 
                         the...

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Tell me young man... Which studio 
                         do you work at?

               The screen greys out. WE HEAR Mark's tiny intake of breath.

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         Chipperfield Studio . . .

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         And that poor girl... where did 
                         she work?

               Someone's heart is pounding fast.

                                     HELEN (O.S.)
                         At Brookwood.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         We were wondering if you knew her?

                                     MARK
                         No - No, I didn't...

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         A pity. I do like first-hand 
                         information.

               We hear Mark's small attempt at a laugh.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Oh, well - I mustn't keep you 
                         gossiping after you've run all the 
                         way from - Where?

               Again that little intake of breath.

                                     MARK
                         The station.

                                                               FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               Mrs. Stephens and Mark are staring at each other as if she 
               has sight and he hasn't. From Helen's POV WE CAN SEE only 
               Mark's back and her mother's upturned face.

                                     HELEN
                         Darling, may I tell you about your 
                         supper?

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         No... go and be told about yours!
                              (she takes Mark's 
                              hand)
                         Goodbye, Mark... I expect we shall 
                         meet again.

                                     MARK
                         I hope so - Goodbye...
                              (He turns to the 
                              door)

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen kissing her mother and whispering into 
               her ear.

                                     HELEN
                         Darling, we forgot to toss. 

               Mrs. Stephens grunts.

                                     HELEN
                         Supper's laid out in the kitchen.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         If you're not back early, you'll 
                         find me laid out with it!

                                     HELEN
                         We'll be early! Good night, darling.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Good night...

               Mark holds the door open for Helen and she goes into the 
               passage. Mark turns and takes a long look at Mrs. Stephens. 
               She is in the middle of raising her glass. She stops 
               suddenly, the glass poised mid-air. He goes out - closing 
               the door. She finishes her drink as if it is her last.

               INT. PASSAGE - DAY

               Helen is waiting by the door.

               From her POV WE SEE Mark coming eagerly towards her, his 
               camera over his shoulder.

                                     HELEN
                         Mark...

                                     MARK
                         Yes, Helen?

                                     HELEN
                         I want to ask you something rather 
                         personal...

               He looks at her anxiously.

                                     HELEN
                         How long is it since you've gone 
                         out without that?

                                     MARK
                         Without what?

                                     HELEN
                         Your camera...

                                     MARK
                         Oh...

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

                                     MARK
                         I... don't think I know?

                                     HELEN
                         Exactly. I've never seen you without 
                         it... but are you going to need it 
                         tonight?

               He looks at her in silence.

                                     HELEN
                         Well are you? And if so... shall I 
                         bring some work with me too?

                                     MARK
                         I'm not going to need it tonight!

                                     HELEN
                         Good - then give it to me!

               She holds out her hand. He looks at her, appalled.

                                     HELEN
                         ...It'll be quite safe - I'll put 
                         it away for you.

                                     MARK
                              (in a whisper)
                         No! 

                                     HELEN
                         Then take it upstairs - if you 
                         can't trust me with it...

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. 

                                     MARK
                         I trust you.

                                     HELEN
                         Then look...

               She opens the door of her bedroom - and turns on the light.

                                     HELEN
                         ...let's put it in here.

               INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM

               She crosses to a cupboard and unlocks it, then turns round. 
               He is standing hesitantly on the threshold.

                                     HELEN
                         Come in - and see for yourself.

               He looks slowly round the room, stares for a moment at the 
               bed in the comer, but he won't cross the threshold. He 
               stays outside.

                                     HELEN
                         We'll put it in here - and lock 
                         it.

                                     MARK
                         This... was my mother's room.

                                     HELEN
                         Was it, Mark?...

               Again he stares at the bed.

                                     HELEN
                         I am being tactless, aren't I?  
                         ... It's just that... I thought it 
                         was growing into an extra limb, 
                         and - but you bring it with you if 
                         you want to.

               He takes off his camera - and holds it out to her. 

                                     HELEN
                         Thank you...  

               She takes it from him, puts it into the cupboard, and locks 
               it. Then offers him the key.

                                     MARK
                         You...

                                     HELEN
                         Thank you. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.  

                                     MARK
                         I feel... 

                                     HELEN
                         Yes?

                                     MARK
                         Can't describe it! Could only 
                         photograph it -

               She laughs.  

                                     HELEN
                         Shall I tell you what I feel?  

                                     MARK
                         Yes.

                                     HELEN
                         Famished!

                                     MARK
                         Good!

               They hurry towards the door.

               EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - DAY

               They walk down the steps of the house.

                                     MARK
                         There's a small place round the 
                         corner... It's awfully good on 
                         Christmas Day.

                                     HELEN
                         Is it?

                                     MARK
                         Yes... there aren't too many open 
                         then.

                                     HELEN
                         No - it sounds fun.

                                     MARK
                         This way.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark and Helen walking along by the side of 
               the house.

                                     HELEN
                         I adore new restaurants...

               Suddenly Mark stands motionless. He is staring at something 
               off camera.

               Especially when -

               Her voice trails away... she is staring at Mark staring at 
               something.

               In the shadows, at the mouth of an alley, a young couple 
               are kissing.

               Mark stands motionless, staring at them. Automatically his 
               hand reaches for his camera. Helen starts to speak - then 
               looks at him in silence. The man glances round. Mark hurries 
               away and Helen stares after him.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

               He turns back - waiting for Helen.

               From his POV WE SEE Helen come slowly towards him. She 
               looks at him searchingly for a long moment.

               He manages - but only just - to meet her eyes.

                                     HELEN
                         Where is this restaurant?

                                     MARK
                         Round the corner...

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Know much about films?

                                     HELEN
                         Come on then...

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

                                     MARK
                         Thank you.

               They walk slowly down the street.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK

               INT. SITTING ROOM - EVENING

               Tony is standing unhappily opposite Mrs. Stephens.

                         Oh!

                         There's a phone book outside... 
                         Look up the number, will you? And 
                         see if you can get it.

                                     TONY
                         Certainly... and then I must go to

                         Granted.

               She lifts her glass, and sits, waiting as he crosses the 
               room.

               INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A small and very pleasant restaurant, almost full. Helen 
               and Mark have a corner table. They are dining by 
               candlelight, and there is a bottle of wine in the middle 
               of the table.

               As CAMERA TRACKS TOWARDS them, Helen is laughing.

                                     HELEN
                         I like this place! And this dinner!

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

               He has again won the Academy Award.

                                     HELEN

                         I'm ready to talk about you...

               His face falls.

                                     HELEN
                         It won't take a second - and it's 
                         best to have it said.

               Mark looks.

                                     HELEN
                         Carrying a camera is only one of 
                         your habits, isn't it, Mark?

               He looks at her in silence. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen.

                                     HELEN
                         ... when you stared at that couple, 
                         you were like the little boy on 
                         that film you showed me... looking 
                         over the wall at something he 
                         shouldn't see. But Mark - you're 
                         strong enough now to lift that 
                         child off the wall... aren't you?

               He hesitates.

                                     HELEN
                         ... aren't you?

                         I'll try to be.

                                     HELEN
                         Will you, Mark?... Will you really?

                                     MARK
                         Yes...

               A pause.

                                     MARK
                         When your book's published - will 
                         you go on working in a library?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, Mark... in case, one day, a 
                         child comes in and asks for it!

                                     MARK
                         I'll come in.

                                     HELEN
                         I'm not popular with my customers! 
                         They ask me for horror comics - 
                         and I take their sticky hands and 
                         drag them to where there are books!

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen.

                                     HELEN
                         ... and do you know, Mark, waiting 
                         for them to come in next time and 
                         ask for books... is as exciting... 
                         as a horror comic...

                                     MARK
                         What does your magic camera 
                         photograph?  

                                     HELEN
                         People... 

                                     MARK
                         Yes?...

                                     HELEN
                         It's owned by a little boy who is 
                         terrified of grown-ups... but when 
                         he looks in his magic camera he 
                         sees grown-ups as they were when 
                         they were children... and he isn't 
                         frightened any longer.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark listening, engrossed.

                                     HELEN
                         ... and one day he gives his camera 
                         away to a little boy who is even 
                         more frightened of grown-ups than 
                         he was - and do you know what he 
                         finds?

               The little boy opposite her shakes his head.

                                     HELEN
                         ... that when he looks at grown-
                         ups without his camera he can still 
                         see them as they were when they 
                         were children!  And that means 
                         that he's grown up himself...

               A moment's pause. She drinks her wine - shy, awaiting his 
               reaction.

                                     MARK
                         What made you think of this story?

                                     HELEN
                         You did!

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

                                     HELEN
                         ... I looked out of my window - 
                         and saw you going off to work 
                         carrying that camera like a little 
                         boy with a satchel... and an idea 
                         came... so thank you...

                                     MARK
                         I'd like to think... I was 
                         responsible... in some way...

                                     HELEN
                         Now what do I do about the 
                         photographs?

                                     MARK
                         Take 'em!

               He slams the table so violently that a lady nearby looks 
               around... then reaches for his camera.

                                     MARK
                         Oh!

               Helen smiles.

                                     MARK
                         There isn't a single face that 
                         doesn't look like a child's - not 
                         a single one - if you catch it at 
                         the right moment.

               He turns around excitedly and sees her watching him.

                                     MARK
                         It would be a challenge!... Unlike 
                         anything I've photographed!

                                     HELEN
                         What have you photographed, Mark?

                                     MARK
                         Everything. But nothing I'd want 
                         children to see.

               She looks at him curiously.

                                     MARK
                         But this would belong to them - 
                         and they'd know if it wasn't 
                         right... Oh, Helen... I would like 
                         to find those faces for you... 
                         with you...

                                     HELEN
                         Very well! Let's try!

               He laughs excitedly... She looks regretfully at her watch. 
               At once he looks at his.

                                     MARK
                         You made a promise to your mother -

                                     HELEN
                              (gently)
                         Yes, Mark...

                                     MARK
                         You'd better keep it.

                                     HELEN
                         Thank you...

               He signals to the head waiter... and pays his first bill 
               for two.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT.STREET - NIGHT

               They walk along the street very close together, but not 
               quite touching. Above them a light is shining on a blind 
               revealing a shadow of a woman undressing.

               Mark glances at the blind - then looks away quickly.

               He stares ahead of him... and continues to stare ahead of 
               him.

               Suddenly Helen tucks her arm through his, and smiles up at 
               him... they walk on in silence.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. HALL OF MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Helen and Mark come in quietly, and close the door.

               She glances round the dimly lit hall. There is no light 
               under any of the doors, except one at the end of the 
               passage.

                                     HELEN
                         Mother must have gone to bed.
                              (she turns to find 
                              him looking at her)
                         Mark, it was a wonderful evening...

                                     MARK
                         That's what I was going to say... 
                         a wonderful evening...

                                     HELEN
                              (gently)
                         And you made it wonderful... without 
                         your camera.

               A shadow passes over his face.

                                     HELEN
                              (gently)
                         I'll get it for you.

               He stands motionless as she goes into her room... 

               From his POV WE SEE the half-opened door - and the bed in 
               the comer.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark forcing himself to look away.

               Helen reappears on the threshold - the camera in her hand. 
               He looks down at it - then slowly stretches out his hand.

                                     HELEN
                         wonder how this sees grown-ups?
                              (she turns the camera 
                              round)
                         ...me, for instance... now that I 
                         am one.
                         (she looks at herself in the lens)

                                     MARK
                         Not you!
                              (he takes the camera 
                              from her)

                                     HELEN
                         Mark.

                                     MARK
                         It never will... see you!

                                     HELEN
                         Why not?

               He hesitates.

                                     MARK
                         Whatever I photograph -

                                     HELEN
                         Yes?  

                                     MARK
                         I always - lose...

                                     HELEN
                         I don't understand.

               The door at the end of the passage opens and Tony emerges 
               in his dressing-gown, carrying a towel. He avoids looking 
               at them - goes into the bathroom opposite, and slams the 
               door.

                                     HELEN
                         He'll wake Mother!

               There is the sound of running water.

                                     HELEN
                         ... thank you, again, for my 
                         evening.
                              (she is standing 
                              very close to him, 
                              smiling up into 
                              his face)
                         Will you go to bed now - and not 
                         stop up watching those films?

                                     MARK
                         Well... I've a little work to do... 
                         then I'll go to bed... and think 
                         of how to find faces for you...

               He looks down at the face which he has found for himself. 
               She raises her head slowly.

                                     MARK
                         ...faces which - are faces which...

               She kisses him very gently on the mouth. The bathroom begins 
               to sound like a small waterfall.

                                     HELEN
                         Good night, Mark...

               He watches her as she goes into the room, and doses the 
               door. A light goes on beneath the door.

               He stands very still for a moment... then turns the camera 
               round and points the lens towards his lips.

               Then he turns abruptly, and hurries up the stairs.

               The waterfall cascades on.  The screen grows dark - and 
               the dark-room grows out of it.

               INT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHT

               The big drying drum is turning, feeding the dry print into 
               a box. A small motor drives it.  CLOSE SHOT of the box. 
               Mark is spooling up the film as it comes off the drier. 
               Once or twice he can't help glancing at an image.

               CLOSE UP of Vivian's face, in the image.

               Mark stops the motor and the drum, loosens the end of the 
               film, spools up with a snap, slides the spool off and 
               hurries out with it.

               Mark hurries to his projector, threads the film and starts 
               the projector. He flicks it on, as if it were a gramophone, 
               then looks eagerly at the 16mm screen.  

               Behind him something moves in the shadows 

               REVERSE SHOT of Mark.  

               Over the shoulder of someone who is standing deep in the 
               shadows WE SEE Mark. His head obscures what he is watching 
               on the screen.

               HE TURNS ROUND SUDDENLY -

               From Mark's POV WE SEE the processing sinks deep in shadow. 
               He starts to move towards them, then suddenly stares at 
               the shadows at the back of the room.

               Silence - except for the whirring of the 16mm projector.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark's hand - switching on the light.  Mark 
               turns round... he is as astonished at what he sees as he 
               can be.

               CAMERA PANS in its own good time to the back of the room.  

               Mrs. Stephens is standing in the shadows... a heavy hand 
               rests on a heavy stick... the sightless eyes stare 
               unerringly towards the light switch.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Good evening, Mark...

                                     MARK
                         ...how did you?

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         The young man bathing himself 
                         brought me to your door... I managed 
                         the rest of the adventure alone...

               He stands motionless, staring at her standing motionless. 
               Above her head an ancient, half-blind camera also stares 
               at her. The only movement in the room is her smile.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         This is one room I expected to 
                         find locked.

                                     MARK
                         I was never allowed a key..., can't 
                         get used to them.

               Mrs. Stephens' sightless eyes stare at him.

                                     MARK
                         I brought her home early.

               CLOSE SHOT of her hand - tightening on the heavy stick.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Thank you...

                                     MARK
                         Is there something you...

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         ... a talk.

                                     MARK
                         Next door would be more...

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         I'm at home here... I visit this 
                         room every night.

                                     MARK
                         Visit?

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         The blind always live in the rooms 
                         they live under...

               Mark nods.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Every night you pace for hours 
                         above my head! Why?

                                     MARK
                         I've no one to talk to... in the 
                         rooms I live over...

               Mrs. Stephens nods. Her hand touches the black cloth loading 
               bag, lying on the table.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         I'm told that you stare too much... 
                         so do I.

               CLOSE SHOT of her hand - touching the black cloth bag. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - walking slowly towards her. 

               At once she raises the heavy stick - pointing it towards 
               him.  

               CLOSE SHOT of the stick. It is a shooting stick - with a 
               sharp spike on the end of it, similar to the tripod on 
               Mark's camera.

               Mark stares at the stick, fascinated.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens - exploring the inside of the 
               black cloth bag with her free hand.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Cloth... with something hard inside 
                         it...

                                     MARK
                         It's a changing bag... we put films 
                         in it - so that the light won't 
                         spoil them...

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         How odd - that the light can spoil 
                         anything...

               The screen greys out.

               In Mrs. Stephens' own dark-room we hear the hum of Mark's 
               projector - and the pounding of Mark's heart - and, very 
               faintly, the sounds of Tony bathing himself.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Every night you switch on that 
                         film machine.

               We hear his tiny intake of breath.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         What are these films you can't 
                         wait to look at?

               The sound of his footsteps softly approaching.  Like a 
               chair?

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         Like a chair?

                                     MRS. STEPHENS (O.S.)
                         What is the film you're showing 
                         now?

               Very faintly we hear Tony singing in his bath.  

               FADE IN: 

               The singing dies away, and the sound returns to normal.  

               Over Mark's shoulder WE SEE Mrs. Stephens holding her stick 
               in front of her.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Why don't you lie to me? I'd never 
                         know...

                                     MARK
                         You'd know at once -

               Mrs. Stephens smiles - then turns her head towards the 
               16mm screen.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Take me to your cinema.

                                     MARK
                         Yes.

               He takes her arm gently and guides her towards us.

               Both of them stare at the 16mm screen... She leans forward - 
               her face only inches from the screen - the light from the 
               projector flickering on to her.  

               REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. Slowly she stretches 
               out her hands and touches the screen.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         What am I seeing, Mark?

               Her head and shoulders blot out most of the screen - but 
               between her outspread fingers WE CATCH A GLIMPSE of a girl's 
               terrified eyes.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Why don't you answer?

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark and Mrs. Stephens.

                                     MARK
                              (staring at the 
                              screen)
                         It's no good - I was afraid it 
                         wouldn't be.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         What?

                                     MARK
                         The lights failed too soon.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                              (pause)
                         They always do.

                                     MARK
                         I'll have to try again.

               He hurries to his cine-camera.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         I've yet to meet an artist who 
                         could judge his own work...

               Mark slips a new spool of film into his cine-camera.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         What do you think you've spoiled?

                                     MARK
                         An opportunity... now I must find 
                         another.

               He looks at her thoughtfully, then presses a light switch. 
               A spotlight falls blindingly on to her eyes. He presses 
               another switch, and then another, until the whole of her 
               face is shining with light.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Why are you putting those lights 
                         on my face?

               He walks towards her. She starts to back away.

               The shadow of Mark's head appears on the 16mm screen. WE 
               SEE him raise his camera - then pull down the tripod.  

               Black out into the grey darkness of Mrs. Stephens' world.  

               WE HEAR the purring of Mark's camera - more clearly than 
               we have yet heard it. (There is the faint rasp of a cog 
               which needs oiling.) The sound of footsteps approaching... 
               the purring changes direction.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS (O.S.)
                         Mark...

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         It's almost over...

               The purring is on top of her. There is a sudden thud.

               FADE IN: 

               Mrs. Stephens is leaning against the wall... she has dropped 
               her heavy stick. It lies on the floor a few feet away from 
               her. Mark is kneeling in front of her - the tripod firmly 
               on the floor. The cine-camera is pointing upwards into her 
               face. He peers excitedly into the viewfinder.

                                     MARK
                         Please let me finish! It's for 
                         Helen!

               She edges towards her stick. He hurries forward and picks 
               it up. He looks at the spike on the end of it - then 
               carefully gives it to her by the handle. She grasps it 
               tightly.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         What do you mean? It's for Helen?

                                     MARK
                         She wants to see something I've 
                         photographed!

                 He returns excitedly to his camera.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         My daughter sees enough of my face 
                         without photographs...

               On Mark's focusing screen WE SEE the fear on her face. Her 
               hand trembles as she wipes away the perspiration.

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         Please... don't be frightened.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Not frightened! Hot!

               But it is fear that we are looking at.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         So put that camera away...

               On the focusing screen we see her moisten her lips 
               nervously.

                                     MARK
                         Yes!

               He switches off the camera abruptly, and folds up the 
               tripod. He turns away without looking at her - and hurries 
               to the door.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens listening to his movements - 
               puzzled.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         In rather a hurry, aren't you?

               He glances towards her.

               From his POV WE SEE the fear in her eyes. He looks away at 
               once, staring into the darkened room.

                                     MARK
                         It's late.

               From her POV (shooting over her shoulder with a large CLOSE 
               SHOT of her ear in the foreground) WE SEE Mark standing in 
               the doorway - and hear, very clearly, his quick, uneasy 
               breathing.

                                     MARK
                         You must be tired...

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         You're anxious to get rid of me 
                         all of a sudden.

               We hear his quick intake of breath.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         I won't be selfish... You can take 
                         some more pictures - if you want 
                         to...

                                     MARK
                         No... thank you.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                              (quietly)
                         Why not, Mark?

                                     MARK
                         Run out of film.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Can't you find some - to please 
                         Helen?

               He glances towards her - then hurries into the next room.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         You don't trust yourself to take 
                         any more, do you?

               INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               The tapping of her stick is overlaid. Mark hurries to the 
               door and opens it - staring into the dimly lit passage. 
               Over his shoulder WE SEE her tapping her way towards him 
               from the dark-room.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't 
                         it Mark? A pity it can't be 
                         photographed.

               Over her shoulder we follow the stick towards him.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         if I'd listened to it years ago, I 
                         might have kept my sight.
                              (she approaches the 
                              door)
                         I wouldn't have let a man operate 
                         I had no faith in... so I'm 
                         listening to it now...
                              (she puts her face 
                              close to him)
                         It says all this filming isn't 
                         healthy - and that you need help...

               His face is averted... his eyes are closed.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         ... get it, Mark... get it 
                         quickly... and until you've got 
                         it... I don't want you and Helen 
                         to see each...

                                     MARK
                         I'll never photograph her... I 
                         promise you that.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         I'd rather you don't have the 
                         chance.

               He turns towards her - a small boy who suddenly understands 
               what contagious means...

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         I mean it, Mark. And if you don't 
                         listen to me... one of us will 
                         move from this house - which would 
                         be a pity, because we'd never find 
                         a cheaper...

                                     MARK
                         You'll never have to move... because 
                         of me... I promise you.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Good boy.
                              (she takes his hand)
                         The stairs are the difficult part...

               They go into the passage.

               INT. PASSAGE - NIGHT

               He guides her gently down the stairs. Over their shoulders 
               WE CAN SEE the door of Helen's room.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Far enough, Mark...

               He stares at Helen's room - then looks quickly away. 
               Suddenly she raises her hands - and runs them gently over 
               his face...

                                     MARK
                         taking my picture?

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Yes ...

               We can see his eyes through her outstretched fingers.

                                     MARK
                         It's been a long time... since 
                         anyone did...

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         Mark... what's troubling you?

                                     MARK
                         Good night, Mrs. Stephens.

               He turns away abruptly and hurries up the stairs.

                                     MRS. STEPHENS
                         ...you'll have to!

               She looks towards Helen's room - then turns slowly towards 
               her own.

               HIGH ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens opening the door of her 
               room - and Mark opening the door of his.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE SHOT of a bottle of whisky standing by a bedside.

               INT. MRS. STEPHENS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

               She is lying in bed, staring at the ceiling. WE HEAR 
               footsteps moving overhead.

               CAMERA PANS to the window. It is dark.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE SHOT of the same bottle of whisky - now almost empty. 
               Mrs. Stephens' heavy breathing is overlaid.

               CAMERA PANS to the window. It is daybreak.

               The footsteps are still moving about above; things are 
               being dragged across the floor.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen in a dressing-gown looking out of a 
               window.

               INT. HELEN'S ROOM - MORNING

               From Helen's POV WE SEE Mark hurrying down the street, his 
               camera over his shoulder.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector looking out of a window.

               INT. DON JARVIS' OFFICE. MORNING

               From his POV WE SEE Mark hurrying along the studio 
               quadrangle, his camera over his shoulder. He is one of a 
               crowd of people scurrying towards their jobs. Camera pulls 
               back - Don Jarvis is seated at his desk.

               Arthur Baden and the Chief Publicity Man are seated in 
               front of him. The Sergeant stands by the door.

                                     JARVIS
                         Have you any suspicions, Chief 
                         Inspector?

                                     INSPECTOR
                         It could be any of them...

                                     SERGEANT
                         That's the trouble with film people - 
                         they're all peculiar...
                              (hastily)
                         ... present company excepted.

               He catches a glare from the great man.

                                     PUBLICITY MAN
                         Speaking of peculiar people.

               The Inspector turns round.

                                     PUBLICITY MAN
                         We've a psychiatrist coming down 
                         today. Dr Rosen -

                                     INSPECTOR
                         I know him.

                                     PUBLICITY MAN
                         It's pure publicity - and I promise 
                         he won't do any work.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         What will he do?

                                     PUBLICITY MAN
                         Get himself photographed... We're 
                         telling the press he's here to 
                         help the case - and to see if he 
                         can spot the murderer.

                                     SERGEANT
                         And the best of luck!

                                     JARVIS
                         Do you object. Chief Inspector?

                                     INSPECTOR
                         No...

               The Publicity Man sighs with relief.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         I'll be frank. I'd welcome anyone's 
                         help... I don't know how this maniac 
                         kills - or why he kills - or who 
                         he'll kill next, but if he isn't 
                         caught quickly...
                              (he shrugs')

                                     BADEN
                         Inspector, have you convinced 
                         yourself he's a member of my unit?

                                     INSPECTOR
                         No, sir ... but a few things seem 
                         to point to it... No one outside 
                         your unit admits to knowing the 
                         girl... There was a trunk all ready 
                         for her... and with the risks he 
                         was running, I think he'd have to 
                         use surroundings he was familiar 
                         with... Where is your unit now?

                                     BADEN
                         Waiting for me on the set.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         I'd like to watch them at their 
                         jobs, sir. It may tell me more 
                         than a hundred interviews.

                                     BADEN
                         But, Inspector, the strain on them 
                         is already...

                                     JARVIS
                         Come now, Arthur, if that's what 
                         the Inspector wants.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         I'm afraid it is, sir... now where 
                         could I get the best view?

                                     BADEN
                              (sulkily)
                         On the dolly... the camera... You 
                         can watch everyone and everything 
                         from there... including me!

                                     INSPECTOR
                         Very well, sir ... I'll become a 
                         member of your camera crew...

                                     BADEN
                         (to Don Jarvis)
                         ... if the unions don't object!

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. STAGE

               A member of the camera crew places his cine-camera and 
               lunch bag on a shelf. Snatches of whispered conversations 
               are overlaid.

                                     VOICE 1
                         I hear they're making an arrest 
                         today.

                                     VOICE 2
                         hope it's D.J. It's about time 
                         they caught up with him!

               Mark turns round and walks towards the small group of people 
               assembled round the studio camera -

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE SHOT of a book entitled The Art of Fly Fishing.

               INT. CAR - DAY

               Through the windscreen WE SEE the entrance to the studio. 
               The driver glances round at his passenger whose face is 
               completely obscured by the book. All WE CAN SEE is a shock 
               of white hair protruding above

                                     DRIVER
                         We're there, Doctor.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (to Sergeant on 
                              gate)
                         Dr Rosen!  What a pity.

               He continues reading. The car enters the studio.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. STAGE E. - DAY

               The (studio) camera is ready for a tracking shot. The set 
               is redressed as the Hat Department of the store. The 
               Inspector stands on the dolly, looking round with interest.  

               The Doctor is sitting in a chair watching everything like 
               an excited schoolboy. The Sergeant has positioned himself 
               near the sound crew.  

               Baden walks on to the set, his arm round Diane's shoulder. 
               He is talking to her softly. She keeps her eyes on the 
               floor; he leads her to the front of the studio camera.

                                     BADEN
                         Try it, darling... We'll all be 
                         with you.

               He pats her arm reassuringly. The Chief Cameraman nods to 
               Mark.

               From the Inspector's POV WE SEE Mark pull a tape measure 
               from the front of the camera and hold it to Diane's 
               forehead. From Mark's POV WE SEE the Inspector watching 
               him over the top of the studio camera. A man with a shock 
               of white hair is also watching him... and the Sergeant 
               stares at him from the other side of the set. The tape 
               measure in Mark's hand remains steady.

               From the Inspector's POV WE SEE Mark replace the tape 
               measure and take up his position on a small stool by the 
               side of the camera.

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                              (shouting)
                         Quiet, everyone. Let's run it!

               The Doctor sneezes violently - and all heads turn towards 
               him.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Terribly sorry.

               In the nervous laughter that follows, the Assistant 
               Cameraman whispers to the Chief Cameraman.

                                     ASSISTANT CAMERAMAN
                         That sneezer geezer's a 
                         psychiatrist!... Heard it on the 
                         grapevine.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark turning round to look at the Doctor - a 
               hint of hope in his face.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector following Mark's glance.

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                              (shouting)
                         All right, everyone - let's run 
                         it...

               Over the Inspector's shoulder WE TRACK towards the 
               rehearsal. WE SEE Mark swing out into space on his stool, 
               turning the handle of the focus-puller. Diane approaches 
               the hat counter. The Assistant smiles at her.

                                     DIANE
                         I'd like to see... that one...

               The Assistant hands her a hat. Diane tries it on.

                                     DIANE
                         ... have you it... in red...?

                                     ASSISTANT
                         Certainly, madam.

                                     DIANE
                         ... in... red
                              (suddenly she covers 
                              her face in her 
                              hands')
                         I can't! I can't, Arthur!

               She bursts into tears and runs off the set. From the 
               Inspector's POV WE SEE Baden whisper to the Assistant 
               Director - then hurry after Diane.

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                         Ten minutes break, everyone!

               The unit dissolves into small, chattering groups. The 
               Assistant Director hurries up to the Doctor.

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                         Can you suggest anything, Doctor?

                                     DOCTOR
                         No. It looked jolly interesting to 
                         me.

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                         I mean to help her 
                         psychologically...

                                     DOCTOR
                         Yes. Give the girl a proper rest... 
                         Ten minutes is useless!

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                              (hastily)
                         Thank you, Doctor.

               He bustles off and the Doctor is left alone. He glances 
               round thoughtfully.

               From the Doctor's POV WE SEE the small, chattering groups. 
               Then we see Mark standing a few yards away, watching him. 
               The Doctor smiles at him pleasantly.

                                     DOCTOR
                         What's your job?  

                                     MARK
                         I'm a focus-puller...

                                     DOCTOR
                         Oh... so am I, in a way.

                                     MARK
                         I was wondering if you knew my 
                         father - Professor Lewis...

                                     DOCTOR
                         Professor... but of course I knew 
                         him. He lectured to me.

               He looks at Mark with renewed interest. So does the 
               Inspector.

               From his POV WE SEE Mark and the Doctor talking. The Doctor 
               is fidgeting with his watch chain. Mark fidgets with his 
               jacket button. The Inspector then glances towards the Hat 
               Salesman, who is holding court in the comer. We return to 
               Mark and the Doctor.

                                     DOCTOR
                         He was an extraordinary man - quite 
                         brilliant!

                                     MARK
                         You know what he was interested in 
                         before he died?

                                     DOCTOR
                         No? Tell me...

               Mark puts his hands behind his back.

                                     MARK
                         I don't remember what he called 
                         it... It was something to do with 
                         what causes people to be... peeping 
                         Toms...

                                     DOCTOR
                         Scoptophilia!... That would interest 
                         him! A most fertile mind.

                                     MARK
                         Scopto...?

                                     DOCTOR
                         philia... The morbid urge to gaze... 
                         Coined since his day... Have you 
                         any manuscripts of his which I 
                         could...?

                                     MARK
                         He thought... it could be cured...

                                     DOCTOR
                         Usually. Now about his manuscripts -

                                     MARK
                         Quickly?

                                     DOCTOR
                         The cure? Very quick... A couple 
                         of years analysis - three times a 
                         week - an hour a time - and it's 
                         soon up-rooted...

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - his last hope gone.

                                     DOCTOR
                         ... if you've any of his papers on 
                         the subject?

                                     MARK
                         Yes, Doctor...

                                     DOCTOR
                         I'd like to see them - I'll give 
                         you my address, young man.

               From the Sergeant's POV WE SEE the Doctor hand Mark a card, 
               and pat him jovially on the shoulder. The Sergeant edges 
               up to the Inspector.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Wonder what all that's about?

                                     INSPECTOR
                         We'll find out afterwards... Now, 
                         listen... I want you to watch who 
                         brings their own lunches... Someone 
                         ate homemade cakes and sandwiches 
                         by the side of those bushes - and 
                         we may get a lead.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Right, sir.

               CAMERA PANS to a shelf in the comer. A lunch basket stands 
               next to a cine-camera.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               WE HEAR the Assistant Director call out:

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                         We're stopping at four today - so 
                         have a quick lunch, everyone! Back 
                         at two sharp!

               FADE IN on the lunch basket.  

               Overlaid is the noise of the unit dispersing. Mark picks 
               up his camera - then reaches for the lunch basket. An urgent 
               voice whispers behind him.

                                     VOICE
                         Hey, Mark!

               He turns round. The Clapper Boy is standing there. The 
               Clapper Boy glances round carefully. The Inspector and 
               Sergeant are wandering casually towards the door.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         Can't wait to show you this!
                              (bringing out a 
                              small postcard)
                         I ought to charge you!  

               He winks at Mark, gives him the postcard.  

               CLOSE SHOT of the postcard. We see Milly's face and naked 
               shoulders framed between Mark's hands.

                                     CLAPPER BOY (O.S.)
                         You don't get that in Sight and 
                         Sound - Isn't she terrific?  Got 
                         some more - if you're interested?

               Mark hands it back.

                                     MARK
                         You've given me... an idea...

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         I'll bet I have!

               Mark turns towards the exit.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         Hey! Where are you going?

                                     MARK
                         Phone - may be my last chance - 
                         and... thanks.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         But your lunch?

                                     MARK
                         You have it!

               He hurries excitedly towards the exit...

               CLOSE SHOT of the Clapper Boy staring at his photograph.

                                     CLAPPER BOY
                         ... some photograph! Well lit too!

               He reaches for the lunch basket, then walks towards the 
               exit where the Sergeant is waiting casually.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. CAMERA ROOM

               Mark is talking at a coin-box telephone.

                                     MARK
                         Can't manage Saturday, sir, but 
                         they're letting us off early today! 
                         This afternoon - after work - may 
                         be my last chance!

               While Mark is talking he is scribbling on a form. He has 
               some more pennies ready for the coin-box.

                                                           CROSS CUT TO:

                         be waiting.

                                     MARK

                                     MARK
                         I'll be there, sir.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         You'd better be!

               INT. CAMERA ROOM

               Mark rings off. He is smiling. He puts in another 4d (Four 
               Pence) and dials a number. His pen is poised over the form 
               he is filling in.

                                     MARK
                         Hallo? Is that the Public Library?  
                         ... You have a Miss Helen Stephens 
                         employed there?  Yes... can you 
                         tell me if her name is spelt with 
                         a V or a PH, I want to send her a 
                         tic-PH? ... Thank you.

               We see the form is a last will and testament.  I, Mark 
               Lewis, etc., etc., leave, etc., etc., to Miss Helen Ste-
               ens all my worldly goods, etc.  He fills in PH.

               The door bursts open and the Clapper Boy appears.

                         He asked if I knew his father... 
                         which I did... a brilliant man!

               EXT. GROUNDS OF STUDIO - DAY

               The Inspector and Doctor are standing by the bushes where 
               Mark and Vivian met.

                                     INSPECTOR
                         Is that all he wanted?

                                     DOCTOR
                         think so... we had a little chat 
                         about scoptophilia - and he's going 
                         to show me...

                         About what?

                         Eh?

                         What makes people into Peeping 
                         Toms, one of his father's subjects, 
                         apparently.

                         An interesting boy... he has his 
                         father's eyes... you don't suspect 
                         him, do you?

                                     INSPECTOR
                         I suspect 'em all - what about 
                         you?

                                     DOCTOR
                         I'm interested in that chap with 
                         the bald head and hatchet face... 
                         there's something on his mind!

                                     INSPECTOR
                         No wonder... he's the director!

               He turns away thoughtfully.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark glancing impatiently at his watch.

               INT. STUDIO - DAY

               CLOSE SHOT of Baden glancing at his watch... He whispers 
               to the Assistant Director.

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                         All right, everyone. This is the 
                         last shot... Make it a good one!

               CAMERA PANS to a comer of the studio.  The Inspector and 
               Sergeant stand in the shadows.

                              (quietly)

                         I want to see how some of them 
                         spend their spare time...

                         Which ones, sir?

                         Exactly, Sergeant...

                              thoughtfully)
                         ... which ones?

               CLOSE SHOT of sign: PUBLIC LIBRARY.

               EXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

               LONG SHOT of very modern, glass-walled building. Helen 
               comes out with a manuscript in a parcel under her arm.

               EXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

               Mark watches her. Beyond him stands an insignificant-looking 
               man in a raincoat.

               EXT. LIBRARY

               Helen looks at her watch.

               Helen hurries homeward.

               EXT. LIBRARY

               Mark slowly turns his back and walks away, gradually 
               gathering speed. The man in the raincoat follows him.

               EXT. NEWSAGENT'S SHOP. LATE AFTERNOON

               Mark hurries towards the shop... ahead of him a street 
               clock stands at just on six. Mark unslings his cine-camera 
               and photographs this clock... then he hurries into the 
               shop.

               The man in the raincoat walks into camera. He looks at the 
               clock, puzzled, then glances at the newsagent's window. He 
               gazes with interest at Mark's photograph of Milly, then 
               walks thoughtfully down the street.  

               All the clocks in the kingdom chime the hour of six.

               INT. NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON

               Mr. Peters is behind the counter.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         Don't make a habit of this!

                                     MARK
                         I won't, sir. 

                                     MR. PETERS
                         Milly's upstairs. 

                                     MARK
                         Right, sir.

               He turns to the door.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         I've got to go out... If you finish 
                         before I'm back, lock up and put 
                         this through the letter-box...
                              (he holds out a key)

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at the key.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         What's the matter? Haven't you 
                         ever seen a key before?

               Mark takes the key. He starts to smile.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         The till will be empty - if that's 
                         what you're smiling about.

               Mark turns to the door.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         You know what I want now! No fancy 
                         stuff...

               Mark goes into the inner room; he is still smiling.

               EXT. NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON

               From the opposite side of the street, we see Mr. Peters 
               locking the door of the shop, and hurrying down the road. 
               The man in the raincoat watches him, puzzled.

               CLOSE SHOT of Milly - very angry, in a dressing-gown.

                                     MILLY
                         You've spoiled my whole evening, 
                         you have!

               INT. NEWSAGENT'S STUDIO - LATE AFTERNOON

               Mark closes the door behind him.

                                     MARK
                         Sorry, Milly.

                                     MILLY
                         What's the idea?

                                     MARK
                         I shan't be here tomorrow.
                              (he hurries to the 
                              window)

                                     MILLY
                         Why? Going on manoeuvres with the 
                         boy scouts?

               He starts to draw the curtains - and stops suddenly. Over 
               his shoulder WE SEE the man in the raincoat standing on 
               the opposite side of the street.

                                     MARK
                         I thought so!

               Mark raises his cine-camera and carefully photographs the 
               Detective through a chink in the curtains.

                                     MILLY
                         Have you gone absolutely...

                                     MARK
                         I'm just... completing a 
                         documentary.

                                     MILLY
                         You're a document and a half, you 
                         are. Is it safe to be alone with 
                         you?

               He draws the curtains - and turns round.

                                     MILLY
                         ... might be more fun if it 
                         wasn't...

               He turns round and walks slowly - and a little sadly - 
               towards her

               AN HOUR LATER - EARLY EVENING

               From the Detective's POV, WE SEE the chink of light between 
               the curtains of a window above the newsagent's shop go 
               out. CAMERA TRACKS TOWARDS the door of the shop. Mark comes 
               out, his cine-camera over his shoulder. He has a key in 
               his hand. He closes the door of the shop... then looks at 
               the key. He fits it into the lock - then slips it through 
               the letter-box. He turns and hails a taxi.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Detective. He looks at the shop, 
               hesitates, decides to follow Mark - hails another cab.

               EXT.STREET

               Mark gets into his taxi. As the driver pulls down the 
               flag...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               Mrs. Stephens' head falling on to her chest.

               INT. MRS. STEPHENS' BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

               She is lying in bed - completely drunk - snoring lustily. 
               A hand smooths her forehead.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK

               Helen is leaning over the bed. She has her coat on.

                                     HELEN
                         Darling...

               She shakes her mother's shoulders. Mrs. Stephens snores 
               on.

                                     HELEN
                         Darling.

               She shakes her again  but it is hopeless. Helen pulls the 
               bedclothes round her mother, then turns away. She picks up 
               a large envelope and her handbag, and hurries to the door.

               INT. PASSAGE. MARK'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

               Helen walks towards the stairs. The door of Tony's room 
               opens, and he pokes his head round.

                                     TONY
                         Hallo.

                         Hallo, Tony...

                                     TONY
                         Where are you going?

                                     HELEN
                         To leave something for Mark...

                                     TONY
                         You haven't much time for me these 
                         days.

                         Tony...

                                     TONY
                         It's all right - I'll be here - if 
                         you want me.
                              (he turns to his 
                              room)
                         ... by the way... your mother was 
                         yelling out something before you 
                         came in... about Mark photographing 
                         her.

                                     HELEN
                         Photographing Mother? You must be 
                         mistaken!

                                     TONY
                         Of course. See you sometime.

               He goes into his room, closing the door. She stares after 
               him for a moment, then hurries up the stairs.

               INT. PASSAGE BY MARK'S ROOM - DAY

               Helen knocks on the door.

                                     HELEN
                         Mark...?

               No answer. She knocks again, then opens the door and goes 
               inside.

               INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Helen enters and glances towards the door of the dark-room.

                                     HELEN
                         Mark?  No answer. She looks 
                         thoughtfully at the envelope in 
                         her hand - then goes in to the 
                         dark-room.

               INT. MARK'S DARK-ROOM

               Helen fumbles for a switch... she finds one and presses 
               it. A spotlight falls on Mark's projector, throwing its 
               shadow on to the dazzling white screen. Helen smiles, and 
               walks towards the projector.

               EXT. HOUSE - DAY

               Taxi arrives and Mark gets out.

               INT. POLICE PHONE BOOTH - EARLY EVENING

                         ... don't know what to make of it, 
                         sir ... He went to a library, a 
                         solicitor's office, and a 
                         newsagent's shop - private 
                         photography there, if you ask me. 
                         Shall I hang around outside the 
                         house, sir? Don't think so, 
                         either... All right, sir, I'll 
                         give you the details when I get 
                         back... Bye, sir.

                              receiver)

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen. She is standing by the projector, 
               holding her envelope thoughtfully.

               INT. MARK'S DARK-ROOM

               She smiles suddenly and opens her envelope. She takes out 
               a bound manuscript. We see a label on the manuscript: The 
               Magic Camera by Helen Stephens. She takes a pencil from 
               her pocket, and opens the manuscript. Then she sits at 
               Mark's table and writes a note on the flyleaf. The projector 
               is at her elbow.

               The Chief Inspector snatches up the telephone.

                                     CHIEF INSPECTOR
                         Chief Inspector Gregg! What?  Put 
                         him on the line...

                                                           CROSS CUT TO:

               Mr. Peters - looking very sick - on the telephone.

                                     MR. PETERS
                         went up to look around - found 
                         her.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Chief Inspector.

                                     CHIEF INSPECTOR
                         Yes, yes... What's the address? 
                         ... Newsagent's shop? ... Did you 
                         say news...?

               He slams down the receiver, and jumps to his feet.

               An empty taxi cruising down the street. It passes the 
               Detective in the raincoat walking away from Mark's house.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE SHOT of a note on a flyleaf which reads 'From one 
               Magic Camera - which needs the help of Another'.

               INT. MARK'S DARK-ROOM - NIGHT

               Helen closes the manuscript and lays it carefully by the 
               side of the projector. She turns to leave - then looks 
               curiously at the projector.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - hesitating. Like a small girl in 
               front of her mother's make-up box, she touches the projector 
               tentatively, hesitates again, then presses a switch. A 
               beam of light shoots out. We watch Helen's face as she 
               looks at the screen. Nothing seems wrong for a few seconds - 
               then something starts to happen to the comers of her 
               mouth... and then her eyes become locked... and cannot 
               stop watching. Some kind of sound comes from the back of 
               her throat. Her hands dig into the table and she tries to 
               stand up. She cannot manage it the first time - and keeps 
               on watching, then, like a child waking from a nightmare, 
               she jerks herself away from the table, and stumbles towards 
               the door.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark standing there - watching her.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen staring at him... again we hear that 
               sound from the back of her throat. He looks away from her 
               at once.

                                     MARK
                         Don't let me see you... 
                         frightened...
                              (he pushes the door 
                              wide open...)
                         Leave!
                              (he looks at her - 
                              then looks quickly 
                              away)
                         Hurry, Helen!

                                     HELEN
                         Not...

                                     MARK
                         Leave!

                                     HELEN
                         Not...
                              (she turns away 
                              from him and forces 
                              the words out)
                         ... till I know...

                                     MARK
                         Now!

               She stands with her back to him. From REVERSE ANGLE we see 
               her struggling for breath. Over her shoulder WE SEE him 
               staring at the 16mm screen.

                                     HELEN
                         That film...

               Over her shoulder we see him hurry towards the projector.

                                     HELEN
                         That film...

               The sound of him switching it off.

                                     HELEN
                         ... is ... just a film...

               She wheels round towards him.

                                     HELEN
                         ... isn't it?

               From REVERSE ANGLE we see her looking at him.

                                     HELEN
                         ... horrible ... horrible... but... 
                         just a film... isn't it?

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

                                     MARK
                         No...
                              (he walks towards 
                              the door)
                         I killed them...
                              (he locks the door 
                              with a hint of 
                              sadness)
                         And now that you know... I want 
                         you with me... a while.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen  not enough breath to scream... hardly 
               enough to breathe.  

                                     MARK
                         You'll be safe - as long as I can't 
                         see you frightened - so stand in 
                         the shadows, Helen... please...

               She stands motionless.

                                     MARK
                         ... please...

               From her POV WE SEE him standing in front of the door, 
               looking ahead of him. She backs slowly away into the shadows 
               at the back of the room.

                                     HELEN
                         She's right... your mother... must 
                         tell someone everything... sorry... 
                         has to be you!

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen standing in the shadows where her mother 
               stood.

                                     HELEN
                         This was his laboratory... and you 
                         know some of what he did... but 
                         not all.

               The room is suddenly filled with the terrified screaming 
               of a small boy. Helen wheels round. The screaming seems to 
               be coming from the walls. Mark's hand is on a switch - one 
               of a number on a panel.

                                     MARK
                         ... aged five...

               He presses another switch. There is a click, and the 
               screaming stops, to be replaced by a low sobbing.

                                     MARK
                         ... aged seven... 

               He presses another switch. There is a moment's silence.

                                     MARK
                         All the rooms were wired for 
                         sound... and... still are.

               WE SUDDENLY HEAR the ticking of a clock.

                                     MARK
                         Your room.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - listening.

                                     MARK
                         Your mother's .

               The click of a switch - and we hear a loud snoring.  

                                     MARK
                         Tony's.

               The click of a switch - and we hear Tony's voice.

                                     TONY (O.S.)
                         No one will come in... honestly, 
                         darling...

                                     GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I don't care!

                                     TONY
                         But darling...

                                     GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Stop it, Tony!

               Mark listens with interest.

                                     HELEN
                              (quietly)
                         Turn it off!

               He does so - at once. She walks towards him. He turns away 
               from her.

                                     HELEN
                         Look at me, Mark!

                                     MARK
                         Not if you're frightened...

                                     HELEN
                         Look at me!

               Slowly he faces her.

                                     HELEN
                         What did you do... to those girls?

                                     MARK
                         No.

                                     HELEN
                         What did you do, Mark...?

               He tries to turn away - but she follows him.

                                     HELEN
                         If you want to torment me... for 
                         the rest of my life... then make 
                         me imagine!

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - his eyes closed.

                                     HELEN
                         What did you do ... to those girls?

                                     MARK
                         Can't...

                                     HELEN
                         Show me, Mark...

                                     MARK
                         But if you're frightened...

                                     HELEN
                         Show me - or I'll remain 
                         frightened... for the rest of my 
                         life.  Show me!

               He turns to his cine-camera, and picks it up. He releases 
               the tripod.

               CAMERA HOLDS on Helen. She stands very still against the 
               wall. Mark's voice is overlaid.

                                     MARK (O.S.)
                         Do you know... what the most 
                         frightening thing in the world 
                         is?...

               She is looking at something, puzzled.

                                     MARK
                         It's fear.

               The sound of his footsteps approaching...

                                     MARK
                         So I did something... very simple...

               WE SEE a look of fear spring into her eyes.

                                     MARK
                         Very simple.

               WE SEE the spike approaching her throat... but she is 
               looking at something else.

                                     MARK
                         When they felt the spike... touching 
                         their throats... and knew I was 
                         going to kill them...

               The spike is touching her throat.

                                     MARK
                         ... I made them - watch their own 
                         deaths!

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen's face several times its natural size. 
               She is looking at herself in a large circular magnifying 
               mirror which has been fitted over the camera's face. The 
               mirror entirely obscures both Mark and the camera. There 
               is a small hole in the mirror through which the lens of 
               the camera winks. As Helen looks at her terrified distorted 
               face this small hole gives her an extra eye in the middle 
               of her forehead.

                                     MARK
                         Made them see their own terror as 
                         the spike went in... and if death 
                         has a face, they saw that too!

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - crouching behind the mirror, sweat 
               pouring down his forehead... his finger on the trigger of 
               the camera.

                                     MARK
                         Not you! Not you! I'll never 
                         photograph you! I promised - I 
                         promised - Not you!  

               Helen's eyes are closed. The spike is still touching her 
               throat.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark  his face turned away from the 
               viewfinder.

                                     HELEN
                         ... frightened ... for you...

               There's the sound of a car pulling up. He hurries to the 
               other room.

               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               The Police arrive: three cars.  Mark appears at an upstairs 
               window with his camera.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Look out!

               He thinks Mark has a gun. They all duck. Mark raises his 
               camera and photographs them. The Police recover and charge 
               for the house. Mark disappears.

               INT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHT

               Mark hurries back into the room carrying his camera. He 
               knows exactly what he has to do.

                                     HELEN
                         Mark! Mark! Give yourself up!

                                     MARK
                         I've been ready for this... for 
                         such a long time...

               Rapidly he fixes his camera on to a hook on the wall. Then 
               he adjusts the tripod so that the spikes protrude towards 
               him...

                                     HELEN
                         What are you...

                                     MARK
                         It'll be all right.

               He makes chalk marks on the floor in front of the camera, 
               then switches on all the floodlights. WE CAN HEAR the 
               Policemen pounding on the door.

                                     MARK
                         I can beat that!

               He crosses to a switch - presses it.  The room is filled 
               with a small boy's screaming.

                                     HELEN
                         Give yourself up... Mark!

               He stands next to her, and looks at his long array of 
               cameras. WE SEE that each one of them has been fitted with 
               a small metal disc (a delayed release), and that some of 
               the older cameras have flashlights attached.

                                     MARK
                         Watch them, Helen... Watch them 
                         say goodbye - one by one -
                              (he presses a master 
                              switch on the wait)
                         I've timed this... so often...

               Slowly he walks past his cameras. As he does, the metallic 
               disc on each one explodes with a little plop - and the eye 
               of each camera winks once as if in salute. Some go off 
               with flashlights on either side of the room. The sound of 
               footsteps hurrying up the stairs.

               Ahead of Mark - coming steadily closer  are the spikes of 
               the tripod. The mirror on the cine-camera reflects the 
               approach - and Helen's terrified face.

                                     HELEN
                         No - No!

               The child's screaming reaches its peak as Mark approaches 
               the spikes... Ahead of him, on the small table where his 
               projector stands, is Helen's book The Magic Camera.

                                     MARK
                         I wish... I could have found your 
                         faces for you... 

               The Policemen are now rattling on the dark-room door. 

                                     MARK
                         Helen - I'm afraid!

               We see his face, terrified, in the magnifying mirror. The 
               spikes are against his throat. The eye of the camera is 
               winking rapidly.

                                     MARK
                         I'm glad I'm afraid!

               Heavy shoulders are pressing against the dark-room door... 
               as it breaks in, Mark lunges forward against the spikes. 
               The cine-camera is wrenched away from the wall as he falls 
               back. He crashes against the small table, which falls over. 
               He is not parted from his camera - it is fixed to him by 
               the tripod, and falls back with him, covering his face 
               like a canopy. WE SEE his face in the lens of the cine-
               camera. and WE SEE his hand - lying limp on the cover of 
               The Magic Camera.

               The Policemen hurry into the room. They stare motionless 
               at what they see.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - her face buried in her hands.

               The child's screaming stops suddenly... and in the absolute 
               silence which follows WE HEAR the voice of Mark's father:

                                     FATHER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Don't be a silly boy... there's 
                         nothing to be afraid of...

               And a small voice answers.

                                     CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Good night, Daddy...

               The spotlights begin to dim... The dazzling white of the 
               16mm screen fades slowly into greyness...

               The room is filled with the gentle breathing of a small 
               child.

                                                               FADE OUT:

               THE END
