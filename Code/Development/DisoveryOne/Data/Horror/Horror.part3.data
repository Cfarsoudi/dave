FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN


 

	FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN

	Written by Rob Hedden


	FADE IN:

	EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	A dark, rumbling sky. Haze clings to the lake as we float 
	across it, clearing to bring the opposite shoreline into 
	view. A few scattered streetlights. Dilapidated cabins. 
	An abandoned campsite. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE. 

	We continue to drift towards it, hearing the faint sound 
	of seductive music and an occasional giggle. A small 
	HOUSEBOAT floats into our foreground, its interior light 
	flickering as TWO BODIES move around inside.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

	A teenage boy and girl, JIM and SUZY, are slow-dancing. 
	Jim's lips softly touch her lissome shoulders.

				JIM
		Well...how do you feel?

				SUZY
		Ask me in about five minutes.

	She bites his ear, giggles, then kisses him fully..

				JIM
		I'm talking about graduation. Being 
		totally free to do whatever we want 
		now.

	Her hands slip inside his Pendleton shirt. He sighs.

				SUZY
		It feels excellent.

	Her mouth finds his again. After a long kiss, he gently 
	pulls away from her with a teasing smile.

				JIM
		Gotta throw the anchor over.

	He leaves the cabin. She slips under the bed sheets.

	EXT. HOUSEBOAT DECK - NIGHT

	as Jim tosses a small anchor overboard.

	TIGHT ON WATER SURFACE

	as the weighty object splashes, sinking into black 
	oblivion, pulling its cable down with it. 

	JIM 

	glances at the lake, at their eerie surroundings. He 
	feels a chill, heading back inside.

	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the anchor drifts to the lake bottom, dropping a few 
	feet from a THICK POWER CABLE which rests in the lake 
	silt.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

	as Jim returns with an uneasy expression. He crawls on 
	top of the bed, kissing her again, but not with the same 
	enthusiasm as before.

				SUZY
		What's wrong?

				JIM
		Nothing.

	He starts to pull off his shirt and join her. She senses 
	his anxiety.

				SUZY
		C'mon, Jimmy. Something's bothering 
		you.

	Jim pauses, turning off the mood music.

				JIM
		It's just that we're right around that 
		old summer camp where all those 
		murders took place.

	The boat creaks. She's instantly nervous.

				SUZY
		What murders?

				JIM
		Never mind, you don't want to know 
		about it.

				SUZY
		Tell me.

				JIM
		There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. 
		The guy's dead now, somewhere at the 
		bottom of this lake...if you believe 
		the stories.
			(beat)
		Let's drop it, okay?

	He starts to kiss her again. She stops him.

				SUZY
		What stories?

	He doesn't want to go into it but Suzy's face insists.

				JIM
		There was this boy named Jason 
		Voorhees who drowned in Crystal 
		Lake...

	FLASHBACK

	Eight year old JASON is desperately trying to tread 
	water, flailing his arms like a marionette to get 
	attention as he gulps down gallons of mossy lake water.

				YOUNG JASON
		Hhhhelp....me....I'm drowning...

				JIM (V.O.)
		None of the counselors heard him.

				YOUNG JASON
		Mmmmmmommy....

	...And Jason finally slips under the surface for good.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

				JIM
		A bunch of years went by and everybody 
		forgot about it.
			(beat)
		That's when the murders started.

	FLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK)

	as our senses are bombarded with QUICK CUTS of assorted

	teenagers just about to die, their screams echoing over 
	each other. We do not see the attacker. As the 
	cacophony reaches a screeching crescendo, CUT BACK TO:

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

	as the silence hits us hard again.

				SUZY
		Jason did it...?

				JIM'
		That's what some people thought. But 
		they were wrong.

	FLASHBACK (STOCK)

	as MRS. VOORHEES comes directly at camera wielding a huge 
	knife and a primal scream.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

				JIM
		His mother blamed the counselors for 
		his death and tried to kill them all.
			(dramatic pause)
		She got her head chopped off by one of 
		them.

	We don't need to see this clip...Suzy's reaction is quite 
	sufficient.

				SUZY
		So the murders stopped?

	He gives her a long, penetrating look.

				JIM
		No.

	FLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK)

	We're bombarded with QUICK FLASHES of a hockey masked 
	JASON wreaking havoc on assorted teenagers...brandishing 
	everything from hatchets to knives to chainsaws. Just as 
	Jason is about to stab us, CUT BACK TO:

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

	Suzy flinches as if she were getting the knife.

				

				JIM
		Legend has it that Jason came back to 
		avenge his mother's death, vowing to 
		kill every teenager from the area. 
			(beat)
		And every now and then, the murders 
		start up again. 

	The boat lurches slightly, tugging at the anchor cable. 
	She's scared: he's frightened himself a little, too.

				JIM
		Forget about it, Suzy. They're just 
		stories.

	He brushes her hair back, kissing her cheek gently, 
	finding the nape of her neck again. She closes her eyes, 
	trying to dismiss what he's dredged up. But she can't. 
	Suzy begins to rationalize.

				SUZY
		We're the last graduating class, 
		right? 

	Jim's kissing her body, putting Jason behind him.

				JIM
		Right.

				SUZY
		I mean, Lakeview High just closed its 
		doors for good, right?

				JIM
		Right.

				SUZY
		So there's no reason for him to come 
		back because there won't be any of us 
		around...right?

	Jim stops, looking her squarely in the eyes.

				JIM
		Right. Except that Jason isn't real 
		so none of it matters anyway.

	She starts to relax, returning his kisses.

	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the anchor drifts along the lake floor, tugging hard 
	on the power cable. Camera TRACKS along the cable, 
	coming to a RUSTY SET OF CHAINS TANGLED AROUND IT.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	as Jim slides on top of Suzy. Thoughts of Jason are 
	starting to slip away along with their clothes.

	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the chains emit a dull tinkle due to movement from the 
	tugging anchor. Camera continues to TRACK again...and we 
	find to our horror that the waterlogged, fish-eaten body 
	of JASON IS SECURED BY THESE SAME CHAINS. (NOTE: Jason's 
	face is obscured.)

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	Teenagers in love, lost in not-so-innocent passion. At 
	the same moment:

	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

	The anchor tugs one last time and RIPS THROUGH THE CABLE. 
	SPARKS INSTANTLY FLY, chasing along the cable, finding 
	the chain which secures Jason and ENGULFING HIM IN 
	ELECTRICITY.

	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - ON LAKE SURFACE (EFX)

	as BRIGHT FLASHES OF BLUE LIGHT strobe-under the surface. 
	ARCING CURRENT chases up the anchor cable, sparking 
	across the hoist.

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - WIDE SHOT FROM WATER

	as the electricity feeding the streetlights is abruptly 
	extinguished, plunging the campsite into darkness.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	as Suzy's eyes flash open.

				SUZY
		Did you hear that?

				JIM
		Hear what?

	He pulls her back down.

				SUZY
		C'mon, I'm serious.

	He knows the mood is broken.

				JIM
		All right, I'll check it out.

	He slips on his jeans, exiting the cabin. She pulls the 
	sheet up around her fearfully.

	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the cable smolders, void of electricity now. TRACK to 
	find the chains again...but they're dangling loosely. 
	JASON IS GONE.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	Suzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now. The black void 
	of night is all she sees out the cabin door, which Jim 
	has left open. An uncomfortable amount of time passes.

				SUZY
		Jimmy...?

	No answer. Her heart starts to pound.

				SUZY
		Jim...?

	Again, nothing. She wraps herself in the sheet, moving 
	towards the open door. The ship creaks again.

	SUZY'S POINT OF VIEW

	as she grows closer to the doorway, nothing but pitch-
	black beyond it.

				SUZY
		Stop screwing around, Jim. I mean 
		it...

	...And just as she reaches the door:

	A HOCKEY MASKED MONSTER

	leaps out, clutching a HUGE KNIFE. Suzy barely has time 
	to scream before JASON PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO HER CHEST.

	SUZY

	stands there in speechless shock, looking down at her 
	mortal wound. But there's no blood.

	THE MONSTER

	pulls the knife back out, pushing the blade in and out 
	with his hand. It's a retractable rubber knife. JIM 
	pulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin, tossing it 
	aside.

				JIM
		Gotcha good, baby cakes.

	She doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick 
	him in the balls. He pulls her back onto the bed, 
	laughing.

	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK

	sitting dormant on the deck, where Jim tossed it. A 
	SHADOW FALLS ACROSS IT...followed by a SLIMY, DECOMPOSING 
	HAND. The hand grabs it like it's an old friend, pulling 
	it away.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	as Jim holds his angry girlfriend down on the bed, trying 
	unsuccessfully to kiss her.

				JIM
		All right, all right -- I'm a major 
		ass.

				SUZY
		And you'll never do it again.

				JIM
		And I'll never do it again. Forgive 
		me?

				SUZY
		No.

	She's resisting only for effect. Her legs curl around 
	him, finally giving in.

	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

	A deadly-sharp SPEAR GUN rests in its rack outside the 
	cabin. JASON'S HAND REMOVES IT.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	The sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each 
	other. Thoughts of Jason are nonexistent now.

	ANGLE - CABIN DOOR

	Nothing there for a moment...then a pair of moss-covered 
	BARE FEET SLOSH INTO FRAME.

	SUZY

	closes her eyes with pleasure...

	ANGLE - CABIN DOOR

	...and camera RISES from the mossy feet, up the bloodless 
	legs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockey-masked 
	face of our anti-hero: JASON VOORHEES.

	SUZY 

	lets out a broad smile, her eyelids fluttering. They stay 
	open long enough to regard the visitor in the doorway. 
	She tries to choke out a warning to Jim, who's just 
	collapsed himself.

				SUZY
		JJJJJJJJason...

	He doesn't follow her glance, smiling instead.

				JIM
		Uh-huh. You must really think I'm an 
		ass.

	But she continues to stare in horror as:

	JASON

	raises the spear, taking aim.

	ANGLE - SUZY AND JIM  

	Hs starts to kiss her but she bolts up with a blood-
	curdling SCREAM. A second later, JASON FIRES THE SPEAR, 
	PIERCING HER NECK, PINNING HER TO THE HEAD BOARD.

	Jim stares point-blank at his dead girlfriend, not able 
	to assimilate it quickly enough. He spins around to see 
	the monster himself.

				JIM
		Ohmygod...

	Jim springs off the bed, looking around for anything to 
	defend himself with, grabbing the bedside lamp. He 
	SMASHES IT OVER JASON'S HEAD which has little effect. Jim 
	scrambles to get past him, but Jason LIFTS JIM IN THE 
	AIR, SLAMMING HIM DOWN ON ONE OF THE SPIKED BEDPOSTS.

	EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	as the HOUSEBOAT silently drifts onward. The lone 
	silhouette of Jason emerges from within, taking the helm. 
	He's back.

							  FADE OUT/MAIN CREDITS.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. HARBOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY

	Only the faintest sign of daylight can be seen through a 
	thick blanket of gray fog. In the distance, speckled 
	lights outlining a smaller LUXURY CRUISE SHIP 
	intermittently appear.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY

	Standing at the boarding ramp is CHARLES MCCULLOCH, 
	clipboard in hand. He's just finished checking off a pair 
	of new-agey SENIOR GIRLS. McCulloch is approaching fifty, 
	wearing a tie and unwrinkled clothes, as well as the 
	disposition of a stern puritan.

				MCCULLOCH
		Remember girls, the shuffleboard 
		tournament will start at six p.m. 
		sharp. A non-attendance will restrict 
		your time in port, understood?

	They nod for his benefit, exchanging derogatory whispers 
	as they head up the ramp. Camera ADJUSTS to find a small 
	parking lot adjacent to the docks, where several cars are 
	just now arriving -- parents dropping off their high 
	school seniors, hugging them bon voyage.

	CLOSER ANGLE PARKING LOT

	as SEAN ROBERTSON walks toward the ship with pal MILES 
	WOLFE. Sean's a tall, nice looking, somewhat serious guy; 
	Miles is shorter, athletic and more extroverted.

				MILES
		You're telling me this boat has a pool 
		with a three meter board?

				SEAN
		It's a ship and that's right. Plus a 
		disco, gym, game room and a lot more.

				MILES
		I think I'm gonna blow off New York 
		and just stay on this thing.

				MCCULLOCH
		You'll do no such thing, Mr. Wolfe... 

	Camera ADJUSTS to reveal McCulloch, holding his list, 
	checking off their names.

				MCCULLOCH
		Your itinerary has been carefully 
		planned and make no mistake, it will 
		be executed accordingly.

				MILES
			(under his breath)
		Of course...wouldn't want to risk 
		enjoying this trip.

	McCulloch gives him a frown. Sean steps up to him 
	tentatively.

				SEAN
		Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. 
		McCulloch?

				MCCULLOCH
		Rennie's not coming.

	He's devastated.

				SEAN
		But I thought...

				MCCULLOCH
		She changed her mind.
			(eyeing list)
		Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom 
		one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are 
		in two-twenty-five.

	A booming VOICE from above interrupts them:

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON (O.S.)
		Sean -- where the hell have you been? 
		We're already into early departure 
		protocol...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Standing on the upper deck is a no-nonsense, uniformed 
	Navy man, ADMIRAL ROBERTSON. The captain of the ship. And 
	Sean's father. Sean's sadness about Rennie's absence is 
	immediately replaced with anxiety.

				SEAN
		Be right up, Dad.

	He and Miles head up the gangway, both boys giving 
	McCulloch one last glare.

	INT. '76 BMW 2002 - DAY

	Behind the wheel is MISS COLLEEN VAN DEUSEN, thirties, 
	attractive, a progressive attitude. RENNIE WICKHAM sits 
	next to her -- she's seventeen, pretty, slightly 
	withdrawn. Rennie's dog TOBY, a border collie, rides in 
	the back seat.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I'm glad you decided to come after 
		all.

				RENNIE
		Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles 
		will be.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		You let me worry about him, okay?
			(pause)
		Personal experiences are what fuel the 
		minds of great writers, Rennie. You 
		made the right decision.

				RENNIE
		What about not-so-great writers?

	Rennie smiles self-deprecatingly, Miss Van Deusen 
	grinning back. But Rennie's smiles are few and far 
	between, this one disappearing as she glances out the 
	window.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT)

	as the countless gallons of harbor and lake water spread 
	out before her, eery in the bog. A small ROWBOAT grazes 
	across it occupied by two indistinguishable people.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	Rennie's eyes show a hidden terror. She quickly turns 
	away, shivering briefly. Miss Van Deusen notices. She 
	turns a corner, heading into the parking lot.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Everything okay?

				RENNIE
		Just felt a little chill.

	Rennie rubs her arms, faking coldness.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Did you know that I'm giving up 
		teaching?

				RENNIE
		Really?

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Since the school is closing anyway, 
		I'm going to write that novel I've 
		been threatening on everybody.

				RENNIE
		That's wonderful, Miss Van 
		Deusen...what's it about?

	She parks the car, turning off the ignition.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		A senior class cruise to Manhattan, 
		laced with romance, adventure and 
		murder.
			(beat)
		Or a Gothic cook book. I haven't 
		decided which.

	She's coaxed the smile out of Rennie again. Miss Van 
	Deusen pulls a small wrapped box from her glove 
	compartment, handing it to Rennie, who seems utterly 
	surprised.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Go on, open it.

	Rennie pops off the lid, revealing an antique ink-dip 
	pen.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Stephen King supposedly used it when 
		he was in high school.

				RENNIE
		I don't know what to say...

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Rennie, you're the best student I ever 
		had...you have a real gift. If anybody 
		can make use of that pen, it's you.

	Rennie hugs her teacher. Camera RISES above the car's 
	window, finding a Mercedes 560 SL pulling in a short 
	distance away.

	CLOSER ANGLE - MERCEDES

	A sexy, money-dressed blonde is behind the wheel. TAMARA 
	MASON. She climbs from her leather seats as a trio of 
	SENIOR GIRLS walk by, offering enthusiastic hi's and 
	hellos. She's obviously Miss Popular. Tamara crosses to a 
	cute Japanese girl unloading luggage from a beige Honda, 
	EVA WATANABE.

				. TAMARA
		Are you ready for drugs, sex and rock 
		'n roll or what, girl?

	Eva gives her a warning glance, nodding to her left. 
	Eva's MOTHER appears by the passenger door, forcing a 
	smile at Tamara.

				MRS. WATANABE
		Hello, Tamara.

				TAMARA
		Hi, Mrs. Watanabe. Just kidding.

				MRS. WATANABE
		Yes, I'm sure.

	Embarrassed, Eva hurries to her Mom, rushing a kiss 
	goodbye.

				EVA
		Don't worry about a thing, Mom. I'll 
		have a terrific time and I won't do 
		anything stupid, okay?

	Before Mrs. Watanabe can squeeze a word in, her daughter 
	is gone. She waves a bittersweet goodbye to her graduate.

				MRS. WATANABE
		I love you...

	TRACKING WITH TAMARA AND EVA

	Once they're out of Mrs. Watanabe's earshot --

				TAMARA
		I hear the crew members are cute guys 
		in their twenties.

				EVA
		Really?

				TAMARA
		I'm sure we'll have no problem getting 
		them to party with us...especially 
		with this.

	Tamara unzips her purse, revealing a baggie filled with 
	fine white powder. Eva looks very nervous.

				TAMARA
		It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It 
		cost over a thousand bucks but it's 
		the best.

				EVA
		He bought you that?

				TAMARA
		More or less. It's part of my college 
		fund.

				

	She grins coquettishly, walking on. Camera HOLDS on the 
	calm, foggy harbor...where the faint image of a HOUSEBOAT 
	is aimlessly drifting into port.

	CLOSER ANGLE - HOUSEBOAT

	Sure enough, it's the same one we saw JASON on last 
	night...but no one is behind the helm. It seems to be a 
	ghost ship.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY

	as Tamara tries to slip past McCulloch, busy with another 
	pair of seniors.

				MCCULLOCH
		You can stop right there, Miss Mason.

	He motions the others onward. Busted. Tamara instantly 
	hands Eva her drug-filled purse, paralyzing Eva.

				MCCULL40CH
		Only graduating seniors are allowed on 
		this cruise.

				TAMARA
		What are you talking about?

				MCCULLOCB
		You never turned in your final biology 
		project, so I've had your diploma 
		rescinded.

				TAMARA
		You can't do that...

				MCCULLOCH
		It's already been done.
			(turning to Eva)
		Congratulations on the 3.9 average, 
		Miss Watanabe. You're in stateroom two-
		fifty-five.

	Eva smiles awkwardly, reaching for her luggage, stalling 
	to see what happens with Tamara.

				TAMARA
		Look, Mr. McCulloch, I got in a car 
		accident yesterday and missed our 
		appointment. It's okay, no big deal, 
		just a bruised arm...
			(squeezes her arm)
		...so I brought my project along 
		today. It's in my suitcase. Really.

	He looks at her suitcase, not buying a word of this.

				EVA
		She's telling the truth, Mr. 
		McCulloch. I saw her pack it.

	He's surprised to hear this...and so is Tamara.

				MCCULLOCH
		All right. But if it mysteriously 
		disappears en route, I'll have you 
		sent back home the minute we dock. 
		Understood?

				TAMARA
		Perfectly.

	She grabs her purse back from Eva, quickly moving on 
	before he changes his mind. Their voices become whispers.

				TAMARA  
		A major prick.

				EVA
		What are you going to do?

				TAMARA
		Improvise, of course.

	EXT. DOCK PILINGS - SAME TIME  

	as the HOUSEBOAT haphazardly bumps into barnacle-covered 
	dock pilings, still around fifty yards from the cruise 
	ship.

	POINT OF VIEW OUT HOUSEBOAT WINDOW

	The window is splattered with blood, but still clear 
	enough to make out Tamara and Eva walking up the gangway, 
	along with a half dozen other teenagers mingling on 
	board.

	TIGHT ON HOUSEBOAT'S ANCHOR CABLE

	--or rather the remnants of it. It's a piece of frayed 
	woven metal charred by extreme electricity, severed just 
	above water level. Suddenly there's blurry movement 
	behind it; camera RACK FOCUSES just in time to catch a 
	glimpse of JASON SLIPPING OFF THE SIDE, FLOATING TOWARDS 
	THE PILINGS.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE - SAME TIME

	as McCulloch impatiently checks his watch and list again. 
	Miss Van Deusen walks up to him.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked 
		in?

				MCCULLOCH
		Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never 
		showed up. I'm a little concerned.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Don't be. They probably decided to 
		explore each other rather than New 
		York.

	He gives her a disdainful look, starting up the ramp. 

				MCCULLOCH
		Let's go -- we're running two minutes 
		late.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Charles, there's someone else coming 
		along too.

	He stops, following her glance. His face tightens.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rennie is walking toward them with a small suitcase, her 
	dog Toby striding next to her. She walks up to him, 
	starts to say something, then decides against it. Rennie 
	heads up the gangway. HOLD on McCulloch and Miss Van 
	Deusen. He's livid.

				MCCULLOCH
		You have no right...

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		And neither do you. It's up to Rennie
		to decide what she wants to do.

				MCCULLOCH
		She doesn't know what she wants. She's 
		never had a stable life.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		And she sure doesn't have one now, 
		either. She needs to live.

				MCCULLOCH
		I'm her legal guardian, not you or 
		anybody else, and I alone know what's 
		best for her. End of discussion.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		No, I think it's just the beginning.

	She walks past him.

	EXT. RAMP/SHIP - ON RENNIE

	as she reaches the top of the gangway, her heart 
	pounding. Rennie pauses, working up the courage to look 
	out at the lake again.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

	The ROWBOAT she saw earlier is still there, even closer 
	now.

	RENNIE'S PUPILS

	contract, her blood pumping faster. Then she hears a 
	FAINT VOICE BELOW HER...

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Hhhhelp me...

	Rennie looks straight down at the water beneath her and 
	sees:

	AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY 

	floundering in the water. It takes us only a moment to 
	recognize him -- IT'S YOUNG JASON. He's gasping, sucking 
	in huge amounts of liquid, exactly like he did in the 
	prologue.

				YOUNG JASON
		Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...

	RENNIE

	leans back in terror, falling into Miss Van Deusen.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		What's wrong, Rennie??

	Rennie frantically points over the ramp edge, unable to 
	speak. Miss Van Deusen quickly looks and sees:

	MISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW

	The water is calm. No Young Jason.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	as Rennie gets a hold of herself.

				RENNIE
		I just got a little dizzy. I'm fine.

	She continues up the ramp. HOLD on Miss Van Deusen, 
	watching her go, somewhat troubled by it. RACK to 
	McCulloch below her, also watching. Extremely concerned.

	RENNIE

	continues along the starboard side, not risking another 
	glance overboard. She passes an older, very deranged DECK 
	HAND, mopping the deck. HOLD on him, his bloodshot eyes 
	following her like a crazed raven.

	INT. BRIDGE - CLOSE ON HARPOON - DAY

	Sharp and rusty, mounted on the wall amidst jagged 
	scaling knives, shark jaws and other artifacts. WIDEN to 
	reveal they are surrounding a navigational chart on the 
	cruise ship's bridge. Admiral Robertson and his CHIEF 
	ENGINEER are preparing for departure, checking the OMEGA 
	satellite computer as well as the LORAN.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
			(checking watch)
		Let's take in the brow.

				CHIEF ENGINEER
		Yes Sir.
			(into intercom phone.)
		Take in the gangway and single up all 
		lines.

	SEAN and MILES enter the room; Sean gets a glance from 
	his Dad. Miles is very impressed with the bridge.

				SEAN
		Hello, Dad.

				MILES
		Hey, Admiral Robertson. Love your 
		ship.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		She's a beauty, isn't she? I should've 
		retired from the Navy ten years ago.

				MILES
		You've really been generous to give us 
		this cruise. I know I speak for 
		everybody on board.

	Everybody...with the possible exception of Sean. He 
	avoids eye contact with his father.

				

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Hell, there's just twenty or so of you 
		-- we only need a skeleton crew and 
		it's a pleasure to sail her anyway.
			(beat)
		By the way, congratulations on winning 
		the intramural diving championships, 
		Miles. I'm sure you made your old man 
		proud.

	Admiral Robertson gives his own son a glance; maybe Sean 
	should think about doing the same.

				CHIEF ENGINEER
		Have you decided on your departure 
		protocol, Admiral?

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Actually, I thought I'd leave the 
		honors to my son.

				SEAN
		Dad, I don't think...

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
			(to Chief Engineer, ignoring 
			Sean)
		Relinquishing command of the Princess 
		Ruby to Captain Sean Robertson.

	Sean has no say in the matter. Miles can feel his 
	friend's nervousness as well.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		But before you take the helm, take 
		this.

	He tosses Sean a wrapped box. Sean opens it. Inside is a 
	navigational computer the size of a calculator, sitting 
	next to a rusty old sextant.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Something old and something new. I 
		used the sextant when I was your age, 
		but now they have these goddamn 
		computers to do all the work for you.

				CHIEF ENGINEER
			(to Sean)
		Have you decided on a plan of 
		departure, Captain?

	Sean's nervous. He eyes the Omega, quickly glancing at 
	the LORAN, briefly referring to the navigational chart.

				SEAN
		How about if we start up the forward 
		engines and come around. 180 
		degrees...

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Aren't you forgetting something?

	Sean looks flustered. Admiral Robertson storms to a 
	large button, pressing it three times, piercing the air 
	with three long blasts of the ship's horn. It 
	underscores his frustration.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		We're in foggy weather! Send out the 
		international maritime signal that a 
		vessel is backing down, followed by a 
		security broadcast warning other 
		ships!

	He shoves the mike out at Sean, but he doesn't grab it, 
	leaving the bridge, humiliated. There's an awkward moment 
	for Miles, unable to find any appropriate words. He exits 
	as well. Admiral Robertson stares out the bridge window, 
	saddened and frustrated. It wasn't supposed to go this 
	way.

	EXT. DECK - ON SEAN

	as he continues away, his retreat blocked by the DECK 
	HAND. The crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at 
	Sean.

				DECK HAND
		This voyage is doomed.

				SEAN
		Yeah, tell me about it.

	Sean sidesteps him, moving on.

	EXT. HARBOR - DAY (CRANE SHOT)

	Parents and relatives wave gleefully from the docks as 
	CAMERA RISES AND ROTATES to find eighteen or so teenagers 
	1ining the upper deck, happily waving back. The ship 
	begins to slice through serene water. The voyage has 
	begun.

	CLOSER ON HULL

	The water begins to ripple as the ship's speed increases. 
	All seems normal...until JASON'S HANDS APPEAR, CLINGING 
	TO A LOOSE MOORING LINE DRAGGING IN THE WATER. He 
	slithers up the side towards the deck as dense fog 
	breezes past him.

	EXT. DECK - DAY

	as Sean continues along, hands in pockets. He turns a 
	corner and collides with RENNIE, walking her dog. His 
	eyes instantly brighten, as do hers.

				SEAN
		Rennie...

				RENNIE
		Hi, Sean.

				SEAN
		I heard you weren't coming.

				RENNIE
			(glances at Toby)
		We changed our minds.

	Sean pats her dog. There's an awkward pause...they are 
	obviously in the early stages-of a relationship. 
	Sean reaches into his coat pocket, bringing back a small 
	necklace-sized box.

				SEAN
		I got you a present.

				RENNIE
		But I didn't get you one...

				SEAN
		Forget it. It's a dumb little thing 
		anyway.

	Rennie opens it up, exposing a petite silver necklace 
	with a Statue of Liberty pendant on it. She's touched.

				RENNIE
		Sean...it's beautiful.

	Sean takes it from her, snapping it around her neck.

				SEAN
		I thought maybe we could hike to the 
		top of the Statue when we got there, 
		if you felt like it. It's supposed to 
		be 22 stories tall.

				RENNIE
		I'd love to.

				MCCULLOCH (O.S.)
		Your father was looking for you, Mr. 
		Robertson.

	McCulloch appears behind them. The mood has been broken.

				SEAN
		I guess I'll see you later.

	Sean leaves. McCulloch steps up to Rennie, pointing out 
	to the foggy sea. Her respiration increases as she 
	psyches herself up to look.

				MCCULLOCH
		There's a storm predicted tonight. 

	Rennie looks at the ocean, forcing herself not to turn 
	away.

				MCCULLOCH
		You're making a big mistake, Rennie. 
		It's not too late to put you back on 
		land.

				RENNIE
		I'm staying.

				MCCULLOCH
		If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you 
		were of...

				RENNIE
		She didn't push me into coming.

				MCCULLOCH
		Why are you doing this to yourself?

				RENNIE
		I don't even know why I'm afraid, 
		Uncle Charles. I can't even remember 
		when it started. Don't you think it's 
		time I found out and got over it?

	He takes a measured pause.

				MCCULLOCH
		Facing your fear doesn't always 
		conquer it.

				RENNIE
		I'm staying.

	He's not going to change her mind.

	P.O.V. - RENNIE AND MCCULLOCH (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)

	through a porthole window...and through the viewfinder 
	of a video camcorder. McCulloch shakes his head, turning 
	away from Rennie and walking away. A sinister electric 
	guitar solo screeches out. PAN with McCulloch as he 
	passes the window, coming around 180 degrees into a CLOSE 
	UP of J.J. JARRETT, fingering a sleek Gibson "Flying V."

				J.J.
			(into camera)
		Is this axe awesome or what?

	INT. J.J.'S STATEROOM - DAY

	as J.J., a female rocker in the vein of band "Vixen," 
	continues to wail on her guitar. She's wearing a black 
	leather corset, with wildly teased deep red hair. Holding 
	the camcorder is WAYNE WEBBER, MTV-acclimated, wearing 
	the latest hip prescription glasses.

				WAYNE
		Too cool, J.J. Your parents came 
		through.

	She pops out the guitar cable from her practice amp.

				J.J.
		No lie. I hear there's a big power 
		room down below where I can get 
		supreme concert hall echo. Come down 
		and shoot a basement tape on me, okay?

				WAYNE
		Sure...but I gotta shoot some 
		shockumentary footage first.

	He avoids eye contact when he says it. She gives him a 
	look.

				J.J.
		Man, don't tell me you're still trying 
		to scam on Tamara...

	His non-answer means yes. J.J. walks over to him, 
	grabbing his cheeks, shaking them like jello.

				J.J.
		How long have we known each other? 
		Don't be a dweeb, Wayne. She's not 
		interested in you, only what you can 
		do for her. She's a user.

				WAYNE
		She's sexy.

				J.J.
		So's this guitar. So what?

				WAYNE
		I'll catch you later.

				

	He exits. She mumbles something under her breath, coiling 
	up her amp cord.

	INT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH WAYNE

	as he walks onward. DROP DOWN to find his FEET as he 
	passes a DARK ALCOVE...which happens to have SLIMY 
	FOOTPRINTS AND SEAWEED leading into it. Camera FOLLOWS 
	the footprints, RISING again and with dim recognition, 
	our eyes fall on JASON. Lurking in the shadows. But not 
	for long.

	INT. POWER ROOM - DAY

	Massive, very dark, backlit steam seeping from a maze of 
	pipes overhead. No windows. A wall of circuit breakers 
	and voltage meters decorate one wall, quietly humming 
	generators on the opposite side. J.J. appears with her 
	guitar, amp and ghetto blaster, appreciative of the 
	surroundings.

				J.J.
		This place is aching for a video. 
		Wayne, you're an asshole.

	She finds an outlet and plugs in her equipment.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	We're peering at J.J. predatorially through the steam, 
	moving through it, behind the generators.

	J.J.

	pops a cassette into her blaster, jamming the "play" 
	button. A loud rock 'n roll rhythm track blasts out.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	moving around the generators, eyeing her sleek leather 
	pants as she bends over to plug in her axe.

	TIGHT ON ELECTRIC GUITAR

	as J.J. snaps the male end of the plug into the female. 
	receptacle.

	JASON'S FACE

	appears for an instant through the vapor, then vanishes.
				
	J.J.

	screams out the opening licks of her solo in sync with 
	her playback. The generators are causing a breeze which 
	makes her hair dance, steam flowing between her legs. 
	She's lost in her music, building to a crescendo, bending 
	the high "E" string above the upper octave fret. She 
	opens her eyes with the pleasure of it and sees:

	JASON

	emerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare.

	EXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME

	as J.J.'s SCREAM echoes from an exhaust duct. WHIP PAN to 
	find the crazed DECK HAND standing just below it, 
	reacting with dread. He's the only one who has heard it.

	INT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME

	as Jason tears the guitar off her body, raising it in the 
	air like a hatchet. The horrified girl flees down a 
	narrow maze of steel steps, forced back against a 
	generator with nowhere to go. PUSH IN on her face for one 
	last look at her before:

	JASON

	swings the guitar downward and buries it in J.J.'s skull.

	EXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME

	as the Deck Hand flinches upon the thick, dull sound of 
	her demise, followed by discordant feedback from her 
	guitar...and eventual silence. He reaches into his breast 
	pocket, his hand shaking badly as he sips from a flask of 
	Early Times.

	EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (EFX)

	as LIGHTNING FLASHES over a gray, choppy sea. A storm is 
	imminent. The Princess Ruby finally appears, cutting 
	through whitecaps, no land in sight.

	CLOSE UP - INK DIP PEN

	as Rennie's hand carefully dips it in India ink, moving 
	to a blank page in her journal. She hesitates for several 
	beats.

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	No inspiration. She puts down the pen, looking at her 
	dog, who's curled up on the bed.

				RENNIE
		What do you think...time for some 
		personal experiences to fuel our 
		minds?

	The dog's eyes blink, but no more than that.

				RENNIE
		I agree.

	Rennie moves to her closet, finding a silk blouse and 
	some black satin pants.

	EXT. OUTSIDE DECK - SAME TIME

	Wind is picking up, sweeping thick mist past a row of 
	decorative flags. One of them flaps back...AND EXPOSES 
	JASON.

	THROUGH JASON'S EYES (FLYING WALL EFX)

	as the flag whips our faces. We MOVE through it, down the 
	empty passageway, coming to a porthole window. Rennie's 
	window. We peer through it with unnerving intensity at 
	the backside of Rennie as she pulls off her T-shirt, 
	slipping on the blouse. Camera continues through the 
	tiny round window, floating across the room, over Toby 
	and the bed...until we're INCHES FROM THE BACK OF 
	RENNIE'S HEAD. She suddenly spins around in fright, 
	facing us point-blank, and:

	REVERSE ANGLE

	Nobody is there, her porthole window empty. But there's 
	something surreal about the window...

	TIGHT ON PORTHOLE WINDOW (EFX)

	Empty grayness...then EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON FLOATS UP FROM 
	BELOW, BUBBLES ESCAPING FROM HIS LIPS. The porthole has 
	become a window into the depths of Crystal Lake.

	RENNIE

	feels her throat catch with terror and an instant later:

	DOG TOBY

	begins to bark vociferously, rushing to her cabin door, 
	scratching to get out.

	RENNIE'S EYES

	are distracted to Toby for a second; when she looks back 
	at the porthole, she sees:

	AN EMPTY WINDOW

	No water, no drowning boy.

	RENNIE

	snaps out of it, moving to the door, where her dog is 
	frantically clawing with his fur up.

				RENNIE
		Okay Toby, calm down...

	She's talking to herself as much as the dog. Rennie 
	closes the curtains on her window, then steps to her 
	door. She swings the door open for Toby...and exposes 
	an empty hall. Toby scrapes his way out of the room, 
	dashing off down the hall, snarling.

	INT. SHIP CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	as Toby runs straight toward us. PAN with him as he 
	rushes around a corner, leading us into a view of TAMARA 
	and EVA, disappearing down a staircase.

	INT. MENS GYM - DAY

	A strong seventeen year-old black kid, JULIUS GAW, is 
	going a few rounds with another senior boy who's clearly 
	losing the boxing match. Julius dances around him on the 
	mat like he's Mike Tyson, several other boys cheering 
	them on.

	REVERSE ANGLE - LOCKER ROOM WINDOW

	as Tamara and Eva step into view. Eva glances around, 
	feeling out of place in the men's locker room.

				EVA
		I'm not sure we're supposed to be 
		here, Tamara.

	A couple of skinny boys wearing only towels walk by. But 
	Tamara doesn't notice them, her face pressed up against 
	the glass, watching Julius.

				TAMARA
		Is that a muscular bod or what?

	Tamara puts on a sexy smile. The other boxer sees her 
	instead, instantly distracted. Julius lays him out with a 
	left-right-left combination. The onlookers applaud. 
	Julius pulls out his mouthpiece, giving Tamara a wicked 
	smile.

				TAMARA
		He's undefeated, you know that?
			(beat)
		Julius is the only senior I'd even 
		consider doing it with. If he wasn't 
		black, that is.

				EVA
			(awkward)
		My parents are open minded about that 
		sort of thing.

				TAMARA
		My stepmom couldn't care less, but 
		Daddy would have a shit fit.
			(lets it slip out)
		He might even pay some attention to 
		me.

	Tamara quickly puts up her veneer again, spotting 
	something.

				TAMARA
		Gorgeous guy at ten o'clock. Look 
		sensual.

	Both girls slip into instant sultry as a CREW MEMBER in 
	his mid-twenties passes them, wearing a tool belt. Very 
	masculine. He gives the girls a pleasant smile. Tamara 
	turns around to check out his back side.

				TAMARA
		I think it's time for some 
		recreational activity, girl.

				EVA
		Sounds good. I hear there's a 
		shuffleboard court on deck -- it might 
		be kinds cool...

				TAMARA
		You're joking, right?

	She wasn't, but Eva tries to act like she was. Tamara 
	walks on, Eva following.

	INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT

	as McCulloch steps from Rennie's room, looking very 
	worried. Wayne Webber passes by, his eye stuck in his 
	viewfinder. McCulloch yanks the camcorder away from his 
	face.

				MCCULLOCH
		Have you seen my niece anywhere?

				WAYNE
		Yeah, motivating downstairs, I think. 
		What's the problem, Mr. McCulloch?

				MCCULLOCH
		Senior predictions started five 
		minutes ago and she hasn't shown up.

				WAYNE
		Some of us don't want our futures 
		predicted.

				MCCULLOCH
		In your case I'm sure that's true.

	He brushes past Wayne angrily.

	INT. SERVICE AREA - NIGHT

	as Tamara drags Eva into a secluded service area, pulling 
	out her mirror, straw and baggie.

				TAMARA
		The night time is the right time. 

	Tamara hands the straw to Eva.

				EVA
			(nervous)
		No thanks.

				TAMARA
		What? Don't be a lightweight...this is 
		top dollar toot.

				EVA
		It's not that, it's just that...
			(beat)
		It I get caught, I'll lose my science 
		scholarship and everything.

				TAMARA
		You're talking to the prom queen, 
		Eva. Do you really think I'm going to 
		risk getting caught?

				EVA
			(a pause)
		I guess not.

				TAMARA
		Do you realize how many people would 
		kill to be sitting here right now? 
		Come on, it's grad night. You've got 
		your whole life to be uptight.

	Eva takes the straw.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	as we move down the corridor, in and out of shadows, 
	hearing giggles from Tamara and Eva up ahead. Jason's 
	coming...

	ANGLE - TAMARA AND EVA

	as Eva takes a nosefull, sneezing badly.

				TAMARA
		Is that unbelievable or what?

	Tamara giggles, getting ready to tap out another line. 
	But the snickering stops upon the sound of APPROACHING 
	FOOTSTEPS. They both look up, every muscle tensing with 
	fear as:

	RENNIE

	appears from the shadows, just as startled to see them. 
	It's not Jason at all. Rennie can't help noticing the 
	cocaine, trying hard to ignore it.

				TAMARA
		Jesus, you scared the hell out of us.

				RENNIE  
		Have you seen my dog? I think he came 
		this way.

				TAMARA
		No, we haven't.
			(awkwardly)
		Care for a hit?

				RENNIE
		No thanks.

	Rennie continues on. After she's gone...

				TAMARA
		A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll 
		narc on us...

				EVA
		I have her in Creative Writing and 
		she's fairly nice.

				TAMARA
		Nobody related to McCulloch can be 
		nice.

	Tamara puts the straw to her nose.

	ANGLE - RENNIE

	as she presses on, the corridor getting darker.

				RENNIE
		Toby?

	No reply. She walks on, turning down the left hallway... 
	but camera turns down the right hallway. Suddenly JASON 
	REVEALS HIMSELF, quietly stepping from the GAME ROOM. 
	He's holding a pool cue, which he proceeds to snap in 
	half, providing a splintery sharp shaft.

	INT. SERVICE AREA - SAME TIME 

	as Tamara finishes off her line, wiping her nose with a 
	sniffle.

				TAMARA
		Oh yeah. Ready to party and then some.

	She rolls up her baggie, stuffing it into her purse.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	as we come down a corridor, turning into the Service 
	Area, stomping right up to Tamara and Eva. They both 
	GASP; Tamara drops her mirror, which SHATTERS on the 
	ground.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	They are facing McCulloch.

				MCCULLOCH
		What are you doing in here?

				TAMARA
		Nothing.

	He eyes the broken mirror. He wasn't born yesterday.

				MCCULLOCH
		Are you girls using drugs?

				EVA
		Do you think I would use drugs, Mr. 
		McCulloch? We were just exploring the 
		ship.

	He doesn't want to believe Eva is a druggie. But Tamara 
	is a different matter. He levels his eyes on her.

				MCCULLOCH
		I'11 be coming around your stateroom 
		in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss 
		Mason. You'd better have your biology 
		project ready or I'm phoning your 
		parents.

				TAMARA
		They're out of town.

				MCCULLOCH
		Then I'll make sure you remain on 
		board while your classmates see the 
		sights.

	He's gotten to her with that one. McCulloch storms away.

				EVA
		What are you going to do?

				TAMARA
		Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... 
		but that little narcing bitch niece of 
		his is a different matter.
			(calculating)
		Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid 
		of the water...

	SPLASH!

	as a body pierces the surface of the deck swimming pool. 
	It's MILES, having just completed a dive from the high 
	board. Miss Van Deusen and several others stand at 
	poolside, giving him some applause.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Poetry in motion, Miles.

				MILES
		A half-twist short. I'll hone that 
		dive yet.

	He swims to the side, leading us to a view of Rennie. 
	She's very cautious about getting too close to the pool 
	edge as she approaches Miss Van Deusen.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Rennie -- I was just on my way over to 
		your room

				RENNIE
		Have you seen my dog anywhere?

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The 
		ship's only so big and there's 
		certainly no way off it, is there?

	She smiles reassuringly, but her words are less than 
	comforting.

	INT. SHIP CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH TOBY - SAME TIME

	as the canine continues to sniff out Jason through the 
	maze of corridors. TRACK with the dog as he slows his 
	pace, knowing he's getting close to something.

	TOBY'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM)

	Low to the ground, creeping past a steam vent which 
	obscures his vision, then turning down a metal staircase, 
	weaving into another passageway. Then with absolutely no 
	warning, A BODY FALLS FROM ABOVE, THUDDING DIRECTLY IN 
	FRONT OF US.

	TOBY

	rears back with teeth bared, but:

	THE BODY

	is quite dead: Toby is snarling at the corpse of the 
	TEENAGE BOXER who lost his bout against Julius. He's 
	still in his boxing shorts...BUT JASON'S SPLINTERY POOL 
	CUE HAS BEEN STABBED THROUGH HIS CHEST.

	EXT. DECK POOL - ON RENNIE AND MISS VAN DEUSEN

	as they walk along the edge of the pool.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		So, are you having fun yet?

				RENNIE
			(lying)
		Yeah...a lot.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I seem to detect a hint of 
		ingenuousness in your tone.
			(beat)
		In other words, level with me.

				RENNIE
			(a pause)
		There's something I haven't told 
		you...

	...But before she can begin the next sentence, Rennie is 
	shoved from behind.

				

	WATER ANGLE

	as she SPLASHES INTO THE POOL'S DEEP END.

	MISS VAN DEUSEN

	spins around, seeing Tamara standing there with Eva.

				TAMARA
		Wow, sorry...

	RENNIE

	flounders at the surface, nobody realizing the terror 
	she's experiencing. She's too scared to even cry for 
	help.

	MISS VAN DEUSEN

	isn't looking at Rennie, her attention on admonishing 
	Tamara.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Why on earth would you do something 
		like that?

				TAMARA
		It was an accident, I swear...

	Eva avoids eye contact, feeling awful. Sean comes walking 
	up, seeing Rennie.

				SEAN
		What happened?
			(to Rennie)
		Rennie, are you okay?

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

	She's can't even hear Sean, her vision being splashed by 
	the chlorinated water. She sinks under the surface, 
	turning around...AND COMING FACE TO FACE WITH YOUNG 
	JASON. The eight year-old corpse GRABS HER ANKLE AND 
	TRIES TO DRAG HER DOWN.

	SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW

	as Rennie sinks under the surface, all alone, thrashing 
	in terror.

	SEAN

	realizes she's in trouble. He immediately dives in after 
	her, pulling her to the pool's edge, where Miss Van 
	Deusen helps to lift her out.

	TAMARA AND EVA

	quickly move on.

				TAMARA
		That was truly excellent.

				EVA
			(feels like shit)
		Yeah.

				TAMARA
		Time to check out the waiters.

				EVA
		I think I'll pass. See you later, 
		okay?

				TAMARA
		But...wait a minute!

	Eva walks away. Tamara acts angry, but deep down she's 
	hurt.

				TAMARA
		Some friend you are.

	EXT. POOL SIDE - SAME TIME

	as Sean climbs from the pool to join Miss Van Deusen, who 
	is trying to comfort Rennie.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(to Sean)
		Bring her a towel, okay?

	Sean nods, hurrying off as others start to crowd around. 
	Miss Van Deusen looks up at them.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		She's fine -- everybody go back to 
		what you were doing.

	They disperse. Rennie slowly starts to cry, holding tight 
	to her teacher.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Care to talk about it?

	After a moment to compose herself...

				RENNIE
		I can't swim.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I gathered that.

	Rennie says nothing else. Miss Van Deusen knows she's 
	holding out.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I had a skiing accident in high 
		school, broke my left leg. It took 
		three winters before I would even look 
		at the snow again...but the solution 
		kept eluding me.
			(beat)
		I finally took lessons. I've never 
		broken a bone since.

				RENNIE
		It's not that simple.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Maybe not. But you're not telling me 
		everything, are you?

				RENNIE
			(long pause)
		Whenever I get near the water, I see 
		this young boy drowning. He tries to 
		pull me down with him.

	The teacher didn't expect this, taking a thoughtful 
	pause.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		When did this start?

				RENNIE
		About four years ago...at Crystal 
		Lake. I spent a few summers there with 
		Uncle Charles inbetween boarding 
		school.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		After your parents passed away?

	Rennie nods somberly.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Did you have an accident in the lake?

				RENNIE
		No. It was just a normal summer. I've 
		never been able to figure it out.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Only one young boy ever drowned in 
		that lake, and that was before you 
		were even born. His name was Jason 
		Voorhees.

	The name has triggered some deep memory...but the 
	recollection vanishes upon the sound of her uncle's 
	voice.

				MCCULLOCH (O.S.)
		Dear God...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as McCulloch rushes over to Rennie, seeing that she's 
	soaked. He's livid.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...

				MCCULLOCH
		Oh, I can see that. You've done a 
		wonderful job of supervising the kids, 
		Miss Van Deusen.

				RENNIE
		It wasn't her fault.

	He gets Rennie to her feet just as Sean runs back with a 
	towel. McCulloch grabs it from him, wrapping it around 
	his niece, facing both Miss Van Deusen and Sean.

				MCCULLOCH
		Stay away from her...both of you.

	He starts to lead her away. The crazy DECK HAND blocks 
	their path, slipping his flask away.

				DECK HAND
		He's come back and you're all going to 
		die.

	Rennie gazes at the Deck Hand, then back at McCulloch.

				RENNIE
		Just...leave me alone...

	She pulls away from him, hurrying off, confused and 
	frightened. McCulloch's retinas pierce the Deck Hand with 
	scorn. He checks his watch, then storms off.

	INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	as a loud, firm KNOCK punctuates the silence. Then comes 
	a sultry voice...

				TAMARA (O.S.)
		The door's open.

	McCulloch swings it open.

				MCCULLOCH
		I'm in no mood for any more stall 
		tactics, Miss Mason. Where is your 
		final project?

	REVERSE ANGLE

	as Tamara fills a pair of champagne glasses with a bottle 
	of Dom Perignon. She's wearing a full body robe.

				TAMARA
		Wouldn't you like a glass of champagne 
		first, Charles?

	He's about to lose his temper. McCulloch steps closer.

				MCCULLOCH
		Where did you get that alcohol?

				TAMARA
		I packed it. Just for us.

	EXT. DECK CORRIDOR - STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	as we approach Tamara's porthole window, peering through 
	it. We can't hear the words but we can clearly see the 
	people.

	INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

	as McCulloch takes the bottle from her, setting it down 
	on her nightstand.

				MCCULLOCH
		That's it. You're not setting foot off 
		this ship until we return home.

				TAMARA
		But I haven't even shown you my 
		biology project...

	Tamara unties her robe. PAN DOWN to the floor with it as 
	it softly piles at her bare feet.

	ANGLE - PORTHOLE WINDOW

	as the SHADOW OUTSIDE quickly blurs past the window.

	RETURN TO SCENE

	McCulloch is flabbergasted, too stunned to fully react. 
	Tamara is wearing a layered teddy, which she's beginning 
	to unsnap, exposing her lithe body...but that's not all. 
	Tamara has drawn all her major organs on her bare skin.

				TAMARA
		Take a closer look, Charles. I want to 
		make sure I labeled all my organs 
		correctly.

	EXT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	as we approach her door, still cracked open from 
	McCulloch's entrance. We get there just in time to see 
	Tamara slip her arms around McCulloch, planting her lips 
	on his, pressing her nubile flesh up against his stiffly 
	starched shirt.

	INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

	as she holds him tight. He finally breaks away in a fit 
	of anger.

				MCCULLOCH
		Oh, you've done it now. Not only are 
		you going home, I'll see to it that 
		you spend next year back in a high 
		school classroom!

	He storms for the door, swinging it open, coming face to 
	face with:

	WAYNE

	who casually lowers his camcorder.

				TAMARA
		I don't think so, Mr. McCulloch.
			(to Wayne)
		Did you get anything good?

	His eyes are unable to leave her nakedness.

				WAYNE
		Oh yeah.

	She quickly slips on her robe again, all business. 
	McCulloch realizes what has just transpired.

				MCCULLOCH
		You'll never get away with it.
			(eyeing Wayne)
		And you can forget about ever 
		attending any film school.
			(serious beat)
		You're both going to be very, very 
		sorry.

	He storms off. Wayne looks very, very nervous. Tamara 
	steps over to him, cuddling up.

				TAMARA
		Relax, Wayne. He won't risk doing a 
		thing.
			(beat)
		Can I have the tape?

	He pops the eject button, absently handing it over. Wayne 
	steps into her room, nervous and excited to be there. He 
	lifts the glass of champagne she poured for McCulloch.

				WAYNE
		This is going to sound supremely 
		lame...but I've had the major hots for 
		you since our sophomore year, Tamara.

	He gulps down the fizz. She forces a smile, stashing the 
	incriminating videotape.

				TAMARA
		That's sweet, Wayne. Look, I'd love to 
		chat but I'm really pressed for time.
			(ushering him to door)
		Let's try to get together later, okey-
		doke?

				WAYNE
		But I thought...

				TAMARA
		Thanks for the camerawork.

	And out he goes, the door shut in his face. Wayne stands 
	outside her room, realizing he's a major chump.

				WAYNE
		Wayne, you're an asshole.

	He despondently exits.

	INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME (STEADICAM)

	as Tamara heads for the bathroom, slipping off her robe. 
	She moves to the shower curtain and we're right behind 
	her. Her hand reaches up, grabbing the curtain, yanking 
	it back...

	Nothing is there.

	INT. LADIES RESTROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT (EFX)

	as Rennie enters, her eyes reddened. She moves to the 
	sink, looking at herself in the mirror. So much for the 
	silk blouse and satin pants, not to mention her soaked 
	hair. Rennie runs some warm water, rinsing her face.

	When she starts to fill her hands a second time, BLOOD 
	POURS OUT THE FAUCET INSTEAD OF WATER. Rennie gasps, 
	jerking up and seeing YOUNG JASON REFLECTED ON THE OTHER 
	SIDE OF THE MIRROR, SPLASHING IN WATER.

				RENNIE
		It's not real, it's not real...

	INT. TAMARA'S SHOWER - SAME TIME

	as water from the shower head SPLASHES CAMERA for a beat 
	before Tamara turns it off.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as Tamara reaches for her robe, slipping it on. Her body 
	paint has been washed off. 
	She steps from the shower, glancing in her vanity mirror 
	AND SEEING THE REAL JASON REFLECTED IN IT. Tamara spins 
	around, looking face to face with JASON IN HER BATHROOM. 
	Just as she SCREAMS:

	INT. LADIES RESTROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)

	Young Jason reaches out to grab Rennie, HIS FIST CRASHING 
	THROUGH THE MIRROR. Right when Rennie SCREAMS:

	INT. TAMARA'S BATHROOM - SAME TIME

	The real Jason SHATTERS TAMARA'S VANITY MIRROR WITH HIS 
	FIST. He grabs a sharp chunk of it, advancing on a 
	whimpering Tamara.

				TAMARA
		Please...please don't...

	Jason raises the shard above her and just as she 
	SHRIEKS...

	CLOSE UP - STEAM WHISTLE OF SHIP

	as it blasts loudly in the bleak stormy night. It begins 
	to rain.

	EXT. LADIES RESTROOM - NIGHT

	as Rennie comes rushing out, right into the arms of. 
	Sean. She clings to him, sobbing as the rain falls over 
	them.

				SEAN
		It's okay...you're going to be okay.

				RENNIE
		I want to go home. I want off this 
		ship.

	After a moment...

				SEAN
		Me too.
			(beat)
		Let's go talk to my Dad.

	He puts his arm around her, leading her toward the 
	bridge.

	INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

	as wind and rain pummel the bridge window.. Admiral 
	Robertson turns to his Chief Engineer.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Let's kick in the stablilizers, Mr. 
		Carlson, and get the seas off the 
		quarter. These kids are in for one 
		hell of a storm.

				CHIEF ENGINEER
		Yes Sir. Activating comfort cruise 
		mode.

	The Chief Engineer moves to a bank of toggle switches, 
	flipping a row of them.

	TIGHT ON NAVIGATIONAL CHART WALL - SAME TIME

	as a bloodstained HAND silently removes the rusty 
	harpoon hanging above the map.

	ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

	gets a reflective look in his weary eyes.

				ADMIRAL-ROBERTSON
		How olds your boy now, Carlson?

				CHIEF ENGINEER
		Nineteen months.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		A tremendous age. Take some advice 
		from a salty old man: don't push him 
		too hard.

	The Chief Engineer nods with a sympathetic smile as the 
	Admiral steps off the bridge, onto the stormy deck, 
	contemplating the sea. The Chief Engineer moves to the 
	radio/intercom console. He lifts a telephone, punching in 
	a three digit number. PUSH IN TIGHT ON HIS FACE.

				CHIEF ENGINEER
		This is the bridge. Approaching 
		weather suggests we secure the main 
		deck and...

	His sentence is sharply cut off, his head jerking from 
	excruciating, instant pain. 
	His mouth contorts with words no one will ever hear as he 
	stares into the face of:

	JASON

	holding the opposite end of the harpoon. He shoves it 
	forward with one more staccato jerk and:

	CLOSE UP - CHIEF ENGINEER'S BACK

	-- The harpoon's bloody, corroded tip pierces through 
	his once-white uniform.

	ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

	returns to the bridge as LIGHTNING flashes outside.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Better have them doublecheck the 
		lifeboat stations as well...

	Admiral Robertson stops cold upon the sight of Mr. 
	Carlson. He hurries over to him, kneeling down, freezing 
	as a pair of MUDDY FEET ENTER FRAME. Admiral Robertson 
	bends his neck upwards to face:

	JASON

	hovering over him, now clutching one of the scaling 
	knives.

	INT. BRIDGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	as Sean and Rennie walk up the corridor leading to the 
	bridge.

				RENNIE
		Can he really take us home?

				SEAN
		Not completing a voyage is against 
		everything he stands for. But I think 
		I can convince him to call a Coast 
		Guard cutter for you.

				RENNIE
		What about you?

				SEAN
		If I go with you, he'll never
		speak to me again.
			(beat)
		But I'm never going to live up to his 
		expectations anyway...so maybe it's 
		the right thing to do.

	He's made a big decision. Sean takes her hand as they 
	walk on.

	THEIR POINT OF VIEW

	moving closer and closer to the bridge door, having not 
	the slightest inclination of what's in store for them.

	SEAN

	knocks on the bridge door. No answer. He's confused. He 
	pushes the door open but something is blocking it. Sean 
	puts his weight into it, shoving hard.

	INT. BRIDGE

	as the door slides open, Sean stepping inside. His eyes 
	roil downwards upon seeing THE DEAD CHIEF ENGINEER, THE 
	HARPOON PROTRUDING FROM HIS BLOODY CHEST.

				SEAN
		Oh Jesus...Dad??

	Sean looks over at the helm...where his father is still 
	sitting in the swivel chair, his back to them. Silent. 
	Sean sidesteps the Chief Engineer's corpse, moving toward 
	his father as Rennie remains frozen in shock.

	SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW

	Slowly walking toward Admiral Robertson...at least he 
	thinks it's his dad because he's unable to see his 
	face. Is it Jason now wearing the uniform?? When he's 
	about two feet away from him...

	SEAN

	reaches out and swivels the chair around. It is his 
	father BUT HIS THROAT HAS BEEN SLIT. Sean staggers 
	backwards, uncomprehending, his senses overloaded. We 
	MOVE with him until he's backed into Rennie, clutching 
	onto him tightly.

				SEAN
		He's...he's dead...

	INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

	as Miss Van Deusen steps up to Rennie's door, gently 
	knocking.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Ronnie? I just came by to see how you 
		were feeling...

	No answer. She knocks harder...and it creaks open, 
	unlocked.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Rennie...?

	Suddenly the door is jerked from her grasp and swung 
	open. MCCULLOCH is standing on the other side of it.

				MCCULLOCH
		I thought I told you to stay away from 
		her.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(holds her ground)
		Where is she?

				MCCULLOCB
			(accusing)
		That's a very good question and I'd 
		appreciate an answer.

	A LOUD BUZZER blares out of an intercom speaker next to 
	their heads, causing the teachers to both jump. Sean's 
	unsteady voice immediately follows.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		Attention everybody, attention. This 
		is Sean Robertson...

	EXT. SWIMMING POOL - SAME TIME

	Miles is toweling off under the shelter of a gazebo as 
	Sean's voice blares out of a rain-pounded megaphone 
	speaker nearby.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		There's been...
			(swallows)
		What I mean is, this is an 
		emergency...

	Miles knows he can't be joking around. Wayne comes 
	walking by, covering his camcorder with his jacket.

				WAYNE
		Miles -- have you seen J.J.? She was 
		supposed to be jamming down in the 
		power room but...

	Miles gestures for him to be quiet, listening very 
	worriedly.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		Repeat, this is an emergency...

	INT. GYM LOCKERS - SAME TIME

	as JULIUS and two other senior boys finish dressing after 
	a shower, hearing Sean's words reverberate around them.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		I want everybody to meet on the 
		bridge...

				JULIUS  
		What the fuck is this?

	The others shrug, concerned.

	EXT. SHUFFLEBOARD COURT - SAME TIME

	The wooden shuffleboard disks are drowning in 
	precipitation. Eva stands alone in the rain, staring at 
	the court as Sean's voice continues.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		Stay calm, but get here as quick as 
		possible. Walk with a friend if you 
		can...

	Eva wipes the rain from her face, then walks away.

	INT. BRIDGE - ON SEAN

	trying his best to keep it together. He glances at his 
	dead father, still unable to believe it.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		God, I wish this was a joke, but it's 
		not.

	Sean slowly puts down the phone. He's lost in a daze. 
	Suddenly the SHIP LURCHES, a huge swell SPLASHING THE 
	BRIDGE WINDOW. Admiral Robertson's body falls from the 
	swivel chair.

				RENNIE
		What is happening???

	Sean regains his balance, moving to the computer console, 
	looking at the OMEGA and LORAN like he's never seen them 
	before.

				SEAN
		I don't know...we've gone off course 
		or something...

				RENNIE
		What do you mean???

	Another wave hammers the bow. She's in a state of awful 
	panic.

				SEAN
		I don't know what I mean! All's I know 
		is that there's no one guiding this 
		ship anymore...

	Sean is starting to lose it. The fear of the ocean 
	guiding her, Rennie rushes to him, gripping and shaking 
	him.

				RENNIE
		Can't you call for help??

	Sean tries to get a grip and assess the situation, pacing 
	frenetically.

				SEAN
		I think so. But we have to lower the 
		anchors so we don't drift any 
		further...

				RENNIE
		Where are they?

				SEAN
		The bow...front of the ship. There's a 
		hoist on each side that lowers them

	She starts to exit.

				SEAN
		I didn't mean for you to go!

				RENNIE
		Just radio for help, okay???

	She hurries out the door, working on terror-induced 
	adrenaline. Sean rushes to the radio console, depressing 
	the keying button, speaking into the mike.

				SEAN
		Mayday, mayday, mayday...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as JULIUS arrives with the others from the locker room. 
	They react to the dead bodies while Sean continues at the 
	radio.

				SEAN
		Please...can anybody out there hear 
		me??

	No response. WAYNE and MILES rush in.

				MILES
		Sean, what's going on?

	Then he sees the corpses. He needs no further answer.

				WAYNE
		Jesus Christ...

	He's too scared to even videotape it. Sean is bombarded 
	with questions as he tries to figure out the radio.

				JULIUS
		Who did this, man?

				WAYNE
		Is the radio even working??

				MILES
		Isn't there some international S.O.S. 
		thing you can do???

				SEAN
			(suddenly remembers)
		Channel 16...the distress frequency...
			(dialing knob)
		Mayday, mayday, mayday...this is the 
		Princess Ruby. Please, somebody 
		answer...

	EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (STOCK)

	as a COAST GUARD CUTTER tracks through stormy seas.

				RADIO OFFICER (V.O.)
		This is Coast Guard cutter Dallas. 
		What is the nature of your problem, 
		Ruby?

	INT. BRIDGE - ON SEAN AND OTHERS

	as they hear the voice, reacting, relieved and thrilled.

				SEAN
		The Captain and Chief Engineer... 
		they've been...they're dead.

				RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
			(a grave-pause)
		What is your location?

				SEAN
		I...I don't know...

				RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
		Is your ship equipped with Omega 
		satellite navigation or LORAN?

				SEAN
		Yes...

				RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
		The LORAN has a digital printout of 
		your latitude and longitude. Give me 
		the coordinates and we'll be there as 
		quick as we can.

	Sean hurries to the LORAN, reading the numbers.

	EXT. DECK - RADIO ANTENNA - SAME TIME (EFX)

	as LIGHTNING STRIKES above it in the night sky. Camera 
	slowly ADJUSTS to find the RADIO ANTENNA CABLE. A second 
	later, JASON'S HAND REACHES FOR IT, GETTING A FIRM GRASP.

	INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME

	as Sean hurries back to the radio, pressing it against 
	his spitless mouth.

				SEAN
		I've got the numbers.

				RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
		Give me the degrees first, followed by 
		minutes and sec...

	Suddenly his voice is CUT OFF, followed by STATIC.

				SEAN
		Hello? Are you there??

	No response. A lump sinks into everyone's throat.

	EXT. DECK - RADIO ANTENNA

	as Jason drops the cable he's just torn out, marching 
	onward.

	EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

	as McCulloch bursts onto the bridge, followed by Miss Van 
	Deusen.

				MCCULLOCH
		I demand to know what is going on...

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Oh dear God...

	She's seen the bodies. McCulloch follows her glance, 
	paling. He quickly takes charge, pushing through the 
	students.

				MCCULLOCH
		Where's the radio?

				SEAN
		It's...dead.

				DECK HAND (O.S.)
		You're all going to die.

	All heads spin as the deranged DECK HAND treads out from 
	a shadowy corridor.

				DECK HAND
		You're the last ones. He's come back 
		for you.

				MCCULLOCH
		What are you talking about?

	The Deck Hand takes a final swig from his flask, dropping 
	it with unsteady hands.

				DECK HAND
		Jason Voorhees.

	There is a collective, disconcerting silence triggered by 
	the infamous name.

				MCCULLOCH	 
		You're insane, old man. Jason Voorhees 
		has been dead for over thirty years.

				DECK HAND
		He walks this ship, here and now.

				MCCULLOCH
		A killer walks this ship indeed. And 
		it's certainly none of us...

	The crazed old man gets his drift. Everyone looks at him 
	suspiciously. McCulloch grabs a SCALING KNIFE off the 
	wall, taking a step towards him.

				DECK HAND
		You're the one who's insane!!

	The raving man flees back the way he came. McCulloch 
	raises the flare gun; Miss Van Deusen grabs McCulloch's 
	arm, stopping him.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		What are you doing??

				MCCULLOCH
		That lunatic has been spouting off 
		about Jason since we boarded... 
			(eyeing bodies)
		It's no coincidence.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		But that doesn't prove that he's the 
		one!

				MCCULLOCH
		Walking corpses are not real!

				JULIUS
		Yeah, well these dead bodies are sure 
		enough real.
			(to the others)
		I say we regroup and find this 
		motherfucker before he finds us. 

	There's a murmur; it makes sense.

				MCCULLOCH
		You'll do no.such thing and watch your 
		mouth, young man! I'm in charge here!

	They all look at McCulloch defiantly.

				JULIUS
		School's out, McCulloch.
			(to the others)
		Let's go.

	Julius walks off the bridge; all the seniors follow 
	except Sean.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Please everybody, stay here!!

	They don't listen. McCulloch starts to go after 
	them...and then it hits him:

				MCCULLOCH
		Christ...where's Rennie??

				SEAN
		She's...she's dropping the anchors. I 
		thought the Coast Guard could find us 
		easier if...

				MCCULLOCH
		What?? You sent her out there with a 
		murderer running around loose??

	EXT. DECK - NIGHT

	as Rennie moves past wet, empty lounge chairs towards the 
	bow. She passes a row of translucent windows. The first 
	three are normal...but the fourth has the SILHOUETTE OF 
	JASON ON ITS OPPOSITE SIDE. 
	He begins to stride parallel to her, then disappears 
	when the windows end and a wall takes over.

	INT. BRIDGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	as Julius and his followers continue on, passing Eva, 
	who's coming up from a staircase. She stops Wayne.

				EVA
		What's going on? I heard on the P.A. 
		system that...

				WAYNE
			(interrupting)
		The Captain's been murdered. The buzz 
		is that Jason might be on board.

				EVA
		Jason...Voorhees?

	She knows the legend as weld as everybody else. Wayne 
	nods gravely, moving to catch up with the others. Eva 
	rushes up to him again.

				EVA
		Have you seen Tamara?

				WAYNE
		No. And I'm not losing any sleep over 
		it.

				EVA
		But she might be in trouble...

				WAYNE
		So what else is new?
			(beat)
		Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude 
		to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise 
		up -- it's not hip to be her friend.

				EVA
		I don't care about being hip anymore.

	She means it. Wayne nods with understanding.

				WAYNE
		I'm sorry, but I've gotta find J.J.

	He hurries on.

	EXT. BOW - NIGHT

	as Rennie appears, fighting the wind and rain to get 
	closer to the anchor hoists.

	POINT OF VIEW THROUGH DECK WINDOW - SAME TIME

	--spying on Rennie like a wolf watching a lamb. We MOVE a 
	few windows down, getting a better view of her.

	REVERSE ANGLE - ON JASON

	deciding that the time is right to strike. His hand moves 
	to the bow entrance door knob, slowly turning it, pulling 
	it open.

	EXT. BOW - ON RENNIE

	moving closer to the right anchor hoist, her back to us 
	as well as Jason. She climbs behind the hoist, looking at 
	the consoles. Then suddenly a BARK.

				RENNIE
		Toby?

	She turns, catching a glimpse of her dog running down the 
	side of the deck. Rennie leaves the hoist, going after 
	Toby.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	through the crack in the door, watching Rennie 
	unexpectedly take off. He's about to move after her when 
	ha hears:

				EVA (O.S.)
		Tamara? Are you around here anywhere?

	Jason quietly closes the door. Rennie will have to wait.

	INT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH EVA

	as she cautiously walks along, poking her head in every 
	alcove.

				EVA
		Tamara?

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	moving down the same corridor, catching a glimpse of Eva 
	before she turns a corner and disappears.

	INT. HALLWAY/TAMARA'S STATEROOM - MOVING WITH EVA 
	(STEADICAM)

	Eva steps into the hallway outside Tamara's stateroom. 
	She walks up to Tamara's door, knocking on it. It swings 
	open, unlocked.

				EVA
		Tamara?
			(no response)
		I just want to talk with you.

	She steps into Tamara's room and we go in with her. The 
	quarters are empty. Eva stands there for a beat, confused 
	and scared. She's about to leave when a CREAKING SOUND 
	causes her to look back at:

	THE BATHROOM DOOR

	It slowly swings open...splashing Eva's eyes with 
	grotesque multi-images of Tamara: SHE IS HANGING ON THE 
	DOOR HOOK, HER BODY PIN-CUSHIONED WITH A DOZEN MIRROR 
	SRARDS.

	EVA

	shrieks, running back out the door...

	INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY

	...and sliding to a abrupt halt because JASON IS STANDING 
	AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY. He moves toward Eva like a 
	bulldozer. She turns a rapid 180 and sprints in retreat.

	RUNNING WITH EVA (HAND HELD)

	Gasping for oxygen, Eva has no time to even scream as she 
	flees from the monster, erratically turning down a spiral 
	staircase and running on.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM)

	chasing after her with the smooth determination of a 
	shark, never letting her get too far in the lead.

	INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - ON EVA

	Empty for a second, then Eva appears, weaving her way 
	through a maze of corridors and passageways. She races 
	past a sign directing passengers to "CLUB RUBY."

	ANGLE - JASON

	--entering the same corridor a beat after Eva exits it in 
	the direction of the disco. He tramples onward.

	INT. CORRIDOR/DISCO (STEADICAM)

	The thudding low frequency of a mesmerizing dance tune 
	precedes Eva as she tears open a door, entering the 
	corridor. MOVE BACKWARDS WITH HER as she rushes forward, 
	curving through the shallow passageway and emptying out 
	onto a high tech DISCO FLOOR. A flashing Star Wars 
	lighting system assaults her all directions along with 
	the music. She's all alone in here.

	TIGHT ON EVA

	The lights strobing across her face only accentuate her 
	terror. She spots another door on a small stage, rushing 
	to it. It's locked.

	CROOKED ANGLE - ENTRANCE DOOR

	as Jason enters the corridor, SLAMMING THE DOOR SHUT 
	BEHIND HIM.

	EVA

	decides this is the wrong place to be. She moves for the 
	corridor again and:

	JASON

	appears on the corridor steps for a brief second. The 
	spotlight goes black, then flashes on again. Now he's 
	gone.

	EVA

	backs away, sliding along the edge of the dance floor 
	like she's on a building ledge. Chaser lights and mirror 
	balls fondle her body as she moves as far away from the 
	point where she last saw him. But:

	JASON

	illuminates only ten feet from her, a crimson strobe 
	assaulting his hockey mask. She's on a collision course 
	with him.

	EVA  

	whirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the 
	sight of him. Camera SPINS with her in 360 degree arcs, 
	PUSHING IN on her face.

	EVA'S POINT OF VIEW

	spiraling counter-clockwise on the dance floor, flashes 
	of Jason materializing where she least expects to see 
	him. And getting closer. Finally at the point of 
	exhaustion:

	EVA

	stops, looking everywhere.

	EVA'S POINT OF VIEW

	He seems to be gone. She catches her breath...then 
	sensing his presence, she revolves a half-turn to face:

	THE HOCKEY MASK

	exploding under a pin spotlight, standing directly 
	before her. His forearms recoil with lightning speed as 
	he grips her throat...

	WIDE SHOT - DISCO

	Thundering music. Frantic lights. And Jason and Eva at 
	the center of it all. HER FEET ARE TWENTY-FOUR INCHES OFF 
	THE GROUND, KICKING MADLY AS THE LIFE IS BEING CHOKED OUT 
	OF HER. Finally Eva's legs go rag doll limp. Jason flings 
	her to the ground like a sack of flour. This dance is 
	over.

	EXT. DECK - NIGHT

	Rennie appears again, scanning her no-visibility 
	surroundings.

				RENNIE
		Toby? Where'd you go?

	No sign of her dog. She remembers her mission, heading to 
	the anchors again.

	EXT. BOW - CONTINUOUS

	as Rennie arrives on the bow, climbing into the left 
	hoist box behind the huge anchor cable.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	moving up to the bow door like Jason did before, cracking 
	it open, seeing Rennie from behind. And moving towards 
	her.

	RENNIE

	is oblivious as she reads the directions above the 
	controls.

	INSERT - HOIST LEVER (SECOND UNIT)

	as Rennie's hand grabs it, shoving it forward.

	INSERT - GREEN HOIST BUTTON (SECOND UNIT)

	A moment later, her thumb finds it and depresses it.

	INSERT - ANCHOR CHAIN (SECOND UNIT)

	as the massive black chain links thunder to life.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	He's now within ten feet of the unaware girl.

	RENNIE

	remains in the hoist box, making certain it is operating 
	correctly. A second later, we see the fleeting outline of 
	a HUMAN SHAPE appear behind her.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	Three feet from Rennie. She spins around to climb out of 
	the hoist box and GASPS.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	She's facing MCCULLOCH. He immediately reaches past her, 
	yanking the lever back to its center position, and:

	THE ANCHOR CHAIN (SECOND UNIT)

	grinds to a halt.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	as McCulloch faces her, angrily grabbing Rennie's arms, 
	shouting over the storm.

				MCCULLOCH
		You had me worried to death!

				RENNIE
		But Sean said...

				MCCULLOCH
		I'm the one you should be listening 
		to! Do you think dropping an anchor in 
		the middle of a storm makes any sense 
		whatsoever?

	She tries to find some defense, but McCulloch leads her 
	off before any wards come forth.

	CLOSE UP - EXERCISE MAT

	as a pair of SKEET RIFLES, three FIRE AXES, a FLARE GUN 
	and several POOL CUES are dumped onto the foam padded 
	plastic.

	INT. EXERCISE ROOM - NIGHT

	where Julius has gathered his small group of vigilantes, 
	including Miles and Wayne.

				JULIUS
		I managed to scrounge this shit from 
		the game room and hallways. Grab what 
		you want.

	Wayne takes one of the rifles; Miles grabs the axe.

				WAYNE
		What are you taking, Julius?

				JULIUS
			(flexes fists)
		Nothin'.

				WAYNE
			(dead serious)
		We're talking the possibility of Jason 
		Voorhees here.

	Julius pauses. He's not stupid.

				JULIUS
		Nothin' but this gun.

	He reaches down, picking up the other rifle. And they 
	move.

	INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY/RENNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	as McCulloch guides his niece down the hallway, swinging 
	her door open.

				RENNIE
		Can't we at least talk about it?

				MCCULLOCH
		I refuse to discuss this ridiculous 
		notion that a ghoul is terrorizing 
		this ship.

				RENNIE
		But what about the drowning boy I've 
		been seeing?

	He avoids eye contact. McCulloch takes her hand, ushering 
	her across the threshold. She's standing inside her room 
	now; he's in the hallway.

				MCCULLOCH
		Whatever you've been...imagining... 
		has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.
			(pause)
		I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's 
		all I care about.

				RENNIE
		I'm not staying in my room, Uncle 
		Charles.

				MCCULLOCH
		This isn't a request.

	He closes the door on her face, pulling out a key, 
	locking the dead bolt. She pounds on it from the other 
	side.

				RENNIE (O.S.)
		Uncle Charles!

	He ignores her, briskly walking away.

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

	as she throws her fists against the door a final time, 
	realizing it's futile.

	INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT

	Steam continues to seep from the maze of criss-crossing 
	pipes. Wayne appears on one of the catwalks. He's holding 
	the skeet rifle under one arm, using the sun gun off his 
	video camera to guide him.

				WAYNE
		J.J. -- you down here?

	CLOSER ANGLE

	as Wayne carefully lets his light guide him down the 
	precarious walkway. An unexpected blast of steam scares 
	the crap out of him, causing him to stumble.

	INSERT - WAYNE'S GLASSES (SECOND UNIT)

	--They slip off the bridge of his nose, skittering down 
	through the catwalk and pipes to God knows where.

	WAYNE

	lies helplessly on the metal grid work, realizing his 
	bleak predicament has just been squared. He pulls himself 
	to a standing position again.

				WAYNE
		We got a major problem, Wayne.

	WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW

	His vision now gives him shadows and shapes rather than 
	crisp images. He raises the gun and continues unsteadily 
	forward.

	POINT OF VIEW THROUGH GRID WORK

	as Wayne inches forward. Camera slowly PANS INTO A 
	PROFILE OF JASON, watching him from a catbird seat.

	WAYNE

	takes another step, almost tripping on a set of stairs 
	leading down to the next level. And when he arrives 
	there...

	WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW

	...A LARGE FIGURE STEPS OUT, HOLDING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A 
	KNIFE.

	WAYNE

	instantly raises the rifle and FIRES...

	WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW

	...and the body goes down. He's hit him!

	WAYNE

	stands there, breathing some relief. He gets an idea, 
	looking through his camcorder eyepiece. Wayne begins to 
	adjust the eyepiece diaptor.

	WAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)

	as the figure on the ground slips in and out of focus, 
	finally becoming crisp. WAYNE HAS SHOT A CREW MEMBER -- 
	the same good looking one Tamara and Eva ogled earlier. 
	He's holding a screwdriver from his waist band tool set, 
	not a knife.

	WAYNE

	slowly lowers his camera as his heart rises into his 
	throat.

				WAYNE
		No...

	He raises his camcorder again, hoping a second view will 
	reveal a dead Jason rather than this young man.

	WAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)

	He gets half his wish: a HOCKEY MASK NOW FILLS HIS 
	FRAME...but Jason is far from dead. Wayne catches a split-
	second glimpse of Jason's fist coming towards him, then 
	the camera is KNOCKED FROM HIS EYE AND THE WORLD BECOMES 
	DARK AND BLURRY.

	WAYNE

	screams, blindly running as fast as he can. He trips, 
	picking himself up, stumbling down the catwalk stairs. 
	Wayne makes it about ten feet before he stumbles over 
	something, bringing with it a harsh strum from an 
	ELECTRIC GUITAR.

	ANGLE - WAYNE'S FEET

	Sure enough, his left shoe is resting on the pickups of a 
	blood-streaked Gibson Flying V.

	TIGHT ON WAYNE

	--sprawled out on the metal floor. He gropes around, his 
	hands feeling something. It sends chills from his groin 
	up through his scalp.

				WAYNE
		No no no...

	REVERSE ANGLE

	Wayne's hands are touching J.J.'S BLOODY FACE, A LARGE 
	CRACK IN HER SKULL. He doesn't have time to scream or cry 
	because

	JASON

	hoists him off of J.J.'s body and flings him into:

	THE SHIP CIRCUIT PANEL (EFX)

	which shorts out with a fanfare of ELECTRICAL SPARKS 
	AND FIRE, INSTANTLY FRYING WAYNE.

	INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME

	as the overhead lights briefly flicker, then resume 
	normal operation. Sean stands opposite the navigational 
	chart, ping-ponging between it and the ship's 
	computers as Miss Van Deusen paces nervously.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		What was that??

				SEAN
			(very worried)
		I don't know.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(trying not to panic)
		What happens if we don't get control 
		of the ship, Sean? I want you to tell 
		me the truth.

				SEAN
			(beat)
		We could hit a reef, collide with 
		another ship...we could be out here 
		for weeks before anybody spotted us.

	They are suddenly jolted with a DOOR SLAM as McCulloch 
	storms onto the bridge.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Did you find Rennie?

				MCCULLOCH
		She's locked safe in her room, no 
		thanks to either of you.
			(like Sean isn't even in the 
			room)
		Has he brought it back on course yet?

	Sean doesn't look at him, still trying to assimilate the 
	wall of components.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		He's doing the best he can, Charles.

				MCCULLOCH
		He's the son of the Captain, for 
		Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able 
		to operate this thing!

	Sean closes his eyes, trying to keep from losing his mind 
	and temper. A fierce WAVE slaps the windows in front of 
	Sean's face, motivating him to get his shit together. He 
	checks the Omega and LORAN.

				MCCULLOCH
		Well?

	Sean doesn't answer, moving to the seat behind the helm. 
	His father's seat. Sean takes the chair, adjusting the 
	wheel, watching the compass. He studies a series of 
	buttons on the console.

	CLOSE UP - WALL OF BUTTONS

	We PAN across them, stopping on one labeled "FIRE ALARM - 
	DO NOT BREAK EXCEPT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY." Camera 
	continues around to find we are in the POWER ROOM, NOT on 
	the bridge. Our vision suddenly lands on JASON, staring 
	at the alarm button, considering. He glances back over 
	his shoulder.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)

	Wayne's body is NOW ON FIRE...AND THE BLAZE IS SPREADING 
	THROUGH THE ROOM.

	INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME

	as Sean makes up his mind, flipping several toggle 
	switches.

	INSERT - AUTO PILOT COMPUTER

	as Sean flips the last toggle and a green light 
	illuminates, indicating the AUTO PILOT is in effect.

	RETURN TO SHOT

				SEAN
		It worked...we're back on course!

	Sean feels his confidence instantly rejuvenated. Miss Van 
	Deuten immediately embraces him. But a fraction of time 
	later:

	TIGHT ON FIRE ALARM BUTTON

	Jason's fist SMASHES the alarm button...

	INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

	...and a LOUD SIREN cries out across the entire vessel. 
	The blood drains from Sean's face.

				MCCULLOCH
		What's that?

				SEAN
		The fire alarm...

	VARIOUS ANGLES ON BOARD SHIP - NIGHT

	as the shrieking alarm assaults the main deck, hallways 
	and corridors, giving Julius, Miles and Wayne deep 
	pause for thought.

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

	as the alarm bombards Rennie's ears like everybody 
	else's. She hurries to her curtained porthole window, 
	working up the energy to look outside. Rennie gets a grip 
	on them, FLINGING THEM OPEN. The DECK HAND'S CRAZED FACE 
	IS GAZING BACK AT HER. Rennie screams; a second later he 
	hurries off.

	INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

	as McCulloch tears open a cabinet door labeled EMERGENCY 
	FLARE GUN. The siren continues to blast.

				MCCULLOCH
		Can you shut that damn thing off??

	Sean moves to a bank of switches, his eyes darting around 
	for the appropriate switch. Miss Van Deusen sees 
	McCulloch remove the FLARE GUN from the cabinet.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		We already thought of that -- nobody 
		could possibly see it in this storm...

				MCCULIACH
		There's only one person who needs to 
		see it. And I'm going to find him.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		What about the fire??

				MCCULLOCH
		I doubt very much that one even 
		exists.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		What are you talking about?

				MCCULLOCH
		Use some common sense! Setting off a 
		fire alarm causes panic...the same 
		kind of panic caused by suggesting 
		Jason Voorhees is on board.
			(resolved)
		Enough is enough. 

	He marches out the door. Sean finds the alarm kill 
	switch, flipping it. The excruciating siren vanishes. He 
	grabs a pair of rain jackets, tossing one to Miss Van 
	Deusen.

				SEAN
		We have to get everybody together just 
		in case the fire's for real.

	Sean heads for the door, shoving it forward.

	EXT. DECK - ON DOOR

	as it slams open...and JULIUS steps out, not Sean, from a 
	different deck door. TRACK with him as he treads along 
	the side of the ship, skeet rifle raised.

	JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW

	walking past the lifeboat stations, the wind and 
	precipitation battering the small boats. With no warning, 
	AN OBSCURE FIGURE LEAPS OUT, GRIPPING AN AXE.

	JULIUS

	shoves the gun stock into his shoulder and takes 
	instantaneous aim...but he doesn't shoot. He slowly 
	lowers the rifle.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as MILES lowers the axe. They've just scared the shit out 
	of each other.

				MILES
		I'll take the upper deck.

	Julius nods. They separate. Neither boy notices the 
	smoke which is starting to emerge from a deck vent...

	INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX)

	Filled with black smoke. The fire is spreading 
	dangerously close to a series of hoses attached to a fuel 
	pump, leading to tanks below. A sign over them reads: 
	DANGER - FUEL TANKS.

	EXT. DECK POOL - NIGHT

	--steaming and far from calm as the weather blitzes it. 
	Miles appears, climbing a ladder to the upper deck level.

	POINT OF VIEW THROUGH LADDER

	Someone is spying on Miles from below, watching his every 
	step.

	EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

	as Miles arrives, axe raised. He pauses to regard his 
	surroundings, then moves on. RACK FOCUS TO FIND JASON 
	RIGHT BEHIND HIM, having followed Miles up the stairs.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Only darkness and rain for a beat, then Miles 
	materializes, curving around the gargantuan smokestack. 
	He passes us and we SWING AROUND, now looking at the back 
	of his head. He takes three more steps and JASON STEPS 
	INTO THE FOREGROUND. Miles senses his presence and JERKS 
	AROUND, RAISING THE AXE, BRINGING IT DOWN ON JASON'S 
	HEAD...

	...but Jason easily grabs the axe handle before it makes 
	contact, flinging it away.

	EXT. LOWER DECK - ON JULIUS

	He's pacing along when a clattering noise from above 
	makes him stop. Suddenly MILES' AXE THUDS INTO THE 
	MAHOGANY DECK NEXT TO HIS FOOT. Julius gazes at it, 
	jerking his head upward.

				JULIUS
		Miles??

	His answer is a LOUD CRACK OF LIGHTNING. At the same 
	time:

	RUNNING WITH MILES

	He's scrambling as fast as he can across the slippery 
	deck as the monster relentlessly pursues him.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	He's having no problem catching up to the defenseless 
	teenager.

	EXT. DECK STAIRS - SAME TIME

	as Julius zooms up them to aid his comrade.

	EXT. RADAR MAST - NIGHT

	as Miles slides up to the mast and begins scaling it. He 
	glances downward and sees:

	MILES' POINT OF VIEW

	Jason is right at his heels.

	MILES

	slips on a rung, regains control, and continues upward. 
	He makes it three more steps, almost at the uppermost 
	point when JASON GRABS THE BACK OF HIS COAT, TEARING HIM 
	OFF THE MAST.

	STUNT FREEFALL

	Miles cries out as he FREEFALLS BACKWARDS, somersaulting 
	and twisting like he's doing one of his better dives...

	CLOSE UP - MILES' FACE  

	...Empty space for a half-second, then MILES' FACE JOLTS 
	INTO FRAME with a look of ultimate agony. Something has 
	abruptly stopped his fall. Something quite fatal.

	EXT. DECK - ON JULIUS

	coming around a corner, stopping dead in his tracks, his 
	stomach wrenching as his eyes fall on:

	MILES (EFX)

	...who is staring right back at him with dead pupils. 
	MILES HAS BEEN HORRIBLY IMPALED OM A SHIP FLAGPOLE.

	JULIUS

	doesn't get the chance to grasp the reality of it because 
	JASON'S HAND GRIPS HIS SHOULDER, SPINS HIM AROUND AND 
	SLUGS HIM SQUARELY IN THE FACE. The force of it sends the 
	boxer REELING BACKWARDS OFF THE RAILING...

	EXT. STORMY OCEAN (TANK)

	...and Julius SPLASHES INTO THE ROUGH SEA. He's quickly 
	swallowed by the torrential waters.

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	as Rennie's HAND jiggles her doorknob again, confirming 
	that it's locked tight. RISE to find her desperate face; 
	she begins furiously pacing and we DOLLY BEHIND HER 
	...but Rennie stops cold upon hearing:

				YOUNG JASON (O.S.)
		Hhhhelp....me....

	Rennie whirls into a CLOSE UP, staring with disbelief at:

	YOUNG JASON (EFX)

	...who is standing on the oval rug in her stateroom, his 
	hands reaching out to her. But then comes the 
	inexplicable: THE OVAL RUG TURNS INTO LAKE WATER AND 
	JASON SINKS INTO IT. He's drowning in the middle of her 
	room, choking on murky water.

				YOUNG JASON
		Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...

	RENNIE

	stands frozen, feeling herself drawn to him like a 
	magnet. She crawls to the edge of her rug, which is now a 
	deep lake, and extends her arms to him.

	YOUNG JASON

	grabs her hand, pulling hard, then grinning wide.

	RENNIE

	feels the skin on her face crawling off her skull, her 
	eyes expanding because she's now looking at:

	HERSELF!

	Rennie is holding onto herself, about four years younger 
	in a bathing suit, drowning in the lake. YOUNG RENNIE.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		Hhhhelp....me....

	RENNIE

	screams with guttural fear, letting go of herself, 
	watching her younger self drown in the hole in her room.

	YOUNG RENNIE

	disappears under the surface of the water...which seconds 
	later CHANGES BACK INTO HER OVAL RUG.

	NEW ANGLE

	as Rennie moves away, tears rolling down her face, 
	utterly confused. She backs against the wall next to her 
	porthole window and THE REAL JASON'S FIST SMASHES THROUGH 
	THE WINDOW, GRABBING HER THROAT. Rennie struggles, 
	gasping for air as he attempts to strangle her.

	CLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND

	groping for a weapon to stop him, her fingers skittering 
	across her table like a spider.

	TWO SHOT - RENNIE AND JASON

	Her head is pulled taut against the wall just below the 
	porthole, with Jason's hideous mask framed in the 
	circular shattered window. She's slowly dying.

	CLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND

	Her movements slow as the oxygen leaves her system. But 
	Rennie's fingers miraculously find a recognizable object: 
	the ink-dip pen given to her by Miss Van Deusen. She 
	seizes it, getting a firm grip.

	CLOSE ON JASON

	as Rennie JABS THE PEN BACKWARDS, SENDING THE SHARP 
	INSTRUMENT THROUGH THE EYEHOLE OF HIS MASK. Jason 
	instantly releases her, reeling backwards.

	RENNIE

	sinks to the floor, scrambling on all fours to get as far 
	away from the porthole as possible. She makes it across 
	the room to her stateroom door just as:

	THE DOOR

	is SLAMMED OPEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE. She shrieks in 
	terror but it's SEAN who is standing there.

				SEAN
		Rennie...??

				RENNIE
			(pointing)
		The window...

	Sean rushes to the shattered porthole, looking out, 
	seeing nothing. He steps back to her.

				RENNIE
		I don't understand what is happening 
		to me...

	She breaks down; he holds her.

				SEAN
		It's gonna be okay...

	INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX)

	...but Sean couldn't be more wrong. The flames are 
	lapping at the fuel pump and hoses, furiously burning 
	down into the tank. A second later the whole thing 
	EXPLODES IN A BALL OF FIRE.

	EXT. SHIP HULL - UNDERWATER (EFX/MODEL?)

	as a huge HOLE is blown through the thick steel hull:

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

	The ship noticeably rocks from the explosion. Rennie 
	clings to him fearfully.

				RENNIE
		What is it??

	One second later, the lights begin to flicker.

				SEAN  
		The power room...

	INT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)

	as huge amounts of water rush in from a gaping hole in 
	the hull.

	INT. SHIP KITCHEN - SAME TIME

	as the overhead lights flicker over McCulloch. There's 
	some fear mixed with the anger as he grips his flare gun, 
	moving onward.

	PONT OF VIEW FROM KITCHEN OVENS

	Someone is crouched behind a massive convection oven, 
	spying on McCulloch.

	MCCULLOCH

	almost flinches when the lights die and he's plunged 
	into blackness. He moves forward, every step tentative. 
	He passes the convection ovens and we REMAIN on them, 
	spotting the frightened face of the DECK HAND in the 
	shadows. The deranged old man is very sober now, 
	clutching a LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE for defense.

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

	Sean paces feverishly in the blackness of her room, 
	trying to think, talking to himself.

				SEAN
		Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, 
		assess the damage and act 
		accordingly...

				RENNIE
		Is the ship going to sink??

	He returns to Rennie, the panic settling back in.

				SEAN
		I don't know.

	Her ultimate fear is staring her straight in the face. 
	Suddenly the dim blue lights flicker on.

				SEAN
		The emergency lights just kicked in...

	Sean makes Rennie look into his eyes. His words are meant 
	to convince himself as much as Rennie.

				SEAN
		We'll be okay. I want you to wait by 
		the lifeboats, just in case.

				RENNIE
			(terrified)
		I'm not going near any lifeboat!

				SEAN
		But Rennie...

				RENNIE
		I'm not!!

	INT. SHIP RESTAURANT ROOM - SAME TIME

	as Miss Van Deusen gathers a handful of students who are 
	panicking, sitting them down.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Everybody wait right here until I come 
		back with the others -- understand?

	They nod, frightened to death. She dashes away, carrying 
	us into a view of the dining room windows. No one 
	notices the SILHOUETTE OF JASON passing by on the outside 
	desk.

	INT. ENGINE ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)

	Sea water is pouring into the ship's motors. Clouds of 
	steam and black smoke fill the room as the engine 
	bearings begin to GRIND.

	INT. SHIP HALLWAY - SAME TIME

	as McCulloch rushes up to Rennie's already open door, 
	cautiously entering with flare gun raised.

				MCCULLOCH
		Rennie??

	MCCULLOCH'S POINT OF VIEW

	The room is empty, shards of the porthole glass scattered 
	across her rug. He steps over to it, bringing his head up 
	to the gaping hole, peering outside. We wait for his 
	attack...but it doesn't come. McCulloch's eyes take us to 
	something across the room. The bathroom door is afar.

	MCCULLOCH

	cautiously steps up to the door, silently grabbing the 
	knob and SWINGING IT OPEN. It's empty. He hears 
	something, spinning around. Again, nothing is there. 
	McCulloch quickly moves to the telephone and dials. A few 
	seconds pass.

				MCCULLOCH
		Come on, answer!!

	INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME

	TIGHT on the bridge telephone, ringing repeatedly. RISE 
	TO FIND JASON, ignoring the phone, scrutinizing the deck 
	below through rain-streaked windows.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	Miss Van Deusen is darting across the deck, gathering up 
	a trio of terrified seniors.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	Jason methodically moves to the bank of switches, 
	studying them.

	INSERT - CONSOLE

	In large, unmistakable letters over a red button are the 
	words "ABANDON SHIP ALARM." He flips back the plastic 
	safety cover, exposing the button.

	INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - SAME TIME  

	A horrible grinding sound echoes through the narrow 
	corridor. Sean and Rennie appear at the opposite end, 
	coughing on the black smoke which clouds their 
	passageway. Sean looks down, seeing that they are 
	standing in a puddle of water.

				SEAN
		Water has gotten to the engines.
			(coughs)
		We have to get everybody off this 
		ship...

	INSERT - ABANDON SHIP BUTTON

	as Jason presses it with firm deliberation, and:

	INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - CONTINUOUS

	A WHOOPING SIREN blasts through the passageway. Sean and 
	Rennie have no time to react because:

	ANGLE - CORRIDOR (EFX)

	A sealed compartment door EXPLODES OPEN WITH THE PRESSURE 
	OF SEA WATER...

	REVERSE ANGLE (EFX)

	...and a WALL OF WATER ENGULFS.RENNIE AND SEAN, KNOCKING 
	THEM DOWN. Sean fights to pull her up, but not in time 
	for her to witness:

	WAYNE'S CHARRED CORPSE (EFX)

	which bobs up in front of her. Rennie cries out, 
	scrambling to grab onto Sean as what's left of Wayne's 
	body washes past them.

	EXT. DECK - NIGHT

	as a door opens and Miss Van Deusen guides a half-dozen 
	SENIORS over to the LIFEBOAT STATIONS.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(shouting over storm)
		Everybody climb in!

	They follow her orders as the Abandon Ship alarm wretches 
	on. But little do they know that:

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	Someone is briskly moving towards the group and Miss Van 
	Deusen. Just as we are within a few feet of her... 

	REVERSE ANGLE

	--It's MCCULLOCH who's approached them. He grabs Miss Van 
	Deusen, shaking her violently.

				MCCULLOCH
		What did you do with Rennie??

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Nothing! I went to her cabin and...

	McCulloch rushes off before she can finish. Miss Van 
	Deusen turns back to the other kids, helping them into 
	the boat.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Everybody hurry...please...

	EXT. DECK - CLOSE ON MAHOGANY DECKING - SAME TIME

	We slowly DOLLY BACKWARDS until Miles' AXE comes into 
	frame, still stuck in the mahogany decking. A beat, then 
	JASON'S HALAL DISLODGES IT FROM THE WOOD.

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	as Sean climbs up from below, soaked to the bone, pulling 
	up a half-conscious Rennie. Sean carries her around a 
	corner, where he collides with McCulloch. McCulloch 
	pulls Rennie away from him.

				MCCULLOCH
		She never should've set foot on this 
		ship. This is your fault!

				SEAN
		This is Jason's fault!

				MCCULLOCH
			(shouting)
		Not another word, do you hear me??

	EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - NIGHT

	as Miss Van Deusen throws the "down" lever and the 
	lifeboat hoist begins to lower the boat. Camera SLOWLY 
	CREEPS IN A SEMI-CIRCLE AS A SILHOUETTED FIGURE STEPS 
	INTO A POOL OF LIGHT BEHIND HER. JASON.

	ANGLE - LIFEBOAT  

	One of the students screams, the others clinging together 
	upon the sight of this infamous monster. But the boat is 
	already over the edge, past the point of return. And 
	lowering at a snail's pace.

	MISS VAN DEUSEN

	turns to see JASON APPROACHING THEM WITH AXE RAISED. She 
	backs away but Jason ignores her, heading directly for 
	the hoist. He arches back with his weapon and SLICES 
	DOWNWARD.

	INSERT - HOIST CABLE (SECOND UNIT)

	as Jason's axe CHOPS THE CABLE IN TWO, and:

	EXT. SHIP/OCEAN (TANK)

	The bow cable SNAPS, DUMPING THE HALF DOZEN TEENAGERS 
	INTO THE TURBULENT SALT WATER. They last about five 
	seconds before succumbing to a drowning death.

	MISS VAN DEUSEN

	sees it all, her intestines constricting in agonizing 
	knots. She summons all her rationale and sends it down to 
	her legs, running away as fast as she can.

	MISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW

	--knocking down deck tables, chairs and chaise lounges as 
	she flees. The creative writing teacher swerves around a 
	column, heading for an interior door, sliding to a stop 
	as it BANGS OPEN IN FRONT OF HER. McCulloch steps 
	outside, carrying Rennie, with Sean right behind her. 
	Rennie is conscious now, squirming free of her uncle upon 
	the sight of Miss Van Deusen.

	ANGLE TO INCLUDE ALL

	as Rennie rushes into Miss Van Deusen's arms. The teacher 
	holds her, beginning to cry herself.

				MCCULLOCH
		Why aren't you with the others, 
		woman??

	Finally the message comes forth:

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Jason...he has an axe...

	His face grows taut with anger.

				MCCULLOCH
		Jason Voorhees is dead!!

	A PRIMAL SCREAM OF AGONY immediately cries out behind 
	them, the words unintelligible. They turn around to 
	witness THE DECK HANG STAGGERING TOWARDS THEM, GRIPPING 
	THE KITCHEN KNIFE. 

	MCCULLOCH

	raises the flare gun with zero hesitation and FIRES IT...

	ANGLE - DECK HAND (EFX)

	...and the charge EXPLODES INTO HIS CHEST. He stands 
	there with his chest smoldering, almost like a gargoyle 
	in effigy. A second later the poor old man falls forward, 
	and:

	CLOSE ON HIS BACK (EFX)

	They all see that JASON'S AXE HAS BEEN BURIED IN HIS 
	BACK.

	RETURN TO MASTER

	McCulloch gazes with utter disbelief.

				MCCULLOCH
		Dear Christ...

				SEAN
		We have to get off this ship!!

	They back away from the horrid sight and begin to run, 
	the Abandon Ship alarm still attacking their ears.

	EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - NIGHT

	as McCulloch, Miss Van Deusen, Rennie and Sean scramble 
	to the closest lifeboat.

				SEAN
		Everybody in -- I'll get the hoists

	McCulloch has no time for politeness, moving to the 
	lifeboat ahead of the women. Rennie stops cold, gazing 
	classy-eyed at the small boat.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Come on, sweetheart -- get in...

	But she doesn't budge. McCulloch levels wild eyes on her, 
	quickly climbing back down.

				MCCULLOCH
		Get in the boat, Rennie!

				RENNIE
		I...I can't...

				MCCULLOCH
			(shaking her)
		You can and you will!!

	He tries to slap her out of it, dragging her over to the 
	boat, ignoring her terror-stricken frenzy.

				SEAN
		Stop it!!

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Leave her alone, Charles!

	Miss Van Deusen quickly moves to a hysterical Rennie and 
	holds her, eyeing McCulloch vehemently.

	EXT. DECK - TIGHT ON DEAD DECK HAND - SAME TIME

	as rain begins to wash the blood from his back. JASON'S 
	FOOT TRUDGES INTO FRAME...then his HAND REACHES DOWN, 
	RETRIEVING HIS AXE FROM THE DECK HAND'S SPINE.

	EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - SAME TIME

	as Rennie clings to	 Miss Van Deusen, crying.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		It's the only way, Rennie. Let's get 
		in the boat now, okay? Please...for 
		me?

	Rennie finds herself nodding. Miss Van Deusen helps the 
	trembling girl up the steps, an angered McCulloch right 
	behind.

	INT. LIFEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	as Rennie climbs over the boat edge, RECOILING AT THE 
	SOUND OF A SNARLING DOG. Toby is curled up in the 
	corner of the lifeboat, teeth bared.

				RENNIE
		Toby...

	She climbs in, moving to her equally, relieved dog, 
	McCulloch and Miss Van Deusen right behind her.

	INSERT - HOIST BUTTON (SECOND UNIT)

	as Sean jabs it and the hoist motor kicks in.

	EXT. SHIP - WIDE SHOT (EFX)

	just as a huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING cracks over the smoke 
	stack and upper deck. JASON steps out from behind it, 
	gaping down on them with frightening omnipresence. 
	Gripping the bloody axe.

	EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - CONTINUOUS

	Sean climbs in the boat as it continues to lower. He 
	takes one look back at the ship and sees:

	JASON

	rapidly moving down the staircase towards them. Sean's 
	view is CUT OFF as the lifeboat sinks below deck level.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	as Sean's eyes dart around, down to the sea, up at the 
	hoist.

				SEAN
		Come on...faster....

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	trampling towards the hoist, about thirty feet away now. 
	The boat has already disappeared over the edge.

	EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the lifeboat continues to lower, about ten feet from 
	making contact with the tumultuous ocean. The ship's hull 
	is crooked and sinking.

	TRACKING WITH JASON

	as he relentlessly moves to the hoist cable, raising his 
	axe.

	EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA (TANK)

	as the ship finally touches water, and:

	INSERT - HOIST CABLE (SECOND UNIT

	Jason's axe blade CHOPS THE CABLE...

	EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA (TANK)

	...and the hoist cable falls limply over them. Jason's 
	too late. Sean looks up and sees:

	JASON

	standing by the hoist, hovering over the edge. Very 
	angry.

	SEAN (TANK)

	grabs an oar, turning back to McCulloch.

				SEAN
		Start rowing!!

	McCulloch takes the oar as Miss Van Deusen holds onto 
	Rennie tightly, the girl's eyes squeezed shut. Sean looks 
	up at the ship again, and:

	SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW

	Jason is none.

	EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA (TANK)

	Sean looks around with confusion as huge waves, wind and 
	rain pummel them.

				SEAN
		He's gone...

	POINT OF VIEW FROM WATER (TANK)

	...or is he? We're moving towards the lifeboat at water 
	level, almost like a shark preparing for attack.

	INT. LIFEBOAT (TANK)

	Sean breathes with some relief, resuming his rowing with 
	McCulloch. They get about three strokes apiece before:

	A DARK FIGURE (TANK)

	lunges from under the ocean surface, grabbing onto 
	Sean. Everybody SCREAMS...but it's JULIUS, gasping for 
	oxygen, spitting up seawater. Sean pulls him over the 
	edge.

				SEAN
		It's Julius!

	Miss Van Deusen moves to help him and we:

								 SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. STORMY OCEAN - WIDE SHOT - DAY (SECOND UNIT)

	The ship is gone now, the lifeboat a speck in the ocean.

	INT. LIFEBOAT - DAY (OCEAN?)

	The water is less rough now, the rain replaced with fog. 
	Julius has taken McCulloch's place behind an oar; 
	McCulloch is flanking his shivering niece with Miss Van 
	Deusen.

				MCCULLOCH
			(miserable)
		If we don't find the shore soon we're 
		all going to die.

	Sean tries to ignore him, keeping his mind on rowing.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(unable to hide fear)
		Do you know where we are, Sean?

	Sean pauses, utterly exhausted. He thinks for a moment, 
	remembering his father's gift. Sean reaches into his coat 
	pocket, removing the pocket navigational calculator. He 
	stares at it long and hard. Julius looks over at him, 
	seeing that Sean is on the verge of tears. He grips his 
	shoulder.

				JULIUS
		Hey man, if I can make it, so can. 
		you.

	Sean slowly nods, turning on the calculator.

								  SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the lifeboat rows into frame, the water relatively 
	calm.

	INT. LIFEBOAT - NIGHT (TANK)

	McCulloch, Rennie and Miss Van Deusen are asleep, Sean 
	and Julius rowing on sheer will power. Sean takes one 
	more stroke, feels himself passing out, then regains his 
	coherence again. Julius glances off the side of the ship 
	for no particular reason, then does a doubletake.

	JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.)

	They are rowing right past THE STATUE OF LIBERTY, 
	illuminated in all its glory.

	INT. LIFEBOAT (TANK)

	Julius feels his eyes widening and a huge smile taking 
	control of his haggard face. He tugs on Sean's sleeve, 
	his eyes never leaving the monument.

				JULIUS
		Hey man, wake up! Check it out!!

	The other stir as well, opening their eyes, not sure if 
	it's some kind of vision or if they are genuinely here.

				JULIUS
		God damn, we're in New York! You did 
		it, my man!!

	Julius howls with delight, Miss Van Deusen hugging Rennie 
	as Julius gives Sean the high-five. Toby barks.

	WIDE SHOT - NEW YORK HARBOR - NIGHT (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.)

	as the lifeboat rows toward the very famous skyline of 
	Manhattan, twinkling in the near distance. We can hear 
	the faint sound of Julius singing "New York, New York," 
	relieved to be alive. They're going to make it.

	EXT. EMPTY OCEAN - ANOTHER ANGLE (TANK)

	as the sound of Julius' voice grows fainter. The water 
	begins to ripple...then the top half of a HOCKEY MASK 
	BREAKS THE SURFACE FOR A BREATH OF AIR, SINKING AGAIN. 
	And swimming onward.

	EXT. CANNERY HARBOR - NIGHT

	as Julius and Sean row the lifeboat up to a narrow barge 
	beneath deserted dock warehouses. They are not in the 
	safest part of town by a longshot.

	CLOSER ANGLE

	as they climb onto the barge. Rennie breathes with relief 
	as she steps off the boat. She takes a final glance back 
	at it and sees:

	YOUNG RENNIE

	flailing her arms in the water right next to the 
	lifeboat, drowning.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		Hhhhelp...me....

	Suddenly a DECOMPOSED HAND REACHES UP FROM BELOW, 
	GRABBING HER, DRAGGING HER UNDER.

	EXT. BARGE - ON RENNIE

	She gazes in utter shock, screaming:

				RENNIE
		No!!!

	They all follow her eyeline...but the water is calm, 
	nothing there.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(holding her)
		It's okay...you're safe now...

	McCulloch grits his teeth.

				MCCULLOCH
		Come on -- everybody up the ladder.

	He's the first one up. Sean looks at Rennie, concerned, 
	then hoists Toby up in his arms. They all begin climbing 
	the ladder.

	CLOSE ON LADDER - NIGHT

	as the last pair of feet disappear over the top edge of 
	the dock. Camera PANS back down the rungs, finding the 
	lifeboat and barge again. Suddenly JASON SPRINGS FROM THE 
	WATER, CLIMBING ONTO THE BARGE. He gazes up at his new 
	surroundings, quite different from all the years he's 
	spent at Crystal Lake. But an item at the far end of the 
	dock causes him the longest pause...

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	A tattered billboard over one of the warehouses 
	advertises the NEW YORK RANGERS HOCKEY TEAM, featuring a 
	full shot of the HOCKEY-MASKED GOALIE.

	JASON

	looks at it long and hard. He tears off his life 
	preserver wits renewed ambition.

	WIDE SHOT - BARGE AND DOCK WAREHOUSES - NIGHT

	as Jason heads up the ladder. He's about to take 
	Manhattan.

	EXT. CANNERY WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT  

	as our survivors head into an isolated, foreboding group 
	of dock warehouses and alleys.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		There must be a phone around here 
		somewhere.

				MCCULLOCH
		A wonderful choice of places to dock a 
		boat, Mr. Robertson.

	Sean looks away, trying to keep from losing his temper.

	PREDATOR'S POINT OF VIEW - SAME TIME

	We're spying on them from behind a stack of crates as 
	they come in our direction. Waiting for the right moment.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	as they move towards the stack of crates. Without 
	warning, a PAIR OF GANG BANGERS JUMP OUT, BOTH HOLDING 
	GUNS. Nervous young druggies.

				GANG RANGER #1
		Hands up!!

				GANG BANGER #2  
		Do it!!

	All hands go up. Gang Banger #2 grabs McCulloch's watch 
	and wallet, skimming through a wad of bills and credit 
	cards while #1 keeps them covered.

				GANG BANGER #2
		Got some good shit here, holmes.

				GANG BANGER #1
			(eyeing Rennie)
		You got that right...

	He steps over to Rennie, brushing her hair back with the 
	barrel of his revolver, spotting the Statue of Liberty 
	pendant Sean gave her.

				GANG BANGER #L
		Now ain't that sweet.

	He tears it off her neck, pocketing it. Sean angrily 
	moves toward him and Gang Banger #l shoves the barrel 
	against Rennie's temple.

				GANG BANGER #1
		Go ahead, superman. Be a hero.

	Sean has no choice but to freeze. Julius flexes his 
	fists, but he too has Gang Banger #2's gun leveled on 
	him. McCulloch stares at the thugs with obvious contempt. 
	It doesn't go unnoticed.

				GANG BANGER #L
		You got a problem, Dad?

	McCulloch offers some rare silence, shaking a "no" to the 
	gun-toting kid. Rennie's dog-begins to growl, backing 
	away, ready to defend her. Gang Banger #1 points his 
	barrel at Toby with zero conscience, cocking back the 
	hammer.

				RENNIE
		No!

	She pushes his arm to the side just as the bullet 
	FIRES...

	ANGLE - TOBY

	as the bullet tears up asphalt next to the dog's paws. 
	Toby sprints off into the darkness.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	Gang Banger #1 grabs Rennie by the hair, brutally jerking 
	her head back.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Please, don't hurt her...

				GANG BANGER #L
		Hurt this princess?
			(beat)
		Would I do that?

	They cough out laughs. Gang Banger #1 looks into Rennie's 
	eyes, his barrel still on her skin.

				GANG BANGER #1
		You look like a party girl, princess. 
		How'd you like to go on a date with me 
		and my friend? If you're free, that 
		is.

	More phlegm-filled laughs. He drags her away, Gang Banger 
	#2 backing away with him with his gun still trained on 
	the others.

				GANG BANGER #2
		You follow and we'll blow her fuckin' 
		head off, comprende?

	The others watch helplessly as Rennie is abducted.

				JULIUS
		We can't let those gang-bangers get 
		away, man...

	Julius starts to move after them. McCulloch grabs him.

				MCCULLOCH
		You heard him! We have to call the 
		police

	Julius jerks away from McCulloch's grasp. But he knows 
	McCulloch	is right.

				MCCULLOCH
		Everyone split up -- we'll cover more 
		ground that way.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I don't think that's such a safe idea

				MCCULLOCH
		My niece's life hangs in the balance 
		right now!! Every second counts.

	No more rebuttal. They hurry off.

	EXT. GANG BANGER'S LAIR - NIGHT

	It's a narrow passageway between warehouses...decrepit 
	brownstones with shattered chicken-wire windows, moss 
	growing on the bricks. The Gang Bangers appear with 
	Rennie, dragging her down some concrete steps.

				GANG BANGER #L
		Welcome to the casbah, princess.

	PAN AROUND with them as they walk through a thick blanket 
	of STEAM which pours out of a factory vent. We MOVE 
	through the mist with them, revealing a tattered, rain-
	soaked couch and chair, upholstery shredded. A spool once 
	used for telephone wire functions as their coffee table. 
	They splash through puddles, throwing her down on the 
	couch.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	--looking back at the steam vent. JASON APPEARS IN THE 
	BILLOWING MIST.

	CLOSE UP - SYRINGE

	as a yellowish liquid squirts out the dirty needle. WIDEN 
	to find Gang Banger #2 holding it with transfixed eyes, 
	his compadre holding a squirming Rennie down on the 
	couch, tearing back her jacket to reveal a bare arm.

				RENNIE
		Please don't...

				GANG BANGER #1
		Loosen up, baby. It'll feel way
		better if you're stoned.

	CLOSE ON JASON'S FEET - SAME TIME

	Amongst the slime and cigarette butts is a discarded 
	syringe. Jason picks it up.

	CLOSER ANGLE - COUCH

	just as Gang Banger #2 jabs Rennie with the needle. 
	Gang Banger #1 wrestles off his torn leather jacket, 
	pushing Rennie back on the exposed foam padding as his 
	friend watches excitedly.

				GANG BANGER #1
		Slang us some more 'caine, JoJo. We're 
		in for a long night.

	Gang Banger #2 runs out the back way. #1 tears open 
	Rennie's blouse, his filthy mouth moving to her neck. 
	Rennie spits in his face. He hesitates not in SLAPPING 
	HER HARD.

				GANG BANGER #1
		It's your parade, princess. Can be 
		smooth or can be rough. Your choice.

	She closes .her eyes, trying to blot out what's about to 
	happen.

				GANG BANGER #1
		I think I'm in love.

	PUSH IN on his face as his neck arches down, bringing his 
	lips toward her chest. Just before contact he GRUNTS 
	THICKLY, HIS EYES BUGGING OUT.

	WIDER ANGLE

	Jason is standing right behind him, shoving something 
	into his back, out of frame. He thrusts it again, 
	bringing with it one more horrific grunt from the kid. 
	Jason goes for number three and: 

	CLOSE UP - GANG BANGER #1'S CHEST (EFX)

	Jason's syringe gets shoved completely through him, the 
	needle sticking out his front side.

	RENNIE

	opens her eyes, looking into the dead boy's face as 
	blood drips from his mouth. He collapses in front of 
	her, giving way to a view of JASON TOWERING OVER HER. At 
	the same time:

	GANG BANGER #2

	comes around the corner.

				GANG BANGER #2
		Forgot my money, holmes...

	Ha stops dead in his tracks at the sight of Jason.

				GANG BANGER #2
		Who the fuck are you?

	Jason paces toward him. The kid glances at his dead 
	friend arched over the couch, quickly whipping out his 
	.38.

				GANG BANGER #2
		You're dead, fuckhead.

	BANG!

	...but Jason keeps on coming. Five shots later and 
	Jason's still standing, easily picking up the slime ball 
	and SHOVING HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE MOSSY BRICK WALL. The 
	kid falls in a bloody heap.

	RENNIE

	shoves Gang Banger #1 off of her as Jason returns his 
	attention to her. She grabs a loose brick and FLINGS IT 
	AT HIM, CRACKING HIS HOCKEY MASK, momentarily 
	disorienting him. Rennie sprints away.

	EXT. ALLEY #1 - NIGHT (LONG LENS)

	as Julius runs into view, looking down a menacing alley, 
	spotting a phone booth. He hurries for it.

	PREDATOR'S POINT OF VIEW

	Like a cat watching a bird, we watch Julius head for the 
	booth.

	JULIUS

	slams open the booth door, grabbing the receiver, 
	punching the "operator" digit. SLOWLY PUSH IN on him as 
	he waits for an answer. Several more rings.

				JULIUS
		C'mon...

	Finally a click and muffled words from the operator.

				JULIUS
		Get me the police -- this is an 
		emergency...

				

	SMASH! as JASON'S FIST CRASHES THROUGH THE BOOTH WINDOW, 
	GRABBING JULIUS BY THE THROAT. Julius grips Jason's scaly 
	arm with all his strength, staring at the cracked hockey 
	mask framed in the shattered window. Julius summons all 
	his strength, tearing free of Jason's grasp and running 
	out the door. The phone is left dangling.

	RUNNING WITH JULIUS (HAND HELD)

	with no apparent direction. Literally running for his 
	life.

	TRACKING WITH JASON

	He's just as quick, but smoother and more methodical.

	JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (HAND HELD)

	heading up the alley, spotting a fire escape, diverting 
	his course straight for it.

	ANGLE - FIRE ESCAPE

	as Julius LEAPS ONTO IT, dragging himself up, climbing as 
	fast as is humanly possible.

	ANGLE - JASON

	...but Jason is-far from human, easily negotiating the 
	wrought-iron stairs and rapidly catching up.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

	as Julius' head appears, clawing his way onto the tar-
	papered surface, running to the opposite side. A second 
	later, JASON HOPS UP RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	as Julius soon learns the awful truth that the only way 
	up is the only way down...with the exception of a head-
	splitting freefall. No way is he gonna jump. Julius turns 
	back to Jason, raising his fists, psyching himself up for 
	the fight of his life. He whispers to himself:

				JULIUS
		Use the combos and keep the feet 
		light...

	THE FIGHT BEGINS, man against monster, each sizing the 
	other up. 
	Jason takes the first swing, Julius deftly dodging him 
	and countering with left-right-left combination. They 
	have absolutely no effect. Julius follows up with a round 
	of kidney punches. Again, nothing. Julius finds himself 
	being forced back against the rings, which in this case 
	is the edge of the roof. He risks a glance backwards and 
	sees:

	JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW

	It's a long, rough way down. It's do or die time.

	RETURN TO SCENE

	as Julius SLAMS PUNCH AFTER PUNCH INTO JASON, forcing him 
	back to the center of the rooftop, spending every last 
	ounce of his energy in doing so. He throws one more 
	feeble punch, knowing it's his last.

				JULIUS
		Take your best shot, motherfucker...

	Jason gladly obliges, winding up and recoiling with a 
	punch none of us expected...

	JULIUS' HEAD (EFX)

	gets literally knocked off his shoulders, cascading off 
	the edge of the rooftop, and:

	ANGLE - SLANTED LOWER ROOF

	--the decapitated head lands on a sloped roof below, 
	rolling down towards street level and falling into a 
	garbage-filled dumpster.

	EXT. ALLEY #2 - NIGHT  

	as Rennie dizzily runs down the alley, the effects of the 
	drugs kicking in.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

	Blurry, disoriented, erratic. Suddenly A FIGURE JUMPS OUT 
	FROM A CORRIDOR IN FRONT OF HER.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	It's SEAN. He rushes to her, sensing her disorientation.

				SEAN
		Rennie...what'd they do to you??

				RENNIE
		Drugs...
			(serious pause)
		Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.

	Oh Jesus. He never expected this.

				SEAN
		We have to find the others.

	Together they run off.

	EXT. ALLEY #3 - NIGHT (OVERHEAD ANGLE)

	as Miss Van Deusen briskly walks below us, far from 
	relaxed in this threatening environment.

	TRACKING SHOT

	She moves forward, the only sound being her shoes against 
	wet asphalt. Four more steps, then a DARK, OUT OF FOCUS 
	FIGURE STEPS OUT BEHIND HER WITH A GUN.

				VOICE
		Freeze.

	RACK FOCUS to find a uniformed IRISH COP standing there, 
	service revolver raised. McCulloch steps out from the 
	alcove as well, recognizing Miss Van Deusen.

				MCCULLOCH
		It's okay -- she's with me.

	She turns around, lowering her hands, utterly relieved.

				IRISH COP
		My apologies, Miss. My unit's right 
		over here.

	They head through an ABANDONED PARKING LOT towards a 
	concrete wall with stairs; about six feet above the wall 
	is an upper street, where his patrol car is parked. They 
	get halfway through the lot when they hear:

				SEAN (O.S.)
		Hey!

	REVERSE ANGLE

	as Sean and Rennie run to join them from the alley. 
	McCulloch rushes to his niece.

				MCCULLOCH
		Rennie, thank God...

	But Rennie goes to Miss Van Deusen instead. It's a bitter 
	pill for McCulloch.

				SEAN
		Jason's here in New York.

				MCCULLOCH
		Don't be ridiculous!

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Is it true, Rennie??

	She nods, unable to repress her fear.

				IRISH COP
		Is this the lass in question?

				MCCULLOCH
			(stewing)
		Yes.

				IRISH COP
		Who is...Jason?

				MCCULLOCH
		He's a walking corpse, a phantasm from 
		hell.

	The others stare at McCulloch angrily. Miss Van Deusen 
	turns to the confused policeman.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I'm afraid you'll have some trouble 
		believing us.

				IRISH COP
		So try me.

	EXT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT

	parked above the abandoned garage, the interior dark. The 
	Cop and our heroes appear in the background, coming 
	towards it.

				IRISH COP
		You're right -- I find it a tall tale 
		indeed. 
		But you seem like honest folks so I'm 
		inclined to believe at least some of 
		it.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(relieved)
		Thank you. The first thing we' have to 
		do is find Julius.

				IRISH COP
		I'm sure he'll pop up soon enough. Why 
		don't you climb in the back while I 
		radio for backup.

	ADJUST INTO A FULL SHOT OF THE BACK DOOR AS HE SWINGS IT 
	OPEN...but even in this darkness, we see that it's 
	empty. They climb in. The Cop opens his drivers door, 
	and...

	INSERT - DOME LIGHT (SECOND UNIT)

	The car dome light blinks on, and...

	ANGLE - BACK SEAT

	Our four survivors' faces are brightly illuminated, 
	INSTANTLY CHANGING TO GASPS AND SCREAMS because:

	THEIR POINT OF VIEW (EFX)

	Julius' severed head is resting on the dash board, 
	staring back at them!!!

	ANGLE - COP

	reacting to their terror, seeing Julius' head, quickly 
	grabbing the radio mike. But he has no time for a message 
	because JASON REACHES UP FROM THE PARKING LOT PIT BELOW, 
	GRABBING THE COP'S ANKLE, DRAGGING HIM DOWN. The radio is 
	still in his grasp.

	INSERT - DISPATCH RADIO (SECOND UNIT)

	as the radio cord grows taut, finally snapping. The 
	Irish cop's awful yell echoes over it, silencing after a 
	sick THUD.

	INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

	The foursome instantly try to flee the car, but police 
	cars have no door handles in the back.

				SEAN
		There aren't any handles!!

	Cocaine flowing through her veins, Rennie acts 
	hyperkinetically, scratching her way over the seats just 
	as:

	JASON

	appears at the parking lot stairs, STALKING STRAIGHT 
	TOWARDS THE CAR.

	INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

	There is no time for escape. Rennie finds the ignition 
	and fires it up, jamming it into drive and STOMPING ON 
	THE ACCELERATOR. Julius' head rolls off the dash, onto 
	the floorboards.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

	Her vision is still a stoned one but clear enough to set 
	her target. We come straight at the abominable creature 
	and:

	WHAM! (EFX)

	Jason is mowed down.

	RENNIE

	slams on the brakes, jerks it into reverse and FLOORS IT 
	AGAIN.

	CLOSE ON JASON (EFX)

	as the automobile grinds back over him a second time.

	RENNIE

	stomps on the brake pedal and the tires SCREECH TO A 
	HALT. They all take a moment to catch their breath, 
	looking out the front window...

	THEIR POINT OF VIEW

	Jason lies dead on the asphalt. For about two seconds. He 
	SLOWLY STANDS.

	RENNIE

	desperately throws it into forward again, gripping the 
	wheel and RACING FORWARD.

	POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)

	Jason's standing there for one second, but the next 
	moment he is LEAPING OUT OF THE WAY...

	EXT. ABANDONED PARKING LOT (STUNT DRIVE)

	...and the squad car SMASHES THROUGH A CHAIN LINK FENCE, 
	FREEFALLING TO THE ABANDONED PARKING LOT BELOW.

	EXT. ALLEY #3 - CONTINUOUS (STUNT DRIVE)

	as the car bottoms out, then swerves into a sharp right 
	turn, racing down the alley.

	POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)

	as Jason appears at the end of the alley, blocking their 
	retreat.

	INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

	as Rennie stomps the brake pedal, jerking it into 
	reverse...

	EXT. ALLEY #3 - CONTINUOUS (STUNT DRIVE)

	as she backs up, changes gears and races down an 
	intersecting alley.

	POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)

	speeding towards an escape when JASON POPS OUT AGAIN! 
	He's everywhere all at once...

	INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

	slamming on the discs one more time, flooring it into 
	reverse.

	CLOSE ON TIRES - CONTINUOUS (SECOND UNIT)

	as the squad car's rear tires smoke and spin, finally 
	gripping pavement.

	POINT OF VIEW OUT REAR WINDOW (STUNT DRIVE)

	as we fly backwards...and JASON APPEARS BEHIND THEM!!

	TIGHT ON REAR VIEW MIRROR

	--Rennie's terrified face filling it, seeing that Jason 
	is in back of them.

	TIGHT ON REAR TIRES (SECOND UNIT)

	as they screech to a halt one final time, rapidly 
	rotating in the opposite direction and speeding out of 
	frame.

	INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

	Rennie is almost maniacal now, her knuckles white around 
	the vinyl wheel, her foot practically mashed through the 
	floorboard.

				MCCULLOCH
		Rennie, for God's sake slow down!!

	She doesn't hear him, or anything for that matter. Her 
	eyes remain straight ahead, never blinking.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

	There's a FIGURE standing in the distance. But it looks 
	too small to be Jason. We RUSH TOWARDS IT, CHANGING INTO 
	SLOW MOTION JUST BEFORE IMPACT. The figure is a dripping 
	wet boy with a sinister smile. YOUNG JASON.

	EXT. BRICK WALL - A SPLIT SECOND LATER (EFX)

	as the front of the squad car RAMS THE BRICK WALL HEAD-
	ON, THE HOOD BURSTING INTO FLAMES.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as the front passenger door is shoved open by Sean, who 
	drags out Rennie. McCulloch follows close behind, helping 
	Sean carry her away from the wreckage, over by a row of 
	old oil drums filled with slime and rainwater. Then it 
	suddenly hits Sean...

				SEAN
		Miss Van Deusen...

	He takes two steps back to the car when:

	BOOM! (EFX)	

	The squad car interior is ENGULFED IN A BALL OF FLAMES.

	RENNIE

	opens her dazed eyes, seeing Miss Van Deusen's body 
	charring inside the wreckage. It's incomprehensible. She 
	numbly gets to her feet, stepping towards it. Something 
	makes her hesitate: she peers down at the asphalt...

	EXT. ASPHALT - RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

	A pool of gasoline has collected, flames dancing across 
	its glassy surface. Suddenly a TINY ROWBOAT DISSOLVES IN, 
	not unlike the lifeboat she was so afraid of. The 
	rowboat glides across the surface of the burning 
	gasoline, TWO PEOPLE RIDING IN IT. The flames and asphalt 
	SLOWLY FADE OUT AND GIVE WAY TO A SERENE LAKE.

	RENNIE'S FLASHBACK - CRYSTAL LAKE - DAY

	Shimmering water, clouds and pine trees reflected in it. 
	The rowboat floats into view. The two occupants are YOUNG 
	RENNIE and MCCULLOCH. She's wearing a bathing suit and an 
	innocent smile. And not an inkling of fear about the 
	water. She stands, letting the sun soak into her.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		What a beautiful day.

				MCCULLOCH
		Perfect for a swim, isn't it?

	She frowns at him, looking away.

				MCCULLOCH
		You've been coming out here every 
		summer for the last three years, young 
		lady, and you still haven't learned 
		how.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		I'll take some lessons this time. I 
		promise.

	She bends over, splashing the water.

				MCCULLOCH
		That's what you said last year. I 
		think the time for your first swimming 
		lesson has just come.

	The splashing stops.

				MCCULLOCH
		You don't want to end up drowning like 
		that Voorhees boy, do you?

	She's instantly tense.

				MCCULLOCH
		He never learned how either and he's 
		still at the bottom of this lake.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		He is not.

				MCCULLOCH
		Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull 
		down anybody who falls in and can't 
		swim.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		You're telling a lie.

				MCCULLOCH
		Am I? Let's find out.

	...And quicker than she's able to react to it, MCCULLOCH 
	PUSHES HER OVERBOARD.

	SPLASH!

	as Rennie's body violently disrupts the calm surface. 
	She immediately begins to flounder. McCulloch calmly 
	leans over the edge.

				MCCULLOCH
		Better swim before Jason drags you 
		down, Rennie. Come on, you can do 
		it...

	...but Rennie thrashes in the water, struggling to keep 
	from sinking under the surface.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

	Her uncle's face blurs and clears as water splashes her 
	eyes.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		I...I can't...

				MCCULLOCH
		You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!

	RENNIE

	is too panicked to obey.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		Hhhhelp...me....

	She coughs on some water then disappears...

	UNDERWATER (TANK)

	The world above her ceases to exist, murky lake water 
	taking over. Rennie looks-down, and to her horror...

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (TANK)

	Young Jason is grabbing her ankle and dragging her 
	down. The whole image BURSTS INTO FLAMES and we:

								  DISSOLVE BACK TO:

	EXT. ASPHALT - NIGHT

	as the gasoline continues to burn, the rowboat gone. 
	ADJUST to find RENNIE'S FACE, the flames of the car 
	wreckage flickering over her glassy eyes. She looks up at 
	Miss Van Deusen's body one last time before:

	ANGLE - SQUAD CAR (EFX)

	The auto's fuel tank EXPLODES, SHRAPNEL FLYING 
	EVERYWHERE.

	EXT. ALLEY #4 - CONTINUOUS

	She looks up at her uncle with knowing eyes. Eyes that 
	tell him she's remembered everything.

				RENNIE
		You pushed me...

				MCCULLOCH
			(defensively)
		I was only trying to teach you. But I 
		pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your 
		life.

	Rennie just stares, incredulous.

				SEAN
		You son of a bitch...

	She lets it build until she's ready to explode...then:

				RENNIE
		He was down there!!!

	And Rennie runs off. McCulloch starts to follow but Sean 
	grabs him, shoving him down.

				SEAN
		You keep away from her!

	Sean chases after Rennie. Camera methodically PANS BACK 
	TO MCCULLOCH, crumpled on the ground. A very bitter man. 
	He wipes his hands, getting ready to stand when THE 
	SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. His skin fades to porcelain white.

				MCCULLOCH
		You...are...NOT POSSIBLE.

	But possible, and actual, he is. A PAIR OF ROTTED ARMS 
	EXTEND DOWN, RIPPING HIM OUT OF FRAME.

	TRACKING WITH JASON

	as the walking corpse lifts a screaming McCulloch over 
	his head, carrying him over to one of the scum-filled OIL 
	DRUMS, SHOVING HIM HEAD-FIRST INTO IT. Jason grips 
	McCulloch's thrashing legs as bubbles rise to the surface 
	of the slime, a pathetic gurgling reverberating out the 
	drum. At last McCulloch's appendages go limp. Jason 
	releases him, moving on.

	EXT. ALLEY #5 - NIGHT

	as Sean runs into view, glancing around, spotting Rennie, 
	crouched against a crumbled brick wall. No tears...only 
	hate. Sean sits down next to her. After several 
	moments...

				RENNIE
		I was at school when they told me. 
		'Rennie, we have some very bad news... 
		your parents have been killed in an 
		auto accident.'

	Sean gently takes her hand, sharing her internal agony.

				RENNIE
		It seems like everybody I care about 
		ends up...

	She can't finish. PUSH IN as Sean kisses her on the 
	forehead, then makes her look into his eyes.

				SEAN
		Not this time.

	He caresses her face; it develops into a tender kiss. 
	Finally she holds him back, letting it out. At the same 
	time:

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	Somebody is creeping at a low angle towards them.

	SEAN AND RENNIE

	are lost in their shared quiet moment...until the 
	GROWLING SOUND becomes audible. They look up, seeing:

	TOBY

	cautiously approaching them. Rennie stands, absolutely 
	relieved.

				RENNIE
		Toby...

	She starts to move towards him and her dog SNARLS 
	VICIOUSLY, CROUCHING BACK IN FEAR.

				RENNIE
		What's wrong, boy?

	Another protective growl, then:

	CRASH!

	as Jason stampedes through a stack of crates and garbage 
	cans behind them.

	SEAN, RENNIE AND TOBY

	abruptly flee down the alley, Jason in mad pursuit.	

	EXT. ALLEY/SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

	as Rennie, Sean and the dog run straight towards us, 
	Jason swiftly catching up. FAST TRACK WITH THEM over to a 
	deserted, rain-slicked SUBWAY ENTRANCE.

	INT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS (EFX)

	as they bang through the glass doors, sailing past us. 
	Three beats later, JASON APPEARS, not bothering to open 
	the door, STAMPEDING RIGHT THROUGH THE GLASS.

	INT. SUBWAY STATION - ESCALATORS (N.Y.)

	Sean, Rennie and Toby sail down the escalators past a few 
	scattered COMMUTERS. Again, Jason appears, looming tall 
	at the top. He starts down the "up" escalator.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (ICY.)

	as an ELDERLY COUPLE rises toward us. Their reactions 
	grow more bleak the closer we get, finally registering 
	terror as we plow right through them.

	ANGLE - SUBWAY TURNSTILES (ICY.)

	Sean and Rennie hop over a metal turnstile, Toby crawling 
	under it. A TICKET TAKER leans out his window, shouting 
	at them.

				TICKET TAKER
		Hey!

	The teenagers are soon forgotten as JASON SMASHES THROUGH 
	THE TURNSTILE LIKE THE TERMINATOR, TEARING THE ALUMINUM 
	WHEEL RIGHT OFF ITS BASE. The Ticket Taker reacts 
	speechlessly, deciding not to press his luck.

	INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)

	as Sean and Rennie slide up to the edge of the track pit, 
	SEEING THE LIGHTS OF AN APPROACHING TRAIN which is taking 
	too long to get there.

				SEAN
		Come on...

	...but Jason arrives before the train. Toby barks and 
	snarls, trying to protect them. Jason is unfazed. He 
	treads toward them and:

	DOG TOBY

	leaps onto Jason, sinking his teeth into the monster's 
	throat. Jason wrestles the animal into submission just 
	as:

	THE SUBWAY TRAIN

	streaks into the station. A fraction of time later:

	JASON

	heaves the dog in front of the train.

	RENNIE

	shrieks in horror as Toby disappears inside the pit just 
	as the train roars by.

	ANGLE - ONLOOKERS

	They're New Yorkers, but not callous enough to stomach 
	this, quickly scattering. Even a group of severe 
	SKINHEADS decide they can wait for the next train, 
	quickly heading up the escalators after seeing Jason in 
	action.

	SEAN

	makes Rennie look away, dragging her with him along the 
	platform edge in retreat as Jason returns his attention 
	to them. They reach the end of the platform, having no 
	choice but to board the front car.

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN (N.Y.)

	as the doors whoosh shut...but Jason PRIES THEM OPEN. The 
	TRAIN ENGINEER glances back from his booth, seeing Jason 
	making the improper entry.

				TRAIN ENGINEER
		Hey pal, you can't do that...

	A second later he's gotten a good look at Jason. It's too 
	late for a retraction as JASON SAVAGELY JAMS HIS HEAD 
	INTO THE TRAIN CONSOLE.

	INSERT - TRAIN CONSOLE

	as the Engineer's arm KNOCKS THE THROTTLE FORWARD...

	EXT. SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)

	...and the train begins to move, racing into the black 
	tunnel.

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	as Rennie and Sean run for their lives, arriving at the 
	end of a car, jamming the separating doors open and 
	entering the next car. Jason follows right behind.

	INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	as the train thunders through the station without 
	stopping, baffling several waiting COMMUTERS.

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (N.Y.)

	--seeing Sean and Rennie disappear through another 
	connecting door. We storm our way through it into the 
	next car right after them. A handful of TRAVELERS cower 
	away from us.

	INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	as the train rapidly speeds past us, showing no signs of 
	slowing down.

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - FINAL CAR (N.Y.)

	as Sean and Rennie come through another set of separating 
	doors, rushing through... finding they're in the last 
	car. They look back, seeing Jason enter at the opposite 
	end. The monster stalks forward. Sean's eyes dart 
	around. He spots the EMERGENCY STOP CORD. HE LEAPS FOR 
	IT.

	EXT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	...and the train SCREECHES TO A HALT.

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)

	The sudden stop throws Jason on his back. Sean throws the 
	rear door open, jumping out with Rennie.

	INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	as Sean and Rennie sprint down the center of the tracks 
	toward the light of the next station, running out of 
	strength.

	INT. TIMES SQUARE STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	as they emerge from the darkness, up to the edge of the 
	pit. Sean boosts Rennie up, starting to climb up himself 
	when:

	JASON

	fires out from the tunnel, grabbing onto Sean's ankle. 
	Rennie screams as Sean is dragged down...but he manages 
	to latch onto a chain securing a garbage receptacle. 
	Jason pulls harder, stretching Sean to his limit as 
	Rennie watches helplessly.

				RENNIE
		NO!!!

	RENNIE

	runs straight towards the track pit like a football 
	punter, RECOILING WITH HER RIGHT LEG, KICKING JASON 
	SQUARELY IN THE FACE.

	JASON (EFX)

	trips backwards and LANDS ON THE THIRD, ELECTRIFIED RAIL, 
	RECEIVING TEN THOUSAND VOLTS. His body smokes and 
	convulses, finally sizzling out. He appears to be 
	terminated!!!

	ANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE

	as they get to their feet, holding each other tight, 
	looking down on the now-dead undead creature.

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.) (CRANE SHOT)

	as our heroes arise into the neon-filled big city 
	wonderland, relieved to be alive, gazing around at the 
	awesome spectacle known as Times Square. A huge DIGITAL 
	CLOCK tells us it's a quarter to midnight. Sean wraps his 
	arm around her.

				SEAN
		It's over, Rennie. It's finally over.

	Camera RISES ABOVE THEM, RACKING BACK TO THE SUBWAY EXIT. 
	Guess who has just made an encore...with more energy 
	than ever!!!

	SEAN AND RENNIE

	look all around them, having never been to a city as big 
	as this. They finally turn far enough around to spot 
	JASON in a series of three quick cuts, each one closer 
	than the last.

				SEAN
		God...please no...

	But Jason keeps on coming.

				RENNIE
		Somebody help us!! He's going to kill 
		us!!!

	But the heavy Times Square foot traffic ignores her, 
	bustling onward. Rennie and Sean have no choice but to 
	flee again.

	JASON

	shoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians; 
	they've certainly seen weirder characters than him here. 
	He moves past a group of STREET URCHINS listening to some 
	rap from their ghetto blaster. His foot obliterates 
	their stereo system with one stride. They instantly pull 
	out switchblades and chains.

				STREET URCHIN
		You're dead meat, slime bag.

	Jason stops, turning around, towering over the kids. He 
	has blood and gore caked everywhere, his skin charred 
	from the electrocution. Jason starts to remove his mask, 
	facing them squarely.

	TIGHT ON STREET URCHINS

	as Jason's mask comes off out-of-frame. Their tough faces 
	turn to putty, scared completely shitless.

				STREET URCHIN
		Hey man, it's cool, it's cool...

	They turn tail and race like the wind. Jason steps 
	forward so that we're looking at the back of his head, 
	never seeing his naked face. He slips his hockey mask on 
	again, turns into a CLOSE UP, then exits.

	INT. TIMES SQUARE DINER - NIGHT

	filled with noise, smoke and derelicts. A tough, 
	redheaded WAITRESS with a thick Brooklyn accent stands 
	behind the countertop, a wall of mirrors behind her. The 
	front door bangs open with the entrance of Sean and 
	Rennie, rushing up to the waitress.

				SEAN
			(out of breath)
		You have to call the police...

				RENNIE
		Please, hurry...

	A telephone sits right next to her, but this is New York.

				WAITRESS
		There's a pay phone in back.

	They start to run.

				WAITRESS
		...but it's broken.

				RENNIE
		You don't understand -- there's a 
		maniac trying to kill us!!!

				WAITRESS
			(blase)
		Welcome to New York.

	There's no time for further response as JASON CRASHES 
	THROUGH THE DINER DOOR, MOWING A PATH STRAIGHT TOWARDS 
	THEM. Sean and Rennie run out the back as the Waitress 
	eyes Jason with complete disbelief.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as the BURLY CHEF comes out to confront him. Jason FLINGS 
	HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE JUKEBOX.

	THE WAITRESS

	picks up the telephone, really pissed off.

	A BIKER

	climbs off his counter stool, revealing a HUGE BOWIE 
	KNIFE. Jason plows straight for him and the Biker STABS 
	JASON IN THE HEART. Jason has little reaction, pulling it 
	out, tossing it aside. The Biker's face goes wan, backing 
	away.

	THE WAITRESS

	stops in mid-dial. Fear is starting to register now.

	JASON

	lifts the very large man and EFFORTLESSLY HEAVES HIM INTO 
	THE MIRROR OVER THE COUNTER.

	THE WAITRESS

	feels the phone receiver slipping from her grasp, her 
	mouth trembling. She backs away from the beast as far as 
	she can. Jason has no time to waste on her, trampling out 
	the back after Rennie and Sean as the other patrons 
	shrink from him.

	INT. REAR OF DINER - SAME TIME

	as Sean fumbles to unlock three deadbolts and two chains, 
	finally getting the back door open and springing into:

	EXT. DEAD END ALLEY - NIGHT

	They run about ten yards before realizing the alley is a 
	dead end. Sean and Rennie start to head back the other 
	way when JASON MOWS OUT FROM THE DINER DOOR. Their vision 
	scatters everywhere in search of a retreat...

				RENNIE
		Look!

	She's spotted a MANHOLE COVER, slightly ajar. They 
	haven't the luxury of thinking about it, Sean sliding the 
	cover back as Jason comes forth.

	INT. SEWER - ENTRANCE CHAMBER - NIGHT

	as they descend into hell...a massive chamber consisting 
	of tall columns, slimy catacombs and three feet of 
	stagnant water. Their alternatives are nil; Sean and 
	Rennie join hands, wading through the swill, splashing 
	deeper into the labyrinth.

	ANGLE UP STAIRS

	as the dim streetlight glowing in the above world is 
	eclipsed by JASON, making his way down after them.

	INT. TUNNEL #1 - NIGHT

	An oval tunnel slanted downward into pitch blackness. 
	Dim overhead lights illuminate salt deposits and eery 
	rust formations. Rennie and Sean appear at the far end, 
	wading from the sewage as the tunnel rises toward us.

	TRACKING SHOT

	as they come forward at a brisk but cautious pace, 
	strangers in a very strange land.

	ANGLE - THEIR FEET

	sloshing through the slime. All is silent until Sean's 
	foot TRIPS OVER A BARREL labeled HUGHES CHEMICAL PLANT. 
	A vaporous green substance oozes out the rusty end of 
	the container, sizzling on the around.

	SEAN AND RENNIE

	carefully sidestep it, continuing on. They make it 
	another ten yards when A FIGURE LEAPS OUT FROM AN ALCOVE, 
	GRIPPING A HUGE WRENCH. Rennie's scream echoes through 
	the tunnel.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	...but it's a middle-aged SANITATION ENGINEER who lowers 
	the wrench, as frightened as they are.

				SANITATION ENGINEER
		What the hell are you kids doing down 
		here?

				SEAN
		Can you help us get out??

				SANITATION ENGINEER
		I sure can and we don't have a minute 
		to waste.

	He begins quickly packing up his tools.

				SEAN
		What do you mean?

				SANITATION ENGINEER
		Toxic waste, son. This sewer floods 
		out with the stuff on the 13th of 
		every month, right at midnight.
			(checks watch)
		And that's less than ten minutes from 
		now.

	Rennie looks down the dark tunnels in all directions, 
	swallowing hard.

				SANITATION ENGINEER
		Follow me.

	He clicks on his high powered flashlight and quickly 
	leads them down:

	INT. TUNNEL #2

	...no less threatening than the one they just left. When 
	they pass a lightless intersecting corridor, JASON EJECTS 
	HIMSELF FROM IT, TACKLING THE SANITATION ENGINEER AND 
	SEAN.

	THE FLASHLIGHT

	rolls through the muck, its beam splashing erratically 
	across the polluted walls.

	THE SANITATION ENGINEER

	begins BASHING JASON'S HEAD IN WITH HIS WRENCH but the 
	monster drags the kicking and screaming man into TUNNEL 
	#3.

	RENNIE

	tries to help up Sean but he's been knocked into the 
	opposite wall, barely conscious.

				SEAN
		Run, Rennie...

	She's struck with indecisive shock, looking into Tunnel 
	#3, seeing:

	A GRUESOME SHADOW ON THE WALL

	Jason arches his back with wrench in hand, hammering it 
	over and over into the Sanitation Engineer's skull.

	RENNIE

	backs away but does not run. The time has come to face 
	her fears.

	ANGLE - SHADOW ON TUNNEL #3 WALL

	as Jason takes one more vengeful stroke, finishing him 
	off. He steps from Tunnel #3 with the scarlet-coated 
	tool, his shadow becoming flesh. He moves straight for 
	Sean, who has no hope for escape. Jason cocks the wrench 
	over Sean's skull...and suddenly his hockey mask is 
	SPLASHED WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT. Jason stops, turning 
	directly into it.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	Rennie is blinding us with the sanitation Engineer's 
	flashlight, giving us only brief glimpses of herself in 
	the reflective wet surroundings.

				RENNIE
		You never got me in the lake, Jason. 
		And you're not going to get me now 
		either.

	Her voice is defiant. She carefully backstops, the 
	irritating light never leaving us.

	JASON

	has been sufficiently taunted. He moves after her.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	as the bright beam leaves our eyes, Rennie dashing down 
	the intersecting tunnel (#1).

	TIGHT ON JASON'S FEET

	stomping through the sludge, picking up speed. He's 
	wanted to kill Rennie most of all.

	INT. TUNNEL #L

	as Rennie dashes up to the HUGHES CHEMICAL DRUM Sean 
	tripped over, using the back end of the flashlight to 
	crush in the can's rusted lid. The metal is flimsy but 
	still resists her blows. She frantically hammers harder.

	INT. TUNNEL #2 - TRACKING WITH JASON

	He's moving like a freight train now, an addict rolling 
	after his fix.

	INSERT - CHEMICAL DRUM

	as the butt of the flashlight dents the metal, ultimately 
	causing it to cave in.

	INT. TUNNEL INTERSECTION - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	--Looking through his unblinking eyes, whipping into 
	Tunnel #1...where we catch a fleeting glimpse of Rennie 
	flinging the contents of the oil drum. A half second 
	later a WAVE OF GRAY/GREEN LIQUID FLIES AT US...

	TIGHT ON JASON (SLOW MOTION)

	and his hockey mask is SPLASHED WITH TOXIC WASTE, 
	SEEPING INTO HIS MASK'S EYE SLITS. He careens back as if 
	her were a rabid dog receiving a load of point-blank 
	buckshot.

	RENNIE

	drops the can, fumbling for the flashlight again.

	CLOSE UP - JASON (EFX)

	as the radiant flashlight beam finds his mask, the 
	plastic beginning to bubble and melt. RUSH INTO A TIGHT 
	CLOSE UP AS JASON TEARS OFF HIS MASK, EXPOSING HIS 
	HIDEOUS FACE: rotted flesh, some of it sizzling from the 
	chemical. Worms slithering out his nostrils. And his 
	eyes...or lack thereof. They're like two raw quail eggs 
	frying in liquid green pollutant...and the yolks just 
	broke, running down his face.

	CLOSE ON FLASHLIGHT

	as the beam begins to waver in her quivering grasp. RISE 
	TO FIND RENNIE'S FACE, reacting to the stomach-turning 
	sight of Jason's visage. She grabs hold of her senses and 
	RUNS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as Rennie skirts past the blinded creature: WHIP PAN WITH 
	HER as she turns down Tunnel #2, heading back toward 
	Sean. CONTINUE TO QUICKLY PAN AROUND until we've come 
	around 360 degrees and are back on JASON, in no way 
	ready to give up. He staggers after Rennie.

	INT. TUNNEL #2

	as Rennie skids up to Sean, still dazed. She grabs him, 
	shaking hard.

				RENNIE
		Get up, Sean!!!

	His eyes blink, only half coherent. Then an inconceivable 
	terror registers in her ears...A LOW, DEEP RUMBLING 
	SOUND, COMING FROM UP AHEAD. Her head jerks in the 
	direction of her planned retreat:

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

	An ominously empty tunnel, soon to be filled with the 
	unthinkable. The sound of RUSHING LIQUID is growing at 
	leaps and bounds.

	TIGHT ON RENNIE

	as her trembling chin rises, looking at:

	ANGLE - TUNNEL #3 CEILING (EFX)

	The dim overhead lights are beginning to vibrate from 
	the approaching flood.

	RENNIE

	rotates her head and sees:

	JASON

	vision or no vision, he is lurching towards her 
	relentlessly. She is literally sandwiched between hell 
	and high water.

	RENNIE

	drags Sean to his feet with the strength of a possessed 
	woman, pulling him over to a SERVICE LADDER attached to 
	the intersecting alcove wall.

				RENNIE
			(screaming)
		Climb!!!

	She shoves him up it from below, Sean summoning 
	everything he's got to obey her. Rennie shoots a stare 
	back down the tunnel...

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)

	The overhead lights are banging around like an earthquake 
	has just hit; the liquid will be arriving any second. Her 
	vision WHIP PANS 180 DEGREES TO FIND JASON APPROACHING 
	FROM THE OPPOSITE END, groping around with his scaly arms 
	like the claws of a roto-tiller.

	ANGLE - LADDER

	as Rennie starts up after Sean, looking down and seeing:

	JASON

	within ten feet of them, shifting directly for the ladder 
	like he's working on some kind of radar.

	RENNIE

	slips on the rusty ladder, regaining her footing. and 
	rushing higher. She takes her final glance into the 
	tunnel, the ultimate horror registering in her corneas as 
	she sees:

	INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)

	A million gallons of green-brown toxic waste splash into 
	the far intersection, FILLING THE TUNNEL, FLOODING 
	STRAIGHT FOR CAMERA.

	JASON

	has just started to climb the ladder when the wind and 
	smell of the rushing toxic waste bombards him. His 
	decomposed head swivels to face:

	INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)

	Tons of lethal sewage, stopping for no one. Arriving in 
	seconds.

	JASON'S FINAL CLOSE UP (EFX/FIBER OPTIC LENS)

	He doesn't need vision to confirm what his other senses 
	already know. Jason's mouth begins to quaver...AND THE 
	FIRST WORDS HE HAS EVER SPOKEN COME OUT, IN THE VOICE OF 
	AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY:

				JASON
		Mmmmmmmmmommy...DON'T LET ME DROWN, 
		MOMMY...

	Camera speeds toward his gaping mouth and DOWN HIS THROAT 
	as lightning arcs off his mucous covered insides. We 
	sink deeper into his guts, fire and smoke flaring into 
	our eves, eventually coming to a WELL IN THE PIT OF HIS 
	STOMACH, FILLED WITH BLOOD...and EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON IS 
	DROWNING IN IT.

				YOUNG JASON
		Hhhhelp me....

	A split second later:

	EXT. TUNNEL #3 (EFX) (SLOW MOTION)

	The wall of deadly toxic liquid ENGULFS JASON.

	INT. TUNNEL #3 - ON RENNIE AND SEAN (EFX)

	The powerful flood thrashes the ladder about two inches 
	below Rennie's feet, the force of it fiercely shaking 
	their rusty support. They are clinging to the ladder with 
	their eyes squeezed shut. Praying for survival.

	INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)

	We are drowning in a chunky cloud of sewage, rushing over 
	and under us.

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (EFX)

	The digital clock we saw earlier abruptly CHIMES 
	MIDNIGHT, HUGE BOLTS OF LIGHTNING CRACKING OVER 
	MANHATTAN.

	ANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE (EFX)

	as the sewage level begins to drop. Rennie opens her 
	eyes, glancing straight down and seeing.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)

	The ladder beneath them reappears...which gives way to a 
	PAIR OF HANDS GRIPPING THE BOTTOM RUNG. The liquid drops 
	further, unshrouding the now-dead corpse of EIGHT YEAR 
	OLD JASON. He's a relatively normal looking boy, 
	probably the way he looked back in 1957...right when he 
	drowned in Crystal Lake.

	Jason Voorhees has finally been put to rest.

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	Rennie and Sean stagger out from a side street, holding 
	each other up...relief etched in their matured faces.

				SEAN
		I hear there's a statue here that's 22 
		stories tall.

	Rennie would smile if she could. She kisses his cheek. 
	They amble on.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	...coming out from another alley, creeping up behind them 
	through a crowd of pedestrians. About the height of a 
	small child.

	RENNIE AND SEAN

	walk arm in arm, exhausted and oblivious to their 
	pursuer. But something, some innate perception causes 
	Rennie to slow...and stop. Her eyes register a horrid 
	fear and she WHIPS AROUND TO FACE...

	TOBY!

	Limping on all fours, filthy with grease-matted fur. The 
	whimpering dog crawls up to her, Rennie bending down, 
	hugging her animal like she'll never let go.

				RENNIE
		Oh Toby...

	HIGH ANGLE CRANE SHOT (N.Y.)

	as Sean bends down too, ruffling the dog's fur, standing 
	again with Rennie. The three survivors enter the collage 
	of pedestrians, bright lights and skyscrapers. 

	It is finally over.

								FADE OUT.

					THE END
FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN

	Written by Rob Hedden


	FADE IN:

	EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	A dark, rumbling sky. Haze clings to the lake as we float 
	across it, clearing to bring the opposite shoreline into 
	view. A few scattered streetlights. Dilapidated cabins. 
	An abandoned campsite. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE. 

	We continue to drift towards it, hearing the faint sound 
	of seductive music and an occasional giggle. A small 
	HOUSEBOAT floats into our foreground, its interior light 
	flickering as TWO BODIES move around inside.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

	A teenage boy and girl, JIM and SUZY, are slow-dancing. 
	Jim's lips softly touch her lissome shoulders.

				JIM
		Well...how do you feel?

				SUZY
		Ask me in about five minutes.

	She bites his ear, giggles, then kisses him fully..

				JIM
		I'm talking about graduation. Being 
		totally free to do whatever we want 
		now.

	Her hands slip inside his Pendleton shirt. He sighs.

				SUZY
		It feels excellent.

	Her mouth finds his again. After a long kiss, he gently 
	pulls away from her with a teasing smile.

				JIM
		Gotta throw the anchor over.

	He leaves the cabin. She slips under the bed sheets.

	EXT. HOUSEBOAT DECK - NIGHT

	as Jim tosses a small anchor overboard.

	TIGHT ON WATER SURFACE

	as the weighty object splashes, sinking into black 
	oblivion, pulling its cable down with it. 

	JIM 

	glances at the lake, at their eerie surroundings. He 
	feels a chill, heading back inside.

	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the anchor drifts to the lake bottom, dropping a few 
	feet from a THICK POWER CABLE which rests in the lake 
	silt.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

	as Jim returns with an uneasy expression. He crawls on 
	top of the bed, kissing her again, but not with the same 
	enthusiasm as before.

				SUZY
		What's wrong?

				JIM
		Nothing.

	He starts to pull off his shirt and join her. She senses 
	his anxiety.

				SUZY
		C'mon, Jimmy. Something's bothering 
		you.

	Jim pauses, turning off the mood music.

				JIM
		It's just that we're right around that 
		old summer camp where all those 
		murders took place.

	The boat creaks. She's instantly nervous.

				SUZY
		What murders?

				JIM
		Never mind, you don't want to know 
		about it.

				SUZY
		Tell me.

				JIM
		There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. 
		The guy's dead now, somewhere at the 
		bottom of this lake...if you believe 
		the stories.
			(beat)
		Let's drop it, okay?

	He starts to kiss her again. She stops him.

				SUZY
		What stories?

	He doesn't want to go into it but Suzy's face insists.

				JIM
		There was this boy named Jason 
		Voorhees who drowned in Crystal 
		Lake...

	FLASHBACK

	Eight year old JASON is desperately trying to tread 
	water, flailing his arms like a marionette to get 
	attention as he gulps down gallons of mossy lake water.

				YOUNG JASON
		Hhhhelp....me....I'm drowning...

				JIM (V.O.)
		None of the counselors heard him.

				YOUNG JASON
		Mmmmmmommy....

	...And Jason finally slips under the surface for good.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

				JIM
		A bunch of years went by and everybody 
		forgot about it.
			(beat)
		That's when the murders started.

	FLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK)

	as our senses are bombarded with QUICK CUTS of assorted

	teenagers just about to die, their screams echoing over 
	each other. We do not see the attacker. As the 
	cacophony reaches a screeching crescendo, CUT BACK TO:

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

	as the silence hits us hard again.

				SUZY
		Jason did it...?

				JIM'
		That's what some people thought. But 
		they were wrong.

	FLASHBACK (STOCK)

	as MRS. VOORHEES comes directly at camera wielding a huge 
	knife and a primal scream.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

				JIM
		His mother blamed the counselors for 
		his death and tried to kill them all.
			(dramatic pause)
		She got her head chopped off by one of 
		them.

	We don't need to see this clip...Suzy's reaction is quite 
	sufficient.

				SUZY
		So the murders stopped?

	He gives her a long, penetrating look.

				JIM
		No.

	FLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK)

	We're bombarded with QUICK FLASHES of a hockey masked 
	JASON wreaking havoc on assorted teenagers...brandishing 
	everything from hatchets to knives to chainsaws. Just as 
	Jason is about to stab us, CUT BACK TO:

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

	Suzy flinches as if she were getting the knife.

				

				JIM
		Legend has it that Jason came back to 
		avenge his mother's death, vowing to 
		kill every teenager from the area. 
			(beat)
		And every now and then, the murders 
		start up again. 

	The boat lurches slightly, tugging at the anchor cable. 
	She's scared: he's frightened himself a little, too.

				JIM
		Forget about it, Suzy. They're just 
		stories.

	He brushes her hair back, kissing her cheek gently, 
	finding the nape of her neck again. She closes her eyes, 
	trying to dismiss what he's dredged up. But she can't. 
	Suzy begins to rationalize.

				SUZY
		We're the last graduating class, 
		right? 

	Jim's kissing her body, putting Jason behind him.

				JIM
		Right.

				SUZY
		I mean, Lakeview High just closed its 
		doors for good, right?

				JIM
		Right.

				SUZY
		So there's no reason for him to come 
		back because there won't be any of us 
		around...right?

	Jim stops, looking her squarely in the eyes.

				JIM
		Right. Except that Jason isn't real 
		so none of it matters anyway.

	She starts to relax, returning his kisses.

	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the anchor drifts along the lake floor, tugging hard 
	on the power cable. Camera TRACKS along the cable, 
	coming to a RUSTY SET OF CHAINS TANGLED AROUND IT.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	as Jim slides on top of Suzy. Thoughts of Jason are 
	starting to slip away along with their clothes.

	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the chains emit a dull tinkle due to movement from the 
	tugging anchor. Camera continues to TRACK again...and we 
	find to our horror that the waterlogged, fish-eaten body 
	of JASON IS SECURED BY THESE SAME CHAINS. (NOTE: Jason's 
	face is obscured.)

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	Teenagers in love, lost in not-so-innocent passion. At 
	the same moment:

	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

	The anchor tugs one last time and RIPS THROUGH THE CABLE. 
	SPARKS INSTANTLY FLY, chasing along the cable, finding 
	the chain which secures Jason and ENGULFING HIM IN 
	ELECTRICITY.

	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - ON LAKE SURFACE (EFX)

	as BRIGHT FLASHES OF BLUE LIGHT strobe-under the surface. 
	ARCING CURRENT chases up the anchor cable, sparking 
	across the hoist.

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - WIDE SHOT FROM WATER

	as the electricity feeding the streetlights is abruptly 
	extinguished, plunging the campsite into darkness.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	as Suzy's eyes flash open.

				SUZY
		Did you hear that?

				JIM
		Hear what?

	He pulls her back down.

				SUZY
		C'mon, I'm serious.

	He knows the mood is broken.

				JIM
		All right, I'll check it out.

	He slips on his jeans, exiting the cabin. She pulls the 
	sheet up around her fearfully.

	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the cable smolders, void of electricity now. TRACK to 
	find the chains again...but they're dangling loosely. 
	JASON IS GONE.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	Suzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now. The black void 
	of night is all she sees out the cabin door, which Jim 
	has left open. An uncomfortable amount of time passes.

				SUZY
		Jimmy...?

	No answer. Her heart starts to pound.

				SUZY
		Jim...?

	Again, nothing. She wraps herself in the sheet, moving 
	towards the open door. The ship creaks again.

	SUZY'S POINT OF VIEW

	as she grows closer to the doorway, nothing but pitch-
	black beyond it.

				SUZY
		Stop screwing around, Jim. I mean 
		it...

	...And just as she reaches the door:

	A HOCKEY MASKED MONSTER

	leaps out, clutching a HUGE KNIFE. Suzy barely has time 
	to scream before JASON PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO HER CHEST.

	SUZY

	stands there in speechless shock, looking down at her 
	mortal wound. But there's no blood.

	THE MONSTER

	pulls the knife back out, pushing the blade in and out 
	with his hand. It's a retractable rubber knife. JIM 
	pulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin, tossing it 
	aside.

				JIM
		Gotcha good, baby cakes.

	She doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick 
	him in the balls. He pulls her back onto the bed, 
	laughing.

	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK

	sitting dormant on the deck, where Jim tossed it. A 
	SHADOW FALLS ACROSS IT...followed by a SLIMY, DECOMPOSING 
	HAND. The hand grabs it like it's an old friend, pulling 
	it away.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	as Jim holds his angry girlfriend down on the bed, trying 
	unsuccessfully to kiss her.

				JIM
		All right, all right -- I'm a major 
		ass.

				SUZY
		And you'll never do it again.

				JIM
		And I'll never do it again. Forgive 
		me?

				SUZY
		No.

	She's resisting only for effect. Her legs curl around 
	him, finally giving in.

	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

	A deadly-sharp SPEAR GUN rests in its rack outside the 
	cabin. JASON'S HAND REMOVES IT.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	The sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each 
	other. Thoughts of Jason are nonexistent now.

	ANGLE - CABIN DOOR

	Nothing there for a moment...then a pair of moss-covered 
	BARE FEET SLOSH INTO FRAME.

	SUZY

	closes her eyes with pleasure...

	ANGLE - CABIN DOOR

	...and camera RISES from the mossy feet, up the bloodless 
	legs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockey-masked 
	face of our anti-hero: JASON VOORHEES.

	SUZY 

	lets out a broad smile, her eyelids fluttering. They stay 
	open long enough to regard the visitor in the doorway. 
	She tries to choke out a warning to Jim, who's just 
	collapsed himself.

				SUZY
		JJJJJJJJason...

	He doesn't follow her glance, smiling instead.

				JIM
		Uh-huh. You must really think I'm an 
		ass.

	But she continues to stare in horror as:

	JASON

	raises the spear, taking aim.

	ANGLE - SUZY AND JIM  

	Hs starts to kiss her but she bolts up with a blood-
	curdling SCREAM. A second later, JASON FIRES THE SPEAR, 
	PIERCING HER NECK, PINNING HER TO THE HEAD BOARD.

	Jim stares point-blank at his dead girlfriend, not able 
	to assimilate it quickly enough. He spins around to see 
	the monster himself.

				JIM
		Ohmygod...

	Jim springs off the bed, looking around for anything to 
	defend himself with, grabbing the bedside lamp. He 
	SMASHES IT OVER JASON'S HEAD which has little effect. Jim 
	scrambles to get past him, but Jason LIFTS JIM IN THE 
	AIR, SLAMMING HIM DOWN ON ONE OF THE SPIKED BEDPOSTS.

	EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	as the HOUSEBOAT silently drifts onward. The lone 
	silhouette of Jason emerges from within, taking the helm. 
	He's back.

							  FADE OUT/MAIN CREDITS.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. HARBOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY

	Only the faintest sign of daylight can be seen through a 
	thick blanket of gray fog. In the distance, speckled 
	lights outlining a smaller LUXURY CRUISE SHIP 
	intermittently appear.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY

	Standing at the boarding ramp is CHARLES MCCULLOCH, 
	clipboard in hand. He's just finished checking off a pair 
	of new-agey SENIOR GIRLS. McCulloch is approaching fifty, 
	wearing a tie and unwrinkled clothes, as well as the 
	disposition of a stern puritan.

				MCCULLOCH
		Remember girls, the shuffleboard 
		tournament will start at six p.m. 
		sharp. A non-attendance will restrict 
		your time in port, understood?

	They nod for his benefit, exchanging derogatory whispers 
	as they head up the ramp. Camera ADJUSTS to find a small 
	parking lot adjacent to the docks, where several cars are 
	just now arriving -- parents dropping off their high 
	school seniors, hugging them bon voyage.

	CLOSER ANGLE PARKING LOT

	as SEAN ROBERTSON walks toward the ship with pal MILES 
	WOLFE. Sean's a tall, nice looking, somewhat serious guy; 
	Miles is shorter, athletic and more extroverted.

				MILES
		You're telling me this boat has a pool 
		with a three meter board?

				SEAN
		It's a ship and that's right. Plus a 
		disco, gym, game room and a lot more.

				MILES
		I think I'm gonna blow off New York 
		and just stay on this thing.

				MCCULLOCH
		You'll do no such thing, Mr. Wolfe... 

	Camera ADJUSTS to reveal McCulloch, holding his list, 
	checking off their names.

				MCCULLOCH
		Your itinerary has been carefully 
		planned and make no mistake, it will 
		be executed accordingly.

				MILES
			(under his breath)
		Of course...wouldn't want to risk 
		enjoying this trip.

	McCulloch gives him a frown. Sean steps up to him 
	tentatively.

				SEAN
		Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. 
		McCulloch?

				MCCULLOCH
		Rennie's not coming.

	He's devastated.

				SEAN
		But I thought...

				MCCULLOCH
		She changed her mind.
			(eyeing list)
		Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom 
		one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are 
		in two-twenty-five.

	A booming VOICE from above interrupts them:

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON (O.S.)
		Sean -- where the hell have you been? 
		We're already into early departure 
		protocol...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Standing on the upper deck is a no-nonsense, uniformed 
	Navy man, ADMIRAL ROBERTSON. The captain of the ship. And 
	Sean's father. Sean's sadness about Rennie's absence is 
	immediately replaced with anxiety.

				SEAN
		Be right up, Dad.

	He and Miles head up the gangway, both boys giving 
	McCulloch one last glare.

	INT. '76 BMW 2002 - DAY

	Behind the wheel is MISS COLLEEN VAN DEUSEN, thirties, 
	attractive, a progressive attitude. RENNIE WICKHAM sits 
	next to her -- she's seventeen, pretty, slightly 
	withdrawn. Rennie's dog TOBY, a border collie, rides in 
	the back seat.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I'm glad you decided to come after 
		all.

				RENNIE
		Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles 
		will be.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		You let me worry about him, okay?
			(pause)
		Personal experiences are what fuel the 
		minds of great writers, Rennie. You 
		made the right decision.

				RENNIE
		What about not-so-great writers?

	Rennie smiles self-deprecatingly, Miss Van Deusen 
	grinning back. But Rennie's smiles are few and far 
	between, this one disappearing as she glances out the 
	window.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT)

	as the countless gallons of harbor and lake water spread 
	out before her, eery in the bog. A small ROWBOAT grazes 
	across it occupied by two indistinguishable people.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	Rennie's eyes show a hidden terror. She quickly turns 
	away, shivering briefly. Miss Van Deusen notices. She 
	turns a corner, heading into the parking lot.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Everything okay?

				RENNIE
		Just felt a little chill.

	Rennie rubs her arms, faking coldness.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Did you know that I'm giving up 
		teaching?

				RENNIE
		Really?

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Since the school is closing anyway, 
		I'm going to write that novel I've 
		been threatening on everybody.

				RENNIE
		That's wonderful, Miss Van 
		Deusen...what's it about?

	She parks the car, turning off the ignition.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		A senior class cruise to Manhattan, 
		laced with romance, adventure and 
		murder.
			(beat)
		Or a Gothic cook book. I haven't 
		decided which.

	She's coaxed the smile out of Rennie again. Miss Van 
	Deusen pulls a small wrapped box from her glove 
	compartment, handing it to Rennie, who seems utterly 
	surprised.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Go on, open it.

	Rennie pops off the lid, revealing an antique ink-dip 
	pen.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Stephen King supposedly used it when 
		he was in high school.

				RENNIE
		I don't know what to say...

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Rennie, you're the best student I ever 
		had...you have a real gift. If anybody 
		can make use of that pen, it's you.

	Rennie hugs her teacher. Camera RISES above the car's 
	window, finding a Mercedes 560 SL pulling in a short 
	distance away.

	CLOSER ANGLE - MERCEDES

	A sexy, money-dressed blonde is behind the wheel. TAMARA 
	MASON. She climbs from her leather seats as a trio of 
	SENIOR GIRLS walk by, offering enthusiastic hi's and 
	hellos. She's obviously Miss Popular. Tamara crosses to a 
	cute Japanese girl unloading luggage from a beige Honda, 
	EVA WATANABE.

				. TAMARA
		Are you ready for drugs, sex and rock 
		'n roll or what, girl?

	Eva gives her a warning glance, nodding to her left. 
	Eva's MOTHER appears by the passenger door, forcing a 
	smile at Tamara.

				MRS. WATANABE
		Hello, Tamara.

				TAMARA
		Hi, Mrs. Watanabe. Just kidding.

				MRS. WATANABE
		Yes, I'm sure.

	Embarrassed, Eva hurries to her Mom, rushing a kiss 
	goodbye.

				EVA
		Don't worry about a thing, Mom. I'll 
		have a terrific time and I won't do 
		anything stupid, okay?

	Before Mrs. Watanabe can squeeze a word in, her daughter 
	is gone. She waves a bittersweet goodbye to her graduate.

				MRS. WATANABE
		I love you...

	TRACKING WITH TAMARA AND EVA

	Once they're out of Mrs. Watanabe's earshot --

				TAMARA
		I hear the crew members are cute guys 
		in their twenties.

				EVA
		Really?

				TAMARA
		I'm sure we'll have no problem getting 
		them to party with us...especially 
		with this.

	Tamara unzips her purse, revealing a baggie filled with 
	fine white powder. Eva looks very nervous.

				TAMARA
		It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It 
		cost over a thousand bucks but it's 
		the best.

				EVA
		He bought you that?

				TAMARA
		More or less. It's part of my college 
		fund.

				

	She grins coquettishly, walking on. Camera HOLDS on the 
	calm, foggy harbor...where the faint image of a HOUSEBOAT 
	is aimlessly drifting into port.

	CLOSER ANGLE - HOUSEBOAT

	Sure enough, it's the same one we saw JASON on last 
	night...but no one is behind the helm. It seems to be a 
	ghost ship.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY

	as Tamara tries to slip past McCulloch, busy with another 
	pair of seniors.

				MCCULLOCH
		You can stop right there, Miss Mason.

	He motions the others onward. Busted. Tamara instantly 
	hands Eva her drug-filled purse, paralyzing Eva.

				MCCULL40CH
		Only graduating seniors are allowed on 
		this cruise.

				TAMARA
		What are you talking about?

				MCCULLOCB
		You never turned in your final biology 
		project, so I've had your diploma 
		rescinded.

				TAMARA
		You can't do that...

				MCCULLOCH
		It's already been done.
			(turning to Eva)
		Congratulations on the 3.9 average, 
		Miss Watanabe. You're in stateroom two-
		fifty-five.

	Eva smiles awkwardly, reaching for her luggage, stalling 
	to see what happens with Tamara.

				TAMARA
		Look, Mr. McCulloch, I got in a car 
		accident yesterday and missed our 
		appointment. It's okay, no big deal, 
		just a bruised arm...
			(squeezes her arm)
		...so I brought my project along 
		today. It's in my suitcase. Really.

	He looks at her suitcase, not buying a word of this.

				EVA
		She's telling the truth, Mr. 
		McCulloch. I saw her pack it.

	He's surprised to hear this...and so is Tamara.

				MCCULLOCH
		All right. But if it mysteriously 
		disappears en route, I'll have you 
		sent back home the minute we dock. 
		Understood?

				TAMARA
		Perfectly.

	She grabs her purse back from Eva, quickly moving on 
	before he changes his mind. Their voices become whispers.

				TAMARA  
		A major prick.

				EVA
		What are you going to do?

				TAMARA
		Improvise, of course.

	EXT. DOCK PILINGS - SAME TIME  

	as the HOUSEBOAT haphazardly bumps into barnacle-covered 
	dock pilings, still around fifty yards from the cruise 
	ship.

	POINT OF VIEW OUT HOUSEBOAT WINDOW

	The window is splattered with blood, but still clear 
	enough to make out Tamara and Eva walking up the gangway, 
	along with a half dozen other teenagers mingling on 
	board.

	TIGHT ON HOUSEBOAT'S ANCHOR CABLE

	--or rather the remnants of it. It's a piece of frayed 
	woven metal charred by extreme electricity, severed just 
	above water level. Suddenly there's blurry movement 
	behind it; camera RACK FOCUSES just in time to catch a 
	glimpse of JASON SLIPPING OFF THE SIDE, FLOATING TOWARDS 
	THE PILINGS.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE - SAME TIME

	as McCulloch impatiently checks his watch and list again. 
	Miss Van Deusen walks up to him.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked 
		in?

				MCCULLOCH
		Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never 
		showed up. I'm a little concerned.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Don't be. They probably decided to 
		explore each other rather than New 
		York.

	He gives her a disdainful look, starting up the ramp. 

				MCCULLOCH
		Let's go -- we're running two minutes 
		late.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Charles, there's someone else coming 
		along too.

	He stops, following her glance. His face tightens.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rennie is walking toward them with a small suitcase, her 
	dog Toby striding next to her. She walks up to him, 
	starts to say something, then decides against it. Rennie 
	heads up the gangway. HOLD on McCulloch and Miss Van 
	Deusen. He's livid.

				MCCULLOCH
		You have no right...

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		And neither do you. It's up to Rennie
		to decide what she wants to do.

				MCCULLOCH
		She doesn't know what she wants. She's 
		never had a stable life.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		And she sure doesn't have one now, 
		either. She needs to live.

				MCCULLOCH
		I'm her legal guardian, not you or 
		anybody else, and I alone know what's 
		best for her. End of discussion.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		No, I think it's just the beginning.

	She walks past him.

	EXT. RAMP/SHIP - ON RENNIE

	as she reaches the top of the gangway, her heart 
	pounding. Rennie pauses, working up the courage to look 
	out at the lake again.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

	The ROWBOAT she saw earlier is still there, even closer 
	now.

	RENNIE'S PUPILS

	contract, her blood pumping faster. Then she hears a 
	FAINT VOICE BELOW HER...

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Hhhhelp me...

	Rennie looks straight down at the water beneath her and 
	sees:

	AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY 

	floundering in the water. It takes us only a moment to 
	recognize him -- IT'S YOUNG JASON. He's gasping, sucking 
	in huge amounts of liquid, exactly like he did in the 
	prologue.

				YOUNG JASON
		Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...

	RENNIE

	leans back in terror, falling into Miss Van Deusen.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		What's wrong, Rennie??

	Rennie frantically points over the ramp edge, unable to 
	speak. Miss Van Deusen quickly looks and sees:

	MISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW

	The water is calm. No Young Jason.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	as Rennie gets a hold of herself.

				RENNIE
		I just got a little dizzy. I'm fine.

	She continues up the ramp. HOLD on Miss Van Deusen, 
	watching her go, somewhat troubled by it. RACK to 
	McCulloch below her, also watching. Extremely concerned.

	RENNIE

	continues along the starboard side, not risking another 
	glance overboard. She passes an older, very deranged DECK 
	HAND, mopping the deck. HOLD on him, his bloodshot eyes 
	following her like a crazed raven.

	INT. BRIDGE - CLOSE ON HARPOON - DAY

	Sharp and rusty, mounted on the wall amidst jagged 
	scaling knives, shark jaws and other artifacts. WIDEN to 
	reveal they are surrounding a navigational chart on the 
	cruise ship's bridge. Admiral Robertson and his CHIEF 
	ENGINEER are preparing for departure, checking the OMEGA 
	satellite computer as well as the LORAN.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
			(checking watch)
		Let's take in the brow.

				CHIEF ENGINEER
		Yes Sir.
			(into intercom phone.)
		Take in the gangway and single up all 
		lines.

	SEAN and MILES enter the room; Sean gets a glance from 
	his Dad. Miles is very impressed with the bridge.

				SEAN
		Hello, Dad.

				MILES
		Hey, Admiral Robertson. Love your 
		ship.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		She's a beauty, isn't she? I should've 
		retired from the Navy ten years ago.

				MILES
		You've really been generous to give us 
		this cruise. I know I speak for 
		everybody on board.

	Everybody...with the possible exception of Sean. He 
	avoids eye contact with his father.

				

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Hell, there's just twenty or so of you 
		-- we only need a skeleton crew and 
		it's a pleasure to sail her anyway.
			(beat)
		By the way, congratulations on winning 
		the intramural diving championships, 
		Miles. I'm sure you made your old man 
		proud.

	Admiral Robertson gives his own son a glance; maybe Sean 
	should think about doing the same.

				CHIEF ENGINEER
		Have you decided on your departure 
		protocol, Admiral?

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Actually, I thought I'd leave the 
		honors to my son.

				SEAN
		Dad, I don't think...

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
			(to Chief Engineer, ignoring 
			Sean)
		Relinquishing command of the Princess 
		Ruby to Captain Sean Robertson.

	Sean has no say in the matter. Miles can feel his 
	friend's nervousness as well.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		But before you take the helm, take 
		this.

	He tosses Sean a wrapped box. Sean opens it. Inside is a 
	navigational computer the size of a calculator, sitting 
	next to a rusty old sextant.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Something old and something new. I 
		used the sextant when I was your age, 
		but now they have these goddamn 
		computers to do all the work for you.

				CHIEF ENGINEER
			(to Sean)
		Have you decided on a plan of 
		departure, Captain?

	Sean's nervous. He eyes the Omega, quickly glancing at 
	the LORAN, briefly referring to the navigational chart.

				SEAN
		How about if we start up the forward 
		engines and come around. 180 
		degrees...

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Aren't you forgetting something?

	Sean looks flustered. Admiral Robertson storms to a 
	large button, pressing it three times, piercing the air 
	with three long blasts of the ship's horn. It 
	underscores his frustration.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		We're in foggy weather! Send out the 
		international maritime signal that a 
		vessel is backing down, followed by a 
		security broadcast warning other 
		ships!

	He shoves the mike out at Sean, but he doesn't grab it, 
	leaving the bridge, humiliated. There's an awkward moment 
	for Miles, unable to find any appropriate words. He exits 
	as well. Admiral Robertson stares out the bridge window, 
	saddened and frustrated. It wasn't supposed to go this 
	way.

	EXT. DECK - ON SEAN

	as he continues away, his retreat blocked by the DECK 
	HAND. The crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at 
	Sean.

				DECK HAND
		This voyage is doomed.

				SEAN
		Yeah, tell me about it.

	Sean sidesteps him, moving on.

	EXT. HARBOR - DAY (CRANE SHOT)

	Parents and relatives wave gleefully from the docks as 
	CAMERA RISES AND ROTATES to find eighteen or so teenagers 
	1ining the upper deck, happily waving back. The ship 
	begins to slice through serene water. The voyage has 
	begun.

	CLOSER ON HULL

	The water begins to ripple as the ship's speed increases. 
	All seems normal...until JASON'S HANDS APPEAR, CLINGING 
	TO A LOOSE MOORING LINE DRAGGING IN THE WATER. He 
	slithers up the side towards the deck as dense fog 
	breezes past him.

	EXT. DECK - DAY

	as Sean continues along, hands in pockets. He turns a 
	corner and collides with RENNIE, walking her dog. His 
	eyes instantly brighten, as do hers.

				SEAN
		Rennie...

				RENNIE
		Hi, Sean.

				SEAN
		I heard you weren't coming.

				RENNIE
			(glances at Toby)
		We changed our minds.

	Sean pats her dog. There's an awkward pause...they are 
	obviously in the early stages-of a relationship. 
	Sean reaches into his coat pocket, bringing back a small 
	necklace-sized box.

				SEAN
		I got you a present.

				RENNIE
		But I didn't get you one...

				SEAN
		Forget it. It's a dumb little thing 
		anyway.

	Rennie opens it up, exposing a petite silver necklace 
	with a Statue of Liberty pendant on it. She's touched.

				RENNIE
		Sean...it's beautiful.

	Sean takes it from her, snapping it around her neck.

				SEAN
		I thought maybe we could hike to the 
		top of the Statue when we got there, 
		if you felt like it. It's supposed to 
		be 22 stories tall.

				RENNIE
		I'd love to.

				MCCULLOCH (O.S.)
		Your father was looking for you, Mr. 
		Robertson.

	McCulloch appears behind them. The mood has been broken.

				SEAN
		I guess I'll see you later.

	Sean leaves. McCulloch steps up to Rennie, pointing out 
	to the foggy sea. Her respiration increases as she 
	psyches herself up to look.

				MCCULLOCH
		There's a storm predicted tonight. 

	Rennie looks at the ocean, forcing herself not to turn 
	away.

				MCCULLOCH
		You're making a big mistake, Rennie. 
		It's not too late to put you back on 
		land.

				RENNIE
		I'm staying.

				MCCULLOCH
		If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you 
		were of...

				RENNIE
		She didn't push me into coming.

				MCCULLOCH
		Why are you doing this to yourself?

				RENNIE
		I don't even know why I'm afraid, 
		Uncle Charles. I can't even remember 
		when it started. Don't you think it's 
		time I found out and got over it?

	He takes a measured pause.

				MCCULLOCH
		Facing your fear doesn't always 
		conquer it.

				RENNIE
		I'm staying.

	He's not going to change her mind.

	P.O.V. - RENNIE AND MCCULLOCH (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)

	through a porthole window...and through the viewfinder 
	of a video camcorder. McCulloch shakes his head, turning 
	away from Rennie and walking away. A sinister electric 
	guitar solo screeches out. PAN with McCulloch as he 
	passes the window, coming around 180 degrees into a CLOSE 
	UP of J.J. JARRETT, fingering a sleek Gibson "Flying V."

				J.J.
			(into camera)
		Is this axe awesome or what?

	INT. J.J.'S STATEROOM - DAY

	as J.J., a female rocker in the vein of band "Vixen," 
	continues to wail on her guitar. She's wearing a black 
	leather corset, with wildly teased deep red hair. Holding 
	the camcorder is WAYNE WEBBER, MTV-acclimated, wearing 
	the latest hip prescription glasses.

				WAYNE
		Too cool, J.J. Your parents came 
		through.

	She pops out the guitar cable from her practice amp.

				J.J.
		No lie. I hear there's a big power 
		room down below where I can get 
		supreme concert hall echo. Come down 
		and shoot a basement tape on me, okay?

				WAYNE
		Sure...but I gotta shoot some 
		shockumentary footage first.

	He avoids eye contact when he says it. She gives him a 
	look.

				J.J.
		Man, don't tell me you're still trying 
		to scam on Tamara...

	His non-answer means yes. J.J. walks over to him, 
	grabbing his cheeks, shaking them like jello.

				J.J.
		How long have we known each other? 
		Don't be a dweeb, Wayne. She's not 
		interested in you, only what you can 
		do for her. She's a user.

				WAYNE
		She's sexy.

				J.J.
		So's this guitar. So what?

				WAYNE
		I'll catch you later.

				

	He exits. She mumbles something under her breath, coiling 
	up her amp cord.

	INT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH WAYNE

	as he walks onward. DROP DOWN to find his FEET as he 
	passes a DARK ALCOVE...which happens to have SLIMY 
	FOOTPRINTS AND SEAWEED leading into it. Camera FOLLOWS 
	the footprints, RISING again and with dim recognition, 
	our eyes fall on JASON. Lurking in the shadows. But not 
	for long.

	INT. POWER ROOM - DAY

	Massive, very dark, backlit steam seeping from a maze of 
	pipes overhead. No windows. A wall of circuit breakers 
	and voltage meters decorate one wall, quietly humming 
	generators on the opposite side. J.J. appears with her 
	guitar, amp and ghetto blaster, appreciative of the 
	surroundings.

				J.J.
		This place is aching for a video. 
		Wayne, you're an asshole.

	She finds an outlet and plugs in her equipment.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	We're peering at J.J. predatorially through the steam, 
	moving through it, behind the generators.

	J.J.

	pops a cassette into her blaster, jamming the "play" 
	button. A loud rock 'n roll rhythm track blasts out.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	moving around the generators, eyeing her sleek leather 
	pants as she bends over to plug in her axe.

	TIGHT ON ELECTRIC GUITAR

	as J.J. snaps the male end of the plug into the female. 
	receptacle.

	JASON'S FACE

	appears for an instant through the vapor, then vanishes.
				
	J.J.

	screams out the opening licks of her solo in sync with 
	her playback. The generators are causing a breeze which 
	makes her hair dance, steam flowing between her legs. 
	She's lost in her music, building to a crescendo, bending 
	the high "E" string above the upper octave fret. She 
	opens her eyes with the pleasure of it and sees:

	JASON

	emerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare.

	EXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME

	as J.J.'s SCREAM echoes from an exhaust duct. WHIP PAN to 
	find the crazed DECK HAND standing just below it, 
	reacting with dread. He's the only one who has heard it.

	INT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME

	as Jason tears the guitar off her body, raising it in the 
	air like a hatchet. The horrified girl flees down a 
	narrow maze of steel steps, forced back against a 
	generator with nowhere to go. PUSH IN on her face for one 
	last look at her before:

	JASON

	swings the guitar downward and buries it in J.J.'s skull.

	EXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME

	as the Deck Hand flinches upon the thick, dull sound of 
	her demise, followed by discordant feedback from her 
	guitar...and eventual silence. He reaches into his breast 
	pocket, his hand shaking badly as he sips from a flask of 
	Early Times.

	EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (EFX)

	as LIGHTNING FLASHES over a gray, choppy sea. A storm is 
	imminent. The Princess Ruby finally appears, cutting 
	through whitecaps, no land in sight.

	CLOSE UP - INK DIP PEN

	as Rennie's hand carefully dips it in India ink, moving 
	to a blank page in her journal. She hesitates for several 
	beats.

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	No inspiration. She puts down the pen, looking at her 
	dog, who's curled up on the bed.

				RENNIE
		What do you think...time for some 
		personal experiences to fuel our 
		minds?

	The dog's eyes blink, but no more than that.

				RENNIE
		I agree.

	Rennie moves to her closet, finding a silk blouse and 
	some black satin pants.

	EXT. OUTSIDE DECK - SAME TIME

	Wind is picking up, sweeping thick mist past a row of 
	decorative flags. One of them flaps back...AND EXPOSES 
	JASON.

	THROUGH JASON'S EYES (FLYING WALL EFX)

	as the flag whips our faces. We MOVE through it, down the 
	empty passageway, coming to a porthole window. Rennie's 
	window. We peer through it with unnerving intensity at 
	the backside of Rennie as she pulls off her T-shirt, 
	slipping on the blouse. Camera continues through the 
	tiny round window, floating across the room, over Toby 
	and the bed...until we're INCHES FROM THE BACK OF 
	RENNIE'S HEAD. She suddenly spins around in fright, 
	facing us point-blank, and:

	REVERSE ANGLE

	Nobody is there, her porthole window empty. But there's 
	something surreal about the window...

	TIGHT ON PORTHOLE WINDOW (EFX)

	Empty grayness...then EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON FLOATS UP FROM 
	BELOW, BUBBLES ESCAPING FROM HIS LIPS. The porthole has 
	become a window into the depths of Crystal Lake.

	RENNIE

	feels her throat catch with terror and an instant later:

	DOG TOBY

	begins to bark vociferously, rushing to her cabin door, 
	scratching to get out.

	RENNIE'S EYES

	are distracted to Toby for a second; when she looks back 
	at the porthole, she sees:

	AN EMPTY WINDOW

	No water, no drowning boy.

	RENNIE

	snaps out of it, moving to the door, where her dog is 
	frantically clawing with his fur up.

				RENNIE
		Okay Toby, calm down...

	She's talking to herself as much as the dog. Rennie 
	closes the curtains on her window, then steps to her 
	door. She swings the door open for Toby...and exposes 
	an empty hall. Toby scrapes his way out of the room, 
	dashing off down the hall, snarling.

	INT. SHIP CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	as Toby runs straight toward us. PAN with him as he 
	rushes around a corner, leading us into a view of TAMARA 
	and EVA, disappearing down a staircase.

	INT. MENS GYM - DAY

	A strong seventeen year-old black kid, JULIUS GAW, is 
	going a few rounds with another senior boy who's clearly 
	losing the boxing match. Julius dances around him on the 
	mat like he's Mike Tyson, several other boys cheering 
	them on.

	REVERSE ANGLE - LOCKER ROOM WINDOW

	as Tamara and Eva step into view. Eva glances around, 
	feeling out of place in the men's locker room.

				EVA
		I'm not sure we're supposed to be 
		here, Tamara.

	A couple of skinny boys wearing only towels walk by. But 
	Tamara doesn't notice them, her face pressed up against 
	the glass, watching Julius.

				TAMARA
		Is that a muscular bod or what?

	Tamara puts on a sexy smile. The other boxer sees her 
	instead, instantly distracted. Julius lays him out with a 
	left-right-left combination. The onlookers applaud. 
	Julius pulls out his mouthpiece, giving Tamara a wicked 
	smile.

				TAMARA
		He's undefeated, you know that?
			(beat)
		Julius is the only senior I'd even 
		consider doing it with. If he wasn't 
		black, that is.

				EVA
			(awkward)
		My parents are open minded about that 
		sort of thing.

				TAMARA
		My stepmom couldn't care less, but 
		Daddy would have a shit fit.
			(lets it slip out)
		He might even pay some attention to 
		me.

	Tamara quickly puts up her veneer again, spotting 
	something.

				TAMARA
		Gorgeous guy at ten o'clock. Look 
		sensual.

	Both girls slip into instant sultry as a CREW MEMBER in 
	his mid-twenties passes them, wearing a tool belt. Very 
	masculine. He gives the girls a pleasant smile. Tamara 
	turns around to check out his back side.

				TAMARA
		I think it's time for some 
		recreational activity, girl.

				EVA
		Sounds good. I hear there's a 
		shuffleboard court on deck -- it might 
		be kinds cool...

				TAMARA
		You're joking, right?

	She wasn't, but Eva tries to act like she was. Tamara 
	walks on, Eva following.

	INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT

	as McCulloch steps from Rennie's room, looking very 
	worried. Wayne Webber passes by, his eye stuck in his 
	viewfinder. McCulloch yanks the camcorder away from his 
	face.

				MCCULLOCH
		Have you seen my niece anywhere?

				WAYNE
		Yeah, motivating downstairs, I think. 
		What's the problem, Mr. McCulloch?

				MCCULLOCH
		Senior predictions started five 
		minutes ago and she hasn't shown up.

				WAYNE
		Some of us don't want our futures 
		predicted.

				MCCULLOCH
		In your case I'm sure that's true.

	He brushes past Wayne angrily.

	INT. SERVICE AREA - NIGHT

	as Tamara drags Eva into a secluded service area, pulling 
	out her mirror, straw and baggie.

				TAMARA
		The night time is the right time. 

	Tamara hands the straw to Eva.

				EVA
			(nervous)
		No thanks.

				TAMARA
		What? Don't be a lightweight...this is 
		top dollar toot.

				EVA
		It's not that, it's just that...
			(beat)
		It I get caught, I'll lose my science 
		scholarship and everything.

				TAMARA
		You're talking to the prom queen, 
		Eva. Do you really think I'm going to 
		risk getting caught?

				EVA
			(a pause)
		I guess not.

				TAMARA
		Do you realize how many people would 
		kill to be sitting here right now? 
		Come on, it's grad night. You've got 
		your whole life to be uptight.

	Eva takes the straw.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	as we move down the corridor, in and out of shadows, 
	hearing giggles from Tamara and Eva up ahead. Jason's 
	coming...

	ANGLE - TAMARA AND EVA

	as Eva takes a nosefull, sneezing badly.

				TAMARA
		Is that unbelievable or what?

	Tamara giggles, getting ready to tap out another line. 
	But the snickering stops upon the sound of APPROACHING 
	FOOTSTEPS. They both look up, every muscle tensing with 
	fear as:

	RENNIE

	appears from the shadows, just as startled to see them. 
	It's not Jason at all. Rennie can't help noticing the 
	cocaine, trying hard to ignore it.

				TAMARA
		Jesus, you scared the hell out of us.

				RENNIE  
		Have you seen my dog? I think he came 
		this way.

				TAMARA
		No, we haven't.
			(awkwardly)
		Care for a hit?

				RENNIE
		No thanks.

	Rennie continues on. After she's gone...

				TAMARA
		A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll 
		narc on us...

				EVA
		I have her in Creative Writing and 
		she's fairly nice.

				TAMARA
		Nobody related to McCulloch can be 
		nice.

	Tamara puts the straw to her nose.

	ANGLE - RENNIE

	as she presses on, the corridor getting darker.

				RENNIE
		Toby?

	No reply. She walks on, turning down the left hallway... 
	but camera turns down the right hallway. Suddenly JASON 
	REVEALS HIMSELF, quietly stepping from the GAME ROOM. 
	He's holding a pool cue, which he proceeds to snap in 
	half, providing a splintery sharp shaft.

	INT. SERVICE AREA - SAME TIME 

	as Tamara finishes off her line, wiping her nose with a 
	sniffle.

				TAMARA
		Oh yeah. Ready to party and then some.

	She rolls up her baggie, stuffing it into her purse.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	as we come down a corridor, turning into the Service 
	Area, stomping right up to Tamara and Eva. They both 
	GASP; Tamara drops her mirror, which SHATTERS on the 
	ground.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	They are facing McCulloch.

				MCCULLOCH
		What are you doing in here?

				TAMARA
		Nothing.

	He eyes the broken mirror. He wasn't born yesterday.

				MCCULLOCH
		Are you girls using drugs?

				EVA
		Do you think I would use drugs, Mr. 
		McCulloch? We were just exploring the 
		ship.

	He doesn't want to believe Eva is a druggie. But Tamara 
	is a different matter. He levels his eyes on her.

				MCCULLOCH
		I'11 be coming around your stateroom 
		in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss 
		Mason. You'd better have your biology 
		project ready or I'm phoning your 
		parents.

				TAMARA
		They're out of town.

				MCCULLOCH
		Then I'll make sure you remain on 
		board while your classmates see the 
		sights.

	He's gotten to her with that one. McCulloch storms away.

				EVA
		What are you going to do?

				TAMARA
		Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... 
		but that little narcing bitch niece of 
		his is a different matter.
			(calculating)
		Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid 
		of the water...

	SPLASH!

	as a body pierces the surface of the deck swimming pool. 
	It's MILES, having just completed a dive from the high 
	board. Miss Van Deusen and several others stand at 
	poolside, giving him some applause.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Poetry in motion, Miles.

				MILES
		A half-twist short. I'll hone that 
		dive yet.

	He swims to the side, leading us to a view of Rennie. 
	She's very cautious about getting too close to the pool 
	edge as she approaches Miss Van Deusen.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Rennie -- I was just on my way over to 
		your room

				RENNIE
		Have you seen my dog anywhere?

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The 
		ship's only so big and there's 
		certainly no way off it, is there?

	She smiles reassuringly, but her words are less than 
	comforting.

	INT. SHIP CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH TOBY - SAME TIME

	as the canine continues to sniff out Jason through the 
	maze of corridors. TRACK with the dog as he slows his 
	pace, knowing he's getting close to something.

	TOBY'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM)

	Low to the ground, creeping past a steam vent which 
	obscures his vision, then turning down a metal staircase, 
	weaving into another passageway. Then with absolutely no 
	warning, A BODY FALLS FROM ABOVE, THUDDING DIRECTLY IN 
	FRONT OF US.

	TOBY

	rears back with teeth bared, but:

	THE BODY

	is quite dead: Toby is snarling at the corpse of the 
	TEENAGE BOXER who lost his bout against Julius. He's 
	still in his boxing shorts...BUT JASON'S SPLINTERY POOL 
	CUE HAS BEEN STABBED THROUGH HIS CHEST.

	EXT. DECK POOL - ON RENNIE AND MISS VAN DEUSEN

	as they walk along the edge of the pool.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		So, are you having fun yet?

				RENNIE
			(lying)
		Yeah...a lot.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I seem to detect a hint of 
		ingenuousness in your tone.
			(beat)
		In other words, level with me.

				RENNIE
			(a pause)
		There's something I haven't told 
		you...

	...But before she can begin the next sentence, Rennie is 
	shoved from behind.

				

	WATER ANGLE

	as she SPLASHES INTO THE POOL'S DEEP END.

	MISS VAN DEUSEN

	spins around, seeing Tamara standing there with Eva.

				TAMARA
		Wow, sorry...

	RENNIE

	flounders at the surface, nobody realizing the terror 
	she's experiencing. She's too scared to even cry for 
	help.

	MISS VAN DEUSEN

	isn't looking at Rennie, her attention on admonishing 
	Tamara.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Why on earth would you do something 
		like that?

				TAMARA
		It was an accident, I swear...

	Eva avoids eye contact, feeling awful. Sean comes walking 
	up, seeing Rennie.

				SEAN
		What happened?
			(to Rennie)
		Rennie, are you okay?

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

	She's can't even hear Sean, her vision being splashed by 
	the chlorinated water. She sinks under the surface, 
	turning around...AND COMING FACE TO FACE WITH YOUNG 
	JASON. The eight year-old corpse GRABS HER ANKLE AND 
	TRIES TO DRAG HER DOWN.

	SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW

	as Rennie sinks under the surface, all alone, thrashing 
	in terror.

	SEAN

	realizes she's in trouble. He immediately dives in after 
	her, pulling her to the pool's edge, where Miss Van 
	Deusen helps to lift her out.

	TAMARA AND EVA

	quickly move on.

				TAMARA
		That was truly excellent.

				EVA
			(feels like shit)
		Yeah.

				TAMARA
		Time to check out the waiters.

				EVA
		I think I'll pass. See you later, 
		okay?

				TAMARA
		But...wait a minute!

	Eva walks away. Tamara acts angry, but deep down she's 
	hurt.

				TAMARA
		Some friend you are.

	EXT. POOL SIDE - SAME TIME

	as Sean climbs from the pool to join Miss Van Deusen, who 
	is trying to comfort Rennie.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(to Sean)
		Bring her a towel, okay?

	Sean nods, hurrying off as others start to crowd around. 
	Miss Van Deusen looks up at them.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		She's fine -- everybody go back to 
		what you were doing.

	They disperse. Rennie slowly starts to cry, holding tight 
	to her teacher.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Care to talk about it?

	After a moment to compose herself...

				RENNIE
		I can't swim.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I gathered that.

	Rennie says nothing else. Miss Van Deusen knows she's 
	holding out.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I had a skiing accident in high 
		school, broke my left leg. It took 
		three winters before I would even look 
		at the snow again...but the solution 
		kept eluding me.
			(beat)
		I finally took lessons. I've never 
		broken a bone since.

				RENNIE
		It's not that simple.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Maybe not. But you're not telling me 
		everything, are you?

				RENNIE
			(long pause)
		Whenever I get near the water, I see 
		this young boy drowning. He tries to 
		pull me down with him.

	The teacher didn't expect this, taking a thoughtful 
	pause.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		When did this start?

				RENNIE
		About four years ago...at Crystal 
		Lake. I spent a few summers there with 
		Uncle Charles inbetween boarding 
		school.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		After your parents passed away?

	Rennie nods somberly.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Did you have an accident in the lake?

				RENNIE
		No. It was just a normal summer. I've 
		never been able to figure it out.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Only one young boy ever drowned in 
		that lake, and that was before you 
		were even born. His name was Jason 
		Voorhees.

	The name has triggered some deep memory...but the 
	recollection vanishes upon the sound of her uncle's 
	voice.

				MCCULLOCH (O.S.)
		Dear God...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as McCulloch rushes over to Rennie, seeing that she's 
	soaked. He's livid.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...

				MCCULLOCH
		Oh, I can see that. You've done a 
		wonderful job of supervising the kids, 
		Miss Van Deusen.

				RENNIE
		It wasn't her fault.

	He gets Rennie to her feet just as Sean runs back with a 
	towel. McCulloch grabs it from him, wrapping it around 
	his niece, facing both Miss Van Deusen and Sean.

				MCCULLOCH
		Stay away from her...both of you.

	He starts to lead her away. The crazy DECK HAND blocks 
	their path, slipping his flask away.

				DECK HAND
		He's come back and you're all going to 
		die.

	Rennie gazes at the Deck Hand, then back at McCulloch.

				RENNIE
		Just...leave me alone...

	She pulls away from him, hurrying off, confused and 
	frightened. McCulloch's retinas pierce the Deck Hand with 
	scorn. He checks his watch, then storms off.

	INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	as a loud, firm KNOCK punctuates the silence. Then comes 
	a sultry voice...

				TAMARA (O.S.)
		The door's open.

	McCulloch swings it open.

				MCCULLOCH
		I'm in no mood for any more stall 
		tactics, Miss Mason. Where is your 
		final project?

	REVERSE ANGLE

	as Tamara fills a pair of champagne glasses with a bottle 
	of Dom Perignon. She's wearing a full body robe.

				TAMARA
		Wouldn't you like a glass of champagne 
		first, Charles?

	He's about to lose his temper. McCulloch steps closer.

				MCCULLOCH
		Where did you get that alcohol?

				TAMARA
		I packed it. Just for us.

	EXT. DECK CORRIDOR - STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	as we approach Tamara's porthole window, peering through 
	it. We can't hear the words but we can clearly see the 
	people.

	INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

	as McCulloch takes the bottle from her, setting it down 
	on her nightstand.

				MCCULLOCH
		That's it. You're not setting foot off 
		this ship until we return home.

				TAMARA
		But I haven't even shown you my 
		biology project...

	Tamara unties her robe. PAN DOWN to the floor with it as 
	it softly piles at her bare feet.

	ANGLE - PORTHOLE WINDOW

	as the SHADOW OUTSIDE quickly blurs past the window.

	RETURN TO SCENE

	McCulloch is flabbergasted, too stunned to fully react. 
	Tamara is wearing a layered teddy, which she's beginning 
	to unsnap, exposing her lithe body...but that's not all. 
	Tamara has drawn all her major organs on her bare skin.

				TAMARA
		Take a closer look, Charles. I want to 
		make sure I labeled all my organs 
		correctly.

	EXT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	as we approach her door, still cracked open from 
	McCulloch's entrance. We get there just in time to see 
	Tamara slip her arms around McCulloch, planting her lips 
	on his, pressing her nubile flesh up against his stiffly 
	starched shirt.

	INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

	as she holds him tight. He finally breaks away in a fit 
	of anger.

				MCCULLOCH
		Oh, you've done it now. Not only are 
		you going home, I'll see to it that 
		you spend next year back in a high 
		school classroom!

	He storms for the door, swinging it open, coming face to 
	face with:

	WAYNE

	who casually lowers his camcorder.

				TAMARA
		I don't think so, Mr. McCulloch.
			(to Wayne)
		Did you get anything good?

	His eyes are unable to leave her nakedness.

				WAYNE
		Oh yeah.

	She quickly slips on her robe again, all business. 
	McCulloch realizes what has just transpired.

				MCCULLOCH
		You'll never get away with it.
			(eyeing Wayne)
		And you can forget about ever 
		attending any film school.
			(serious beat)
		You're both going to be very, very 
		sorry.

	He storms off. Wayne looks very, very nervous. Tamara 
	steps over to him, cuddling up.

				TAMARA
		Relax, Wayne. He won't risk doing a 
		thing.
			(beat)
		Can I have the tape?

	He pops the eject button, absently handing it over. Wayne 
	steps into her room, nervous and excited to be there. He 
	lifts the glass of champagne she poured for McCulloch.

				WAYNE
		This is going to sound supremely 
		lame...but I've had the major hots for 
		you since our sophomore year, Tamara.

	He gulps down the fizz. She forces a smile, stashing the 
	incriminating videotape.

				TAMARA
		That's sweet, Wayne. Look, I'd love to 
		chat but I'm really pressed for time.
			(ushering him to door)
		Let's try to get together later, okey-
		doke?

				WAYNE
		But I thought...

				TAMARA
		Thanks for the camerawork.

	And out he goes, the door shut in his face. Wayne stands 
	outside her room, realizing he's a major chump.

				WAYNE
		Wayne, you're an asshole.

	He despondently exits.

	INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME (STEADICAM)

	as Tamara heads for the bathroom, slipping off her robe. 
	She moves to the shower curtain and we're right behind 
	her. Her hand reaches up, grabbing the curtain, yanking 
	it back...

	Nothing is there.

	INT. LADIES RESTROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT (EFX)

	as Rennie enters, her eyes reddened. She moves to the 
	sink, looking at herself in the mirror. So much for the 
	silk blouse and satin pants, not to mention her soaked 
	hair. Rennie runs some warm water, rinsing her face.

	When she starts to fill her hands a second time, BLOOD 
	POURS OUT THE FAUCET INSTEAD OF WATER. Rennie gasps, 
	jerking up and seeing YOUNG JASON REFLECTED ON THE OTHER 
	SIDE OF THE MIRROR, SPLASHING IN WATER.

				RENNIE
		It's not real, it's not real...

	INT. TAMARA'S SHOWER - SAME TIME

	as water from the shower head SPLASHES CAMERA for a beat 
	before Tamara turns it off.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as Tamara reaches for her robe, slipping it on. Her body 
	paint has been washed off. 
	She steps from the shower, glancing in her vanity mirror 
	AND SEEING THE REAL JASON REFLECTED IN IT. Tamara spins 
	around, looking face to face with JASON IN HER BATHROOM. 
	Just as she SCREAMS:

	INT. LADIES RESTROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)

	Young Jason reaches out to grab Rennie, HIS FIST CRASHING 
	THROUGH THE MIRROR. Right when Rennie SCREAMS:

	INT. TAMARA'S BATHROOM - SAME TIME

	The real Jason SHATTERS TAMARA'S VANITY MIRROR WITH HIS 
	FIST. He grabs a sharp chunk of it, advancing on a 
	whimpering Tamara.

				TAMARA
		Please...please don't...

	Jason raises the shard above her and just as she 
	SHRIEKS...

	CLOSE UP - STEAM WHISTLE OF SHIP

	as it blasts loudly in the bleak stormy night. It begins 
	to rain.

	EXT. LADIES RESTROOM - NIGHT

	as Rennie comes rushing out, right into the arms of. 
	Sean. She clings to him, sobbing as the rain falls over 
	them.

				SEAN
		It's okay...you're going to be okay.

				RENNIE
		I want to go home. I want off this 
		ship.

	After a moment...

				SEAN
		Me too.
			(beat)
		Let's go talk to my Dad.

	He puts his arm around her, leading her toward the 
	bridge.

	INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

	as wind and rain pummel the bridge window.. Admiral 
	Robertson turns to his Chief Engineer.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Let's kick in the stablilizers, Mr. 
		Carlson, and get the seas off the 
		quarter. These kids are in for one 
		hell of a storm.

				CHIEF ENGINEER
		Yes Sir. Activating comfort cruise 
		mode.

	The Chief Engineer moves to a bank of toggle switches, 
	flipping a row of them.

	TIGHT ON NAVIGATIONAL CHART WALL - SAME TIME

	as a bloodstained HAND silently removes the rusty 
	harpoon hanging above the map.

	ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

	gets a reflective look in his weary eyes.

				ADMIRAL-ROBERTSON
		How olds your boy now, Carlson?

				CHIEF ENGINEER
		Nineteen months.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		A tremendous age. Take some advice 
		from a salty old man: don't push him 
		too hard.

	The Chief Engineer nods with a sympathetic smile as the 
	Admiral steps off the bridge, onto the stormy deck, 
	contemplating the sea. The Chief Engineer moves to the 
	radio/intercom console. He lifts a telephone, punching in 
	a three digit number. PUSH IN TIGHT ON HIS FACE.

				CHIEF ENGINEER
		This is the bridge. Approaching 
		weather suggests we secure the main 
		deck and...

	His sentence is sharply cut off, his head jerking from 
	excruciating, instant pain. 
	His mouth contorts with words no one will ever hear as he 
	stares into the face of:

	JASON

	holding the opposite end of the harpoon. He shoves it 
	forward with one more staccato jerk and:

	CLOSE UP - CHIEF ENGINEER'S BACK

	-- The harpoon's bloody, corroded tip pierces through 
	his once-white uniform.

	ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

	returns to the bridge as LIGHTNING flashes outside.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Better have them doublecheck the 
		lifeboat stations as well...

	Admiral Robertson stops cold upon the sight of Mr. 
	Carlson. He hurries over to him, kneeling down, freezing 
	as a pair of MUDDY FEET ENTER FRAME. Admiral Robertson 
	bends his neck upwards to face:

	JASON

	hovering over him, now clutching one of the scaling 
	knives.

	INT. BRIDGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	as Sean and Rennie walk up the corridor leading to the 
	bridge.

				RENNIE
		Can he really take us home?

				SEAN
		Not completing a voyage is against 
		everything he stands for. But I think 
		I can convince him to call a Coast 
		Guard cutter for you.

				RENNIE
		What about you?

				SEAN
		If I go with you, he'll never
		speak to me again.
			(beat)
		But I'm never going to live up to his 
		expectations anyway...so maybe it's 
		the right thing to do.

	He's made a big decision. Sean takes her hand as they 
	walk on.

	THEIR POINT OF VIEW

	moving closer and closer to the bridge door, having not 
	the slightest inclination of what's in store for them.

	SEAN

	knocks on the bridge door. No answer. He's confused. He 
	pushes the door open but something is blocking it. Sean 
	puts his weight into it, shoving hard.

	INT. BRIDGE

	as the door slides open, Sean stepping inside. His eyes 
	roil downwards upon seeing THE DEAD CHIEF ENGINEER, THE 
	HARPOON PROTRUDING FROM HIS BLOODY CHEST.

				SEAN
		Oh Jesus...Dad??

	Sean looks over at the helm...where his father is still 
	sitting in the swivel chair, his back to them. Silent. 
	Sean sidesteps the Chief Engineer's corpse, moving toward 
	his father as Rennie remains frozen in shock.

	SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW

	Slowly walking toward Admiral Robertson...at least he 
	thinks it's his dad because he's unable to see his 
	face. Is it Jason now wearing the uniform?? When he's 
	about two feet away from him...

	SEAN

	reaches out and swivels the chair around. It is his 
	father BUT HIS THROAT HAS BEEN SLIT. Sean staggers 
	backwards, uncomprehending, his senses overloaded. We 
	MOVE with him until he's backed into Rennie, clutching 
	onto him tightly.

				SEAN
		He's...he's dead...

	INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

	as Miss Van Deusen steps up to Rennie's door, gently 
	knocking.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Ronnie? I just came by to see how you 
		were feeling...

	No answer. She knocks harder...and it creaks open, 
	unlocked.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Rennie...?

	Suddenly the door is jerked from her grasp and swung 
	open. MCCULLOCH is standing on the other side of it.

				MCCULLOCH
		I thought I told you to stay away from 
		her.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(holds her ground)
		Where is she?

				MCCULLOCB
			(accusing)
		That's a very good question and I'd 
		appreciate an answer.

	A LOUD BUZZER blares out of an intercom speaker next to 
	their heads, causing the teachers to both jump. Sean's 
	unsteady voice immediately follows.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		Attention everybody, attention. This 
		is Sean Robertson...

	EXT. SWIMMING POOL - SAME TIME

	Miles is toweling off under the shelter of a gazebo as 
	Sean's voice blares out of a rain-pounded megaphone 
	speaker nearby.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		There's been...
			(swallows)
		What I mean is, this is an 
		emergency...

	Miles knows he can't be joking around. Wayne comes 
	walking by, covering his camcorder with his jacket.

				WAYNE
		Miles -- have you seen J.J.? She was 
		supposed to be jamming down in the 
		power room but...

	Miles gestures for him to be quiet, listening very 
	worriedly.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		Repeat, this is an emergency...

	INT. GYM LOCKERS - SAME TIME

	as JULIUS and two other senior boys finish dressing after 
	a shower, hearing Sean's words reverberate around them.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		I want everybody to meet on the 
		bridge...

				JULIUS  
		What the fuck is this?

	The others shrug, concerned.

	EXT. SHUFFLEBOARD COURT - SAME TIME

	The wooden shuffleboard disks are drowning in 
	precipitation. Eva stands alone in the rain, staring at 
	the court as Sean's voice continues.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		Stay calm, but get here as quick as 
		possible. Walk with a friend if you 
		can...

	Eva wipes the rain from her face, then walks away.

	INT. BRIDGE - ON SEAN

	trying his best to keep it together. He glances at his 
	dead father, still unable to believe it.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		God, I wish this was a joke, but it's 
		not.

	Sean slowly puts down the phone. He's lost in a daze. 
	Suddenly the SHIP LURCHES, a huge swell SPLASHING THE 
	BRIDGE WINDOW. Admiral Robertson's body falls from the 
	swivel chair.

				RENNIE
		What is happening???

	Sean regains his balance, moving to the computer console, 
	looking at the OMEGA and LORAN like he's never seen them 
	before.

				SEAN
		I don't know...we've gone off course 
		or something...

				RENNIE
		What do you mean???

	Another wave hammers the bow. She's in a state of awful 
	panic.

				SEAN
		I don't know what I mean! All's I know 
		is that there's no one guiding this 
		ship anymore...

	Sean is starting to lose it. The fear of the ocean 
	guiding her, Rennie rushes to him, gripping and shaking 
	him.

				RENNIE
		Can't you call for help??

	Sean tries to get a grip and assess the situation, pacing 
	frenetically.

				SEAN
		I think so. But we have to lower the 
		anchors so we don't drift any 
		further...

				RENNIE
		Where are they?

				SEAN
		The bow...front of the ship. There's a 
		hoist on each side that lowers them

	She starts to exit.

				SEAN
		I didn't mean for you to go!

				RENNIE
		Just radio for help, okay???

	She hurries out the door, working on terror-induced 
	adrenaline. Sean rushes to the radio console, depressing 
	the keying button, speaking into the mike.

				SEAN
		Mayday, mayday, mayday...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as JULIUS arrives with the others from the locker room. 
	They react to the dead bodies while Sean continues at the 
	radio.

				SEAN
		Please...can anybody out there hear 
		me??

	No response. WAYNE and MILES rush in.

				MILES
		Sean, what's going on?

	Then he sees the corpses. He needs no further answer.

				WAYNE
		Jesus Christ...

	He's too scared to even videotape it. Sean is bombarded 
	with questions as he tries to figure out the radio.

				JULIUS
		Who did this, man?

				WAYNE
		Is the radio even working??

				MILES
		Isn't there some international S.O.S. 
		thing you can do???

				SEAN
			(suddenly remembers)
		Channel 16...the distress frequency...
			(dialing knob)
		Mayday, mayday, mayday...this is the 
		Princess Ruby. Please, somebody 
		answer...

	EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (STOCK)

	as a COAST GUARD CUTTER tracks through stormy seas.

				RADIO OFFICER (V.O.)
		This is Coast Guard cutter Dallas. 
		What is the nature of your problem, 
		Ruby?

	INT. BRIDGE - ON SEAN AND OTHERS

	as they hear the voice, reacting, relieved and thrilled.

				SEAN
		The Captain and Chief Engineer... 
		they've been...they're dead.

				RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
			(a grave-pause)
		What is your location?

				SEAN
		I...I don't know...

				RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
		Is your ship equipped with Omega 
		satellite navigation or LORAN?

				SEAN
		Yes...

				RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
		The LORAN has a digital printout of 
		your latitude and longitude. Give me 
		the coordinates and we'll be there as 
		quick as we can.

	Sean hurries to the LORAN, reading the numbers.

	EXT. DECK - RADIO ANTENNA - SAME TIME (EFX)

	as LIGHTNING STRIKES above it in the night sky. Camera 
	slowly ADJUSTS to find the RADIO ANTENNA CABLE. A second 
	later, JASON'S HAND REACHES FOR IT, GETTING A FIRM GRASP.

	INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME

	as Sean hurries back to the radio, pressing it against 
	his spitless mouth.

				SEAN
		I've got the numbers.

				RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
		Give me the degrees first, followed by 
		minutes and sec...

	Suddenly his voice is CUT OFF, followed by STATIC.

				SEAN
		Hello? Are you there??

	No response. A lump sinks into everyone's throat.

	EXT. DECK - RADIO ANTENNA

	as Jason drops the cable he's just torn out, marching 
	onward.

	EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

	as McCulloch bursts onto the bridge, followed by Miss Van 
	Deusen.

				MCCULLOCH
		I demand to know what is going on...

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Oh dear God...

	She's seen the bodies. McCulloch follows her glance, 
	paling. He quickly takes charge, pushing through the 
	students.

				MCCULLOCH
		Where's the radio?

				SEAN
		It's...dead.

				DECK HAND (O.S.)
		You're all going to die.

	All heads spin as the deranged DECK HAND treads out from 
	a shadowy corridor.

				DECK HAND
		You're the last ones. He's come back 
		for you.

				MCCULLOCH
		What are you talking about?

	The Deck Hand takes a final swig from his flask, dropping 
	it with unsteady hands.

				DECK HAND
		Jason Voorhees.

	There is a collective, disconcerting silence triggered by 
	the infamous name.

				MCCULLOCH	 
		You're insane, old man. Jason Voorhees 
		has been dead for over thirty years.

				DECK HAND
		He walks this ship, here and now.

				MCCULLOCH
		A killer walks this ship indeed. And 
		it's certainly none of us...

	The crazed old man gets his drift. Everyone looks at him 
	suspiciously. McCulloch grabs a SCALING KNIFE off the 
	wall, taking a step towards him.

				DECK HAND
		You're the one who's insane!!

	The raving man flees back the way he came. McCulloch 
	raises the flare gun; Miss Van Deusen grabs McCulloch's 
	arm, stopping him.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		What are you doing??

				MCCULLOCH
		That lunatic has been spouting off 
		about Jason since we boarded... 
			(eyeing bodies)
		It's no coincidence.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		But that doesn't prove that he's the 
		one!

				MCCULLOCH
		Walking corpses are not real!

				JULIUS
		Yeah, well these dead bodies are sure 
		enough real.
			(to the others)
		I say we regroup and find this 
		motherfucker before he finds us. 

	There's a murmur; it makes sense.

				MCCULLOCH
		You'll do no.such thing and watch your 
		mouth, young man! I'm in charge here!

	They all look at McCulloch defiantly.

				JULIUS
		School's out, McCulloch.
			(to the others)
		Let's go.

	Julius walks off the bridge; all the seniors follow 
	except Sean.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Please everybody, stay here!!

	They don't listen. McCulloch starts to go after 
	them...and then it hits him:

				MCCULLOCH
		Christ...where's Rennie??

				SEAN
		She's...she's dropping the anchors. I 
		thought the Coast Guard could find us 
		easier if...

				MCCULLOCH
		What?? You sent her out there with a 
		murderer running around loose??

	EXT. DECK - NIGHT

	as Rennie moves past wet, empty lounge chairs towards the 
	bow. She passes a row of translucent windows. The first 
	three are normal...but the fourth has the SILHOUETTE OF 
	JASON ON ITS OPPOSITE SIDE. 
	He begins to stride parallel to her, then disappears 
	when the windows end and a wall takes over.

	INT. BRIDGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	as Julius and his followers continue on, passing Eva, 
	who's coming up from a staircase. She stops Wayne.

				EVA
		What's going on? I heard on the P.A. 
		system that...

				WAYNE
			(interrupting)
		The Captain's been murdered. The buzz 
		is that Jason might be on board.

				EVA
		Jason...Voorhees?

	She knows the legend as weld as everybody else. Wayne 
	nods gravely, moving to catch up with the others. Eva 
	rushes up to him again.

				EVA
		Have you seen Tamara?

				WAYNE
		No. And I'm not losing any sleep over 
		it.

				EVA
		But she might be in trouble...

				WAYNE
		So what else is new?
			(beat)
		Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude 
		to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise 
		up -- it's not hip to be her friend.

				EVA
		I don't care about being hip anymore.

	She means it. Wayne nods with understanding.

				WAYNE
		I'm sorry, but I've gotta find J.J.

	He hurries on.

	EXT. BOW - NIGHT

	as Rennie appears, fighting the wind and rain to get 
	closer to the anchor hoists.

	POINT OF VIEW THROUGH DECK WINDOW - SAME TIME

	--spying on Rennie like a wolf watching a lamb. We MOVE a 
	few windows down, getting a better view of her.

	REVERSE ANGLE - ON JASON

	deciding that the time is right to strike. His hand moves 
	to the bow entrance door knob, slowly turning it, pulling 
	it open.

	EXT. BOW - ON RENNIE

	moving closer to the right anchor hoist, her back to us 
	as well as Jason. She climbs behind the hoist, looking at 
	the consoles. Then suddenly a BARK.

				RENNIE
		Toby?

	She turns, catching a glimpse of her dog running down the 
	side of the deck. Rennie leaves the hoist, going after 
	Toby.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	through the crack in the door, watching Rennie 
	unexpectedly take off. He's about to move after her when 
	ha hears:

				EVA (O.S.)
		Tamara? Are you around here anywhere?

	Jason quietly closes the door. Rennie will have to wait.

	INT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH EVA

	as she cautiously walks along, poking her head in every 
	alcove.

				EVA
		Tamara?

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	moving down the same corridor, catching a glimpse of Eva 
	before she turns a corner and disappears.

	INT. HALLWAY/TAMARA'S STATEROOM - MOVING WITH EVA 
	(STEADICAM)

	Eva steps into the hallway outside Tamara's stateroom. 
	She walks up to Tamara's door, knocking on it. It swings 
	open, unlocked.

				EVA
		Tamara?
			(no response)
		I just want to talk with you.

	She steps into Tamara's room and we go in with her. The 
	quarters are empty. Eva stands there for a beat, confused 
	and scared. She's about to leave when a CREAKING SOUND 
	causes her to look back at:

	THE BATHROOM DOOR

	It slowly swings open...splashing Eva's eyes with 
	grotesque multi-images of Tamara: SHE IS HANGING ON THE 
	DOOR HOOK, HER BODY PIN-CUSHIONED WITH A DOZEN MIRROR 
	SRARDS.

	EVA

	shrieks, running back out the door...

	INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY

	...and sliding to a abrupt halt because JASON IS STANDING 
	AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY. He moves toward Eva like a 
	bulldozer. She turns a rapid 180 and sprints in retreat.

	RUNNING WITH EVA (HAND HELD)

	Gasping for oxygen, Eva has no time to even scream as she 
	flees from the monster, erratically turning down a spiral 
	staircase and running on.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM)

	chasing after her with the smooth determination of a 
	shark, never letting her get too far in the lead.

	INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - ON EVA

	Empty for a second, then Eva appears, weaving her way 
	through a maze of corridors and passageways. She races 
	past a sign directing passengers to "CLUB RUBY."

	ANGLE - JASON

	--entering the same corridor a beat after Eva exits it in 
	the direction of the disco. He tramples onward.

	INT. CORRIDOR/DISCO (STEADICAM)

	The thudding low frequency of a mesmerizing dance tune 
	precedes Eva as she tears open a door, entering the 
	corridor. MOVE BACKWARDS WITH HER as she rushes forward, 
	curving through the shallow passageway and emptying out 
	onto a high tech DISCO FLOOR. A flashing Star Wars 
	lighting system assaults her all directions along with 
	the music. She's all alone in here.

	TIGHT ON EVA

	The lights strobing across her face only accentuate her 
	terror. She spots another door on a small stage, rushing 
	to it. It's locked.

	CROOKED ANGLE - ENTRANCE DOOR

	as Jason enters the corridor, SLAMMING THE DOOR SHUT 
	BEHIND HIM.

	EVA

	decides this is the wrong place to be. She moves for the 
	corridor again and:

	JASON

	appears on the corridor steps for a brief second. The 
	spotlight goes black, then flashes on again. Now he's 
	gone.

	EVA

	backs away, sliding along the edge of the dance floor 
	like she's on a building ledge. Chaser lights and mirror 
	balls fondle her body as she moves as far away from the 
	point where she last saw him. But:

	JASON

	illuminates only ten feet from her, a crimson strobe 
	assaulting his hockey mask. She's on a collision course 
	with him.

	EVA  

	whirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the 
	sight of him. Camera SPINS with her in 360 degree arcs, 
	PUSHING IN on her face.

	EVA'S POINT OF VIEW

	spiraling counter-clockwise on the dance floor, flashes 
	of Jason materializing where she least expects to see 
	him. And getting closer. Finally at the point of 
	exhaustion:

	EVA

	stops, looking everywhere.

	EVA'S POINT OF VIEW

	He seems to be gone. She catches her breath...then 
	sensing his presence, she revolves a half-turn to face:

	THE HOCKEY MASK

	exploding under a pin spotlight, standing directly 
	before her. His forearms recoil with lightning speed as 
	he grips her throat...

	WIDE SHOT - DISCO

	Thundering music. Frantic lights. And Jason and Eva at 
	the center of it all. HER FEET ARE TWENTY-FOUR INCHES OFF 
	THE GROUND, KICKING MADLY AS THE LIFE IS BEING CHOKED OUT 
	OF HER. Finally Eva's legs go rag doll limp. Jason flings 
	her to the ground like a sack of flour. This dance is 
	over.

	EXT. DECK - NIGHT

	Rennie appears again, scanning her no-visibility 
	surroundings.

				RENNIE
		Toby? Where'd you go?

	No sign of her dog. She remembers her mission, heading to 
	the anchors again.

	EXT. BOW - CONTINUOUS

	as Rennie arrives on the bow, climbing into the left 
	hoist box behind the huge anchor cable.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	moving up to the bow door like Jason did before, cracking 
	it open, seeing Rennie from behind. And moving towards 
	her.

	RENNIE

	is oblivious as she reads the directions above the 
	controls.

	INSERT - HOIST LEVER (SECOND UNIT)

	as Rennie's hand grabs it, shoving it forward.

	INSERT - GREEN HOIST BUTTON (SECOND UNIT)

	A moment later, her thumb finds it and depresses it.

	INSERT - ANCHOR CHAIN (SECOND UNIT)

	as the massive black chain links thunder to life.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	He's now within ten feet of the unaware girl.

	RENNIE

	remains in the hoist box, making certain it is operating 
	correctly. A second later, we see the fleeting outline of 
	a HUMAN SHAPE appear behind her.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	Three feet from Rennie. She spins around to climb out of 
	the hoist box and GASPS.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	She's facing MCCULLOCH. He immediately reaches past her, 
	yanking the lever back to its center position, and:

	THE ANCHOR CHAIN (SECOND UNIT)

	grinds to a halt.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	as McCulloch faces her, angrily grabbing Rennie's arms, 
	shouting over the storm.

				MCCULLOCH
		You had me worried to death!

				RENNIE
		But Sean said...

				MCCULLOCH
		I'm the one you should be listening 
		to! Do you think dropping an anchor in 
		the middle of a storm makes any sense 
		whatsoever?

	She tries to find some defense, but McCulloch leads her 
	off before any wards come forth.

	CLOSE UP - EXERCISE MAT

	as a pair of SKEET RIFLES, three FIRE AXES, a FLARE GUN 
	and several POOL CUES are dumped onto the foam padded 
	plastic.

	INT. EXERCISE ROOM - NIGHT

	where Julius has gathered his small group of vigilantes, 
	including Miles and Wayne.

				JULIUS
		I managed to scrounge this shit from 
		the game room and hallways. Grab what 
		you want.

	Wayne takes one of the rifles; Miles grabs the axe.

				WAYNE
		What are you taking, Julius?

				JULIUS
			(flexes fists)
		Nothin'.

				WAYNE
			(dead serious)
		We're talking the possibility of Jason 
		Voorhees here.

	Julius pauses. He's not stupid.

				JULIUS
		Nothin' but this gun.

	He reaches down, picking up the other rifle. And they 
	move.

	INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY/RENNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	as McCulloch guides his niece down the hallway, swinging 
	her door open.

				RENNIE
		Can't we at least talk about it?

				MCCULLOCH
		I refuse to discuss this ridiculous 
		notion that a ghoul is terrorizing 
		this ship.

				RENNIE
		But what about the drowning boy I've 
		been seeing?

	He avoids eye contact. McCulloch takes her hand, ushering 
	her across the threshold. She's standing inside her room 
	now; he's in the hallway.

				MCCULLOCH
		Whatever you've been...imagining... 
		has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.
			(pause)
		I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's 
		all I care about.

				RENNIE
		I'm not staying in my room, Uncle 
		Charles.

				MCCULLOCH
		This isn't a request.

	He closes the door on her face, pulling out a key, 
	locking the dead bolt. She pounds on it from the other 
	side.

				RENNIE (O.S.)
		Uncle Charles!

	He ignores her, briskly walking away.

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

	as she throws her fists against the door a final time, 
	realizing it's futile.

	INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT

	Steam continues to seep from the maze of criss-crossing 
	pipes. Wayne appears on one of the catwalks. He's holding 
	the skeet rifle under one arm, using the sun gun off his 
	video camera to guide him.

				WAYNE
		J.J. -- you down here?

	CLOSER ANGLE

	as Wayne carefully lets his light guide him down the 
	precarious walkway. An unexpected blast of steam scares 
	the crap out of him, causing him to stumble.

	INSERT - WAYNE'S GLASSES (SECOND UNIT)

	--They slip off the bridge of his nose, skittering down 
	through the catwalk and pipes to God knows where.

	WAYNE

	lies helplessly on the metal grid work, realizing his 
	bleak predicament has just been squared. He pulls himself 
	to a standing position again.

				WAYNE
		We got a major problem, Wayne.

	WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW

	His vision now gives him shadows and shapes rather than 
	crisp images. He raises the gun and continues unsteadily 
	forward.

	POINT OF VIEW THROUGH GRID WORK

	as Wayne inches forward. Camera slowly PANS INTO A 
	PROFILE OF JASON, watching him from a catbird seat.

	WAYNE

	takes another step, almost tripping on a set of stairs 
	leading down to the next level. And when he arrives 
	there...

	WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW

	...A LARGE FIGURE STEPS OUT, HOLDING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A 
	KNIFE.

	WAYNE

	instantly raises the rifle and FIRES...

	WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW

	...and the body goes down. He's hit him!

	WAYNE

	stands there, breathing some relief. He gets an idea, 
	looking through his camcorder eyepiece. Wayne begins to 
	adjust the eyepiece diaptor.

	WAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)

	as the figure on the ground slips in and out of focus, 
	finally becoming crisp. WAYNE HAS SHOT A CREW MEMBER -- 
	the same good looking one Tamara and Eva ogled earlier. 
	He's holding a screwdriver from his waist band tool set, 
	not a knife.

	WAYNE

	slowly lowers his camera as his heart rises into his 
	throat.

				WAYNE
		No...

	He raises his camcorder again, hoping a second view will 
	reveal a dead Jason rather than this young man.

	WAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)

	He gets half his wish: a HOCKEY MASK NOW FILLS HIS 
	FRAME...but Jason is far from dead. Wayne catches a split-
	second glimpse of Jason's fist coming towards him, then 
	the camera is KNOCKED FROM HIS EYE AND THE WORLD BECOMES 
	DARK AND BLURRY.

	WAYNE

	screams, blindly running as fast as he can. He trips, 
	picking himself up, stumbling down the catwalk stairs. 
	Wayne makes it about ten feet before he stumbles over 
	something, bringing with it a harsh strum from an 
	ELECTRIC GUITAR.

	ANGLE - WAYNE'S FEET

	Sure enough, his left shoe is resting on the pickups of a 
	blood-streaked Gibson Flying V.

	TIGHT ON WAYNE

	--sprawled out on the metal floor. He gropes around, his 
	hands feeling something. It sends chills from his groin 
	up through his scalp.

				WAYNE
		No no no...

	REVERSE ANGLE

	Wayne's hands are touching J.J.'S BLOODY FACE, A LARGE 
	CRACK IN HER SKULL. He doesn't have time to scream or cry 
	because

	JASON

	hoists him off of J.J.'s body and flings him into:

	THE SHIP CIRCUIT PANEL (EFX)

	which shorts out with a fanfare of ELECTRICAL SPARKS 
	AND FIRE, INSTANTLY FRYING WAYNE.

	INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME

	as the overhead lights briefly flicker, then resume 
	normal operation. Sean stands opposite the navigational 
	chart, ping-ponging between it and the ship's 
	computers as Miss Van Deusen paces nervously.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		What was that??

				SEAN
			(very worried)
		I don't know.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(trying not to panic)
		What happens if we don't get control 
		of the ship, Sean? I want you to tell 
		me the truth.

				SEAN
			(beat)
		We could hit a reef, collide with 
		another ship...we could be out here 
		for weeks before anybody spotted us.

	They are suddenly jolted with a DOOR SLAM as McCulloch 
	storms onto the bridge.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Did you find Rennie?

				MCCULLOCH
		She's locked safe in her room, no 
		thanks to either of you.
			(like Sean isn't even in the 
			room)
		Has he brought it back on course yet?

	Sean doesn't look at him, still trying to assimilate the 
	wall of components.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		He's doing the best he can, Charles.

				MCCULLOCH
		He's the son of the Captain, for 
		Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able 
		to operate this thing!

	Sean closes his eyes, trying to keep from losing his mind 
	and temper. A fierce WAVE slaps the windows in front of 
	Sean's face, motivating him to get his shit together. He 
	checks the Omega and LORAN.

				MCCULLOCH
		Well?

	Sean doesn't answer, moving to the seat behind the helm. 
	His father's seat. Sean takes the chair, adjusting the 
	wheel, watching the compass. He studies a series of 
	buttons on the console.

	CLOSE UP - WALL OF BUTTONS

	We PAN across them, stopping on one labeled "FIRE ALARM - 
	DO NOT BREAK EXCEPT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY." Camera 
	continues around to find we are in the POWER ROOM, NOT on 
	the bridge. Our vision suddenly lands on JASON, staring 
	at the alarm button, considering. He glances back over 
	his shoulder.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)

	Wayne's body is NOW ON FIRE...AND THE BLAZE IS SPREADING 
	THROUGH THE ROOM.

	INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME

	as Sean makes up his mind, flipping several toggle 
	switches.

	INSERT - AUTO PILOT COMPUTER

	as Sean flips the last toggle and a green light 
	illuminates, indicating the AUTO PILOT is in effect.

	RETURN TO SHOT

				SEAN
		It worked...we're back on course!

	Sean feels his confidence instantly rejuvenated. Miss Van 
	Deuten immediately embraces him. But a fraction of time 
	later:

	TIGHT ON FIRE ALARM BUTTON

	Jason's fist SMASHES the alarm button...

	INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

	...and a LOUD SIREN cries out across the entire vessel. 
	The blood drains from Sean's face.

				MCCULLOCH
		What's that?

				SEAN
		The fire alarm...

	VARIOUS ANGLES ON BOARD SHIP - NIGHT

	as the shrieking alarm assaults the main deck, hallways 
	and corridors, giving Julius, Miles and Wayne deep 
	pause for thought.

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

	as the alarm bombards Rennie's ears like everybody 
	else's. She hurries to her curtained porthole window, 
	working up the energy to look outside. Rennie gets a grip 
	on them, FLINGING THEM OPEN. The DECK HAND'S CRAZED FACE 
	IS GAZING BACK AT HER. Rennie screams; a second later he 
	hurries off.

	INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

	as McCulloch tears open a cabinet door labeled EMERGENCY 
	FLARE GUN. The siren continues to blast.

				MCCULLOCH
		Can you shut that damn thing off??

	Sean moves to a bank of switches, his eyes darting around 
	for the appropriate switch. Miss Van Deusen sees 
	McCulloch remove the FLARE GUN from the cabinet.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		We already thought of that -- nobody 
		could possibly see it in this storm...

				MCCULIACH
		There's only one person who needs to 
		see it. And I'm going to find him.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		What about the fire??

				MCCULLOCH
		I doubt very much that one even 
		exists.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		What are you talking about?

				MCCULLOCH
		Use some common sense! Setting off a 
		fire alarm causes panic...the same 
		kind of panic caused by suggesting 
		Jason Voorhees is on board.
			(resolved)
		Enough is enough. 

	He marches out the door. Sean finds the alarm kill 
	switch, flipping it. The excruciating siren vanishes. He 
	grabs a pair of rain jackets, tossing one to Miss Van 
	Deusen.

				SEAN
		We have to get everybody together just 
		in case the fire's for real.

	Sean heads for the door, shoving it forward.

	EXT. DECK - ON DOOR

	as it slams open...and JULIUS steps out, not Sean, from a 
	different deck door. TRACK with him as he treads along 
	the side of the ship, skeet rifle raised.

	JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW

	walking past the lifeboat stations, the wind and 
	precipitation battering the small boats. With no warning, 
	AN OBSCURE FIGURE LEAPS OUT, GRIPPING AN AXE.

	JULIUS

	shoves the gun stock into his shoulder and takes 
	instantaneous aim...but he doesn't shoot. He slowly 
	lowers the rifle.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as MILES lowers the axe. They've just scared the shit out 
	of each other.

				MILES
		I'll take the upper deck.

	Julius nods. They separate. Neither boy notices the 
	smoke which is starting to emerge from a deck vent...

	INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX)

	Filled with black smoke. The fire is spreading 
	dangerously close to a series of hoses attached to a fuel 
	pump, leading to tanks below. A sign over them reads: 
	DANGER - FUEL TANKS.

	EXT. DECK POOL - NIGHT

	--steaming and far from calm as the weather blitzes it. 
	Miles appears, climbing a ladder to the upper deck level.

	POINT OF VIEW THROUGH LADDER

	Someone is spying on Miles from below, watching his every 
	step.

	EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

	as Miles arrives, axe raised. He pauses to regard his 
	surroundings, then moves on. RACK FOCUS TO FIND JASON 
	RIGHT BEHIND HIM, having followed Miles up the stairs.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Only darkness and rain for a beat, then Miles 
	materializes, curving around the gargantuan smokestack. 
	He passes us and we SWING AROUND, now looking at the back 
	of his head. He takes three more steps and JASON STEPS 
	INTO THE FOREGROUND. Miles senses his presence and JERKS 
	AROUND, RAISING THE AXE, BRINGING IT DOWN ON JASON'S 
	HEAD...

	...but Jason easily grabs the axe handle before it makes 
	contact, flinging it away.

	EXT. LOWER DECK - ON JULIUS

	He's pacing along when a clattering noise from above 
	makes him stop. Suddenly MILES' AXE THUDS INTO THE 
	MAHOGANY DECK NEXT TO HIS FOOT. Julius gazes at it, 
	jerking his head upward.

				JULIUS
		Miles??

	His answer is a LOUD CRACK OF LIGHTNING. At the same 
	time:

	RUNNING WITH MILES

	He's scrambling as fast as he can across the slippery 
	deck as the monster relentlessly pursues him.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	He's having no problem catching up to the defenseless 
	teenager.

	EXT. DECK STAIRS - SAME TIME

	as Julius zooms up them to aid his comrade.

	EXT. RADAR MAST - NIGHT

	as Miles slides up to the mast and begins scaling it. He 
	glances downward and sees:

	MILES' POINT OF VIEW

	Jason is right at his heels.

	MILES

	slips on a rung, regains control, and continues upward. 
	He makes it three more steps, almost at the uppermost 
	point when JASON GRABS THE BACK OF HIS COAT, TEARING HIM 
	OFF THE MAST.

	STUNT FREEFALL

	Miles cries out as he FREEFALLS BACKWARDS, somersaulting 
	and twisting like he's doing one of his better dives...

	CLOSE UP - MILES' FACE  

	...Empty space for a half-second, then MILES' FACE JOLTS 
	INTO FRAME with a look of ultimate agony. Something has 
	abruptly stopped his fall. Something quite fatal.

	EXT. DECK - ON JULIUS

	coming around a corner, stopping dead in his tracks, his 
	stomach wrenching as his eyes fall on:

	MILES (EFX)

	...who is staring right back at him with dead pupils. 
	MILES HAS BEEN HORRIBLY IMPALED OM A SHIP FLAGPOLE.

	JULIUS

	doesn't get the chance to grasp the reality of it because 
	JASON'S HAND GRIPS HIS SHOULDER, SPINS HIM AROUND AND 
	SLUGS HIM SQUARELY IN THE FACE. The force of it sends the 
	boxer REELING BACKWARDS OFF THE RAILING...

	EXT. STORMY OCEAN (TANK)

	...and Julius SPLASHES INTO THE ROUGH SEA. He's quickly 
	swallowed by the torrential waters.

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	as Rennie's HAND jiggles her doorknob again, confirming 
	that it's locked tight. RISE to find her desperate face; 
	she begins furiously pacing and we DOLLY BEHIND HER 
	...but Rennie stops cold upon hearing:

				YOUNG JASON (O.S.)
		Hhhhelp....me....

	Rennie whirls into a CLOSE UP, staring with disbelief at:

	YOUNG JASON (EFX)

	...who is standing on the oval rug in her stateroom, his 
	hands reaching out to her. But then comes the 
	inexplicable: THE OVAL RUG TURNS INTO LAKE WATER AND 
	JASON SINKS INTO IT. He's drowning in the middle of her 
	room, choking on murky water.

				YOUNG JASON
		Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...

	RENNIE

	stands frozen, feeling herself drawn to him like a 
	magnet. She crawls to the edge of her rug, which is now a 
	deep lake, and extends her arms to him.

	YOUNG JASON

	grabs her hand, pulling hard, then grinning wide.

	RENNIE

	feels the skin on her face crawling off her skull, her 
	eyes expanding because she's now looking at:

	HERSELF!

	Rennie is holding onto herself, about four years younger 
	in a bathing suit, drowning in the lake. YOUNG RENNIE.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		Hhhhelp....me....

	RENNIE

	screams with guttural fear, letting go of herself, 
	watching her younger self drown in the hole in her room.

	YOUNG RENNIE

	disappears under the surface of the water...which seconds 
	later CHANGES BACK INTO HER OVAL RUG.

	NEW ANGLE

	as Rennie moves away, tears rolling down her face, 
	utterly confused. She backs against the wall next to her 
	porthole window and THE REAL JASON'S FIST SMASHES THROUGH 
	THE WINDOW, GRABBING HER THROAT. Rennie struggles, 
	gasping for air as he attempts to strangle her.

	CLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND

	groping for a weapon to stop him, her fingers skittering 
	across her table like a spider.

	TWO SHOT - RENNIE AND JASON

	Her head is pulled taut against the wall just below the 
	porthole, with Jason's hideous mask framed in the 
	circular shattered window. She's slowly dying.

	CLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND

	Her movements slow as the oxygen leaves her system. But 
	Rennie's fingers miraculously find a recognizable object: 
	the ink-dip pen given to her by Miss Van Deusen. She 
	seizes it, getting a firm grip.

	CLOSE ON JASON

	as Rennie JABS THE PEN BACKWARDS, SENDING THE SHARP 
	INSTRUMENT THROUGH THE EYEHOLE OF HIS MASK. Jason 
	instantly releases her, reeling backwards.

	RENNIE

	sinks to the floor, scrambling on all fours to get as far 
	away from the porthole as possible. She makes it across 
	the room to her stateroom door just as:

	THE DOOR

	is SLAMMED OPEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE. She shrieks in 
	terror but it's SEAN who is standing there.

				SEAN
		Rennie...??

				RENNIE
			(pointing)
		The window...

	Sean rushes to the shattered porthole, looking out, 
	seeing nothing. He steps back to her.

				RENNIE
		I don't understand what is happening 
		to me...

	She breaks down; he holds her.

				SEAN
		It's gonna be okay...

	INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX)

	...but Sean couldn't be more wrong. The flames are 
	lapping at the fuel pump and hoses, furiously burning 
	down into the tank. A second later the whole thing 
	EXPLODES IN A BALL OF FIRE.

	EXT. SHIP HULL - UNDERWATER (EFX/MODEL?)

	as a huge HOLE is blown through the thick steel hull:

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

	The ship noticeably rocks from the explosion. Rennie 
	clings to him fearfully.

				RENNIE
		What is it??

	One second later, the lights begin to flicker.

				SEAN  
		The power room...

	INT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)

	as huge amounts of water rush in from a gaping hole in 
	the hull.

	INT. SHIP KITCHEN - SAME TIME

	as the overhead lights flicker over McCulloch. There's 
	some fear mixed with the anger as he grips his flare gun, 
	moving onward.

	PONT OF VIEW FROM KITCHEN OVENS

	Someone is crouched behind a massive convection oven, 
	spying on McCulloch.

	MCCULLOCH

	almost flinches when the lights die and he's plunged 
	into blackness. He moves forward, every step tentative. 
	He passes the convection ovens and we REMAIN on them, 
	spotting the frightened face of the DECK HAND in the 
	shadows. The deranged old man is very sober now, 
	clutching a LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE for defense.

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

	Sean paces feverishly in the blackness of her room, 
	trying to think, talking to himself.

				SEAN
		Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, 
		assess the damage and act 
		accordingly...

				RENNIE
		Is the ship going to sink??

	He returns to Rennie, the panic settling back in.

				SEAN
		I don't know.

	Her ultimate fear is staring her straight in the face. 
	Suddenly the dim blue lights flicker on.

				SEAN
		The emergency lights just kicked in...

	Sean makes Rennie look into his eyes. His words are meant 
	to convince himself as much as Rennie.

				SEAN
		We'll be okay. I want you to wait by 
		the lifeboats, just in case.

				RENNIE
			(terrified)
		I'm not going near any lifeboat!

				SEAN
		But Rennie...

				RENNIE
		I'm not!!

	INT. SHIP RESTAURANT ROOM - SAME TIME

	as Miss Van Deusen gathers a handful of students who are 
	panicking, sitting them down.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Everybody wait right here until I come 
		back with the others -- understand?

	They nod, frightened to death. She dashes away, carrying 
	us into a view of the dining room windows. No one 
	notices the SILHOUETTE OF JASON passing by on the outside 
	desk.

	INT. ENGINE ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)

	Sea water is pouring into the ship's motors. Clouds of 
	steam and black smoke fill the room as the engine 
	bearings begin to GRIND.

	INT. SHIP HALLWAY - SAME TIME

	as McCulloch rushes up to Rennie's already open door, 
	cautiously entering with flare gun raised.

				MCCULLOCH
		Rennie??

	MCCULLOCH'S POINT OF VIEW

	The room is empty, shards of the porthole glass scattered 
	across her rug. He steps over to it, bringing his head up 
	to the gaping hole, peering outside. We wait for his 
	attack...but it doesn't come. McCulloch's eyes take us to 
	something across the room. The bathroom door is afar.

	MCCULLOCH

	cautiously steps up to the door, silently grabbing the 
	knob and SWINGING IT OPEN. It's empty. He hears 
	something, spinning around. Again, nothing is there. 
	McCulloch quickly moves to the telephone and dials. A few 
	seconds pass.

				MCCULLOCH
		Come on, answer!!

	INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME

	TIGHT on the bridge telephone, ringing repeatedly. RISE 
	TO FIND JASON, ignoring the phone, scrutinizing the deck 
	below through rain-streaked windows.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	Miss Van Deusen is darting across the deck, gathering up 
	a trio of terrified seniors.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	Jason methodically moves to the bank of switches, 
	studying them.

	INSERT - CONSOLE

	In large, unmistakable letters over a red button are the 
	words "ABANDON SHIP ALARM." He flips back the plastic 
	safety cover, exposing the button.

	INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - SAME TIME  

	A horrible grinding sound echoes through the narrow 
	corridor. Sean and Rennie appear at the opposite end, 
	coughing on the black smoke which clouds their 
	passageway. Sean looks down, seeing that they are 
	standing in a puddle of water.

				SEAN
		Water has gotten to the engines.
			(coughs)
		We have to get everybody off this 
		ship...

	INSERT - ABANDON SHIP BUTTON

	as Jason presses it with firm deliberation, and:

	INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - CONTINUOUS

	A WHOOPING SIREN blasts through the passageway. Sean and 
	Rennie have no time to react because:

	ANGLE - CORRIDOR (EFX)

	A sealed compartment door EXPLODES OPEN WITH THE PRESSURE 
	OF SEA WATER...

	REVERSE ANGLE (EFX)

	...and a WALL OF WATER ENGULFS.RENNIE AND SEAN, KNOCKING 
	THEM DOWN. Sean fights to pull her up, but not in time 
	for her to witness:

	WAYNE'S CHARRED CORPSE (EFX)

	which bobs up in front of her. Rennie cries out, 
	scrambling to grab onto Sean as what's left of Wayne's 
	body washes past them.

	EXT. DECK - NIGHT

	as a door opens and Miss Van Deusen guides a half-dozen 
	SENIORS over to the LIFEBOAT STATIONS.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(shouting over storm)
		Everybody climb in!

	They follow her orders as the Abandon Ship alarm wretches 
	on. But little do they know that:

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	Someone is briskly moving towards the group and Miss Van 
	Deusen. Just as we are within a few feet of her... 

	REVERSE ANGLE

	--It's MCCULLOCH who's approached them. He grabs Miss Van 
	Deusen, shaking her violently.

				MCCULLOCH
		What did you do with Rennie??

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Nothing! I went to her cabin and...

	McCulloch rushes off before she can finish. Miss Van 
	Deusen turns back to the other kids, helping them into 
	the boat.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Everybody hurry...please...

	EXT. DECK - CLOSE ON MAHOGANY DECKING - SAME TIME

	We slowly DOLLY BACKWARDS until Miles' AXE comes into 
	frame, still stuck in the mahogany decking. A beat, then 
	JASON'S HALAL DISLODGES IT FROM THE WOOD.

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	as Sean climbs up from below, soaked to the bone, pulling 
	up a half-conscious Rennie. Sean carries her around a 
	corner, where he collides with McCulloch. McCulloch 
	pulls Rennie away from him.

				MCCULLOCH
		She never should've set foot on this 
		ship. This is your fault!

				SEAN
		This is Jason's fault!

				MCCULLOCH
			(shouting)
		Not another word, do you hear me??

	EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - NIGHT

	as Miss Van Deusen throws the "down" lever and the 
	lifeboat hoist begins to lower the boat. Camera SLOWLY 
	CREEPS IN A SEMI-CIRCLE AS A SILHOUETTED FIGURE STEPS 
	INTO A POOL OF LIGHT BEHIND HER. JASON.

	ANGLE - LIFEBOAT  

	One of the students screams, the others clinging together 
	upon the sight of this infamous monster. But the boat is 
	already over the edge, past the point of return. And 
	lowering at a snail's pace.

	MISS VAN DEUSEN

	turns to see JASON APPROACHING THEM WITH AXE RAISED. She 
	backs away but Jason ignores her, heading directly for 
	the hoist. He arches back with his weapon and SLICES 
	DOWNWARD.

	INSERT - HOIST CABLE (SECOND UNIT)

	as Jason's axe CHOPS THE CABLE IN TWO, and:

	EXT. SHIP/OCEAN (TANK)

	The bow cable SNAPS, DUMPING THE HALF DOZEN TEENAGERS 
	INTO THE TURBULENT SALT WATER. They last about five 
	seconds before succumbing to a drowning death.

	MISS VAN DEUSEN

	sees it all, her intestines constricting in agonizing 
	knots. She summons all her rationale and sends it down to 
	her legs, running away as fast as she can.

	MISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW

	--knocking down deck tables, chairs and chaise lounges as 
	she flees. The creative writing teacher swerves around a 
	column, heading for an interior door, sliding to a stop 
	as it BANGS OPEN IN FRONT OF HER. McCulloch steps 
	outside, carrying Rennie, with Sean right behind her. 
	Rennie is conscious now, squirming free of her uncle upon 
	the sight of Miss Van Deusen.

	ANGLE TO INCLUDE ALL

	as Rennie rushes into Miss Van Deusen's arms. The teacher 
	holds her, beginning to cry herself.

				MCCULLOCH
		Why aren't you with the others, 
		woman??

	Finally the message comes forth:

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Jason...he has an axe...

	His face grows taut with anger.

				MCCULLOCH
		Jason Voorhees is dead!!

	A PRIMAL SCREAM OF AGONY immediately cries out behind 
	them, the words unintelligible. They turn around to 
	witness THE DECK HANG STAGGERING TOWARDS THEM, GRIPPING 
	THE KITCHEN KNIFE. 

	MCCULLOCH

	raises the flare gun with zero hesitation and FIRES IT...

	ANGLE - DECK HAND (EFX)

	...and the charge EXPLODES INTO HIS CHEST. He stands 
	there with his chest smoldering, almost like a gargoyle 
	in effigy. A second later the poor old man falls forward, 
	and:

	CLOSE ON HIS BACK (EFX)

	They all see that JASON'S AXE HAS BEEN BURIED IN HIS 
	BACK.

	RETURN TO MASTER

	McCulloch gazes with utter disbelief.

				MCCULLOCH
		Dear Christ...

				SEAN
		We have to get off this ship!!

	They back away from the horrid sight and begin to run, 
	the Abandon Ship alarm still attacking their ears.

	EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - NIGHT

	as McCulloch, Miss Van Deusen, Rennie and Sean scramble 
	to the closest lifeboat.

				SEAN
		Everybody in -- I'll get the hoists

	McCulloch has no time for politeness, moving to the 
	lifeboat ahead of the women. Rennie stops cold, gazing 
	classy-eyed at the small boat.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Come on, sweetheart -- get in...

	But she doesn't budge. McCulloch levels wild eyes on her, 
	quickly climbing back down.

				MCCULLOCH
		Get in the boat, Rennie!

				RENNIE
		I...I can't...

				MCCULLOCH
			(shaking her)
		You can and you will!!

	He tries to slap her out of it, dragging her over to the 
	boat, ignoring her terror-stricken frenzy.

				SEAN
		Stop it!!

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Leave her alone, Charles!

	Miss Van Deusen quickly moves to a hysterical Rennie and 
	holds her, eyeing McCulloch vehemently.

	EXT. DECK - TIGHT ON DEAD DECK HAND - SAME TIME

	as rain begins to wash the blood from his back. JASON'S 
	FOOT TRUDGES INTO FRAME...then his HAND REACHES DOWN, 
	RETRIEVING HIS AXE FROM THE DECK HAND'S SPINE.

	EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - SAME TIME

	as Rennie clings to	 Miss Van Deusen, crying.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		It's the only way, Rennie. Let's get 
		in the boat now, okay? Please...for 
		me?

	Rennie finds herself nodding. Miss Van Deusen helps the 
	trembling girl up the steps, an angered McCulloch right 
	behind.

	INT. LIFEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	as Rennie climbs over the boat edge, RECOILING AT THE 
	SOUND OF A SNARLING DOG. Toby is curled up in the 
	corner of the lifeboat, teeth bared.

				RENNIE
		Toby...

	She climbs in, moving to her equally, relieved dog, 
	McCulloch and Miss Van Deusen right behind her.

	INSERT - HOIST BUTTON (SECOND UNIT)

	as Sean jabs it and the hoist motor kicks in.

	EXT. SHIP - WIDE SHOT (EFX)

	just as a huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING cracks over the smoke 
	stack and upper deck. JASON steps out from behind it, 
	gaping down on them with frightening omnipresence. 
	Gripping the bloody axe.

	EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - CONTINUOUS

	Sean climbs in the boat as it continues to lower. He 
	takes one look back at the ship and sees:

	JASON

	rapidly moving down the staircase towards them. Sean's 
	view is CUT OFF as the lifeboat sinks below deck level.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	as Sean's eyes dart around, down to the sea, up at the 
	hoist.

				SEAN
		Come on...faster....

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	trampling towards the hoist, about thirty feet away now. 
	The boat has already disappeared over the edge.

	EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the lifeboat continues to lower, about ten feet from 
	making contact with the tumultuous ocean. The ship's hull 
	is crooked and sinking.

	TRACKING WITH JASON

	as he relentlessly moves to the hoist cable, raising his 
	axe.

	EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA (TANK)

	as the ship finally touches water, and:

	INSERT - HOIST CABLE (SECOND UNIT

	Jason's axe blade CHOPS THE CABLE...

	EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA (TANK)

	...and the hoist cable falls limply over them. Jason's 
	too late. Sean looks up and sees:

	JASON

	standing by the hoist, hovering over the edge. Very 
	angry.

	SEAN (TANK)

	grabs an oar, turning back to McCulloch.

				SEAN
		Start rowing!!

	McCulloch takes the oar as Miss Van Deusen holds onto 
	Rennie tightly, the girl's eyes squeezed shut. Sean looks 
	up at the ship again, and:

	SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW

	Jason is none.

	EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA (TANK)

	Sean looks around with confusion as huge waves, wind and 
	rain pummel them.

				SEAN
		He's gone...

	POINT OF VIEW FROM WATER (TANK)

	...or is he? We're moving towards the lifeboat at water 
	level, almost like a shark preparing for attack.

	INT. LIFEBOAT (TANK)

	Sean breathes with some relief, resuming his rowing with 
	McCulloch. They get about three strokes apiece before:

	A DARK FIGURE (TANK)

	lunges from under the ocean surface, grabbing onto 
	Sean. Everybody SCREAMS...but it's JULIUS, gasping for 
	oxygen, spitting up seawater. Sean pulls him over the 
	edge.

				SEAN
		It's Julius!

	Miss Van Deusen moves to help him and we:

								 SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. STORMY OCEAN - WIDE SHOT - DAY (SECOND UNIT)

	The ship is gone now, the lifeboat a speck in the ocean.

	INT. LIFEBOAT - DAY (OCEAN?)

	The water is less rough now, the rain replaced with fog. 
	Julius has taken McCulloch's place behind an oar; 
	McCulloch is flanking his shivering niece with Miss Van 
	Deusen.

				MCCULLOCH
			(miserable)
		If we don't find the shore soon we're 
		all going to die.

	Sean tries to ignore him, keeping his mind on rowing.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(unable to hide fear)
		Do you know where we are, Sean?

	Sean pauses, utterly exhausted. He thinks for a moment, 
	remembering his father's gift. Sean reaches into his coat 
	pocket, removing the pocket navigational calculator. He 
	stares at it long and hard. Julius looks over at him, 
	seeing that Sean is on the verge of tears. He grips his 
	shoulder.

				JULIUS
		Hey man, if I can make it, so can. 
		you.

	Sean slowly nods, turning on the calculator.

								  SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the lifeboat rows into frame, the water relatively 
	calm.

	INT. LIFEBOAT - NIGHT (TANK)

	McCulloch, Rennie and Miss Van Deusen are asleep, Sean 
	and Julius rowing on sheer will power. Sean takes one 
	more stroke, feels himself passing out, then regains his 
	coherence again. Julius glances off the side of the ship 
	for no particular reason, then does a doubletake.

	JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.)

	They are rowing right past THE STATUE OF LIBERTY, 
	illuminated in all its glory.

	INT. LIFEBOAT (TANK)

	Julius feels his eyes widening and a huge smile taking 
	control of his haggard face. He tugs on Sean's sleeve, 
	his eyes never leaving the monument.

				JULIUS
		Hey man, wake up! Check it out!!

	The other stir as well, opening their eyes, not sure if 
	it's some kind of vision or if they are genuinely here.

				JULIUS
		God damn, we're in New York! You did 
		it, my man!!

	Julius howls with delight, Miss Van Deusen hugging Rennie 
	as Julius gives Sean the high-five. Toby barks.

	WIDE SHOT - NEW YORK HARBOR - NIGHT (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.)

	as the lifeboat rows toward the very famous skyline of 
	Manhattan, twinkling in the near distance. We can hear 
	the faint sound of Julius singing "New York, New York," 
	relieved to be alive. They're going to make it.

	EXT. EMPTY OCEAN - ANOTHER ANGLE (TANK)

	as the sound of Julius' voice grows fainter. The water 
	begins to ripple...then the top half of a HOCKEY MASK 
	BREAKS THE SURFACE FOR A BREATH OF AIR, SINKING AGAIN. 
	And swimming onward.

	EXT. CANNERY HARBOR - NIGHT

	as Julius and Sean row the lifeboat up to a narrow barge 
	beneath deserted dock warehouses. They are not in the 
	safest part of town by a longshot.

	CLOSER ANGLE

	as they climb onto the barge. Rennie breathes with relief 
	as she steps off the boat. She takes a final glance back 
	at it and sees:

	YOUNG RENNIE

	flailing her arms in the water right next to the 
	lifeboat, drowning.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		Hhhhelp...me....

	Suddenly a DECOMPOSED HAND REACHES UP FROM BELOW, 
	GRABBING HER, DRAGGING HER UNDER.

	EXT. BARGE - ON RENNIE

	She gazes in utter shock, screaming:

				RENNIE
		No!!!

	They all follow her eyeline...but the water is calm, 
	nothing there.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(holding her)
		It's okay...you're safe now...

	McCulloch grits his teeth.

				MCCULLOCH
		Come on -- everybody up the ladder.

	He's the first one up. Sean looks at Rennie, concerned, 
	then hoists Toby up in his arms. They all begin climbing 
	the ladder.

	CLOSE ON LADDER - NIGHT

	as the last pair of feet disappear over the top edge of 
	the dock. Camera PANS back down the rungs, finding the 
	lifeboat and barge again. Suddenly JASON SPRINGS FROM THE 
	WATER, CLIMBING ONTO THE BARGE. He gazes up at his new 
	surroundings, quite different from all the years he's 
	spent at Crystal Lake. But an item at the far end of the 
	dock causes him the longest pause...

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	A tattered billboard over one of the warehouses 
	advertises the NEW YORK RANGERS HOCKEY TEAM, featuring a 
	full shot of the HOCKEY-MASKED GOALIE.

	JASON

	looks at it long and hard. He tears off his life 
	preserver wits renewed ambition.

	WIDE SHOT - BARGE AND DOCK WAREHOUSES - NIGHT

	as Jason heads up the ladder. He's about to take 
	Manhattan.

	EXT. CANNERY WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT  

	as our survivors head into an isolated, foreboding group 
	of dock warehouses and alleys.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		There must be a phone around here 
		somewhere.

				MCCULLOCH
		A wonderful choice of places to dock a 
		boat, Mr. Robertson.

	Sean looks away, trying to keep from losing his temper.

	PREDATOR'S POINT OF VIEW - SAME TIME

	We're spying on them from behind a stack of crates as 
	they come in our direction. Waiting for the right moment.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	as they move towards the stack of crates. Without 
	warning, a PAIR OF GANG BANGERS JUMP OUT, BOTH HOLDING 
	GUNS. Nervous young druggies.

				GANG RANGER #1
		Hands up!!

				GANG BANGER #2  
		Do it!!

	All hands go up. Gang Banger #2 grabs McCulloch's watch 
	and wallet, skimming through a wad of bills and credit 
	cards while #1 keeps them covered.

				GANG BANGER #2
		Got some good shit here, holmes.

				GANG BANGER #1
			(eyeing Rennie)
		You got that right...

	He steps over to Rennie, brushing her hair back with the 
	barrel of his revolver, spotting the Statue of Liberty 
	pendant Sean gave her.

				GANG BANGER #L
		Now ain't that sweet.

	He tears it off her neck, pocketing it. Sean angrily 
	moves toward him and Gang Banger #l shoves the barrel 
	against Rennie's temple.

				GANG BANGER #1
		Go ahead, superman. Be a hero.

	Sean has no choice but to freeze. Julius flexes his 
	fists, but he too has Gang Banger #2's gun leveled on 
	him. McCulloch stares at the thugs with obvious contempt. 
	It doesn't go unnoticed.

				GANG BANGER #L
		You got a problem, Dad?

	McCulloch offers some rare silence, shaking a "no" to the 
	gun-toting kid. Rennie's dog-begins to growl, backing 
	away, ready to defend her. Gang Banger #1 points his 
	barrel at Toby with zero conscience, cocking back the 
	hammer.

				RENNIE
		No!

	She pushes his arm to the side just as the bullet 
	FIRES...

	ANGLE - TOBY

	as the bullet tears up asphalt next to the dog's paws. 
	Toby sprints off into the darkness.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	Gang Banger #1 grabs Rennie by the hair, brutally jerking 
	her head back.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Please, don't hurt her...

				GANG BANGER #L
		Hurt this princess?
			(beat)
		Would I do that?

	They cough out laughs. Gang Banger #1 looks into Rennie's 
	eyes, his barrel still on her skin.

				GANG BANGER #1
		You look like a party girl, princess. 
		How'd you like to go on a date with me 
		and my friend? If you're free, that 
		is.

	More phlegm-filled laughs. He drags her away, Gang Banger 
	#2 backing away with him with his gun still trained on 
	the others.

				GANG BANGER #2
		You follow and we'll blow her fuckin' 
		head off, comprende?

	The others watch helplessly as Rennie is abducted.

				JULIUS
		We can't let those gang-bangers get 
		away, man...

	Julius starts to move after them. McCulloch grabs him.

				MCCULLOCH
		You heard him! We have to call the 
		police

	Julius jerks away from McCulloch's grasp. But he knows 
	McCulloch	is right.

				MCCULLOCH
		Everyone split up -- we'll cover more 
		ground that way.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I don't think that's such a safe idea

				MCCULLOCH
		My niece's life hangs in the balance 
		right now!! Every second counts.

	No more rebuttal. They hurry off.

	EXT. GANG BANGER'S LAIR - NIGHT

	It's a narrow passageway between warehouses...decrepit 
	brownstones with shattered chicken-wire windows, moss 
	growing on the bricks. The Gang Bangers appear with 
	Rennie, dragging her down some concrete steps.

				GANG BANGER #L
		Welcome to the casbah, princess.

	PAN AROUND with them as they walk through a thick blanket 
	of STEAM which pours out of a factory vent. We MOVE 
	through the mist with them, revealing a tattered, rain-
	soaked couch and chair, upholstery shredded. A spool once 
	used for telephone wire functions as their coffee table. 
	They splash through puddles, throwing her down on the 
	couch.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	--looking back at the steam vent. JASON APPEARS IN THE 
	BILLOWING MIST.

	CLOSE UP - SYRINGE

	as a yellowish liquid squirts out the dirty needle. WIDEN 
	to find Gang Banger #2 holding it with transfixed eyes, 
	his compadre holding a squirming Rennie down on the 
	couch, tearing back her jacket to reveal a bare arm.

				RENNIE
		Please don't...

				GANG BANGER #1
		Loosen up, baby. It'll feel way
		better if you're stoned.

	CLOSE ON JASON'S FEET - SAME TIME

	Amongst the slime and cigarette butts is a discarded 
	syringe. Jason picks it up.

	CLOSER ANGLE - COUCH

	just as Gang Banger #2 jabs Rennie with the needle. 
	Gang Banger #1 wrestles off his torn leather jacket, 
	pushing Rennie back on the exposed foam padding as his 
	friend watches excitedly.

				GANG BANGER #1
		Slang us some more 'caine, JoJo. We're 
		in for a long night.

	Gang Banger #2 runs out the back way. #1 tears open 
	Rennie's blouse, his filthy mouth moving to her neck. 
	Rennie spits in his face. He hesitates not in SLAPPING 
	HER HARD.

				GANG BANGER #1
		It's your parade, princess. Can be 
		smooth or can be rough. Your choice.

	She closes .her eyes, trying to blot out what's about to 
	happen.

				GANG BANGER #1
		I think I'm in love.

	PUSH IN on his face as his neck arches down, bringing his 
	lips toward her chest. Just before contact he GRUNTS 
	THICKLY, HIS EYES BUGGING OUT.

	WIDER ANGLE

	Jason is standing right behind him, shoving something 
	into his back, out of frame. He thrusts it again, 
	bringing with it one more horrific grunt from the kid. 
	Jason goes for number three and: 

	CLOSE UP - GANG BANGER #1'S CHEST (EFX)

	Jason's syringe gets shoved completely through him, the 
	needle sticking out his front side.

	RENNIE

	opens her eyes, looking into the dead boy's face as 
	blood drips from his mouth. He collapses in front of 
	her, giving way to a view of JASON TOWERING OVER HER. At 
	the same time:

	GANG BANGER #2

	comes around the corner.

				GANG BANGER #2
		Forgot my money, holmes...

	Ha stops dead in his tracks at the sight of Jason.

				GANG BANGER #2
		Who the fuck are you?

	Jason paces toward him. The kid glances at his dead 
	friend arched over the couch, quickly whipping out his 
	.38.

				GANG BANGER #2
		You're dead, fuckhead.

	BANG!

	...but Jason keeps on coming. Five shots later and 
	Jason's still standing, easily picking up the slime ball 
	and SHOVING HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE MOSSY BRICK WALL. The 
	kid falls in a bloody heap.

	RENNIE

	shoves Gang Banger #1 off of her as Jason returns his 
	attention to her. She grabs a loose brick and FLINGS IT 
	AT HIM, CRACKING HIS HOCKEY MASK, momentarily 
	disorienting him. Rennie sprints away.

	EXT. ALLEY #1 - NIGHT (LONG LENS)

	as Julius runs into view, looking down a menacing alley, 
	spotting a phone booth. He hurries for it.

	PREDATOR'S POINT OF VIEW

	Like a cat watching a bird, we watch Julius head for the 
	booth.

	JULIUS

	slams open the booth door, grabbing the receiver, 
	punching the "operator" digit. SLOWLY PUSH IN on him as 
	he waits for an answer. Several more rings.

				JULIUS
		C'mon...

	Finally a click and muffled words from the operator.

				JULIUS
		Get me the police -- this is an 
		emergency...

				

	SMASH! as JASON'S FIST CRASHES THROUGH THE BOOTH WINDOW, 
	GRABBING JULIUS BY THE THROAT. Julius grips Jason's scaly 
	arm with all his strength, staring at the cracked hockey 
	mask framed in the shattered window. Julius summons all 
	his strength, tearing free of Jason's grasp and running 
	out the door. The phone is left dangling.

	RUNNING WITH JULIUS (HAND HELD)

	with no apparent direction. Literally running for his 
	life.

	TRACKING WITH JASON

	He's just as quick, but smoother and more methodical.

	JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (HAND HELD)

	heading up the alley, spotting a fire escape, diverting 
	his course straight for it.

	ANGLE - FIRE ESCAPE

	as Julius LEAPS ONTO IT, dragging himself up, climbing as 
	fast as is humanly possible.

	ANGLE - JASON

	...but Jason is-far from human, easily negotiating the 
	wrought-iron stairs and rapidly catching up.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

	as Julius' head appears, clawing his way onto the tar-
	papered surface, running to the opposite side. A second 
	later, JASON HOPS UP RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	as Julius soon learns the awful truth that the only way 
	up is the only way down...with the exception of a head-
	splitting freefall. No way is he gonna jump. Julius turns 
	back to Jason, raising his fists, psyching himself up for 
	the fight of his life. He whispers to himself:

				JULIUS
		Use the combos and keep the feet 
		light...

	THE FIGHT BEGINS, man against monster, each sizing the 
	other up. 
	Jason takes the first swing, Julius deftly dodging him 
	and countering with left-right-left combination. They 
	have absolutely no effect. Julius follows up with a round 
	of kidney punches. Again, nothing. Julius finds himself 
	being forced back against the rings, which in this case 
	is the edge of the roof. He risks a glance backwards and 
	sees:

	JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW

	It's a long, rough way down. It's do or die time.

	RETURN TO SCENE

	as Julius SLAMS PUNCH AFTER PUNCH INTO JASON, forcing him 
	back to the center of the rooftop, spending every last 
	ounce of his energy in doing so. He throws one more 
	feeble punch, knowing it's his last.

				JULIUS
		Take your best shot, motherfucker...

	Jason gladly obliges, winding up and recoiling with a 
	punch none of us expected...

	JULIUS' HEAD (EFX)

	gets literally knocked off his shoulders, cascading off 
	the edge of the rooftop, and:

	ANGLE - SLANTED LOWER ROOF

	--the decapitated head lands on a sloped roof below, 
	rolling down towards street level and falling into a 
	garbage-filled dumpster.

	EXT. ALLEY #2 - NIGHT  

	as Rennie dizzily runs down the alley, the effects of the 
	drugs kicking in.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

	Blurry, disoriented, erratic. Suddenly A FIGURE JUMPS OUT 
	FROM A CORRIDOR IN FRONT OF HER.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	It's SEAN. He rushes to her, sensing her disorientation.

				SEAN
		Rennie...what'd they do to you??

				RENNIE
		Drugs...
			(serious pause)
		Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.

	Oh Jesus. He never expected this.

				SEAN
		We have to find the others.

	Together they run off.

	EXT. ALLEY #3 - NIGHT (OVERHEAD ANGLE)

	as Miss Van Deusen briskly walks below us, far from 
	relaxed in this threatening environment.

	TRACKING SHOT

	She moves forward, the only sound being her shoes against 
	wet asphalt. Four more steps, then a DARK, OUT OF FOCUS 
	FIGURE STEPS OUT BEHIND HER WITH A GUN.

				VOICE
		Freeze.

	RACK FOCUS to find a uniformed IRISH COP standing there, 
	service revolver raised. McCulloch steps out from the 
	alcove as well, recognizing Miss Van Deusen.

				MCCULLOCH
		It's okay -- she's with me.

	She turns around, lowering her hands, utterly relieved.

				IRISH COP
		My apologies, Miss. My unit's right 
		over here.

	They head through an ABANDONED PARKING LOT towards a 
	concrete wall with stairs; about six feet above the wall 
	is an upper street, where his patrol car is parked. They 
	get halfway through the lot when they hear:

				SEAN (O.S.)
		Hey!

	REVERSE ANGLE

	as Sean and Rennie run to join them from the alley. 
	McCulloch rushes to his niece.

				MCCULLOCH
		Rennie, thank God...

	But Rennie goes to Miss Van Deusen instead. It's a bitter 
	pill for McCulloch.

				SEAN
		Jason's here in New York.

				MCCULLOCH
		Don't be ridiculous!

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Is it true, Rennie??

	She nods, unable to repress her fear.

				IRISH COP
		Is this the lass in question?

				MCCULLOCH
			(stewing)
		Yes.

				IRISH COP
		Who is...Jason?

				MCCULLOCH
		He's a walking corpse, a phantasm from 
		hell.

	The others stare at McCulloch angrily. Miss Van Deusen 
	turns to the confused policeman.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I'm afraid you'll have some trouble 
		believing us.

				IRISH COP
		So try me.

	EXT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT

	parked above the abandoned garage, the interior dark. The 
	Cop and our heroes appear in the background, coming 
	towards it.

				IRISH COP
		You're right -- I find it a tall tale 
		indeed. 
		But you seem like honest folks so I'm 
		inclined to believe at least some of 
		it.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(relieved)
		Thank you. The first thing we' have to 
		do is find Julius.

				IRISH COP
		I'm sure he'll pop up soon enough. Why 
		don't you climb in the back while I 
		radio for backup.

	ADJUST INTO A FULL SHOT OF THE BACK DOOR AS HE SWINGS IT 
	OPEN...but even in this darkness, we see that it's 
	empty. They climb in. The Cop opens his drivers door, 
	and...

	INSERT - DOME LIGHT (SECOND UNIT)

	The car dome light blinks on, and...

	ANGLE - BACK SEAT

	Our four survivors' faces are brightly illuminated, 
	INSTANTLY CHANGING TO GASPS AND SCREAMS because:

	THEIR POINT OF VIEW (EFX)

	Julius' severed head is resting on the dash board, 
	staring back at them!!!

	ANGLE - COP

	reacting to their terror, seeing Julius' head, quickly 
	grabbing the radio mike. But he has no time for a message 
	because JASON REACHES UP FROM THE PARKING LOT PIT BELOW, 
	GRABBING THE COP'S ANKLE, DRAGGING HIM DOWN. The radio is 
	still in his grasp.

	INSERT - DISPATCH RADIO (SECOND UNIT)

	as the radio cord grows taut, finally snapping. The 
	Irish cop's awful yell echoes over it, silencing after a 
	sick THUD.

	INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

	The foursome instantly try to flee the car, but police 
	cars have no door handles in the back.

				SEAN
		There aren't any handles!!

	Cocaine flowing through her veins, Rennie acts 
	hyperkinetically, scratching her way over the seats just 
	as:

	JASON

	appears at the parking lot stairs, STALKING STRAIGHT 
	TOWARDS THE CAR.

	INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

	There is no time for escape. Rennie finds the ignition 
	and fires it up, jamming it into drive and STOMPING ON 
	THE ACCELERATOR. Julius' head rolls off the dash, onto 
	the floorboards.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

	Her vision is still a stoned one but clear enough to set 
	her target. We come straight at the abominable creature 
	and:

	WHAM! (EFX)

	Jason is mowed down.

	RENNIE

	slams on the brakes, jerks it into reverse and FLOORS IT 
	AGAIN.

	CLOSE ON JASON (EFX)

	as the automobile grinds back over him a second time.

	RENNIE

	stomps on the brake pedal and the tires SCREECH TO A 
	HALT. They all take a moment to catch their breath, 
	looking out the front window...

	THEIR POINT OF VIEW

	Jason lies dead on the asphalt. For about two seconds. He 
	SLOWLY STANDS.

	RENNIE

	desperately throws it into forward again, gripping the 
	wheel and RACING FORWARD.

	POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)

	Jason's standing there for one second, but the next 
	moment he is LEAPING OUT OF THE WAY...

	EXT. ABANDONED PARKING LOT (STUNT DRIVE)

	...and the squad car SMASHES THROUGH A CHAIN LINK FENCE, 
	FREEFALLING TO THE ABANDONED PARKING LOT BELOW.

	EXT. ALLEY #3 - CONTINUOUS (STUNT DRIVE)

	as the car bottoms out, then swerves into a sharp right 
	turn, racing down the alley.

	POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)

	as Jason appears at the end of the alley, blocking their 
	retreat.

	INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

	as Rennie stomps the brake pedal, jerking it into 
	reverse...

	EXT. ALLEY #3 - CONTINUOUS (STUNT DRIVE)

	as she backs up, changes gears and races down an 
	intersecting alley.

	POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)

	speeding towards an escape when JASON POPS OUT AGAIN! 
	He's everywhere all at once...

	INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

	slamming on the discs one more time, flooring it into 
	reverse.

	CLOSE ON TIRES - CONTINUOUS (SECOND UNIT)

	as the squad car's rear tires smoke and spin, finally 
	gripping pavement.

	POINT OF VIEW OUT REAR WINDOW (STUNT DRIVE)

	as we fly backwards...and JASON APPEARS BEHIND THEM!!

	TIGHT ON REAR VIEW MIRROR

	--Rennie's terrified face filling it, seeing that Jason 
	is in back of them.

	TIGHT ON REAR TIRES (SECOND UNIT)

	as they screech to a halt one final time, rapidly 
	rotating in the opposite direction and speeding out of 
	frame.

	INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

	Rennie is almost maniacal now, her knuckles white around 
	the vinyl wheel, her foot practically mashed through the 
	floorboard.

				MCCULLOCH
		Rennie, for God's sake slow down!!

	She doesn't hear him, or anything for that matter. Her 
	eyes remain straight ahead, never blinking.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

	There's a FIGURE standing in the distance. But it looks 
	too small to be Jason. We RUSH TOWARDS IT, CHANGING INTO 
	SLOW MOTION JUST BEFORE IMPACT. The figure is a dripping 
	wet boy with a sinister smile. YOUNG JASON.

	EXT. BRICK WALL - A SPLIT SECOND LATER (EFX)

	as the front of the squad car RAMS THE BRICK WALL HEAD-
	ON, THE HOOD BURSTING INTO FLAMES.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as the front passenger door is shoved open by Sean, who 
	drags out Rennie. McCulloch follows close behind, helping 
	Sean carry her away from the wreckage, over by a row of 
	old oil drums filled with slime and rainwater. Then it 
	suddenly hits Sean...

				SEAN
		Miss Van Deusen...

	He takes two steps back to the car when:

	BOOM! (EFX)	

	The squad car interior is ENGULFED IN A BALL OF FLAMES.

	RENNIE

	opens her dazed eyes, seeing Miss Van Deusen's body 
	charring inside the wreckage. It's incomprehensible. She 
	numbly gets to her feet, stepping towards it. Something 
	makes her hesitate: she peers down at the asphalt...

	EXT. ASPHALT - RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

	A pool of gasoline has collected, flames dancing across 
	its glassy surface. Suddenly a TINY ROWBOAT DISSOLVES IN, 
	not unlike the lifeboat she was so afraid of. The 
	rowboat glides across the surface of the burning 
	gasoline, TWO PEOPLE RIDING IN IT. The flames and asphalt 
	SLOWLY FADE OUT AND GIVE WAY TO A SERENE LAKE.

	RENNIE'S FLASHBACK - CRYSTAL LAKE - DAY

	Shimmering water, clouds and pine trees reflected in it. 
	The rowboat floats into view. The two occupants are YOUNG 
	RENNIE and MCCULLOCH. She's wearing a bathing suit and an 
	innocent smile. And not an inkling of fear about the 
	water. She stands, letting the sun soak into her.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		What a beautiful day.

				MCCULLOCH
		Perfect for a swim, isn't it?

	She frowns at him, looking away.

				MCCULLOCH
		You've been coming out here every 
		summer for the last three years, young 
		lady, and you still haven't learned 
		how.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		I'll take some lessons this time. I 
		promise.

	She bends over, splashing the water.

				MCCULLOCH
		That's what you said last year. I 
		think the time for your first swimming 
		lesson has just come.

	The splashing stops.

				MCCULLOCH
		You don't want to end up drowning like 
		that Voorhees boy, do you?

	She's instantly tense.

				MCCULLOCH
		He never learned how either and he's 
		still at the bottom of this lake.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		He is not.

				MCCULLOCH
		Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull 
		down anybody who falls in and can't 
		swim.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		You're telling a lie.

				MCCULLOCH
		Am I? Let's find out.

	...And quicker than she's able to react to it, MCCULLOCH 
	PUSHES HER OVERBOARD.

	SPLASH!

	as Rennie's body violently disrupts the calm surface. 
	She immediately begins to flounder. McCulloch calmly 
	leans over the edge.

				MCCULLOCH
		Better swim before Jason drags you 
		down, Rennie. Come on, you can do 
		it...

	...but Rennie thrashes in the water, struggling to keep 
	from sinking under the surface.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

	Her uncle's face blurs and clears as water splashes her 
	eyes.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		I...I can't...

				MCCULLOCH
		You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!

	RENNIE

	is too panicked to obey.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		Hhhhelp...me....

	She coughs on some water then disappears...

	UNDERWATER (TANK)

	The world above her ceases to exist, murky lake water 
	taking over. Rennie looks-down, and to her horror...

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (TANK)

	Young Jason is grabbing her ankle and dragging her 
	down. The whole image BURSTS INTO FLAMES and we:

								  DISSOLVE BACK TO:

	EXT. ASPHALT - NIGHT

	as the gasoline continues to burn, the rowboat gone. 
	ADJUST to find RENNIE'S FACE, the flames of the car 
	wreckage flickering over her glassy eyes. She looks up at 
	Miss Van Deusen's body one last time before:

	ANGLE - SQUAD CAR (EFX)

	The auto's fuel tank EXPLODES, SHRAPNEL FLYING 
	EVERYWHERE.

	EXT. ALLEY #4 - CONTINUOUS

	She looks up at her uncle with knowing eyes. Eyes that 
	tell him she's remembered everything.

				RENNIE
		You pushed me...

				MCCULLOCH
			(defensively)
		I was only trying to teach you. But I 
		pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your 
		life.

	Rennie just stares, incredulous.

				SEAN
		You son of a bitch...

	She lets it build until she's ready to explode...then:

				RENNIE
		He was down there!!!

	And Rennie runs off. McCulloch starts to follow but Sean 
	grabs him, shoving him down.

				SEAN
		You keep away from her!

	Sean chases after Rennie. Camera methodically PANS BACK 
	TO MCCULLOCH, crumpled on the ground. A very bitter man. 
	He wipes his hands, getting ready to stand when THE 
	SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. His skin fades to porcelain white.

				MCCULLOCH
		You...are...NOT POSSIBLE.

	But possible, and actual, he is. A PAIR OF ROTTED ARMS 
	EXTEND DOWN, RIPPING HIM OUT OF FRAME.

	TRACKING WITH JASON

	as the walking corpse lifts a screaming McCulloch over 
	his head, carrying him over to one of the scum-filled OIL 
	DRUMS, SHOVING HIM HEAD-FIRST INTO IT. Jason grips 
	McCulloch's thrashing legs as bubbles rise to the surface 
	of the slime, a pathetic gurgling reverberating out the 
	drum. At last McCulloch's appendages go limp. Jason 
	releases him, moving on.

	EXT. ALLEY #5 - NIGHT

	as Sean runs into view, glancing around, spotting Rennie, 
	crouched against a crumbled brick wall. No tears...only 
	hate. Sean sits down next to her. After several 
	moments...

				RENNIE
		I was at school when they told me. 
		'Rennie, we have some very bad news... 
		your parents have been killed in an 
		auto accident.'

	Sean gently takes her hand, sharing her internal agony.

				RENNIE
		It seems like everybody I care about 
		ends up...

	She can't finish. PUSH IN as Sean kisses her on the 
	forehead, then makes her look into his eyes.

				SEAN
		Not this time.

	He caresses her face; it develops into a tender kiss. 
	Finally she holds him back, letting it out. At the same 
	time:

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	Somebody is creeping at a low angle towards them.

	SEAN AND RENNIE

	are lost in their shared quiet moment...until the 
	GROWLING SOUND becomes audible. They look up, seeing:

	TOBY

	cautiously approaching them. Rennie stands, absolutely 
	relieved.

				RENNIE
		Toby...

	She starts to move towards him and her dog SNARLS 
	VICIOUSLY, CROUCHING BACK IN FEAR.

				RENNIE
		What's wrong, boy?

	Another protective growl, then:

	CRASH!

	as Jason stampedes through a stack of crates and garbage 
	cans behind them.

	SEAN, RENNIE AND TOBY

	abruptly flee down the alley, Jason in mad pursuit.	

	EXT. ALLEY/SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

	as Rennie, Sean and the dog run straight towards us, 
	Jason swiftly catching up. FAST TRACK WITH THEM over to a 
	deserted, rain-slicked SUBWAY ENTRANCE.

	INT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS (EFX)

	as they bang through the glass doors, sailing past us. 
	Three beats later, JASON APPEARS, not bothering to open 
	the door, STAMPEDING RIGHT THROUGH THE GLASS.

	INT. SUBWAY STATION - ESCALATORS (N.Y.)

	Sean, Rennie and Toby sail down the escalators past a few 
	scattered COMMUTERS. Again, Jason appears, looming tall 
	at the top. He starts down the "up" escalator.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (ICY.)

	as an ELDERLY COUPLE rises toward us. Their reactions 
	grow more bleak the closer we get, finally registering 
	terror as we plow right through them.

	ANGLE - SUBWAY TURNSTILES (ICY.)

	Sean and Rennie hop over a metal turnstile, Toby crawling 
	under it. A TICKET TAKER leans out his window, shouting 
	at them.

				TICKET TAKER
		Hey!

	The teenagers are soon forgotten as JASON SMASHES THROUGH 
	THE TURNSTILE LIKE THE TERMINATOR, TEARING THE ALUMINUM 
	WHEEL RIGHT OFF ITS BASE. The Ticket Taker reacts 
	speechlessly, deciding not to press his luck.

	INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)

	as Sean and Rennie slide up to the edge of the track pit, 
	SEEING THE LIGHTS OF AN APPROACHING TRAIN which is taking 
	too long to get there.

				SEAN
		Come on...

	...but Jason arrives before the train. Toby barks and 
	snarls, trying to protect them. Jason is unfazed. He 
	treads toward them and:

	DOG TOBY

	leaps onto Jason, sinking his teeth into the monster's 
	throat. Jason wrestles the animal into submission just 
	as:

	THE SUBWAY TRAIN

	streaks into the station. A fraction of time later:

	JASON

	heaves the dog in front of the train.

	RENNIE

	shrieks in horror as Toby disappears inside the pit just 
	as the train roars by.

	ANGLE - ONLOOKERS

	They're New Yorkers, but not callous enough to stomach 
	this, quickly scattering. Even a group of severe 
	SKINHEADS decide they can wait for the next train, 
	quickly heading up the escalators after seeing Jason in 
	action.

	SEAN

	makes Rennie look away, dragging her with him along the 
	platform edge in retreat as Jason returns his attention 
	to them. They reach the end of the platform, having no 
	choice but to board the front car.

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN (N.Y.)

	as the doors whoosh shut...but Jason PRIES THEM OPEN. The 
	TRAIN ENGINEER glances back from his booth, seeing Jason 
	making the improper entry.

				TRAIN ENGINEER
		Hey pal, you can't do that...

	A second later he's gotten a good look at Jason. It's too 
	late for a retraction as JASON SAVAGELY JAMS HIS HEAD 
	INTO THE TRAIN CONSOLE.

	INSERT - TRAIN CONSOLE

	as the Engineer's arm KNOCKS THE THROTTLE FORWARD...

	EXT. SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)

	...and the train begins to move, racing into the black 
	tunnel.

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	as Rennie and Sean run for their lives, arriving at the 
	end of a car, jamming the separating doors open and 
	entering the next car. Jason follows right behind.

	INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	as the train thunders through the station without 
	stopping, baffling several waiting COMMUTERS.

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (N.Y.)

	--seeing Sean and Rennie disappear through another 
	connecting door. We storm our way through it into the 
	next car right after them. A handful of TRAVELERS cower 
	away from us.

	INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	as the train rapidly speeds past us, showing no signs of 
	slowing down.

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - FINAL CAR (N.Y.)

	as Sean and Rennie come through another set of separating 
	doors, rushing through... finding they're in the last 
	car. They look back, seeing Jason enter at the opposite 
	end. The monster stalks forward. Sean's eyes dart 
	around. He spots the EMERGENCY STOP CORD. HE LEAPS FOR 
	IT.

	EXT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	...and the train SCREECHES TO A HALT.

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)

	The sudden stop throws Jason on his back. Sean throws the 
	rear door open, jumping out with Rennie.

	INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	as Sean and Rennie sprint down the center of the tracks 
	toward the light of the next station, running out of 
	strength.

	INT. TIMES SQUARE STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	as they emerge from the darkness, up to the edge of the 
	pit. Sean boosts Rennie up, starting to climb up himself 
	when:

	JASON

	fires out from the tunnel, grabbing onto Sean's ankle. 
	Rennie screams as Sean is dragged down...but he manages 
	to latch onto a chain securing a garbage receptacle. 
	Jason pulls harder, stretching Sean to his limit as 
	Rennie watches helplessly.

				RENNIE
		NO!!!

	RENNIE

	runs straight towards the track pit like a football 
	punter, RECOILING WITH HER RIGHT LEG, KICKING JASON 
	SQUARELY IN THE FACE.

	JASON (EFX)

	trips backwards and LANDS ON THE THIRD, ELECTRIFIED RAIL, 
	RECEIVING TEN THOUSAND VOLTS. His body smokes and 
	convulses, finally sizzling out. He appears to be 
	terminated!!!

	ANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE

	as they get to their feet, holding each other tight, 
	looking down on the now-dead undead creature.

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.) (CRANE SHOT)

	as our heroes arise into the neon-filled big city 
	wonderland, relieved to be alive, gazing around at the 
	awesome spectacle known as Times Square. A huge DIGITAL 
	CLOCK tells us it's a quarter to midnight. Sean wraps his 
	arm around her.

				SEAN
		It's over, Rennie. It's finally over.

	Camera RISES ABOVE THEM, RACKING BACK TO THE SUBWAY EXIT. 
	Guess who has just made an encore...with more energy 
	than ever!!!

	SEAN AND RENNIE

	look all around them, having never been to a city as big 
	as this. They finally turn far enough around to spot 
	JASON in a series of three quick cuts, each one closer 
	than the last.

				SEAN
		God...please no...

	But Jason keeps on coming.

				RENNIE
		Somebody help us!! He's going to kill 
		us!!!

	But the heavy Times Square foot traffic ignores her, 
	bustling onward. Rennie and Sean have no choice but to 
	flee again.

	JASON

	shoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians; 
	they've certainly seen weirder characters than him here. 
	He moves past a group of STREET URCHINS listening to some 
	rap from their ghetto blaster. His foot obliterates 
	their stereo system with one stride. They instantly pull 
	out switchblades and chains.

				STREET URCHIN
		You're dead meat, slime bag.

	Jason stops, turning around, towering over the kids. He 
	has blood and gore caked everywhere, his skin charred 
	from the electrocution. Jason starts to remove his mask, 
	facing them squarely.

	TIGHT ON STREET URCHINS

	as Jason's mask comes off out-of-frame. Their tough faces 
	turn to putty, scared completely shitless.

				STREET URCHIN
		Hey man, it's cool, it's cool...

	They turn tail and race like the wind. Jason steps 
	forward so that we're looking at the back of his head, 
	never seeing his naked face. He slips his hockey mask on 
	again, turns into a CLOSE UP, then exits.

	INT. TIMES SQUARE DINER - NIGHT

	filled with noise, smoke and derelicts. A tough, 
	redheaded WAITRESS with a thick Brooklyn accent stands 
	behind the countertop, a wall of mirrors behind her. The 
	front door bangs open with the entrance of Sean and 
	Rennie, rushing up to the waitress.

				SEAN
			(out of breath)
		You have to call the police...

				RENNIE
		Please, hurry...

	A telephone sits right next to her, but this is New York.

				WAITRESS
		There's a pay phone in back.

	They start to run.

				WAITRESS
		...but it's broken.

				RENNIE
		You don't understand -- there's a 
		maniac trying to kill us!!!

				WAITRESS
			(blase)
		Welcome to New York.

	There's no time for further response as JASON CRASHES 
	THROUGH THE DINER DOOR, MOWING A PATH STRAIGHT TOWARDS 
	THEM. Sean and Rennie run out the back as the Waitress 
	eyes Jason with complete disbelief.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as the BURLY CHEF comes out to confront him. Jason FLINGS 
	HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE JUKEBOX.

	THE WAITRESS

	picks up the telephone, really pissed off.

	A BIKER

	climbs off his counter stool, revealing a HUGE BOWIE 
	KNIFE. Jason plows straight for him and the Biker STABS 
	JASON IN THE HEART. Jason has little reaction, pulling it 
	out, tossing it aside. The Biker's face goes wan, backing 
	away.

	THE WAITRESS

	stops in mid-dial. Fear is starting to register now.

	JASON

	lifts the very large man and EFFORTLESSLY HEAVES HIM INTO 
	THE MIRROR OVER THE COUNTER.

	THE WAITRESS

	feels the phone receiver slipping from her grasp, her 
	mouth trembling. She backs away from the beast as far as 
	she can. Jason has no time to waste on her, trampling out 
	the back after Rennie and Sean as the other patrons 
	shrink from him.

	INT. REAR OF DINER - SAME TIME

	as Sean fumbles to unlock three deadbolts and two chains, 
	finally getting the back door open and springing into:

	EXT. DEAD END ALLEY - NIGHT

	They run about ten yards before realizing the alley is a 
	dead end. Sean and Rennie start to head back the other 
	way when JASON MOWS OUT FROM THE DINER DOOR. Their vision 
	scatters everywhere in search of a retreat...

				RENNIE
		Look!

	She's spotted a MANHOLE COVER, slightly ajar. They 
	haven't the luxury of thinking about it, Sean sliding the 
	cover back as Jason comes forth.

	INT. SEWER - ENTRANCE CHAMBER - NIGHT

	as they descend into hell...a massive chamber consisting 
	of tall columns, slimy catacombs and three feet of 
	stagnant water. Their alternatives are nil; Sean and 
	Rennie join hands, wading through the swill, splashing 
	deeper into the labyrinth.

	ANGLE UP STAIRS

	as the dim streetlight glowing in the above world is 
	eclipsed by JASON, making his way down after them.

	INT. TUNNEL #1 - NIGHT

	An oval tunnel slanted downward into pitch blackness. 
	Dim overhead lights illuminate salt deposits and eery 
	rust formations. Rennie and Sean appear at the far end, 
	wading from the sewage as the tunnel rises toward us.

	TRACKING SHOT

	as they come forward at a brisk but cautious pace, 
	strangers in a very strange land.

	ANGLE - THEIR FEET

	sloshing through the slime. All is silent until Sean's 
	foot TRIPS OVER A BARREL labeled HUGHES CHEMICAL PLANT. 
	A vaporous green substance oozes out the rusty end of 
	the container, sizzling on the around.

	SEAN AND RENNIE

	carefully sidestep it, continuing on. They make it 
	another ten yards when A FIGURE LEAPS OUT FROM AN ALCOVE, 
	GRIPPING A HUGE WRENCH. Rennie's scream echoes through 
	the tunnel.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	...but it's a middle-aged SANITATION ENGINEER who lowers 
	the wrench, as frightened as they are.

				SANITATION ENGINEER
		What the hell are you kids doing down 
		here?

				SEAN
		Can you help us get out??

				SANITATION ENGINEER
		I sure can and we don't have a minute 
		to waste.

	He begins quickly packing up his tools.

				SEAN
		What do you mean?

				SANITATION ENGINEER
		Toxic waste, son. This sewer floods 
		out with the stuff on the 13th of 
		every month, right at midnight.
			(checks watch)
		And that's less than ten minutes from 
		now.

	Rennie looks down the dark tunnels in all directions, 
	swallowing hard.

				SANITATION ENGINEER
		Follow me.

	He clicks on his high powered flashlight and quickly 
	leads them down:

	INT. TUNNEL #2

	...no less threatening than the one they just left. When 
	they pass a lightless intersecting corridor, JASON EJECTS 
	HIMSELF FROM IT, TACKLING THE SANITATION ENGINEER AND 
	SEAN.

	THE FLASHLIGHT

	rolls through the muck, its beam splashing erratically 
	across the polluted walls.

	THE SANITATION ENGINEER

	begins BASHING JASON'S HEAD IN WITH HIS WRENCH but the 
	monster drags the kicking and screaming man into TUNNEL 
	#3.

	RENNIE

	tries to help up Sean but he's been knocked into the 
	opposite wall, barely conscious.

				SEAN
		Run, Rennie...

	She's struck with indecisive shock, looking into Tunnel 
	#3, seeing:

	A GRUESOME SHADOW ON THE WALL

	Jason arches his back with wrench in hand, hammering it 
	over and over into the Sanitation Engineer's skull.

	RENNIE

	backs away but does not run. The time has come to face 
	her fears.

	ANGLE - SHADOW ON TUNNEL #3 WALL

	as Jason takes one more vengeful stroke, finishing him 
	off. He steps from Tunnel #3 with the scarlet-coated 
	tool, his shadow becoming flesh. He moves straight for 
	Sean, who has no hope for escape. Jason cocks the wrench 
	over Sean's skull...and suddenly his hockey mask is 
	SPLASHED WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT. Jason stops, turning 
	directly into it.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	Rennie is blinding us with the sanitation Engineer's 
	flashlight, giving us only brief glimpses of herself in 
	the reflective wet surroundings.

				RENNIE
		You never got me in the lake, Jason. 
		And you're not going to get me now 
		either.

	Her voice is defiant. She carefully backstops, the 
	irritating light never leaving us.

	JASON

	has been sufficiently taunted. He moves after her.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	as the bright beam leaves our eyes, Rennie dashing down 
	the intersecting tunnel (#1).

	TIGHT ON JASON'S FEET

	stomping through the sludge, picking up speed. He's 
	wanted to kill Rennie most of all.

	INT. TUNNEL #L

	as Rennie dashes up to the HUGHES CHEMICAL DRUM Sean 
	tripped over, using the back end of the flashlight to 
	crush in the can's rusted lid. The metal is flimsy but 
	still resists her blows. She frantically hammers harder.

	INT. TUNNEL #2 - TRACKING WITH JASON

	He's moving like a freight train now, an addict rolling 
	after his fix.

	INSERT - CHEMICAL DRUM

	as the butt of the flashlight dents the metal, ultimately 
	causing it to cave in.

	INT. TUNNEL INTERSECTION - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	--Looking through his unblinking eyes, whipping into 
	Tunnel #1...where we catch a fleeting glimpse of Rennie 
	flinging the contents of the oil drum. A half second 
	later a WAVE OF GRAY/GREEN LIQUID FLIES AT US...

	TIGHT ON JASON (SLOW MOTION)

	and his hockey mask is SPLASHED WITH TOXIC WASTE, 
	SEEPING INTO HIS MASK'S EYE SLITS. He careens back as if 
	her were a rabid dog receiving a load of point-blank 
	buckshot.

	RENNIE

	drops the can, fumbling for the flashlight again.

	CLOSE UP - JASON (EFX)

	as the radiant flashlight beam finds his mask, the 
	plastic beginning to bubble and melt. RUSH INTO A TIGHT 
	CLOSE UP AS JASON TEARS OFF HIS MASK, EXPOSING HIS 
	HIDEOUS FACE: rotted flesh, some of it sizzling from the 
	chemical. Worms slithering out his nostrils. And his 
	eyes...or lack thereof. They're like two raw quail eggs 
	frying in liquid green pollutant...and the yolks just 
	broke, running down his face.

	CLOSE ON FLASHLIGHT

	as the beam begins to waver in her quivering grasp. RISE 
	TO FIND RENNIE'S FACE, reacting to the stomach-turning 
	sight of Jason's visage. She grabs hold of her senses and 
	RUNS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as Rennie skirts past the blinded creature: WHIP PAN WITH 
	HER as she turns down Tunnel #2, heading back toward 
	Sean. CONTINUE TO QUICKLY PAN AROUND until we've come 
	around 360 degrees and are back on JASON, in no way 
	ready to give up. He staggers after Rennie.

	INT. TUNNEL #2

	as Rennie skids up to Sean, still dazed. She grabs him, 
	shaking hard.

				RENNIE
		Get up, Sean!!!

	His eyes blink, only half coherent. Then an inconceivable 
	terror registers in her ears...A LOW, DEEP RUMBLING 
	SOUND, COMING FROM UP AHEAD. Her head jerks in the 
	direction of her planned retreat:

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

	An ominously empty tunnel, soon to be filled with the 
	unthinkable. The sound of RUSHING LIQUID is growing at 
	leaps and bounds.

	TIGHT ON RENNIE

	as her trembling chin rises, looking at:

	ANGLE - TUNNEL #3 CEILING (EFX)

	The dim overhead lights are beginning to vibrate from 
	the approaching flood.

	RENNIE

	rotates her head and sees:

	JASON

	vision or no vision, he is lurching towards her 
	relentlessly. She is literally sandwiched between hell 
	and high water.

	RENNIE

	drags Sean to his feet with the strength of a possessed 
	woman, pulling him over to a SERVICE LADDER attached to 
	the intersecting alcove wall.

				RENNIE
			(screaming)
		Climb!!!

	She shoves him up it from below, Sean summoning 
	everything he's got to obey her. Rennie shoots a stare 
	back down the tunnel...

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)

	The overhead lights are banging around like an earthquake 
	has just hit; the liquid will be arriving any second. Her 
	vision WHIP PANS 180 DEGREES TO FIND JASON APPROACHING 
	FROM THE OPPOSITE END, groping around with his scaly arms 
	like the claws of a roto-tiller.

	ANGLE - LADDER

	as Rennie starts up after Sean, looking down and seeing:

	JASON

	within ten feet of them, shifting directly for the ladder 
	like he's working on some kind of radar.

	RENNIE

	slips on the rusty ladder, regaining her footing. and 
	rushing higher. She takes her final glance into the 
	tunnel, the ultimate horror registering in her corneas as 
	she sees:

	INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)

	A million gallons of green-brown toxic waste splash into 
	the far intersection, FILLING THE TUNNEL, FLOODING 
	STRAIGHT FOR CAMERA.

	JASON

	has just started to climb the ladder when the wind and 
	smell of the rushing toxic waste bombards him. His 
	decomposed head swivels to face:

	INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)

	Tons of lethal sewage, stopping for no one. Arriving in 
	seconds.

	JASON'S FINAL CLOSE UP (EFX/FIBER OPTIC LENS)

	He doesn't need vision to confirm what his other senses 
	already know. Jason's mouth begins to quaver...AND THE 
	FIRST WORDS HE HAS EVER SPOKEN COME OUT, IN THE VOICE OF 
	AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY:

				JASON
		Mmmmmmmmmommy...DON'T LET ME DROWN, 
		MOMMY...

	Camera speeds toward his gaping mouth and DOWN HIS THROAT 
	as lightning arcs off his mucous covered insides. We 
	sink deeper into his guts, fire and smoke flaring into 
	our eves, eventually coming to a WELL IN THE PIT OF HIS 
	STOMACH, FILLED WITH BLOOD...and EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON IS 
	DROWNING IN IT.

				YOUNG JASON
		Hhhhelp me....

	A split second later:

	EXT. TUNNEL #3 (EFX) (SLOW MOTION)

	The wall of deadly toxic liquid ENGULFS JASON.

	INT. TUNNEL #3 - ON RENNIE AND SEAN (EFX)

	The powerful flood thrashes the ladder about two inches 
	below Rennie's feet, the force of it fiercely shaking 
	their rusty support. They are clinging to the ladder with 
	their eyes squeezed shut. Praying for survival.

	INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)

	We are drowning in a chunky cloud of sewage, rushing over 
	and under us.

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (EFX)

	The digital clock we saw earlier abruptly CHIMES 
	MIDNIGHT, HUGE BOLTS OF LIGHTNING CRACKING OVER 
	MANHATTAN.

	ANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE (EFX)

	as the sewage level begins to drop. Rennie opens her 
	eyes, glancing straight down and seeing.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)

	The ladder beneath them reappears...which gives way to a 
	PAIR OF HANDS GRIPPING THE BOTTOM RUNG. The liquid drops 
	further, unshrouding the now-dead corpse of EIGHT YEAR 
	OLD JASON. He's a relatively normal looking boy, 
	probably the way he looked back in 1957...right when he 
	drowned in Crystal Lake.

	Jason Voorhees has finally been put to rest.

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	Rennie and Sean stagger out from a side street, holding 
	each other up...relief etched in their matured faces.

				SEAN
		I hear there's a statue here that's 22 
		stories tall.

	Rennie would smile if she could. She kisses his cheek. 
	They amble on.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	...coming out from another alley, creeping up behind them 
	through a crowd of pedestrians. About the height of a 
	small child.

	RENNIE AND SEAN

	walk arm in arm, exhausted and oblivious to their 
	pursuer. But something, some innate perception causes 
	Rennie to slow...and stop. Her eyes register a horrid 
	fear and she WHIPS AROUND TO FACE...

	TOBY!

	Limping on all fours, filthy with grease-matted fur. The 
	whimpering dog crawls up to her, Rennie bending down, 
	hugging her animal like she'll never let go.

				RENNIE
		Oh Toby...

	HIGH ANGLE CRANE SHOT (N.Y.)

	as Sean bends down too, ruffling the dog's fur, standing 
	again with Rennie. The three survivors enter the collage 
	of pedestrians, bright lights and skyscrapers. 

	It is finally over.

								FADE OUT.

					THE END
FRIGHT NIGHT



                                   Written by

                                   Marti Noxon



          EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT


                         FADE UP:
          Moving through a tract development. The houses are like
          Mexican food -- the basic elements are all the same, just
          mixed differently.
          A gloomy night, no moon. And a slightly ominous pattern
          emerges...
          Green, thriving lawns and meticulously tended homes abut
          brown yards and porches littered with old newspapers and
          pizza joint flyers.
          Each third or fourth house is FOR SALE or, worse, seemingly
          abandoned. This area is in danger of becoming a ghost town.
          A deep, commanding voice pierces the silence:

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Defy reason. Defy everything you
          know.
          Now we move in on one of the homes. Not the nicest on the
          block, but inhabited. Lights on in the windows.

          INT. SUBURBAN HOME/VARIOUS -- NIGHT

          Inside the house. A middle-class family lives here. The
          living room is empty, but the TV's on.

          ON THE TELEVISION
          A commercial for PETER VINCENT. A Las Vegas institution,
          he's a magician whose show is all Gothic, horror-movie
          imagery.
          Peter's wiry, hot -- a rock and roll bad boy. He's cutting a
          girl up with a chain saw. And grinning like a mad man.

                         TELEVISION ANNOUNCER
          Peter Vincent's "FRIGHT NIGHT."
          The family DOG is up on the coffee table eating what's left
          of a fast food burger and fries, still in the box.

          TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
          Something's moving in the dark.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          Also on the table -- a role-playing game in progress.
          "Magic, the Gathering"... Elves and Wizards.

          TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
          Only at The Hard Rock. Nightly
          Wednesday Through Sunday.
          Now we hear what at first sounds like a MUFFLED ARGUMENT
          coming from another room.

                         DISTANT VOICE
          Get off her!!
          More voices yelling, something being thrown. An ugly
          domestic scene.
          We creep down a dark hall toward a cracked door, light seeps
          through the opening -- it SLAMS OPEN and ADAM, 17, crashes
          toward us.
          He's nice-looking, a little nerdy -- and he's in a blind
          terror.
          We get a glimpse of the horrible scene behind the door. A
          teen girl's room -- the sound of flesh ripping.
          We see a pale arm on the ground, shaking violently, as if
          something is tearing and tugging at the body attached to it.
          We bolt away with ADAM, who we now see is blood splattered,
          as he races UPSTAIRS. A PHONE CRADLE is ripped out of the
          wall, which Adam nearly falls over.

          INT. SUBURBAN HOME -- UPPER LANDING/BEDROOM -- NIGHT

          ADAM RACES INTO HIS PARENTS' ROOM. Another horrible glimpse -
          - his mother's body splayed across her frilly bed.
          Blood on pale pink sheets.
          ADAM goes to his FATHER'S SIDE OF THE BED and now we see
          Adam's father's body. His father was reaching for A GUN he'd
          hidden under the bed.
          ADAM gets down under the bed, desperately reaches for the
          gun. It's just beyond his grasp.

                         ADAM
          Come on, come on, come on...
          He gets it. But the GUN HAS A GUN LOCK. Adam has to dig in
          his dead father's pockets for his keys. Adam starts to cry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Come on, come on!
          He finds them, struggles to unlock the gun with shaking
          hands.
          THE BED IS TURNED OVER in one violent throw. Adam is
          exposed. We see only a hint of the creature that looms over

                         HIM --
          Brutally strong, veins dark and visible under the skin...
          Human but not quite.
          Adam reacts in horror. He knows he's dead.
          HE's RIPPED OUT OF FRAME as we hear:

           DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)
           .we're looking at a nice day here
           in Clark County, hitting a season
          low of only 89 degrees...

          EXT. SHADOW HILLS - DAY

          MUSIC starts under the DISC JOCKEY as we LOOK DOWN FROM HIGH
          ABOVE at the SAME suburban neighborhood as before.
          In the daylight it seems nice. Charming, even.
          Pocket parks decorate almost every corner and kids ride bikes
          in the street. Mothers unload groceries. Neighbors chat.

          DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)
          .so get out there and enjoy this
          beautiful Wednesday, people.
          We SWOOP CLOSER and find that RADIO comes from a passing
          MINIVAN with those cutesy stick figure family decals on the
          rear window.
          The FOR SALE SIGNS and brown lawns don't seem nearly so
          foreboding now.
          We SWOOP UP AGAIN and see beyond Shadow Hills, past the WALL
          that encompasses it -- and become aware for the first time
          that the community is SURROUNDED BY FLAT, ARID DESERT.
          In the distance, we can just make out the glow of Las Vegas
          proper. It looks like a distant fantasy, a land-locked
          Pleasure Island.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          EXT. STREET - DAY


                         CLOSE ON:
          The wheels of a DIRT BIKE as it zooms down the street.
          WIDEN to see CHARLIE BREWSTER, who is PUSHING the bike as
          fast as he can. It STARTS, sputters -- then craps out.

                         CHARLIE
          (to the bike/pissed)
          You want me to take you apart, huh?
          Charlie's 17 and has the slightly awkward feel of someone who
           just recently came into his body and good looks.
          He's a wry, thoughtful kid who's enjoying -- but not quite
          trusting -- a sudden surge in popularity.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          (still talking to bike)
          I will. I'll sell you for parts.
          Don't think I won't--
          Charlie stops, embarrassed. DORIS -- a neighbor -- watches
           him talk to his bike. Paused as she hauls her trash cans to
          the curb.
          She's super pretty in a wholesome way -- except for her
          ridiculous body. Stripper city. She nods to the bike,
          amused.

                         DORIS
          Nothing doing, huh?

                         CHARLIE
          The thing's got no ambition.
          (re: trash cans)
          Can I -- uh, give you a hand?

                         DORIS
          I got it. Thanks.
          She walks away -- her sweatpants have the word "LUCKY" across
          the butt. He watches her go appreciatively. Doesn't notice
          his mom, JANE, struggling to pull their own cans to the curb.

                         JANE
          Don't leer at the neighbors, kid.
          Jane, 40's, attractive and frazzled, wears a REAL ESTATE
          brokers blazer. Charlie wheels his bike back to the curb.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.
          He and his mom have had an affectionate, teasing relationship
          which has only recently started to have more edge.

                         CHARLIE
          She's the one who put a word on her
          butt. I'm just reading it.
          Jane eyes a LARGE DUMPSTER FULL OF CONCRETE that sits in
          front of their NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR'S YARD.

                         JANE
          Is he ever going to move that
          thing?

                         CHARLIE
          You need to get over it, Mom.

                         JANE

                         (WATCH IT)
          Attitude.
          (observes him/then)
          You've been tense or something.
          School?

                         CHARLIE
          School's great, actually.

                         JANE
          Amy?

                         CHARLIE
          Good. Hasn't dumped me yet.
          He says this like he's surprised. Jane nods. Getting it.

                         JANE
          That'll teach you to get so tall
          and handsome.

                         (THEN)
          Getting what you want is stressful.
          Especially when you're not used to
          it. More to lose.

                         CHARLIE
          Are you reading those books again?
          The Power of Whatever the Hell?
          She laughs. He glances at the DUMPSTER.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          They're not working. You're still
          flipping out about a big box.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
          Now Jane moves to the open garage and starts loading OPEN
          HOUSE SIGNS into her trunk. Charlie stands there. She
          shoots him a look -- then he helps her load.

                         JANE
          It's an eyesore. I'm trying to
          convince people to move in, not
          join the legions leaving town--

                         CHARLIE
          If you say "mortgage crisis" again
          I'm getting a new mom.

                         JANE
          The guy moves in and puts a giant
          trash can in his yard! When the
          Perry's lived there--
          Charlie has heard this before. It's a common refrain.

                         CHARLIE
          The Perry's were the greatest
          neighbors ever. But they moved. I
          thought you were happy their place
          finally sold.

                         JANE
          (back on the neighbor)
          He's not digging a pool. Where do
          you think all that concrete's
          coming from?

                         CHARLIE
          You're spying on the guy now?

                         JANE
          He's thirteen feet from our house.
          That's not spying, that's
          observing.
          A BEETLE CONVERTIBLE pulls up. AMY drives and her two hot
          friends, CARA and BEE, sit in the back.

                         AMY
          Hi, Mrs. Brewster.

                         JANE
          Hi honey. Hi girls.
          ANY, 16, is a stunner. And she's as cool as she is beautiful
          -- the girl every other guy in school would die to be with.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          But Charlie is. And he can't believe his luck. Which puts
          him off his game. She makes him feel like he's always
          playing catch up.
          Charlie moves toward the VW. Jane calls after him.

                         JANE (CONT'D)
          Oh hey -- Ed called. Again.

                         CHARLIE
          Okay.

                         JANE
          I'm tired of making excuses,
          Charlie. If you don't want to talk
          to him, would you please tell him?

                         CHARLIE
          Kinda defeats the purpose.
          He gets to AMY and the girls. Amy glances at the dirt bike.

                         AMY
          Still can't get the bike started,
          huh?

                         CHARLIE
          Wow. No faith.

                         AMY
          So you don't need a ride.
          Amy calls his bluff and starts to drive off. Charlie grabs
          his backpack and RACES after her.

                         CHARLIE
          No, hey, stop--
          She laughs, stops the car. Charlie tries to jump in and she
          drives again.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Come on! Hey!--
          Charlie runs and finally dives into the back headfirst. The
          girls are laughing.

                         ON JANE
          Watching them drive off, gone in a cloud of teen spirit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

          INT/EXT. AMY'S CAR -- DAY

          The Beetle zips through a commercial strip. More suburban
          paradise.
          Charlie's in the front seat now. Amy drives, one hand on the
          wheel. Casually drops one on Charlie's leg. Charlie tries
          to act casual, but he's stoked and... amazed.
          Cara half-sleeps in the back while BEE leans forward, flirty,
          and eyes Charlie's COLORFUL PUMA SNEAKERS. Charlie's a
          sneakerhead, a serious collector.

                         BEE
          Takes a man to wear purple, Chuck.

                         AMY
          Charlie.

                         BEE
          Chuck likes it when I call him
          Chuck, right Chuck?
           Intimidated by these girls, he tries to form a witty retort.

                          CHARLIE
          It's -- they're not -- that's,
           like, puce? That's a macho puce.

                         CARA
          Can you stop someplace? I'm
          severely under-caffeinated.

                         AMY
          (ignores her/to Bee)
          Did you see the poster for the
          formal? The theme is "Hope"?

                         BEE
          I know. They asked me to be on the
          committee again but I was like --
          hope is completely 2008. Grow up.

                         CHARLIE
          Did you suggest "Despair?" Nobody
          would see that coming. Or --
          global warming? Everybody has to
          wear tin foil.

                         AMY
          (laughs/to Charlie)
          Did you go last year? We basically
          did the whole thing, Bee and me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         CHARLIE

                         (LIES)
          Me? I, ah, was in training that
          week. This big triatha--

                         BEE
          (cutting him off)
          Chuck was still under his rock.
          We're so glad you crawled out.

                         CARA
          Caffeine!? Hello!

                         CHARLIE
          I have Econ first period.
          Amy takes her hand off his leg. Charlie notices.

                         CARA
          Charrrliiieeeee.

                         CHARLIE

                         (KILLING HIM)
          Okay. Yeah. It's no big deal.
          Amy PULLS into a coffee place. Parks. The girls climb out.

                         CARA
          Thank you, Jesus.
          Amy catches Charlie looking at his watch, fidgeting.

                         AMY
          You're not going to flunk for
          missing Econ, Brain.

                         CHARLIE
          Brain? I -- what? No, I'm--
          But she's already walking away.

                         AMY
          Five minutes.
          He watches her move off, anxious and smitten.

          EXT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH -- COURTYARD -- DAY

          Charlie arrives with Amy, Cara and Bee -- all the girls now
          sport coffee drinks. Charlie has one too, with whipped cream
          and the works.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.
          Kids stream into a nice, modern-looking high school. Amy
          takes Charlie's arm.

                         AMY
          On time. You stress too much.

                         CHARLIE
          I wasn't worried.

                         AMY
          You were doing your worried thing.

                         CHARLIE
          I was? I have a -- what's my--

          MARK (O.S.)
          Ladies!
          A couple of handsome jock-type guys, MARK and BEN, roll up
          along side Charlie and the girls. They draw looks from other
          students as they move through the courtyard.
          The cool kids.

                         BEE
          Doods. Looking massive.

                         MARK
          (to Charlie/re: drink)
          Seriously? A Mochachino? You
          can't ride with the girls anymore.
          You let them brush your hair, My
          Pretty Pony?
          Mark grabs the cup away from him. Starts drinking it.

                         BEE
          (takes his arm)
          Chuck's secure, aren't you?
          We see that Ben is also wearing PUMA's. Different design.
          It's a thing. Charlie shows his off -- he's secure.

                         CHARLIE
          Puce.

                         BEN
          Fuck yeah.

                         AMY

                         (TO CHARLIE)
          I have track after school, maybe we
          can hook up later?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         CHARLIE
          Yeah. Hey. Come here.
          (pulls her aside/awkward)
          You know, the formal. Don't think
          I wasn't going to ask you, because
          I thought it was an obvious go.
          Together. Hope, puppies, kittens,
          the whole deal. You and me.

                         AMY

                         (NOT UNKIND)
          Oh, no. Please. Nobody goes to
          the dance senior year.
          She smiles, moves off. He watches her, lets out a breath.

                         CHARLIE
          Right. I knew that.
          MARK and BEN enjoy the view as the girls move off. Wow.
          Mark, incredulous, says to Charlie:

                         MARK
          Did you find a frickin' Genie lamp
          man? Make a sacrifice to the hot
          ass Gods? How do you get that?

                         CHARLIE
          Game, my friend. Rock solid.
          Charlie moves off. And even though he's playing it off, we
          see that Mark's hit a nerve. This hot girlfriend thing is a
          bitch. Mark calls after him--

                         MARK
          You don't even have a car!

          INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY

          Later. Charlie's in Econ class. Seated in a back row near
          MARK and BEN. A number of seats in class are EMPTY.

                         TEACHER
          Ben Wegner?

                         BEN
          Here.

                         TEACHER
          Adam Noris?
          Nothing. Teacher looks around.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         TEACHER (CONT'D)
          Adam?
          (marks chart/then)
          Courtney Heuer?
          A girl raises her hand.
          Charlie, bored, idly checks out the class. Stops when he
          sees a tweaked-looking kid, ED, staring at him.
          EVIL ED is a slight, faintly punk-looking kid who's been
          picked on by bullies his whole life.
          He's hyper-intelligent, hyper-critical and... just hyper. And
          his binder is covered with COMIC BOOK STICKERS.

                         TEACHER (CONT'D)
          Nick Straley?

                         (NOTHING)
          Nick?
          Ed sees that he's caught Charlie's eye. Nods significantly
          at him. Like -- "you know and I know..."
          Charlie looks away. As if he didn't see him.

          INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY

          Charlie, Mark and Ben move down the hall. Mark shows Charlie
          a picture on his phone. A woman posing seductively.

                         MARK
          Miss Granada. Geometry.

                         CHARLIE
          Holy crap. Where did you get that?

                         MARK
          She's hard up, man. Equations
          don't keep you warm at night.
          They stop, see EVIL ED approaching. This amuses Mark and
          Ben. But Charlie's uncomfortable -- wants to bolt.

                         BEN
          I think "it's" going to talk to us.

                         ED

                         (TO CHARLIE)
          I need a minute.

                         MARK
          "It's" going to talk to Brewster.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         BEN

                         (TO ED)
          When are you going to get the
          message? We don't know you--

                         ED

                         (RE: CHARLIE)
          He does. Or did. Before the
          summer and his Jock Lobotomy.

                         CHARLIE
          (to Ed/uncomfortable)
          What's the deal, man?

                         ED
          Alone.
          Ed stares Charlie down. A beat. Ben and Mark bust out
          laughing. Mark looks at Charlie.

                         MARK
          Just the two of you. That's sweet.
          He can school you in the ways of
          geek-douchery.

                         ED
          It's important. "Brewster."
          The way Ed says his name is enough to propel Charlie into
          action. He grabs Ed and pulls him aside. Mark and Ben watch
          with interest -- out of earshot.
          Ed's tone is dire, serious as a heart attack.

                         ED (CONT'D)
          Adam's missing.
          Charlie's looking around, self-conscious.

                         CHARLIE
          What do you mean, he's missing?

                         ED
          I keep trying him -- nothing. No
          texts, no phone. And he's not the
          only one who's gone. You heard
          roll call.

                         CHARLIE
          So kids aren't coming to school.
          What do you want me to do about it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         ED
          Meet me at his house after school.
          We'll check around. See what's up,
          if he's okay.

                         CHARLIE
          I can't after school. I'm busy.

                         ED
          I don't think you get what I'm

                         TELLING YOU--

                         CHARLIE
          Look, do we have to do this here?
          Ed can't believe it. Charlie's totally blowing him off. He
          starts to lose it, raises his voice--

                         ED
          What, am I not even suppose to
          speak to you now?--

                         CHARLIE
          Keep it down. Don't spaz--

                         ED
          It's so horrible! Crossing the
          streams! Will High School as we
          know it cease to exist?!
          Ed glances at Mark and Ben, who still watch from a distance.

                          ED (CONT'D)
          You want me to tell your pals how
          well we know each other? The Lego
          contests, the Farscape conventions,

                         THE COSTUMES--

                         CHARLIE

                         UIET--

                         ED
          Or how your first sexual experience
          was with an Electra figurine--

                         CHARLIE
          No. No.

                         ED
          Then be my backup.

                         CHARLIE

                         (DEFEATED)
          Fine. Adam's after school.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         ED
          Don't be late.
          Moves off. Charlie sees the guys watching him. A beat. He
          shrugs like "I have no idea what that was about..."

                         FADE TO:

          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT LAWN -- DUSK

           The sun has set behind the mountains. It's gloomy gray out,
          right before dark.
           Charlie and AMY park, climb out of her car with drinks from
           PLANET SMOOTHIE in hand. She's still in her track and field
          clothes. Looks tough.

                         AMY
          You know what I want? For dinner?

                         CHARLIE
          You're eating right now, you know.
          As you speak. You literally just
          forced me to get you a smoothie so
          large they named a planet after it--

                         AMY

                         (LAUGHS)
          I ran six miles. What did you do?

                         CHARLIE
          I -- watched you. But not in a
          creepy way.
          Charlie winces a little. It sounds creepy.

                         AMY
          So don't judge. You don't want me
          to burn my big ole' booty off, do
          you?
          Charlie, on impulse, stops her -- kisses her.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          What was that for?

                         CHARLIE
          I don't know you're just...

                         AMY
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         CHARLIE

                         (PERFECT)
          Nothing.
          A sweet moment. These two have a definite thing. It's real.
          They're about to kiss again when JANE'S GIRLISH LAUGH stops
          them. They both turn and REACT AS THEY SEE...
          A MUSCLED MALE, SQUATTING AND HUNCHED-OVER -- clad only in a
          white wife-beater and jeans. We can't make out his face.
          Jane stands over him, laughing at something he's said as he
          FIXES their sprinkler.
          PUSH IN as the guy looks up. This is JERRY. 30's. Handsome
          to the point of devastating. An all-American Adonis.

                         AMY
          Wow.

                         CHARLIE
          Look at Mom. She'sâ

                         AMY
          Damn right. If he followed her
          home, you have to let her keep him.
          Amy laughs -- almost skips toward them, milking the moment.

          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- DUSK

          ED paces anxiously in front of ADAM'S HOUSE. He has a duffle
          bag over his shoulder. Keeps checking his phone.
          He finally dials in a number. Talks--

                         ADAM
          Charlie. I'm in front of Adam's.
          Remember the videos we all made
          back when? You and me and Adam,
          bro? In tights. Want your pals to
          get a load of that?

          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT LAWN -- DUSK

          Amy and Charlie approach Jane and Jerry. They overhear--

                         JANE
          .so not a pool, what's the work
          you're doing?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          Jerry has an easy-going way about him. An inviting charm.

                         JERRY
          Foundation problems. I had to rip
          up half the basement.

                         JANE
          These houses were built practically
          overnight. I'm never surprised
          when they come apart.

                         JERRY

                         (RE: SPRINKLER)
          Done. Just needed a new stem.
          Jane sees Charlie and Amy approaching. And gaping.

                         JANE
          Jerry, this is my son Charlie. And
          his -- do we say girlfriend now?

                         CHARLIE

                         (EMBARRASSED)
          I guess. I mean -- only if she's--
          Amy's amused at Charlie's squirming, finally saves him.

                         AMY
          (shakes Jerry's hand)
          Hi. I'm Amy.
          He can't help but give Amy an appreciative once-over. She
          enjoys it, but pulls away and moves closer to Charlie.
          Charlie notices the exchange -- the way this dude oozes
          manliness. Doesn't like it one bit. He shakes Jerry's hand
          a little too firmly. Lowers his voice a bit.

                         CHARLIE
          Hey.

                         JANE
          Jerry's our new neighbor. The
          Perry place. He's "handy."

                         AMY
          (looks to Charlie, smiles)
          No kidding.

                         JERRY
          Sorry about the mess, man. I was
          just telling your mom I'll have the
          dumpster gone next week.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         CHARLIE
          Doesn't bother me.

                         JANE
          Jerry does night construction on
          the strip.

                         JERRY
          (noticing Charlie's shoes)
          You play ball? I'm always looking
          for a pick up game.

                         CHARLIE

                         (BLUFFING)
          Now and then, you know.

                         JANE
          It's more of a collector thing.
          The shoes. He's obsessed.
          (to Jerry/"those teens")
          They sleep on sidewalks to get
          them.
          Charlie looks at Jane, thanks for embarrassing me.

                         JERRY
          Well -- they're bold. I like them.
           Jerry looks back at Jane. A little flirtatious.

                         JERRY (CONT'D)
          So... I'd ask you guys inside, but
          it's a mess. I've been meaning to.

                         JANE
          Be neighborly.

                         JERRY
          A drink, something.
          It hangs there, waiting for an invitation. Jane just smiles.

                         JERRY (CONT'D)
          Soon, okay?

                         JANE
          You bet. And thank you so much.
          For the help.

                         JERRY
          Least I could do.
          Jane, Amy and Charlie walk toward the house. Jerry moves
          off. Amy looks at Jane, amazed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         AMY
          Why did you blow him off? Oh my
          God!

                         JANE
          A guy that good-looking, still
          single? Bad bet. He's a player.

                         CHARLIE

                         (IMPRESSED)
          Mom. Breaking it down.

                         JANE
          I've had enough man trouble. I'm
          not getting suckered again.
          Amy and Charlie meet eyes. That was loaded. Jane notices.

                         JANE (CONT'D)
          Don't listen to me. Jaded old

                         BROAD--

                         CHARLIE

                         MOM--
          Charlie's PHONE buzzes. He checks it.

          ON THE PHONE
          A VIDEO CLIP from ED. TITLED "KID COMEBACK and SUPER SQUID!"
          It shows Charlie, Ed and Adam when they were younger,
          prancing around in homemade costumes and, indeed, tights.
          The text message says "10 MINUTES -- OR THIS IS GOING WIDE!"

                         ON CHARLIE

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          (alarmed/to Amy)
          Wow. Okay. I gotta go. Sorry.
          Call you later.

                         AMY
          Now?

                         JANE
          I have dinner on--

                         CHARLIE
          I gotta go. I'll eat later.

                         JANE
          Charlie!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          But Charlie's already off and running.

          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- DUSK

           Charlie approaches, sees ED pacing in front of the house.
          He's flipping out.

                         ED
          Where the hell have you been?

                         CHARLIE
          You said after school, chill out!
          Ed is already lugging his big duffle to Adam's front door.

                         ED
          Right after! It's dusk, dude, you
          know what that means!?

                         CHARLIE
          That the sun's gone down. What's

                         THE BIG--
          Over him, Ed knocks loudly. Rings the bell.

                         ED
          Hey! Anybody home?
          A long pause. Nothing.

                         CHARLIE
          Not here. Let's go--
           But Ed's already heading around the house with the duffle.

          INT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DUSK

          Ed wriggles in through the DOG DOOR. He turns, lets Charlie
          in. Charlie looks around.

                         CHARLIE
          This is nuts.
          It's the SAME HOUSE we saw in the opening, but completely
          righted. TV is off, the walls are clean. Furniture in it's
          proper place. It's perfect.
          They move into the house. Ed is wired, scared.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         21

                         ED
          Hello? Ed and Charlie here!

                         (TO CHARLIE)
          Come on.
          Charlie follows him in. Resigned and placating.

                         CHARLIE
          Okay. Fine.
          Ed opens his duffle bag. Inside are CROSSES, STAKES, HOLY
          WATER, even a small AX.

                         ED
          Take this.
          Ed hands Charlie a STAKE. Charlie eyes it, incredulous.

                         CHARLIE
          You've got to be kidding me.
          Ed stops. This is it.

                         ED
          I hate to tell you this but that
          guy, your neighbor.

                         (DEAD SERIOUS)
          He's a vampire. One of the undead.

                         CHARLIE
          My neighbor. Next door.

                         ED
          Yeah.

                         CHARLIE
          I just met him. Jerry.

                         ED
          Jerry.
          A beat.

                         CHARLIE
          That's a terrible vampire name.
          "Jerry." Seriously--

                         ED
          I didn't name him, man, I'm just
          reporting the facts!
          Ed moves UP THE STAIRS. Charlie reluctantly follows. It's
          darker up here. Lights off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         CHARLIE
          Come on, this is a gag -- right?
          Ed's barely listening -- cautious. Every shadow is potential
          death. Total shmuck bait...

                         ED
          Hey! Anybody here?
          They pass the empty MASTER BEDROOM -- where we saw ADAM's
          parents slaughtered. Now its clean and empty.
          Then Ed turns into ADAM's room. It's full of geekery.
          Action figures, the like. Charlie sticks behind him.
          The guys don't register the mostly obscured form of SOMEBODY
          HIDING BEHIND the door. A LARGE MALE figure.
          Ed catches sight of the guy, and SPINS toward it, freaked.
          Charlie also reacts, scared.

                         ED (CONT'D)
          Get back, demon!
          Ed thrusts his cross forward which knocks the door open,
          toppling A MOVIE CHARACTER STANDEE.
          A beat. Then Ed lets out a slightly manic laugh.

                         ED (CONT'D)
          Ha! I killed that sucker dead!

                         CHARLIE

                         (ANGRY)
          They're not here, okay? They left
          town. His dad was a deadbeat--
          Ed pulls a MAP out of his pocket. It has lots of red and
          black DOTS marked on it. He thrusts it at Charlie.

                         ED
          No, see, it's not just them. It
          started -- there was this thing on
          Channel 13, a lady escaped an
          attacker who tried to bite her.
          Ed points to the RED DOTS on his chart. They form a loose
          circle around CHARLIE'S house.

                         ED (CONT'D)
          Adam and me, we graphed the attack,
          the disappearances. Whole
          families, gone.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         23

                         ED (CONT'D)
          And that's you guys at the center,
          see? His windows are totally

                         BLACKED OUT--

                         CHARLIE
          There's a ton of houses like that.
          People work nights on the strip--

                         ED
          But every window? No. I've been
          watching him. It all fits--

                         CHARLIE
          That Jerry's a Dracula.

                         ED
          No. Dracula is a specific vampire.

                         I'M SAYING--

                         CHARLIE
          I know what you're saying! I'm
          mocking you. You've been reading
          too much Twilight--

                         ED
          Fiction, okay? This is real. A
          real monster. And he's not
          brooding. Or lovesick. Or noble.
          He's the fucking shark from JAWS.
          He feeds, he kills, and he doesn't
          move on until everyone around him
          is dead.

                         (MOST EMPHATIC)
          And that book SUCKS.
          Charlie can't help but pause. Ed's conviction is so real.
          But he shakes it off.

                         CHARLIE

                         COME ON--

                         ED
          What about your neighbors, the
          Perrys? He moved into their house.
          Haven't seen them around, have you?

                         CHARLIE
          Yeah, in San Diego like a month
          ago!

                         ED
          Exception, proves the rule. You
          haven't asked him in, have you? He
          can't get in without an invitation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         24

                         CHARLIE
          No, but--

                         ED
          Your mom? Lonely divorcee...

                         CHARLIE
          You're on drugs.

                         ED
          No! Well, yeah... I thought you'd
          take my word, but I have evidence
          at home. Hard evidence.
          Charlie stops fighting it and humors him. Ed's lost it.

                         CHARLIE
          Yeah. Okay.

                         ED

                         (INTENSE)
          We have to stake him in his nest.
          You and me. Not now, it's dark.

                         CHARLIE
          Right. Cause he's nocturnal.

                         ED
          Just for -- okay -- for a minute
          pretend you're not a douche now--

                         CHARLIE
          Look, Ed, this stuff, it was fun
          when we were eight--

                         ED

                         SIXTEEN--

                         CHARLIE

                         (LOSING IT)
          Whatever! I grew up, okay? You
          don't want to, fine. But don't get
          an attitude because I'd rather have
          a life than make shit up!
          Ed stops. Stung.

                         ED
          Right. Got it. You're soooo cool
          "Brewster." Go ahead, join the
          Clark High early-peakers. This is
          the pinnacle for them. And that
          includes your girl--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         CHARLIE
          Shut up.

                         ED
          Undeniably doable, but we used to
          make fun of her and her pals,
          remember? They're bimbos--

                         CHARLIE
          Shut up!
          Charlie barely refrains from hitting Ed. Instead he shoves
          him away. Ed stumbles. Falls.
          He looks up at Charlie, genuinely hurt and desperate.

                         ED
          Adam's gone -- you act like it has
          nothing to do with you.

                         (THEN/PAINED)
          We were inseparable, man.

                         CHARLIE
          Yeah. And you know when I got
          popular? The minute I stopped
          hanging out with you.
          Charlie takes off. Ed watches him go.

                         FADE TO:

          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS/VARIOUS -- NIGHT

          A while later. It's REALLY DARK now.
          Ed, gripping his duffle bag nervously, skates down a
          residential street. Houses here are spaced far apart and the
          lights in many of them are off.
          Ed is anxious, watchful. He knows it's not safe. Every dark
          corner is potentially the end of him.
          A few cars pass. Something moves behind him. Footsteps
          GAINING. Ed abandons his skateboard and BOLTS.
          A hand SLAMS on his shoulder, spins him around. IT's MARK,
          Charlie's pal from school.

                         MARK
          You crossed my yard. Tracked your
          nerdjuice all over it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         ED
          Sorry. Sorry--

                         MARK
          My mom works hard on that shit,

                         MORON--
          Ed glances around nervously, it's dark and anything... else
          could be out there.

                         ED
          Can you just hit me? I don't have
          time for the build up.
          (he steels himself)
          Go.

                         MARK
          Seriously?

                         ED
          Jesus, man! Just do it!
          Fine. Mark winds up and SWINGS -- a brutal blow.
          Ed DUCKS and runs. Mark's immediately on his heels.
          The guys dodge and dart through the neighborhood. But Ed has
          experience in the art of losing bullies and he manages to
          shake Mark for a moment.
          Ed scrambles over a wooden fence, but his DUFFLE BAG GETS
          CAUGHT ON TOP. Most of his vamp hunting stuff SPILLS over on
          the OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.

                         ED (CONT'D)
          Crap. Crap!
          There's not time to get the stuff. He can hear Mark
          approaching in the dark.
          He drops into a neighbor's backyard.

          EXT. BACKYARD -- NIGHT

          ED spins and slams right into MARK -- no, it's JERRY.
          Ed falls back and scrambles away, terrified.

                         ED (CONT'D)
          Get away! I'm armed mother fucker!
          Jerry moves after Ed, angry but controlled. More like a man
          than a monster.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

          EXT. FENCE -- NIGHT

          Mark pulls up on the other side of the wood fence. Sees Ed's
          VAMP HUNTING STUFF on the ground, laughs.

                         MARK
          Unbelievable.
          A beat, Mark glances at the high fence. Decides he's done.
          He kicks some of Ed's stuff as he moves off.

          EXT. BACKYARD -- NIGHT

          Ed trips over kid's toys and bikes as he runs to the house.
          There's a porch light on over the back door.

                         ED
          (pounding on door)
          Hey! Let me in! Please!
          But there's no answer. Ed is desperate, Sees Jerry closing
          in, walking across the backyard.
          Ed takes a ROCK and smashes the window over the kitchen sink.

          INT. HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT

          Ed falls through the window into the kitchen. Looks out.
          JERRY stalks toward him. All hulking menace.
          But Ed's safe now. Calls out--

                         ED
          Forget it sucker! No invite!
          BAM! Jerry kicks in the kitchen door. Ed, terrified, falls
          back.

                         JERRY
          Abandoned. I thought you did your
          homework.

                         ED
          -- what?

                         JERRY
          You've been watching me. I've been
          watching you. Seems fair.
          Ed BOLTS into the house.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

          INT. HOUSE -- VARIOUS -- NIGHT

          As he races through the empty rooms he pulls a stake from his
          pocket. We see he's wearing a cross around his neck on a
          long chain.
          JERRY's following, but barely breaking a sweat.
          Ed sees A SLIDING GLASS DOOR to the back. He fumbles with
          the lock, gets it open and runs into the backyard.

          EXT. BACKYARD -- NIGHT

          Ed races for the back gate--

          AND SUDDENLY JERKS TO A STOP.
          Jerry has him by the back of the CROSS he's wearing.
          Ed's lifted WAY off his feet by the CHAIN, until he's choking
          on it, the cross directly under his neck.
          JERRY looks away as he SNAPS the chain off Ed and HURLS the
          cross into the neighbor's POOL.
          Ed falls to the ground, watches the cross sink in despair.
          Jerry's standing over him. Smiles a little. We get just a
          flash -- he suddenly has MORE TEETH, sharper, in rows. It's
          chilling.

                         JERRY
          Bit off more than you can chew.
          Shaking, terrified, Ed brandishes the STAKE.

                         ED
          We'll see, man. I know my shit.
          But Jerry doesn't appear to be afraid. He looks at Ed with
          actual sympathy.

                         JERRY
          Really? Who's going to believe
          you? You see the truth, but what
          good is it when you're alone?
          Ed's shaken -- but still grips the stake. Holding on.

                         ED
          Don't play that stuff. That mind
          crap. Come on -- try me. Try me!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

                         JERRY
          You say you're glad you're
          different. But how can you be in a
          place like this? These people...
          Even your best friend. You're
          nothing to him now.
          Ed's listening despite himself, hurting now. Jerry moves a
          step in. Ed raises his stake again -- but with slightly less
          conviction.

                         ED
          Get back!

                         JERRY
          It can be over. I can make all
          that pain go away.
          Ed's fighting tears. Life as he knows it is gone.

                         ED
          No...

                         JERRY
          You were born for this and you know
          it. Your "life", what you had?
          That's the illusion.
          (off Ed's silence)
          I can take you somewhere great.
          Somewhere you'll belong.
          Ed takes this in. His eyes clear a bit. Is it...hope?

                         JERRY (CONT'D)
          It's a gift.
          And Jerry moves closer, blocking our view.

          CUT TO BLACK:

          FADE UP ON:

          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- DAY

          A new day. Sunny and hot. A truck moves the DUMPSTER from
          Jerry's house.

          INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAY

          Through the kitchen window, Jane watches the DUMPSTER drive
          away. She's pleased, a little surprised. Says to herself...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         JANE
          Good on his word.
          A knock at the door. It's Amy. She lets herself in.

                         AMY
          Morning. Charlie?

                         JANE
          You try. My voice seems to be on
          some frequency he can't hear.

                         AMY

          CHARLIE!

          CHARLIE (O.S.)
          Coming!
          Amy looks at Jane, who shakes her head. Amy moves to the
          island. Grins a little.

                         AMY
          Talk to Hot Neighbor again? You
          should facebook him.

                         JANE
          (shakes her head)
          Temptress. I'm resolved.
          Charlie runs down. Wet from the shower, discombobulated.
          pecks Amy, grabs food off a plate. He's out of sorts.

                         AMY
          Oversleep?

                         CHARLIE
          Didn't.
          (off her look)
          Weird dreams.
          Charlie gives Jane a quick peck and follows Amy out.

          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT YARD -- DAY

          Amy and Charlie head to the car. Charlie turns -- looks back
          at JERRY'S HOUSE. The blacked out windows...

                         AMY
          What?
          Charlie snaps out of it. It's crazy to even entertain Ed's
          theories.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         31

                         CHARLIE
          Nothing. That guy was such a tool.

                         AMY

                         (HUMORING HIM)
          Totally. Poser.
          She gets in the car. Smiles a little.

                         FADE TO:

          INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY

          Charlie's in class. He's restless, agitated. On his pad, he
          absently draws VAMPIRE images, blood...

                         TEACHER
          Sally Cabella?

                         SALLY
          Here.

                         TEACHER
          Ed Lee?
          Nothing. Charlie looks up.

                         TEACHER (CONT'D)
          Edward Lee?
          Charlie looks around. No Ed. And just like he said -- quite
          a few other kids are missing. Charlie takes this in, looks
          around.

                         ABOVE CHARLIE
          SEATS ALL AROUND HIM ARE EMPTY. This time it makes an
          impact.

          EXT. BASEBALL FIELD -- DAY

          Charlie, Mark, Ben and the rest of the guys get ready for
          practice. Mark's in the middle of a story, but Charlie is
          distracted -- barely listening.

                         MARK
          .she's wearing a jumpsuit, dude.
          Like -- one zip and POP!

                         CHARLIE
          Huh.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         32

                         MARK
          What's up with you? Dreaming about
          your little boyfriend?
          Charlie takes this in, worried.

                         CHARLIE
          You see him around today? Ed?

                         BEN
          I don't track "it's" whereabouts.
          What did he want, anyway?

                         CHARLIE
          Nothing. Homework stuff.
          But Charlie's clearly distracted.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Look, I have to go.

                         MARK
          Now? You're ditching? I'll bail
          with you.

                         CHARLIE
          No -- I'm -- I don't feel so well.
          He takes off. Ben and Mark watch him, perplexed.

          EXT. ED'S HOUSE -- DAY

          Another suburban development. Rows and rows of red tile
          roofs, houses stacked right on top of one another...
          Charlie rings the bell of a modest place. Not as big as
          where Charlie and Jane live. But nice, well-tended for.
          ED's mom, VICTORIA, answers. She's surprised to see him.

                         VICTORIA
          Charlie!

                         CHARLIE
          Yeah, Hi Mrs. Lee.
          Victoria breaks into a wide smile.

                         VICTORIA
          God you're a sight for sore eyes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

          INT. ED'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Victoria pulls Charlie in and hugs him, happy. Calls out--

                         VICTORIA
          Rick! Charlie's here!

                         (TO CHARLIE)
          Look at you. So handsome!

                         CHARLIE
          Oh, I -- you don't have to--
           Now RICK, Ed's dad comes into the room. Shakes his hand.

                         RICK
          Ed said you'd sprouted. And
          you're, the--
          Rick awkwardly gestures around his face.

                         CHARLIE
          Cleared up. Yes sir--

                         VICTORIA
          Ed will be so sorry he missed you,
          But -- you should both be in school
          now, shouldn't you?

                         CHARLIE
          He's not here? Did you see him
          today?

                         RICK
          He's usually up and out early.
          Everything okay?

                         CHARLIE
          No, sure. We're working on a class
          project. I guess we crossed paths.

                         VICTORIA
          I'm so glad you're doing that. Ed,
          he'd be mad that I said so, but he
          talks about you all the time.
          This lands hard on Charlie. How remiss he's been.

                         CHARLIE
          Yeah. That's... He's great.

                         (THEN)
          Would it be okay if I went
          upstairs? Ed has a book we need.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         VICTORIA
          Of course. Make yourself at home.
          Charlie goes upstairs. Victoria makes a face at Rick --
          "that's good!" They're both pleased.

          INT. ED'S ROOM -- DAY

          Ed's room is a shrine to comic books, horror and fantasy
          movies.
          There's an art table where Ed has been working on some
          illustrations for a noir-style graphic novel. Charlie stops
          and looks at them. They're fantastic.
          He looks at the photos on the wall -- including a few
          pictures of Ed, Charlie and Adam when they were friends.

          CLOSE ON A PHOTO
          Charlie and Ed, arms around each other. Charlie is shorter
          and thinner -- with really bad acne. Not cute. WAY not.

                         ON CHARLIE
          Ouch. Best not to dwell. He turns and sees--
          PETER VINCENT'S "FRIGHT NIGHT" POSTER on a wall. Charlie
          takes it in, laughs a little.
          Then Charlie examines a WHOLE WALL devoted to Ed's
          investigation of Jerry. Maps, news reports, vampire lore
          printed off the internet, books, etc.
          If you didn't know the difference, you'd say it's just more
          of Ed's fictional world.
          Charlie stares at it all for a beat. Then shakes his head.
          It's all a fantasy -- nothing more.

                         CHARLIE
          This is crazy.
          He starts to take off. But sees that Ed's computer is on --
          and one file stands out. "THE JERRY DIARIES."
          Charlie gives in to his curiosity -- clicks it open -- finds
          a bunch of Quicktime files.
          He opens one. Stops.

          CLOSE ON COMPUTER

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          As BLURRY short clips play:
          Jerry's truck, in motion but it looks like NOBODY'S DRIVING

          IT.
          DORIS the neighbor chatting on Jerry's lawn -- with nobody.
          Over and over, it's appears that JERRY DOESN'T SHOW UP on
          video.

                         OFF CHARLIE
          Taking this in. Chilled.

          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- NIGHT

          It's dark as Charlie comes home. He looks warily at Jerry's
          house as he searches for his keys.
          BAM -- he walks right into JERRY.

                         JERRY
          Hey guy.
          Charlie tries to maintain his cool. What if Jerry is what Ed
          thought? Impossible, but...

                         CHARLIE
          Hey. Guy.

                         JERRY
          You could really do me a solid.

                         CHARLIE
          Yeah? What kind.

                         JERRY
          I have a girl on her way over for a
          beer, and I'm totally out of beer.
          They're at Charlie's back door, the one that leads to the
          kitchen.

                         CHARLIE
          Bummer.

                         JERRY
          Set me up, I'll pay you back two
          times. A sixer for your mom, and
          one for you.

                         CHARLIE
          Uh, yeah, sure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.
          Jerry watches Charlie as he unlocks the door.
          This is when Charlie should invite him in.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Let me see what Mom's got. She's
          kind of a "light domestic".. .mom.
          Charlie steps inside. Pointedly DOESN'T ask Jerry to enter.
          Charlie intentionally leaves the door open, moves to the
          refrigerator. But keeps his eyes on Jerry. If he steps in,
          uninvited, Ed's theory is blown.

                         JERRY
          Nice kitchen. Same floor plan as
          my place, huh?
          Jerry leans against the door jamb -- BUT DOES NOT CROSS THE
          THRESHOLD. Charlie observes this. Holy shit.
          Charlie and Jerry MEET EYES. Then a cold smile creeps over
          Jerry's face.
          Charlie fumbles, lets one of the wet beers slide from his
          hand -- it hits the ground, explodes.

                         CHARLIE
          Fuck!

                         JERRY
          Can I help you with that?

                         CHARLIE
          No! No. Thanks. I'll get it.
          Jerry takes in Charlie's frantic refusal. Now he's darkly
          certain. He's been made.
          Charlie tosses the broken bottle into the sink. Moves to the
          doorway with the remaining beers.
          Charlie hands them over the threshold. But doesn't cross.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          There you go. Uh...party down.
          Jerry watches him, intense. His tone shifts -- cocky and
          intimidating. A threat disguised as "guy talk."

                         JERRY
          This girl tonight -- she's a
          handful. You know.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         JERRY (CONT'D)
          Women who look a certain way, they
          need to be managed.

                         CHARLIE
          Yeah.

                         JERRY
          You don't mind my saying, you got a
          lot on your shoulders for a kid.
          Your pal, Amy? She's ripe. Must
          be a line of guys dying to pluck
          that. Your mom too -- you don't
          see it, maybe you do -- she's
          giving it off. It's on you to
          watch out for them. You up for
          that?
          Charlie's burning. But holds himself in check.

                         CHARLIE
          I think I can manage.

                         JERRY
          Good. Cause there are bad people
          out there, man. Better keep an eye
          on your women.
          Jerry backs away, intimidating even as he retreats.

                         JERRY (CONT'D)
          Thanks for the beers.
          Charlie watches him move into the dark.

          INT. BREWSTER HOUSE - CHARLIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

          Charlie bursts into his room, freaked out -- races to the
          window.
          His room is free of all geekery. Now it's all sports and
          sneakerhead stuff.
          AMY's there -- on his bed and surrounded by school books.
          She's reading Wuthering Heights.

                         AMY
          Where've you been? You told me to
          meet you here an hour ago.

                         CHARLIE'S POV
          Jerry's nowhere to be seen and his house is quiet. Lights on
          behind BLACKED OUT WINDOWS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          Hello?
          Charlie breaks away from the window. It's an effort. His
          focus is still half there, even as he tries to talk to Amy.

                         CHARLIE
          Sorry. You okay? Everything okay?
          He checks his phone. Checks for anything from ED. Nothing.

                         AMY
          Yeah. Why shouldn't it be?

                         CHARLIE
          No, it should. Nothing.

                         AMY
          (re: her book)
          You ever read this? It's good.
          Sexy, actually.
          Amy moves to Charlie. Puts her arms around him.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          In a frustrated, unconsummated sort
          of way.

                         CHARLIE
          Like us, you mean.
          Amy laughs, pulls him onto the bed. She's feeling frisky.

                         AMY
          Kinda makes it hotter.

                         CHARLIE
          Yeah, so you keep saying.
          He smiles a little. She kisses him. But feels his distance.

                         AMY
          Am I boring you? What's up?

                         CHARLIE
          What? No. I'm kind of wiped out,
          that's all.

                         AMY
          I can fix that.
          She kisses him again. Despite himself, Charlie gets drawn in
          and turned on. She pulls back, serious.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          Want to get under the covers?

                         CHARLIE
          -- now? Seriously?

                         AMY
          Calm down. Let's just... see how it
          goes.
          Charlie's dying inside. Now?! Could not be a worse time.

                         CHARLIE
          Believeme when I say--thereis
          nothing in the worldI'dratherdo

                         BUT--

                         AMY
          Charlie. Don't be nervous.
          She kisses him again. It's intense, passionate. Charlie
          weakens a little. Maybe death and mayhem can wait...
          Amy moves to take off her top. Oh. My. God--
          DING DONG. Somebody is ringing the bell at Jerry's. Charlie
          stops. Practically tosses Amy off him.

                         CHARLIE
          You hear that?
          He rushes to the window. Looks outside.

                         CHARLIE'S POV
          DORIS is at Jerry's front door. Holding a bottle of wine.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Shit.

                         AMY
          What?
          JERRY comes to the door. He and Doris start chatting. She's
          flirting up a storm.

                         CHARLIE
          Shit, shit, shit--
          Amy sees what Charlie sees. Shrugs.

                         AMY
          He's hot. She's a stripper. They
          were bound to find each other.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         CHARLIE

                         GO-GO DANCER--

                         AMY
          Take away two tiny pieces of cloth,
          stripper.

                         (LIGHTLY)
          You jealous?

                         CHARLIE
          What? No--
          Jerry is showing Doris in when he stops-and looks DIRECTLY AT
          CHARLIE. It's chilling.
          Charlie DIVES away from the window, grabbing Amy and pulling
          her down too.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          He looked right at us.

                         AMY
          Maybe. Not a big deal--
          Charlie's freaked now. Doris is IN THERE.

                         CHARLIE
          No, it is a big. A very big. He
          saw us and he was pissed.

                         AMY
          Okay...
          Amy moves away. Looking at him skeptically.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          If you're not into this, say so.
          Don't do me any favors.

                         CHARLIE
          What? No! I am, I totally am.
          just -- I don't trust that guy.
          He glances out the window again. Amy's irritated, not used
          to having her passes rejected. She gathers her stuff.

                         AMY
          I'm going.

                         CHARLIE
          Amy. Don't--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         AMY
          No. You've got your neighborhood
          watch thing.

                         CHARLIE
          Come on, don't be that way--
          But she's gone.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Crap!
          A beat. Charlie's torn -- he should go after her. But
          Doris's muted LAUGH from the other house draws his attention.
          He looks again at Jerry's house. He can see faint shadows
          moving behind the windows in the house, like ghosts.
           Charlie's conflicted, freaked -- what can he do? He picks up
          the phone. Dials 911. Then thinks better of it. Hangs up.
          Finally -- he stops at the window, eyes on JERRY'S PLACE.
          Listening and watching intently. Keeping sentry.

                         FADE TO:

          INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- CHARLIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

          Later. Charlie's fallen asleep in a chair by the window.
          He's startled awake by a woman's SCREAMS. They sound like
          they are coming from Jerry's.
          But are they screams of pleasure or pain?
          Charlie looks out the window. Jerry's house is dark. It's
          all quiet. Charlie looks at the clock. tam.
          Charlie sits back on his bed. Was it a dream? Then Charlie
          hears A MOTOR START. Charlie goes back to the window.
          Jerry's TRUCK starts and Jerry drives off.
          Off Charlie, unsettled.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- NIGHT

          A short while later. Charlie moves cautiously into Jerry's
          backyard. He's wearing ALL BLACK and his dad's old winter
          gloves. He looks at his iPhone.
          ON THE PHONE -- a diagram. "How to pick a lock."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          Charlie steels his nerves. At Jerry's back door, he clumsily
          tries to pick the lock. After a moment or two, he realizes
          he has no idea what he's doing.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Crap.
          He walks away from the door, frustrated. Then turns and
          impulsively tries to KICK IN the DOOR with his foot. Nothing
          happens.
          Then something occurs to Charlie. He goes into the garden.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          The Perrys...
          Charlie finds a FAKE ROCK. Turns it over. It has a KEY in
          it. Charlie's like -- duh.
          He puts the key in the back door lock. It opens.

          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Charlie moves through the first story of the house. He's
          cautious, on edge.
          At first the place seems totally unremarkable. A typical
          "guy pad". Lots of inexpensive furniture, bad art, a salt
          water fish tank...
          At every turn, Charlie expects something or someone to jump
          out at him. It's unbearably tense.

          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS -- NIGHT

          Charlie looks upstairs. Moves through a plain white hallway,
          finds an open door that leads to Jerry's office, where he
          keeps an EXTENSIVE LIBRARY.
          On one wall hangs a TAPESTRY that looks very old, decorated
          with a strange INSIGNIA. Charlie takes a picture of it with
          his phone.

          INT. JERRY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

          Charlie goes into Jerry's bedroom - opens his closet. Sees a
          variety of UNIFORMS. Cop, gas man, UPS, etc. Charlie
          reacts, chilled.
          Charlie stops. JERRY'S TRUCK is pulling into the driveway.
          Charlie's in a panic. Jerry will be inside any moment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.
          There's no time to get out so Charlie ducks into the CLOSET.

          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- CLOSET -- NIGHT

          Charlie pushes as far back into the closet as he can go.
          Leans against the back wall.
          The BACK OF THE CLOSET SWINGS OPEN and Charlie falls back
          into a HIDDEN HALLWAY.
          Charlie stands, stunned, see that the hallway is lined by
          small rooms on either side.
          It's clear that these are additions Jerry's added. Each room
          has a small rectangular WINDOW, so you can see in.
          Charlie reacts, sick. It looks like a prison. Despite the
          danger, he creeps over and looks in one of the rooms--

          WHAM!!
          A pale HAND slaps against the window. Charlie jumps.

                         CHARLIE
          Fuck! --
          DORIS is in the window now. Bruised and so pale she looks
          almost BLUE.

                         DORIS
          Help...

                         CHARLIE
          Oh my God. Oh, shit--
          Charlie tugs on the door. Locked.
          He stands back, what to do? Charlie hears a NOISE. The
          FRONT DOOR. And then -- JERRY'S FOOTSTEPS approaching.

                         DORIS
          Oh... Oh no... Get me out of here!
          Doris pounds on the door. In a cold panic.

                         CHARLIE
          I'm -- I won't leave you--
          But Charlie has no choice. The footsteps are getting CLOSER.

                         DORIS
          Please! No! Don't go!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          Charlie ducks inside one of the CELLS across from Doris,
          moves behind the door.
          JERRY steps into the hallway, walks right by Charlie's hiding
          place. Pauses near him.
          The door is ajar. Was it that way before? Charlie holds his
          breath.
          Jerry moves to the CELL and retrieves DORIS's half-alive body
          from it.
          Charlie cautiously looks through the crack in the door.

                          DORIS (CONT'D)
          .no... . God, no... please...
          The door to Doris's cell open. Charlie can see PART of
          Doris's body and face.
          Jerry is mostly obscured, bent over Doris -- holding her.
          Charlie watches helplessly, horrified.

                         DORIS (CONT'D)
          Please, please... don't kill me.
          Doris's body TENSES and starts to jerk, as Jerry TUGS AND
          RIPS AT IT SAVAGELY. It's clear he's FEEDING ON HER,
          although we can't see his face.
          Doris screams, then starts to cry. It's stark and REAL and
          terrifying.
          It seems to go on and on. Doris weakens, her head lolling to
          one side, her light fading.
          A small stream of blood spreads across the white pavement.
          In the position she's in, she is eye to eye with CHARLIE.
          She sees him, smiles weakly. Then mouths something -- too
          weak to make much sound.

                          DORIS (CONT'D)
          Cha... Cha...
          CHARLIE is petrified. Doris gets it -- smiles a little
          grimly, puts a finger to her lips. Silence.
          After what seems like an eternity, Jerry is satisfied. He
          tosses Doris aside and stands away from her.
          Charlie DUCKS behind the door as Jerry emerges and casually
          wipes a spot of blood from his mouth.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          Then Jerry LOCKS DORIS back into her cell. Pockets the key
          and moves off toward the stairs. After a moment, he's gone.
          The sound of a TV starts in Jerry's living room. Something
          banal like "The Real Housewives of Orange County."
          Charlie knows this is his moment. With shaking hands, he
          retrieves his iPhone and pulls up the "HOW TO PICK A LOCK"
          screen.
          Charlie looks through the window in Doris's cell. She's
          breathing -- alive.
          Charlie whispers to himself as he uses a bobby pin and a tiny
          screwdriver on the lock.

                         CHARLIE
          Please... Please...
          The bobby pin slips. Drops. Charlie's losing it. Steadies
          himself. Tries again.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Come on.
          The tension is unbearable. Charlie can hear JERRY moving
          downstairs.

                         CLICK
          The lock slides open. Charlie breathes with relief. Then he
          grabs Doris and BOLTS.
          Charlie SLIPS in a pool of blood left behind from Jerry's
          feeding, but he manages to stay on his feet.
          He pushes Doris ahead of him, to a BACK STAIRCASE.
          His PHONE drops out of his pocket, he has to double back --
          every moment counts. Doris's barely aware of what's
          happening, let alone where she is.

          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- STAIRWELL/ENTRY -- DAWN

          A moment later. Charlie and Doris emerge downstairs, near
          the entry hall. They can see the front door -- and hear
          Jerry moving in another room.
          Charlie looks around, trying to get oriented.
          JERRY emerges -- almost sees them. Charlie ducks into a
          hiding spot and grabs Doris, covering her mouth.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          A long beat as Jerry returns to the living room with a beer.
          Settles in a chair facing away from the door.
          Charlie considers his options. Says almost silently:

                         CHARLIE
          Same floor plan.
          He grabs Doris and bolts for the kitchen.

          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAWN

          A back door. Leading out. Charlie and Doris race for it,
          DORIS stumbles and bumps into a chair. Stifles a cry.

          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- DAWN

          Jerry turns at the noise.

          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAWN

          Charlie throws the back door open, he and DORIS ESCAPE.

          EXT. JERRY HOUSE -- DAWN

          The sun is just starting to rise. Charlie races for his
          house, with Doris holding on to him tight. She's crying with
          gratitude and relief, manages--

                         DORIS
          Thank you, thank you...
          Doris looks up at him, her EYES TURNING BLACK, her veins
          going gray. A first ray of pure sunlight hits them.

                         CHARLIE
          Doris?
          In a flash, DORIS starts to BURN. Charlie is helpless to stop
          it as she GOES UP IN FLAMES and explodes.

                         CHARLIE REACTS
          Horrified. In shock.

          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAWN

          Jerry moves into the kitchen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          The back door is closed now -- but the blinds sway slightly.
          And there are BLOODY prints on the floor from Charlie's
          sneakers.
          Jerry takes this in, coldly furious.

                         FADE TO:

          INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- CHARLIE'S ROOM -- DAWN

          Charlie sits on his bed -- still in a state of shock. This
          shit is for real.
          Jane comes to the door, her knock cursory. She enters.

                         JANE
          You're going to be late.
          Jane moves to the windows, throws the curtains open. Charlie
          winces at the sun. He got no sleep, looks like hell.

                         JANE (CONT'D)
          The hours you keep. It's like
          living with a vampire.
          Charlie stops. Looks at her. She has no idea.

                         CHARLIE
          Listen -- promise me -- that guy
          next door, Jerry? Under no
          circumstances do you invite him
          into our house. He's dangerous.

                         JANE
          I think I can handle myself.

                         CHARLIE
          No, no you can't--

                         JANE CHARLIE
          Charlie-- Don't even look in his
          direction, understand? And
          at night, you stay inside.

                         JANE
          Because he's dangerous. What kind
          of dangerous?
          Charlie starts gathering his things. Getting ready to bolt.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         CHARLIE
          Can you trust me? For once, don't
          ask a million questions--

                         JANE
          Charlie. Stop. I'm your mom, not
          some ridiculous woman--

                         CHARLIE

                         (GENUINE)
          I'm sorry. Okay? I know... We
          just don't have time for a big
          thing! I'm telling you--

                         JANE
          That's enough. I'm done with this
          conversation.
          She moves away.

                         CHARLIE
          Mom! Mom--
          But she's gone. Charlie looks after her, worried.

          EXT./INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY

          Later. Charlie approaches the school. Kids swarm around
          him, happy and care-free. Charlie's in another world.

          twilight.
           Vamps always sleep in the dirt. Vamps never sleep.

          can NOT shape-shift.

                         ON CHARLIE
          We see now that he's on a computer in the SCHOOL LIBRARY,
          isolated behind some stacks.
          He clicks a link on one of the sites -- which leads him to
          PETER VINCENT'S website. It's an elaborate interactive site.
          It says that Vincent is a serious student of all things
          occult -- especially VAMPIRES -- and has amassed a vast
          collection of books and artifacts.
          It also claims that there are different TRIBES of vampires.

          ON CHARLIE'S NOTEBOOK
          He writes in big letters

           TRIBES?

           PETER VINCENT -- VAMP EXPERT?

          AMY (O.S.)
          Hey.
          Charlie looks up. Amy stands over him, a little wary.
          Charlie covers his writing and closes his computer screen.
          He looks like hell. Disheveled, sleep deprived, tense.

                         CHARLIE
          Hey...

                         AMY
          You weren't in class. What are you
          working on?

                         CHARLIE
          Porn. Hacked it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         AMY
          Oh, good. I thought it was
          something creepy.
          Charlie nods. Smiles wanly. Then--

                         CHARLIE
          Look, I'd better...

                         AMY
          Get back to your porn. Got it.
          She looks away, losing patience. Charlie rallies.

                         CHARLIE
          No. Sorry. I'm just -- I could
          use some coffee.
          She looks back. Okay.

          EXT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- QUAD -- DAY

          Charlie and Amy sit in the busy quad.

                         CHARLIE
          We can't hang out at my house any
          more. My mom's flipping out about
          some stuff. I can see you at
          school, but for a while --

                         AMY
          Why? What's going on?

                         CHARLIE
          It's hard to explain. Just...
          What can he say? He has to protect her, but how?
          BEN AND MARK Join them. Notice how tweaked Charlie looks.

                         BEN
          You look like dog shit.

                         CHARLIE
          Thanks.

                         MARK
          Your pal the spaz, his folks were
          here earlier. It's a big thing.

                         CHARLIE
          What? Why?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         MARK
          I don't know. He ran away or
          something. They were all upset,
          talking to the principal.

                         BEN
          One less tweaker clogging up the
          halls.
          Charlie stands, upset.

                         CHARLIE
          Shut up.

                         MARK BEN
          Charlie-- Chill out-

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          You don't know what you're talking
          about. He could be dead for all
          you know.
          Mark steps in. Calming, reasonable.

                         MARK
          You're right. Not cool. You're
          worried and it's totally
          understandable.

                         (THEN)
          But he's better off, man. He'll be
          happier with the other trolls on
          the shire.
          That's it. Charlie DECKS MARK. They go to the ground and
          Charlie lets loose on him. A bunch of other guys pull them
          apart amid shouts, etc.
          Mark is bloodied and freaked.

                         MARK (CONT'D)
          What the fuck man!?
          AMY stands back, appalled.

                         AMY
          Charlie!! What the hell is wrong
          with you?!

                         CHARLIE

                         (TO MARK)
          You're an idiot, you know that?

                         (SUPER EMPHATIC)
          And it's HOBBITS on the shire!

          Charlie turns to Amy--

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Come on.
          But she shakes her head and moves to MARK and BEN.

                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)

                          AMY--

                          AMY
           Just get out of here, Charlie. Go.
           He knows it's over. Heartbroken, he takes off.

                          FADE TO:

          EXT. THE STRIP -- DAY

          Charlie gets off the bus and walks toward one of the nicer
          hotels.
          He's looking at another "how to" on his phone. "How to meet
          a celebrity."

          INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- ELEVATOR -- DAY

          Charlie watches a bunch of CONVENTIONEERS with BADGES in the

          FOOD COURT.
          A guy about Charlie's size leaves his coat and badge on his
          chair -- goes to get his food.
          Charlie sweeps in and quietly takes it.

          INT. HOTEL SHOWROOM -- DAY


                         CLOSE ON

                         PETER VINCENT
          40's, but all wiry rock n' roll attitude. Leather pants and
          tattoos, Long black hair wrapped in a bandana. Dark painted
          nails and heavy eye make-up. HEAVY METAL MUSIC BLARES.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.
          The whole scene is OVER THE TOP GOTH cheesiness. Lots of
          stage effects and fire...
          PAMELA ANDERSON look-alikes in skimpy outfits prance on stage
          as another SEXY GIRL is handcuffed, S&M style, to a CIRCULAR

          TORTURE BOARD.

          ON THE AUDIENCE
          We see that this is a run-through. Tech guys work light
          boards, etc. A director and scattered others sit in the
          seats.

                         CHARLIE
          Sneaks in one of the back doors. Silently moves close to the
          stage.
          He's WEARING THE STOLEN COAT.
          The badge holder now has the SUN masthead logo inside. It
          looks, at first glance, like a legit credential.

                         ON STAGE
          Peter reveals a tray full of SHARP DAGGERS. He raises them
          to the audience.

                         PETER
          The knives are real.
          He CUTS his OWN PALM with one, bleeds. Doesn't even wince.
          Stud.

                         PETER (CONT'D)
          The girl is real.
          He GRABS HER, feels her up. She giggles.

                         SEXY ASSISTANT
          Ooooo!
          Peter YANKS down on the circular board the assistant's tied
          to -- sending her SPINNING.

                         PETER
          And if I miss, she'll really be
          dead.
          The music switches. It's all TENSION. Peter FLINGS a
          dagger. SCHWACK! The assistant DUCKS as the KNIFE embeds in
          the board behind her, this close where her head was.
          She screams! Breaks character.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         SEXY ASSISTANT
          Holy Shit! Pete!
          Also out of character -- PETER speaks in a thick QUEEN'S

          ACCENT.

                         PETER
          You can't say that!
          (moves to her)
          Stop the-- STOP. CUT!!
          The music stops. The spinning board stops.

                         SEXY ASSISTANT
          You almost tore my extensions out!
          Why do you have to throw a real
          knife!?

                         PETER

                         (RE: KNIFE)
          It barely cuts! That board is like
          butter.
          He tears the MAKEUP appliance off his hand that made it look
          like he cut himself. The assistant pulls out of her VELCRO
          straps.

                         SEXY ASSISTANT
          Everybody else fakes it!

                         PETER
          But this looks authentic--

                         SEXY ASSISTANT
          Then learn how to throw!
          She stomps off the stage. Peter can't believe it.

                         PETER
          Screw this.
          He starts to stalk off stage. CHARLIE rushes toward him.

                         CHARLIE
          Mr. Vincent! Mr. Vincent--
          A tech guy moves in on Charlie.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Charles Brewster. From the Sun?
          We had an appointment.

                         PETER
          I don't think so. Talk to my guy.

                         CHARLIE
          We're doing a piece -- "Vampires.
          Separating myth from fact."

                         PETER
          You want a comment? That's a shit
          idea for an article.
          Peter starts to move off. Charlie, anxious, follows.

                         CHARLIE
          Please. I really -- I need your
          expertise. You're the man on this
          stuff, right?
          Peter sees how desperate Charlie is. Stops.

                         PETER
          What is this, like your first
          assignment?

                         CHARLIE
          Actually -- yeah.

                         PETER

          Ten minutes.

          INT. PETER VINCENT'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

          Peter lives in a two story penthouse at the top of one of the
          casino hotels that he works in. It's lavish, floor to
          ceiling windows, etc.
          Still, goth influence reigns. The decor is tacky Haunted
          Mansion all the way.
          Charlie is shown into the "museum" by Peter's ASSISTANT,
          ARTHUR, who looks and sounds A LOT LIKE PETER.

                         ARTHUR
          Don't touch anything, dude.

          INT. PETER'S "MUSEUM"/LIBRARY -- NIGHT

          Charlie enters -- comes face to face with a SNARLING
          WEREWOLF. He starts. Then realizes it's a life-size model.

                         CHARLIE
          Ho -- wow.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.
          Charlie stands back, takes in the place. It's an amazing
          combination of FANTASY memorabilia and ACTUAL occult weapons
          and objects. It seems to go on and on.

                         ARTHUR
          Got rooms of this crap. Ebay.
          Charlie examines a case that holds all kinds of TORTURE
          DEVICES and battle axes, as well as SPIKED BALL MACES, etc.
          Cases hold ancient texts and scrolls, haunted objects, etc.

                         CHARLIE
          Amazing.
          Charlie is genuinely impressed. The geek in him can't help
          it. Peter enters, talks to Arthur--

                         PETER
          Midori me.
          Arthur pours Peter a green drink as Peter pulls off his black
          wig (bandana attached) and peels off a nude body shirt that
          has a bunch of TATTOOS printed on it.
          He steps out of his boots, with three-inch LIFTS. Collapses
          into an arm chair. He's just another balding, middle-aged
          guy with bad eyes.
          Peter downs his drink. Arthur hands him the bottle. Peter
          looks at Charlie.
          In truth, Peter's isolated himself to the point that he
          actually welcomes a visitor -- though he'd never admit it.

                         PETER (CONT'D)

                         (RE: MIDORI)
          Looks like pee but I'm hooked. You
          want?

                         CHARLIE
          No, thanks. Not...on the job.
          Peter scratches avidly at his crotch.

                         PETER
          Leather, it doesn't breath. You
          know? Fucking rashes are killing
          me... So I'm your expert, huh?
          For your vampire thing.

                         (BITTER)
          They're all the rage, huh.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         CHARLIE
          Yeah. I guess... So -- say I want
          to kill one. But really. How how
          would you do it?

                         PETER
          Depends. You got fire, beheading.
          Or go classic -- stake through the
          heart. Bam!

                         CHARLIE
          So all that actually works?

                         PETER
          How the fuck do I know.

                         CHARLIE
          I thought you're--

                         PETER
          I read books, man. You think I'm
          hanging out with Dracula and the
          Easter Bunny?

                         CHARLIE
          Sorry. No.
          Charlie realizes he has no choice. He has to reveal more.

                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)
           I -- I have a personal interest in
          this story.
          (off Peter's look)
          A friend's missing, actually. I
          think one of them got him.

                         PETER
          Them, meaning a "vampire."

                         CHARLIE
          Jerry. He lives next door to me.

                         PETER
          "Jerry?"

                         CHARLIE
          I know.

                         (THEN)
          But it's no joke. If you look at
          these clips, you'll see. They take
          some time to load but...
          Charlie moves to Peter, shows him his phone. Digs into his
          pocket.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          And I printed up some photos I
          took. In his place. Or lair...
          Charlie put the photos in front of Peter on the table.
          Peter's expression closes. He stands, pissed.

                         PETER
          Arthur!

                         CHARLIE
          No, come on, I'm--

                         PETER
          You're a nutjob. Arthur!
          Charlie deflates -- his desperation showing again.

                         CHARLIE
          Listen to me. I saw it. I saw him
          kill a girl. She burned up in my
          hands. You have to tell me how to
          stop him.
          Arthur enters.

                         PETER
          Get this loser out of my sight.

                         CHARLIE
          I know what I saw.

                         PETER
          No you don't. See this guy?
          He gestures to ARTHUR.

                         PETER (CONT'D)
          My cousin, Art. He's "me" on
          stage. That's how I teleport.
          People see what they want to see.

                         CHARLIE

                         (URGENT)
          This is what you've been looking
          for, I promise. I can take you to
          him, to his place.

                         PETER
          In Clark County Nevada. A hot bed
          of supernatural activity.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         CHARLIE
          Yes! It's genius. A transient
          population. A town where people
          work all night, sleep all day...

                         PETER
          A town full of con-artists.
          (not buying it)
          No. You're working me, or
          somebody's working you.
          Charlie's getting angry now.

                         CHARLIE
          He already got my friend! I know
          how I sound. But I'm not crazy. I
          didn't want this. I don't want to
          know this. Just tell me what to
          do!
          Peter feels Charlie's sincerity. For a moment he looks
          genuinely conflicted. But his expression hardens.

                         PETER
          Run.

                         CHARLIE
          What?

                         PETER
          You heard me.
          He moves away. But Charlie is on his heels. Peter looks to
          ARTHUR, nods.

                         CHARLIE
          So I save my own skin so he can
          keep killing!? I won't. We have
          to kill him! Please!--
          Arthur THROWS Charlie out, the door closed firmly behind him.

          INT. PETER VINCENT'S PENTHOUSE -- OUTER HALL -- DUSK

          Charlie stands, shut out. What the hell is he going to do
          now?

                         FADE TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE/JERRY'S HOUSE -- DUSK

          Moving in on the Brewster home, an odd sight is revealed.
          Every window is draped with strings of GARLIC.
          Charlie's revealed in his window -- hammering up another long
          rope of the stuff.
          His gaze falls on JERRY'S HOUSE and we follow it.

          INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- CHARLIE'S ROOM -- DUSK

          Now we find that Charlie's entire room is decked out in anti-
          vamp decor. Not just the garlic but crosses and other
          religious pictures, etc.
          Charlie LOOKS at the clock -- night coming too quickly. He's
          grimly focused as he starts sharpening a STAKE.
          A knock. Jane doesn't enter this time. Another knock.

                         CHARLIE
          What?
          Jane walks in. Takes in the decor.

                         JANE
          The whole house looks like that
          show Dark Shadows.

                         CHARLIE
          It's a gag. For Amy. Long story.

                         JANE
          (takes this in/then)
          You like her a lot, don't you?
          A moment when they could connect. But Charlie just nods.
          Jane's disappointed. Then--

                         JANE (CONT'D)
          Don't use tape on the walls.

                         (THEN)
          Oh. Ed's parents left a few
          messages, looking for him.
          Charlie looks up at this. Pained.

                         CHARLIE
          Okay.
          He goes back to his work. Jane looks at him for a beat, then
          she starts to go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          THE DOORBELL RINGS. Before Jane can really react, Charlie
          pushes past her.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          DON'T. Don't open it.

          INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- DUSK

           Charlie races downstairs. Stops. AMY is standing in the
          living room.

                         CHARLIE
          How'd you get in?!

                         AMY
          It was unlocked.

                         CHARLIE
          MOM! You have to lock the door!

                         AMY
          Okay, whatever, listen. You're
          flipping out. Punching out your
          friends and blowing everything off
          and is that a stake?
          A beat. He forgot he was holding it. He hides it behind his
          back.

                         CHARLIE
          No.
          Amy sits, upset. Looks around and sees that the living room
          is decked in more anti-vamp decor.

                         AMY
          Look. Even if you're losing it --
          you don't get to blow me off. You
          don't go from something to nothing
          overnight.

                         (EMOTIONAL)
          You're not nothing to me, Charlie.
          Whatever's happening, just -- talk
          to me.
          Charlie takes this in, emotional. But--

                         CHARLIE
          I can't let you get hurt. You need
          to forget about me for a while.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         AMY
          What? How am I going to get hurt?
          Tell me. Charlie--
          Now there's another KNOCK at the door. Jane comes downstairs-

                         JANE
          I got it--

                         CHARLIE
          NO. Don't answer it.
          A tense moment. Another knock.

                         INNERCUT WITH

          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT DOOR -- DUSK

          JERRY stands at the door. Quietly enraged.

                         JANE
          This is ridiculous--

                         JERRY
          Jane. It's Jerry from next door--

                         CHARLIE
          I'm telling you, don't answer it!

                         JANE
          This is my house. I'll answer the
          door if I want to.
          She starts to move to the door again. Charlie blocks her
          way, desperate.

                         CHARLIE
          Mom. He murdered Ed and Adam. And
          I have proof.
          Jane is stunned, at a loss. From the other side of the door--

          JERRY (O.S.)
          Jane? I need to talk to you.

                         JANE
          Just-- Hold on!

          JERRY (O.S.)
          Now. Your son is harassing me!
          He pounds on the door. Jane examines Charlie closely.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         63

                         JANE
          Charlie. What's happening?

                         CHARLIE
          Whatever he says, don't--

          JERRY (O.S.)
          He broke into my house. I'd rather
          not take this to the authorities.
          But I will! He's sick, deluded--

                         CHARLIE
          Mom.
          A tense beat... Finally--

                         JANE

                         (YELLS/ANGRY)
          Get the authorities! My son is a
          good kid!
          Charlie sags with relief. A brief look of appreciation
          passes between Charlie and Jane.

                         ON JERRY
          As he backs away from the door. His expression goes cold.
          He disappears into the dark.

          INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

          Charlie races to a window. SEES JERRY MOVE out of sight.

                         CHARLIE
          Shit, shit...

                         JANE
          What? What is he doing?

                         CHARLIE
          Whatever it is, it's not good.

          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT YARD -- NIGHT

          Jerry stands back, intense. He's got to take care of this
          problem NOW.

          INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

          Charlie's running from window to window now, trying to see
          what's going on.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         CHARLIE
          Just -- if we stay in here -- he
          has to give up. He can't get in
          without an invitation.

                         AMY

                         OH--

                         (GETTING IT)
          Oh... Really? Like a--

                          CHARLIE
          Vampire. Really.
           Amy and Jane are blown away. Charlie's going crazy.

          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- NIGHT

           Jerry carries a SHOVEL and A SMALL SAW. He stalks into the
          Brewster's backyard, where he's hidden from the street.

          INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

          Jane follows Charlie, worried.

                         JANE
          Think about what you're saying--

                         CHARLIE
          I have. I've "processed," believe
          me.
          Jane takes this in. Then SMILES.

                         JANE
          Ooooh. This is the gag! For Amy.
          I can't believe you got Jerry to go
          along with it!
          Charlie stops. Fuck.

          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- NIGHT


          CLOSE ON JERRY
          As he starts to DIG UNDERGROUND -- amazingly strong and
          swift.

          INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

          Charlie hands Amy and Jane both CROSSES on CHAINS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         CHARLIE
          Take these. Put them on. Just do
          it.

                         JANE

                         (HUMORING HIM)
          Okaaaay. Vampire protection!

                         AMY
          I don't think this is funny.
          But she puts it on.

          EXT. BREWSTER BACKYARD -- NIGHT

          Jerry pulls up the NATURAL GAS LINE that leads to the
          BREWSTER'S HOUSE. He SAWS IT OPEN AND LIGHTS THE END ON

          FIRE.

          INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM/VARIOUS -- NIGH

          Hisssssssssss. A strange sounds coming from under the floor.

                         AMY

                         WHAT'S THA--
          BOOM!! The GAS FIREPLACE EXPLODES, the STOVE EXPLODES, THE
          WATER HEATER ALL EXPLODE at once!!
          WINDOWS BLOW OUT as Charlie JUMPS on Jane and Amy, dragging
          them to the ground.
          The room starts to BURN.
          Charlie, Amy and Jane are in a panic. They try to put the
          fire out, but it's no use.
          Charlie stops. A CHILLING SIGHT:
          Jerry stands on the other side of the blown-out windows. His
          expression dark. Through the flames he says--

                         JERRY
          Don't need an invitation if there's
          no house.
          A beat. Charlie GRABS Amy and Jane and they RUN through the
          house.

          INT/EXT. BREWSTER GARAGE/STREET - NIGHT

          y, Charlie and Jane race into the garage

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         AMY
          I can drive--

                         JANE
          I drive!
          They jump into Jane's car. Hit the garage opener--

                         CHARLIE
          Gun it Mom! Go!!!
          Jane GUNS IT THROUGH THE OPENING GARAGE DOOR, destroying it.
          She CLIPS Charlie's dirt bike -- pushing it onto the sidewalk
          as she takes off.
          Jane's car swings wide into the street, almost smashing into
          an arriving FIRE ENGINE! Charlie, Amy and Jane SCREAM!!
          They narrowly avoid a head-on collision with a FIRE TRUCK.

                         ON JERRY
          As he sees the dirt bike in the driveway. He jumps on.
          Tries to start it. NO GO. Fuck.

          INT. JANE'S CAR -- NIGHT


                         JANE
          What did we do!? What does he
          want!?
          They are racing away when the DIRT BIKE COMES CRASHING
          THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW of the car, nearly taking Amy's head
          off.

                         AMY

                         HOLY--
          Everyone reacts. Then the BIKE STARTS - the wheels spinning
          wildly in the back seat.

                         CHARLIE
          Amy!
          Amy's hair gets caught in the spokes - it's horrible as it
          YANKS part of her hair out.
          Charlie grabs her away from the bike -- she falls into his
          arms, crying as JERRY's BIG PICKUP appears in the rear
          windshield.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         JANE
          He's coming!

          THEY SWERVE OUT THE SHADOW HILLS GATES

          EXT. MAJOR STREET -- NIGHT

          Jane speeds down the street, which is wide and not heavily
          trafficked here.
          Unlike the planned community of Shadow Hills -- now we can
          see we're surrounded by great expanses of empty DESERT.
          JERRY'S TRUCK SMASHES REPEATEDLY into JANE'S.

                         AMY
          My brother has a gun!

                         CHARLIE
          Good to know! Is he here?!

                         JANE
          Call the police! Anybody--
          Jane manages to evade Jerry until --
          The TRUCK SKIDS in a long arc in front of them and BLOCKS
          THEM. Jane screeches to a halt.

                         JANE (CONT'D)
          Oh hell.
          In a flash, Jerry is out of the truck and coming for them.

                         CHARLIE
          GO! Go! Don't stop!! Go--
          Charlie steps on the accelerator, grabs the wheel and AIMS

          THE CAR AT JERRY.

                         JANE
          Charlie!!
          They RUN JERRY OVER WITH A TERRIBLE THUDDDD!!! Amy and Jane
          scream. Jane is aghast, stops the car.

                         JANE (CONT'D)
          Oh my God!!
          Charlie steps on her accelerator foot, the CAR ZOOMS FORWARD.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         AMY
          Are you nuts!? You can't kill that
          guy!

                         CHARLIE
          You have no idea.

                         (TO JANE)
          It's him or us. Mom. MOM.
          Jane looks at him -- can feel that he's telling the truth.
          Charlie's looking around as they speed down the highway, in
          the rearview. NO JERRY anywhere.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Where is he? Where'd he go?
          Everybody looks UP. The roof of the car.
          BAM! Jerry's hand SHOOTS up through the FLOORBOARD under
          Jane's feet.
          Jane and Amy SCREAM!

          CLOSE ON THE FLOOR OF THE CAR
          JERRY'S EYE glares through the small hole. It's all BLACK.
          No pupil. Freaky.
          He's TEARING THROUGH METAL from the undercarriage of the car,
          where he's clinging -- face up.
          The more he rips away -- the more he reveals his face.
          His veins and eyes are BLACK. His nose snout-like. And his
          fangs emerge from lethal rows of jagged teeth, like a SHARK.
          It's shocking, horrible.

          ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CAR
          As Jerry drags over the highway, the pavement grinding away
          at his clothes and flesh.
          He reaches through the hole he's made and SLAMS his fist down
          on the FLOOR BREAK. The car SCREECHES to a sudden halt.
          ON CHARLIE, AMY and JANE
          Screaming even after the car has stopped. Then -- BAM!! The
          car is REAR-ENDED by another vehicle. It's a MINIVAN.
          JANE's car is SLAMMED -- the back is a crush of glass and
          metal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          A GRIM MOMENT -- only the sound of hissing air and groaning
          steel as everyone assesses the damage.

                         AMY
          Oh... Are you-- Jane?
          Jane is woozy. Hurt.

                         CHARLIE
          Mom?

                         JANE
          I'm okay...
          Charlie sees that the other car is drivable. The guy inside,
          a FAMILY MAN, is stunned and pissed. Gets out of his car--

                         FAMILY MAN
          What the hell do you think you're
          doing!--
          Charlie gets out of the car too. Yells, urgent--

                         CHARLIE
          NO! Hey man, stay in your--
          But it's too late. The guy is met by a HORRIFIC Jerry,
          hideously torn and bleeding, who appears from UNDER JANE'S

          CAR.
          In a flash, Jerry grabs the guy and VAMPS, ripping the family
          man's NECK OUT.

          CLOSE ON MINIVAN
          As those "cute" stick figure family decals are splattered
          with BLOOD.

          AMY AND JANE
          Now out of the car, react. JERRY IS A FUCKING VAMPIRE.
          Jerry drops the business man, who's dead as he hits the
          ground. He moves toward them.
          Charlie looks at Amy and Jane. I told you so.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Yeah.
          Charlie urgently grabs them. Shoves them down the highway.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Get out of here. Run. Run!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         AMY

                         BUT--

                         CHARLIE
          Go! I'll catch up! She's hurt,
          get out of here!
          They back off.
          Charlie pulls a large cross out of his coat and brandishes it
          as he walks toward Jerry. Jerry keeps his distance, taunting

                         HIM--

                         JERRY
          Let them run. Just makes them
          easier to kill when I'm done with
          you.
          Ding, ding, ding -- the family man's CAR DOOR is open and the
          warning bell rings over and over...
          CHARLIE eyes the car. Keys still in it. He circles Jerry,
          backing him off.

                         CHARLIE
          I repel you with the power of
          Christ the Lord.

                         JERRY
          Do you? Really? When did you take
          your last confession?

                         CHARLIE
          Get back...

                         JERRY
          That's a mighty big cross you have
          there. Question is -- do you
          actually know how to use it?
          Jerry LUNGES for Charlie, but he DIVES for the family man's
          open car door.
          But Jerry's on him -- hands BURNING as he rips the cross from
          Charlie and shatters it with his hand.
          Then he TOSSES Charlie, who flies and hits JANE'S CAR, then
          crumples to the ground.
          Jerry gets Charlie around the neck -- holds a sharp,
          splintered end of the broken cross against Charlie's chest.
          The wood still burns into Jerry's hand, but Jerry holds on.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         JERRY (CONT'D)
          Ever take one of these in the
          chest? I have.
          Charlie struggles, terrified.

                         JERRY (CONT'D)
          But they missed the heart.
          Rigggght... . here. Easy
          measurement.
          Jerry positions the "stake" right over Charlie's heart.
          Charlie winces. Terrified and overpowered.

                         JERRY (CONT'D)
          Shouldn't have been so nosey.
          Jerry's about to plunge the STAKE through Charlie's heart
          when a THICK WOOD STAKE comes through Jerry's SHOULDER.
          Jerry HOWLS, falls off Charlie and we see that he's been
          staked by the business end of a REAL ESTATE SIGN.
          JANE stands over them, quaking with fear and adrenaline.
          Amy's right behind her with a CROWBAR.

                         JANE
          Leave my kid alone.
          Jane collapses, and we see that there's a lot of BLOOD on the
          back of her head.

                         CHARLIE
          Mom!
          Jerry's in agony as he stumbles away, pulls the sign post out
          of his shoulder.
          Charlie grabs his mom and drags her into her wreck of a car.
          Amy dives into the car with them.
          Charlie presses the accelerator. Will it still drive?

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Come on come on come on...
          IT LURCHES forward, then goes. Metal scraping the ground,
          raining glass... but it RUNS.
          They start to bolt when BAM! JERRY STANDS UP right in front
          of the car, LUNGES AT THEM. CHARLIE RUNS OVER JERRY'S BODY
          AGAIN. They speed off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         72
          Jerry writhes in the middle of the road. But even as he
          does, he HEALS. His body knitting itself back together...

          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR/JANE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

          Charlie's giving a report to a pair of uniformed cops.

                         COP #1
          So a gas leak caused the fire at
          your home and...

                         CHARLIE
          My mom didn't feel right, we were
          trying to get her to the hospital.
          It was stupid to let her drive.

                         COP #1
          Yeah it was. And driver who rear-
          ended you, you get the exact make
          and name of the van?

                         CHARLIE
          It wasn't there when you got there?

                         COP #2
          Hit and run. Happens all the time.
          Charlie stifles his surprise. Nods.

          ANGLE ON AMY
          On her cell, pacing as she eyes Charlie with the cops.

                         AMY
          We won't stay up all night. Bee
          and Cara need help with Trig --
          it's not a party. Okay. Okay...

                         (THEN/EMOTIONAL)
          Mom? I love you.
          She stops at the open door of a hospital ROOM. Her gaze

                         FALLING ON--

                         JANE
          Who lies motionless in a bed. A doctor checks her chart.
          AMY hangs up. Charlie, finished with the cops, joins her.
          They're both pained as they look at Jane.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          Maybe you should have said
          something to the police.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         73

                         CHARLIE
          Like what? A vampire moved next
          door, borrowed some beer, ate a
          stripper and then blew up our house
          because we wouldn't invite him in?
          Amy looks at him.

                         AMY
          Okay.
          The DOCTOR approaches.

                         DOCTOR
          You should get some rest.

                         CHARLIE
          She's going to wake up, right?

                         DOCTOR
          Assuming the swelling is minimal, I
          hope so.

                         CHARLIE
          But you don't know.

                         DOCTOR
          Not yet. We need to give it time.
          The doctor puts a hand on Charlie's shoulder, leaves.
          Charlie turns away, upset. Amy watches, feeling helpless.

          INT. PETER'S "MUSEUM"/LIBRARY -- NIGHT

          Peter, in a bathrobe, looks out his floor-to-ceiling windows
          at the lights of the strip.
          The ASSISTANT from the show toddles out on high heels and a
          ridiculous mini-dress. Her hair is messy, post sex.

                         ASSISTANT
          Bye babe. Good show tonight.
          He's barely paying attention.

                         PETER
          You were late again on "The Devil's
          Torture Chamber."
          But she's gone.
          A beat. He moves back toward the library shelves. As he
          does he notices the PHOTOS Charlie took at Jerry's place.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
          Absently, he sifts through them. Stops.
          He picks up the one of the INSIGNIA.
          Peter reacts. Stunned. This means something to him.
          He goes to a WALL SAFE. Opens it. Hidden inside are a bunch
          of personal items. Some from his childhood. Old photos of
          his mother and father...
          And a hand-drawn sketch, in a youthful scrawl, of THE
          INSIGNIA. He puts the two side by side. They MATCH.
          Off PETER, looking at the sketches. Haunted.

          INT. HOSPITAL -- JANE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

          Charlie and Amy sit on a tiny couch. Both are scared and
          regretful.

                         CHARLIE
          This is my fault.

                         AMY
          You didn't make any of it happen.

                         CHARLIE
          Ed came to me. I turned my back on
          him.

                         AMY
          How were you supposed to believe
          him? None of it makes sense.

                         CHARLIE
          He did talk a lot of demented crap.
          (but.. )
          He was my best friend. He asked
          me, begged me, to believe him.

                         AMY
          People change. Everybody--

                         CHARLIE
          Yeah they do. I turned into a
          dick. I figured my dweeb past, not
          big with the ladies.

                         AMY

                         (WRY)
          So you're saying this is my fault.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         CHARLIE
          I wanted you to like me. I tried
          to erase Ed -- all of it. I know
          how that feels.

                         AMY
          I knew you were a dweeb.
          (off his look)
          You think I want a "dude" like Mark
          or Ben? I like that you're
          different... It didn't hurt that
          your skin cleared up.
          She smiles, takes his hand. A sweet, connected moment. Then
          something alarming occurs to Amy:

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          I can't believe we didn't have sex.

                         CHARLIE

                         AMY-

                         AMY
          No, seriously. I'm going to die a
          virgin? Me? How did this happen?

                         CHARLIE
          We're not going to die--

                         AMY
          But what if we do? Let's do it.
          Now. The bathroom. Charlie.
          A beat.

                         CHARLIE
          I think we should kill the vampire
          first. I'll perform much better.
          They laugh -- trying not to cry. Then:

                         AMY
          Oh my God, Charlie. What are we
          going to do?

                         CHARLIE
          We're going to fight.
          Then Charlie's phone rings. He answers.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Hello?

                         INNERCUT WITH:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

          INT. PETER'S VINCENT'S PENTHOUSE -- LIBRARY -- NIGHT

          Peter stands with the photo of the insignia in hand.

                         PETER
          I can help you. My place. One
          hour.

          EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- DAY

          A few minutes later. Charlie and Amy move out of Jane's
          room.

                         AMY
          The Peter Vincent?

                         CHARLIE
          Under-whelming, believe me. But
          he's what we've got.
          They close Jane's door and we see that it's COVERED in
          CROSSES of every shape and size. It's quite a spectacle.
          A nurse passes, looks at Charlie and Amy quizzically.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          My mom is very religious.

          INT. PETER'S "MUSEUM"/LIBRARY - NIGHT


                         CLOSE ON
          A MIDORI cocktail
           WIDEN to reveal that PETER is pouring himself a whopper. Amy
          and Charlie sit nearby.

                         PETER
          I'll tell you what I know, but
          that's it. Don't expect me to join
          your Scooby gang.

                         CHARLIE
          Anything. I'll take it.

                         PETER
          I found the origin of that insignia
          you showed me. It's a species that
          originated in the Mediterranean.
          They nest in the earth -- explains
          that hole you saw. And they kill
          slowly, keep their victims alive
          for days.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                          PETER (CONT'D)

                          (GRIM)
          "Snackers."

                          CHARLIE
          So -- they turn all of them?
           (off Amy's look)
          Make their victims into vampires.

                         AMY
          I know. I read.

                         PETER
          No. It takes a while before they
          complete the change. They usually
          finish them off before that.

                         AMY
          So how do you kill these guys, this
          "tribe"?

                         PETER
          Usual stuff. But it's a strong
          breed. You need a plan--
          A VOICE interrupts over an intercom. It's ARTHUR, Peter's
          assistant.

          ARTHUR (O.S.)
          Delivery. Guy says you need to
          sign for something.

                         PETER
          Send him in.

                         (TO CHARLIE)
          I order things when I've had a few
          cocktails. It's a--

                         CHARLIE

                         (ALARMED)
          Wait. You get deliveries this
          late?

                         PETER
          I don't know. Maybe--
          Charlie stands.

                         CHARLIE
          No. You said he could come in.
          The delivery guy. That's--

                         AMY
          What? Charlie--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          An invitation, airhead.
          They turn and see EVIL ED, in one of Jerry's "uniforms."
          It's clear he's changed. A glint in the eye, more muscular.
          Charlie takes Ed in, pained. Ed grins at him.
          Ed flips open a cell phone. Dials.

                         ED
          Looking at them now. Yes sir.
          (hangs up/then)
          He's modern, Jerry, dispensed with
          all that "master" stuff.

                         (TO CHARLIE)
          Hey bud.
          Charlie steps in front of Amy.

                         CHARLIE
          You've got a problem, keep it with
          me.

                         ED
          Problem? You let him get me, man.

                         CHARLIE

                         (ANGUISHED)

                         I KNOW--
          Ed is CREEPING TOWARD Charlie.

                         AMY

                         CHARLIE--

                         ED
          You let him turn me into this.
          At that, ED VAMPS. Black eyes, black veins. Those teeth.
          It's terrifying.
          SMASH!! One of the cabinets shatters. Ed, Charlie and Amy
          spin to see PETER standing by the open collection case. A
          SMALL NAIL in his hand. He's shaking like a leaf.

                         PETER
          Stay away, demon.

                         ED
          (amused/queens accent)
          "Stay awaaaay, demon!"
          Ed closes in on Peter. Peter looks to Charlie. It's real.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         ED (CONT'D)
          Whatcha got there? Itsy bitsy
          little stakey?

                         PETER
          Crucifixion nail. Lethal to you.

                         ED
          Old school. Nice. Got to get
          pretty close to use it, though.
          Peter looks at the short piece of metal in his hand. Fuck.
          HE BOLTS down the nearest hallway.

                         ED (CONT'D)
          Uh uh. No you don't.
          ED BOLTS AFTER PETER. Charlie and Amy race the other way.

                         CHARLIE
          The elevator!

          INT. PETER'S PENTHOUSE -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT

          Peter pushes a BUTTON on a doorway, bolts into a PANIC ROOM.
          Ed is on his heels, but JUST MISSES grabbing Peter before the
          door closes.
          The POWERFUL DOOR CLOSES ON ED'S ARM, crushes it. ED HOWLS
          as his arm SEVERS. The door LOCKS.
          But what doesn't kill him makes him stronger and crazier.

                         ED
          A panic room!? You better panic,
          loser! You better watch your neck!

          INT. PETER'S PANIC ROOM -- NIGHT

          Peter's in shock -- watching Ed's severed arm twitch on the
          floor.

          ED (0.S.)
          Prince of darkness is a little baby
          man! I love it! All the fat
          chicks in your fan club are gonna
          be so bummed!
          He hears ED flipping out, but ED DOESN'T SHOW UP ON THE

          SECURITY SCREEN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

          INT. PETER'S PENTHOUSE -- ENTRY AREA -- NIGHT

          Charlie runs with Amy to the ELEVATOR. The CONTROL BOX has
          been ripped from the wall. They're trapped.

                         AMY
          Oh my God, oh my God...
          Amy's starting to lose it. Charlie grabs her.

                         CHARLIE
          Look at me. Stop.

                         (SHE DOES)
          There's another way out of here.
          And there are a million things to
          fight with in here. Understand?
          We're going to make it.
          Amy pulls herself together. Nods. They RUN.

          INT. PETER'S "MUSEUM" LIBRARY -- VARIOUS -- NIGHT

          CHARLIE AND AMY race through the ROOMS of Peter's extensive
          collection.

          INNERCUT WITH ED
          Tracking them -- not far behind, his stub of an arm bleeding
          and HEALING as he goes.

                         ED
          Give it up, Chuck! You're dead.

                         (THEN)
          If you hadn't ended up such a dick,
          I might have tricked you out. We
          could have rocked this evil shit!
          But you blew it. Nothing but the
          big dirt nap for you and your lady.

          AMY AND CHARLIE
          Round a corner -- it's a dead-end. They see a large antique
          CONFESSIONAL at one end of the room.

                         ON ED
          As he comes around the same corner a moment later. AMY and
          CHARLIE are NOWHERE to be seen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

          INT. PETER'S HIGH RISE LOBBY -- NIGHT

          Jerry enters, his appearance different. Healing from the car
          incident has taken it out of him.
          He's pale and weakened -- and still has lots of cuts and
          bruises.
          He's also changed into new clothes, jeans and a SWEATER.
          We see THE SAME GUARD that Charlie spoke to earlier.

                         GUARD
          Sign in, please.

                         JERRY
          I know where I'm going.

                         GUARD
          Sign in. No exceptions.
          Jerry ignores him, keeps moving toward the elevator.

                         GUARD (CONT'D)
          Hey! I'm talking to you. Sign in,
          or you're not going nowhere.
          Jerry turns. Slow and deliberate. Expression cold.

          INT. PETER'S "MUSEUM"/CONFESSIONAL ROOM -- NIGHT

          Ed is MOVING IN ON the CONFESSIONAL. Sees MOVEMENT behind
          the curtain.

                         ED
          I expected more of a fight. Girl's
          made you lazy in the head.
          Pussy'll do that.
          ED YANKS the curtain on the confessional open.
          ARTHUR hides there, terrified.

                         ED (CONT'D)
          Look at that. Vincent's got a
          Vincent.

                         CLOSE ON
          A large cabinet on the other side of the room. AMY AND
          CHARLIE are squeezed behind it. They react to HORRIBLE
          SCREAMS as Ed rips ARTHUR apart.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.
          CHARLIE holds AMY close, muffling her sobs.
          Blood seeps across the floor, under their feet...

                         ON ED
          His face bloodied. Eyes wild. The trembling body of ARTHUR
          on the ground at his feet.
          Ed turns Arthur over. Arthur's still breathing, reaches for
          something around his neck. A cross? No, it's a chain with
          PICTURES of sweet-faced children on silver charms.

                         HE PLEADS--

                         ARTHUR
          .I have ...kids ...

                         ED
          Had.
          Ed lifts Arthur off his feet and chokes him with one hand...

                         ED (CONT'D)
          Don't take it personal. I'd eat
          you -- but I'm saving my appetite.
          Arthur's turning a horrible purple, eyes bulging... Ed
          breaks his neck with a HORRIBLE WRENCHING CRUNCH. Drops him.

                         ED (CONT'D)
          Dinner with an old friend.

          INT. PETER'S PENTHOUSE -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT

          A door to a STAIRWELL opens, Jerry steps into a hall. He
          looks healthy again. Robust.
          He wipes a small smear of blood from his mouth.

          INT. PETER'S "MUSEUM"/CONFESSIONAL ROOM -- NIGHT

          AMY AND CHARLIE hold their breath as ED looks around the
          room. Arthur is motionless at his feet now.

                         ED
          I know you're here. I can hear you
          breathing. It's totally cool.
          He laughs, hyper. Excited.

          CHARLIE EYES A CASE WITH A BATTLE AXE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         ED (CONT'D)
          Sooo, I take out the prom king and
          queen? Embarrassment of riches!
          CHARLIE SHOVES the case he hides behind with Amy over ONTO
          ED. Yells to Amy--

                         CHARLIE

          GO!
          Amy bolts from the room as Charlie punches the glass out on
          another case that holds the battle axe. He grabs the weapon.
          Ed SHOVES the cabinet off him with his good hand, stands.
          Charlie and Ed face off.

                         ED
          Mano e...one mano. Piece of cake.
          Cause I'm a God Damned killing
          machine, and you're like all the
          Clark High big shots -- nothing.

                         (THEN)
          You picked the wrong side, man.
          Ed lashes out, slicing CHARLIE on the arm with his SHARP
          NAILS. Charlie yells, but holds his ground.

                         CHARLIE
          I didn't pick--

                         ED
          You didn't think.
          Charlie's wrecked about what he has to do.

                         CHARLIE
          I know. I'm sorry.
          Charlie takes a swing with the AXE. Ed starts BOUNDING
          around the room, avoiding Charlie's swings as he clings to
          walls and, impossibly, THE CEILING.

                         ED
          Steeeerike! Call that a swing,
          Slugger?
          Charlie swings and swings, but Ed is too fast for him.
          Finally, Charlie connects with ED'S NECK. Blood flies,
          Charlie can't look -- anguished.

           ED (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Come on! You're not even trying.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          Charlie looks back, Ed's HEAD is only HALF OFF. He's
          grinning even as he bleeds everywhere. It's macabre,
          horrible.
          Ed SLASHES Charlie again with his claw-like nails. Charlie
          cries out.

          INT. PETER'S LIBRARY/"MUSEUM" -- NIGHT

          Amy can hear Charlie yell.

                         AMY
          Charlie!
          She smashes into one GLASS CABINET after another, pulling out
          and pocketing everything she can find to fight ED. Finds a
          GUN loaded with silver bullets...

                         JERRY
          You are something, aren't you?
          Amy spins. Jerry's closing in on her. Beautiful, seductive.
          She's shaking, terrorized. BAM, BAM, BAM!!
          She empties the GUN into JERRY anyway. It knocks him back,
          but he's still standing. He picks a silver bullet out of his
          shoulder, unimpressed.

                         JERRY (CONT'D)
          Werewolves.
          Amy FLINGS holy water in his face.
          JERRY SCREAMS, burns.

                         AMY
          Vampires.
          She RUNS.

          INT. PETER'S "MUSEUM"/CONFESSIONAL ROOM -- NIGHT

          ED is already starting to heal as he and Charlie continue to
          fight. But his head still flops hideously to one side.

                         ED
          Bone is a motherfucker, Chuckles.
          Hard to cut.
          Charlie takes another swing with his axe. Ed jumps out of
          the way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.
          Ed manages to get Charlie in a one-arm embrace of sorts,
          positions himself so he can BITE HIS NECK.

                         ED (CONT'D)
          Is this weird for you too? I feel
          like such a homo--
          Charlie FLIPS ED -- they are wrestling when Charlie sees AMY
          approaching with A SPIKED MACE. Charlie DUCKS and AMY
          smashes ED in the head. Hard.
          Charlie grabs a long, sharp piece of the shattered wooden
          cabinet.
          Ed is on the ground. Moaning, laughing. Charlie has his
          shot. But he hesitates.

                         AMY
          Do it. Charlie!
          Charlie's frozen.
          Ed starts to get up, his head a mess. It's now or never.

                         ED
          Wow. Bimbo has some juice--

                         AMY
          Jerry's here. He's coming!

                         CHARLIE
          (to Ed/pained)
          I'm sorry.
          WHAP, Charlie stakes ED in the heart. Ed looks at Charlie
          with surprise...
          Ed's hideous features seem to dissolve. For a brief moment --
          he looks like himself again.

                         ED
          I wasn't even a badass vamp. I was
          his Renfield. Funny if you--
          Ed starts to VIBRATE HORRIBLY, his WHOLE BODY moving so
          impossibly fast he's little more than a BLUR...
          Then he BURNS UP FROM THE INSIDE OUT.
          Charlie's paralyzed -- in a world of hurt.
          Amy grabs him. Pulls him out of the room.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         AMY
          I found the stairs. Come on.

          INT. PETER'S PENTHOUSE -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT

          JERRY, VAMP-FACED and recovering from the holy water, sees
          AMY and CHARLIE running up ahead.
          He sprints after them. Charlie sees him and TOPPLES A GIANT
          FIGURINE in his path, as well as cabinets, etc...
          They slow Jerry down enough to get slightly ahead.

                         AMY

                         OVER HERE--
          She flings the door to the stairwell open and they RACE DOWN

          THE STAIRS.

          INT. PETER'S PANIC ROOM -- NIGHT

          Peter sits huddled in a corner, ashamed and shaking.
          The SECURITY CAMERA flicks through different rooms, until it
          lands on his dead cousin, ARTHUR.
          It's like Peter's looking at his own mutilated corpse.
          OFF PETER, terrified.

          INT. CASINO -- NIGHT

          Amy and Charlie emerge from the stairway.
          They find themselves ON THE FLOOR of a HARD ROCK TYPE CASINO,
          which is on the bottom of the building where Peter lives.
          Amy slows as they fold into the crowds. Relieved.

                         AMY
          Stop. Stop, I need to--

                         CHARLIE
          Not now. He's coming for us.

                         AMY
          He can't kill us, not here--

                         CHARLIE
          Who's going to notice? Who's going
          to care? Amy, look around--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          Amy takes in the people on the floor. Drunk, oblivious. Two
          guys YELL and FIGHT at a craps table. A couple makes out in
          a dark corner, etc. It's loud, chaotic.

                         AMY
          Oh, God...

                         CHARLIE
          Keep moving. Come on.
          Now Charlie sees JERRY some distance behind them now, moving
          toward them in the crowd. They meet eyes.
          Charlie grabs Amy, scans for someplace to hide. He spots a
          nightclub -- "REFLECTIONS".
          The outside walls are all mirrored, like a brightly lit
          diamond.

                         ON JERRY
          Behind them in the crowd, he sees them slip into the club.

          INT. REFLECTIONS - NIGHT

          The inside of the club is made up of MIRRORS AND WINDOWS.
          The dance floor is PACKED. All writhing bodies and sweaty
          abandon.
          It's dizzying, disorienting.
          Charlie sees JERRY enter, look around for them. The best bet
          to get lost is to dive into the crowd.
          Charlie leads Amy through the throngs of people -- the
          different levels of the club are like a maze. Glass
          staircases lead to mirrored balconies...
          A hopped-up DJ climbs up on a balcony, starts throwing t-
          shirts into the crowd.

                         DJ
          Tequila Man t-shirts! Yeeeeeahhhh!
          The crowd goes nuts, SURGES forward...
          Someone bumps Amy and Charlie and they lose hands.

                         AMY
          Charlie!
          Charlie turns, a DRUNK CHICK gets in his way -- tries to
          dance with him. He pushes past her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         CHARLIE
          Amy? Amy!
          Charlie can't see Amy, instead sees HIMSELF over and over
          again in a series of mirrors -- the infinity effect.
          It's dizzying, disorienting.
          THEN HE SEES JERRY, a shark, moving in and out of the crowd,
          disappearing behind mirrored columns, reemerging...
          Charlie also sees that JERRY DOESN'T REFLECT in the mirrors
          around them. Instead the crowd parts as if by magic.
          Jerry's heading straight toward--

                         AMY
          who's been pushed toward the DJ stand by the crowd. She's
          spinning, looking desperately for Charlie.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Amy!
          Charlie's frantically pushing toward her. But the CRUSH of
          people makes it nearly impossible to gain ground.

          CLOSE ON AMY
          As a HAND slips into hers. She turns, relieved, to find--

                         JERRY
          Holding her with a firm grip.

                         AMY
          No. No!
          Amy STRUGGLES and CRIES OUT as JERRY PULLS HER away from
          CHARLIE, toward ramp that leads to another dance floor.
          Jerry laughs, throws her over his shoulder.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          Help!!
          A GUY in the crowd high-fives him. All part of another crazy
          night in Vegas.

                         GUY
          Go get her, man!
          AMY sees her fast-moving reflection in the mirror -- she
          appears to be FLOATING above the people.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         AMY
          Help me! Help!!
          CHARLIE can SEE HER, but can't get to her. The crowd is
          indifferent to her cries.
          Charlie grabs his cell -- hits a button. It dials, then--

                         CHARLIE

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Peter! We're in the casino, the
          club! Jerry's got Amy! He's got

                         HER--

          INT. PETER'S PANIC ROOM -- NIGHT

          Peter's holding his cell. It's ringing.
          He hangs up.

          INT. REFLECTIONS -- SECOND STORY -- CONT.

          Jerry, hidden away from Charlie now, puts Amy down. She
          tries to run, but he holds her tight.

                         AMY
          Charlie's coming, he'll find me--

                         JERRY
          I'm counting on it.
          Amy SPITS on him. Jerry reacts -- a flash of RAGE and he
          exposes his brutal rows of TEETH for just an instant.

                         JERRY (CONT'D)
          Come on.
          He grips her harder, sways with her to the music. Leans
          close to her ear, seductive.
          His predatory skills in high gear.

                         JERRY (CONT'D)
          You just need a taste. You'll see.
          It can be like a dream.
          Jerry draws a nail over his wrist, draws a line of blood. He
          puts his mouth over the cut, bloodying it.
          He forces her into a DEEP KISS. She struggles mightily --
          but then her body relaxes, as if she's been sedated.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         JERRY (CONT'D)
          That's it... Good girl.
          JERRY looks up sees CHARLIE coming toward them.
          But Amy's altered now. Staring into Jerry's eyes like a
          child.
          CHARLIE'S GETTING CLOSER when--

                         CHARLIE
          Amy! No!--
          BAM! A hand falls on his shoulder.

                         A DOORMAN

                         DOORMAN
          How'd you get in here?

                         CHARLIE
          You have to help me. That guy,
          he's going to kill her, he's a

                         KILLER--
          The doorman glances at JERRY and AMY. Jerry stokes Charlie's
          anguish -- running his hands over Amy's ass, kissing her
          neck.

                         DOORMAN
          Yeah? Then she's liking it.
          Charlie's beside himself, enraged and terrorized.

                         CHARLIE
          You don't understand!--

                         DOORMAN
          ID. Then you can tell me your
          whole sad story--

                         CHARLIE
          No! There's no time-- Amy!!
          Charlie's increasingly desperate, tries to RUN. But the
          doorman has a good grip, pulls him back.

                         JERRY
          Sees that CHARLIE is restrained.
          Jerry locks eyes with Charlie and SMILES, his horrible fangs
          exposed. He's taking Charlie's woman -- and enjoying it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          No! NO!

                         CHARLIE'S POV
          As he's being dragged away -- JERRY BRUTALLY BITES AMY.
          It's a nightmare.
          Charlie loses it, screaming and flailing. But there is no
          helping her.

                         FADE TO:

          INT. PETER'S HIGH RISE -- BEDROOM -- NIGHT

          Peter packs a bag, getting out of town.

          CHARLIE (O.S.)
          I see you got my message.
          Peter turns. Sees Charlie standing in the doorway.

                         PETER
          How'd you get in here?

                         CHARLIE
          Security's a little lax. Everybody
          got their throat ripped out.
          Peter backs away as Charlie moves in.
          Charlie is different. Colder, harder. Like he's aged a
          decade in one night.

                         PETER
          You too? He change you?

                         CHARLIE
          Look at your monitor.
          PETER turns to a security monitor in his closet. Charlie

          SHOWS UP ON THE SCREEN.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          I don't know if Amy's alive or dead
          or turned -- but he's got her. My
          mom may not make it. And Ed...

                         (COLD)
          I'm going to end him, or he's going
          to end me.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         92

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          One way or the other, that's how
          it's going to be and you're going
          with me.

                         PETER
          Don't you get what this is?
          There's no fighting. There's only
          surviving, if you're lucky--

                         CHARLIE
          You call this surviving? If you
          live and we all die, you think
          you'll ever be able to get us out
          of your head?

                         PETER
          I know I won't. I never could --
          not after the first time.
          This stops Charlie.

                         PETER (CONT'D)
          I told myself I probably made it
          up. I was a kid. Maybe it was
          easier to believe in monsters...

                         CHARLIE
          Made what up?

                         PETER
          The vampire who killed my parents,
          my brothers. But not me. I hid.
          Charlie reacts. Surprised, but now it all makes sense.
          Peter continues, haunted--

                         PETER (CONT'D)
          I didn't collect all this stuff for
          fun. I thought maybe I could find
          the tribe, "avenge" my people.

                         CHARLIE
          So do it. We'll go in at dawn.
          He's got to rest sometime--

                         PETER

                         (HARD)
          It's not like that. When I was a
          kid, I hid because I wanted to
          live. I still do! This isn't the
          comics. You want to be a dead
          hero. Good for you. But I'm out.

                         (THEN)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         PETER (CONT'D)
          You think I'm a coward. I'm just a
          realist.
          Moment of hesitation for Charlie. Has he been affected by
          Peter's words? Then--

                         CHARLIE
          So you bail on people, erase them.

                         (THEN)
          I don't want to make it to
          tomorrow, not if you're the kind of
          man I have to be.
          A moment. Peter is full of self-loathing, but resolved.
          Charlie turns to leave.

                         PETER
          Wait.
          Peter takes something from his luggage. A stake carved from
          WHITE WOOD. He hands it to Charlie.

                         PETER (CONT'D)
          Blessed by Saint Michael. Kill a
          vampire with it -- it's supposed to
          turn his victims back. If Amy's
          changed, you can still save her.

                         CHARLIE

                         (RE: STAKE)
          If it's for real.

                         PETER
          Who knows what's for real any more.
          Charlie takes the stake. Starts to go. Peter stops him--

                         PETER (CONT'D)
          There's no guarantee he'll be
          asleep during the day. He's
          housebound, not hibernating.

                         CHARLIE
          I'll figure it out.

                         PETER
          No, you need a plan. To stake him,
          you have to get close -- he's
          stronger than you.

                         CHARLIE
          Holy water?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         94

                         PETER
          Slow him down. Won't stop him.

                         (THEN)
          Torch him, you'll have a few good
          minutes before he really goes up.
          Believe me, a vampire on fire isn't
          thinking clearly.

                         CHARLIE
          But if he's on fire, how do I get
          close enough to stake him?
          A beat.

                         PETER
          Fuck.

                         CHARLIE

                         (POINTED)
          You just worry about yourself.
          With that, Charlie leaves.
          Off PETER. Disgusted with himself.

          INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT/DAY

          Charlie sits by Jane's bedside. She's still comatose.
          We move closer and see that Charlie's drawing a MAP OF
          JERRY'S HOUSE on some scrap paper -- laying it out from
          memory as best he can.
          He GLANCES at the clock as it ticks toward DA
          As Charlie plots, he talks to Jane -- his silent confidante.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Those rooms upstairs, that's
          probably where he's got Amy.
          I get her out, assuming she's--

                         (NOT DEAD)
          Then I have to get him on the
          ropes.
          He thinks... Then looks up, an idea occurring. Jane lies
          there peacefully.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          I have to go.
          More energized, Charlie stands and gathers his things.
          He stops, contemplates his mother for a moment -- regretful.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          I'm coming back for you, Mom.

          INT. ARMY/NAVY STORE -- DAY

          Charlie buys FIREPROOF CLOTHING, a small open-flame lighter,
          and a SPRAY CANISTER like the kind an exterminator uses.
          The guy at the counter looks Charlie up and down. Charlie
          takes this in. Finally, Charlie's like -- fuck it.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Going to kill a vampire.
          The guy looks at him. Then--

                         STORE GUY
          Good for you.
          The store guy waits. Charlie hands over his money.

          EXT. JERRY'S HOUSE - DAY


          ON JERRY'S HOUSE
          LOOMING, silhouetted against early morning light. Next to
          it, Charlie's house stands in charred ruins.
          CHARLIE stands on the front lawn, contemplating the houses.
          He wears fireproof clothes, has stakes and crosses strapped
          to him, holsters made out of duct-tape...
          Slung over his shoulder is the spray canister. And he holds
          a crowbar in a free hand. He looks like something out of one
          of Ed's graphic novels.
          Before he enters, Charlie DOUSES HIMSELF IN HOLY WATER.

                         CHARLIE
          Let's do this shit.
          He swallows hard, scared but determined.

          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- FIRST FLOOR -- DAY


          CLOSE ON WET FOOTPRINTS
          Widen to find Charlie cautiously moving through the house.
          The blacked-out windows give the place a gray, stifled air.
          Behind Charlie, we see that the front door has been broken
          open with the crow bar.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          Charlie anxiously looks around for Jerry -- fully expecting
          him to jump out and go for his throat...
          He takes the stairs up to the second floor, two at a time.

          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY

          Charlie moves down the hall, stops at some of the small
          rooms. Looks in.

                         NO AMY
          Finally, Charlie hears a GROAN. He opens a window in the
          door for yet another room.
          AMY'S lying on the floor, turned away from him. Charlie's
          not sure what he'll see when he gets a better look at her.

                         CHARLIE

                         AMY--
          Amy slowwwwly gets up, turns...
          And aside from a BRUISED BITE MARK on her neck -- she looks
          normal. She rushes to Charlie, keeps her voice down.

                         AMY

                         CHARLIE--
          She reaches through the window. They link hands, emotional.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          You shouldn't be here--

                         CHARLIE
          Where is he?

                         AMY
          I don't know. He dumped me here.
          I'm bait. He said so--

                         CHARLIE
          How do you feel?

                         AMY
          I'll survive. Please get out of
          here. He's too strong--

                         CHARLIE
          I'm stronger.

                         (WAVERING)
          In a nerd power way. You know...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          He reaches into his jacket, pulls out a CROSS.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Take this. It should--
          He looks up. AMY IS GONE. Disappeared.
          Charlie, reacts. Calls out in a hushed panic--

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Amy? Amy!?
          Nothing. It's like she vaporized.

          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- HALLWAY -- DAY

          Charlie races down a hallway, looking for ANY.
          He tries door after door that won't open.
          He finally finds one door that's unlocked, rushes through --
          almost FALLS through an open floor in an unfinished portion
          of the house.
          Jerry's building more cells.
          Charlie backs out of the doorway, turns a corner and BAM!
          He runs into JERRY. No, wait -- it's PETER.
          He's not wearing his wig, etc. But he's cleaned up and
          standing tall. Dressed all in black.

                         CHARLIE
          Shit! You--

                         PETER CHARLIE
          Sorry-- How'd you--
          A beat. Then:

                         PETER
          Guess I don't want to be a man like
          me either.
          Peter opens his leather coat -- it's loaded with weapons.
          And a flask. Peter grins.

                         PETER (CONT'D)
          Let's kill something.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         CHARLIE

                         (RE: FLASK)
          You reek. Midori?

                         PETER
          Don't get greedy. I'm here.

                         (THEN/PROUD)
          And I found something else. From
          my collection. Powerful shit.
          From around his back, he reveals A DOUBLE-BARRELLED SHOTGUN
          with a CROSS MOUNTED ON THE BARREL.

                         CHARLIE
          Wooden bullets? Nice.

                         PETER
          No, you think I'm fucking MacGyver?
          Bullet, bullets. They'll buy us
          some time.
          Charlie is grateful, but now's not the time for man hugs.

                         CHARLIE
          We have to find Amy. She was in a
          room upstairs, then she just
          disappeared. This house--

                         PETER
          What do you mean she "disappeared?"

                         CHARLIE
          She was there. I looked away,
          looked back -- she was gone.
          Peter takes this in.

                         PETER
          Show me where.

          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- AMY'S ROOM -- DAY

          Peter and Charlie pry open the door to the room where Amy was
          held. Peter walks over the floor -- finds a TRAP DOOR.

                         PETER (CONT'D)
          Floor trap. I use it all the time.

                         CHARLIE
          Where does it go?

                         PETER
          Only one way to find out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          Peter lowers himself into the hole under the trap door--

                         CHARLIE
          Wait -- you're going in?

                         PETER
          See that? Like a great date. Get
          me drunk and I'll try anything.
          Peter lets go and FALLS. Charlie steels himself, goes in
          after him.

          INT. JERRY'S BASEMENT -- DAY

          THUD! Charlie and Peter land painfully on a dirt floor.

                         PETER
          Ow, crap...
          They look around -- eyes adjusting. There's barely any
          light.
          They're in a LARGE UNFINISHED BASEMENT. The floor is dirt
          and the main story of the house is held up by numerous

          SUPPORT POSTS.
          At the far end of the basement there is a door that leads to
          another room/storage area.

                         ON CHARLIE
          As he sees something. Stops.
          A MOUND of dirt. Like a grave.
          Charlie indicates to Peter to follow him. They whisper:

                         CHARLIE
          You uncover him. I'll light him
          up, then stake him.
          Charlie pulls a FABRIC MASK, like a ski mask, over his face.
          Peter looks at him.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Flame retardant.
          They're standing over the grave now. Both nervous.
          Charlie nods to Peter. Peter does his best to hold the
          shotgun on the grave as he pushes the dirt aside with his
          free hand. He's shaking.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.
          After a moment Peter UNCOVERS PART OF THE BODY. Then he
          moves up toward the face...
          Charlie douses the body with liquid from the canister.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)

                         (TO PETER)
          Gas.

                         PETER
          You should be a magician.
          As the face emerges, Charlie readies a match, then reaches
          for his STAKE--

                         PETER (CONT'D)
          Stop! No--
          CHARLIE stops JUST AS HE'S ABOUT TO TOSS the match.

                         PETER (CONT'D)
          Who is that?
          IT'S ADAM, sleeping in a shallow dirt grave.
          Charlie reacts. Holy shit. He pushes his mask back.

                         CHARLIE
          Adam. I know him. Knew him.

                         PETER
          Shh. Don't wake him up, for

                         CHRIST'S--
          Peter stops. He's looking over Charlie's shoulder,
          horrified.
          In the dirt behind CHARLIE are MORE GRAVES. Eight or ten at
          least. Charlie turns. Sees the graves.

                         PETER (CONT'D)
          You know them too?
          Charlie reacts, stunned.
          Peter moves to another grave, uncovers another sleeping face.
          And then another. A hulking man, a suburban mom...
          Charlie uncovers another body. Stops, chilled.

                         CHARLIE
          Ms. Granada. My geometry teacher.

                         (RUEFUL)
          She was hard up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         PETER
          How about we go back to my "run
          away" plan?

                         CHARLIE

                         (IGNORING HIM)
          We can't burn Jerry out. There's
          no way we'll get all these people
          out if the house goes up.

                         PETER
          I thought you're here for Amy.
          (off Charlie's look)
          Great. Right. Save the Geometry--
          A SCREAM stops him. Amy. Charlie and Peter spin -- it's
          coming from behind the door to the other room. A beat.
          They're both petrified as they move toward the door.
          Peter readies the gun again. Charlie pulls a CROSS out along
          with the stake.
          They creep toward the door.

          CLOSE ON CHARLIE
          Charlie puts his hand on the doorknob... Turns it...
          WHAMP! -- Charlie's VIOLENTLY SHOVED THROUGH THE DOOR into
          the STORAGE AREA

          INT. JERRY'S STORAGE AREA -- DAY

          Charlie hits the dirt hard.
          The door SLAMS SHUT AND LOCKS BEHIND HIM. He's in a smaller
          room with a LARGE DIRT GRAVE in the middle. Jerry's grave.

          INT. JERRY'S BASEMENT -- DAY

          Peter's confronted by JERRY. Who smiles darkly.

                         JERRY
          You look bigger on TV.
          Peter fires the shotgun, BLAM!
          But he misses Jerry and the power of the blast sends PETER

          HURTLING BACKWARD.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

          INT. STORAGE AREA -- DAY

          Charlie reacts to the blast -- but sees that ST. MICHAEL'S
          STAKE has fallen from his hand and rolled to the edge of the
          grave.
          He cautiously moves to retrieve it...
          He stops as he sees A FIGURE emerge from the dark. AMY.
          Her clothes are torn now, a thin trickle of blood runs down
          her neck. She looks impossibly sexy. Her hair, her eyes,
          her lips -- all shining and full.
          Forgetting himself, he goes to her. Pulls her into his arms.

                         CHARLIE
          Amy, God...
          She clings to him, near tears.

                         AMY
          Charlie.

          INT. JERRY'S BASEMENT -- DAY

          Peter scrambles on the ground, SHOTGUN trained on JERRY --
          who moves toward him calmly. The cross on the gun the only
          thing holding him back.

          BLAM!
          Peter fires again -- grazes JERRY.

                         JERRY
          In pain, he TRANSFORMS and VAMPS before our eyes with a blood-
          curdling yell. It's chilling.

          CLOSE ON GRAVES
          One by one, the TRIBE of vampires wake. ADAM, MS. GRANADA...

          INT. STORAGE AREA -- DAY

          Amy pulls away from Charlie -- says:

                         AMY
          You should have run with me while
          we had the chance. You should have
          saved me, Charlie.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          Charlie takes this in, pained. Then--

                         CHARLIE
          It's not too late.
          She brings her lips close to his ear. Rasps...

                         AMY
          It is. He's inside me now.
          Her EYES GO DARK -- fingernails grow SHARP and dig into
          Charlie. He feels the change.

                         CHARLIE

                         AMY--
          Charlie shoves her off, hard. But she holds him tight -- and
          they TUMBLE INTO THE GRAVE.

          INT. JERRY'S BASEMENT -- DAY

          JERRY, backed by ADAM, MS. GRANADA and a handful of other
          vampires, closes in on PETER.

                         JERRY
          It's over, guy. Charlie -- his
          girl's having her way with him.

                         (THEN)
          She's way out of his league anyway.
          Peter, trapped, won't be able to keep them at bay much
          longer.

                         PETER
          Stop! Stop!
          Desperate, he BLASTS them again. Hits one on the shoulder.
          But it's not stopping them.

                         JERRY
          And your aim--

                         PETER
          You don't get it! I'm on your
          side.
          Peter smiles a little. Shows his rows of SHARP FANGS.
          Jerry and the others stop. What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          INT. STORAGE AREA -- DAY

          Amy and Charlie struggle. He reaches for his cross -- but
          she throws him off her with a violent HISS.
          Charlie gets his first look at AMY in full VAMPIRE glory.
          She's even more freaky looking than Jerry or Ed. Her face is
          nearly overtaken by a wide mouth filled with razor-sharp
          teeth. Her eyes are crazed and blood-red.
          It's gruesome and terrifying.
          Charlie sees THE STAKE at the lip of the hole. Dives for it.
          Amy's on him in a flash. She throws him to the ground. He's
          got the STAKE in hand. Ready to strike.

                         AMY
          You wouldn't.

                         CHARLIE
          Try me.
          She STRADDLES HIM, sexual and raw. Charlie's repulsed,
          terrified.

                         AMY
          I'll be the best you ever had. The
          only you had.

                         (THEN)
          Charlie. We can be together
          forever.
          She leans in, licks his neck seductively...

          AND GASPS.
          She sits back, the STAKE IN HER CHEST. She falls away,
          shuddering.
          Charlie pulls the stake out -- scrambles out of the nest.
          He looks back at her, anguished.
          A beat. AMY, in terrible pain, LAUGHS. Nothing's happening.
          No kablooey.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          Missed. You missed.
          Charlie BREAKS THE DOOR OPEN with his crowbar.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

                         CHARLIE
          I know.
          He backs away from her. Into--

          INT. JERRY'S BASEMENT -- DAY

          The basement where Jerry and the THE TRIBE are CIRCLED around
          a body as MS. GRANADA feeds.
          ON PETER, who's pale and shaking...
          Charlie attacks them with THE CROWBAR.

                         CHARLIE
          Get off him!
          He hits MS. GRANADA off Peter. Manages to hold off JERRY for
          a beat. Spins and HITS ADAM in the head.

                         ADAM
          Dude!

                         CHARLIE
          Sorry.
          AMY enters from the other room -- already healing. Jerry
          sees her -- holds up a hand and backs the others off.

                         JERRY
          I'll finish this.
          Jerry, all swagger, moves in on Charlie.
          Charlie sees Peter, barely alive, spit out his FAKE VAMP
          teeth. Peter meets his gaze, wry and weak. Done for.

                         PETER
          Worth a shot. "Master of
          illusion."
          Now Charlie notices SHOTGUN not far from Peter's body. He
          dives for it, but Jerry steps on it -- kicks it away.

                         JERRY

                         (TO CHARLIE)
          You think that's going to stop me?
          Time to man up.
          Jerry brutally kicks Charlie, sends him sprawling.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         JERRY (CONT'D)
          Now. I'm going to kill your girl --
          make you watch. I'll take my time
          with you. And once you're dead,
          I'll finish your mother.

                         (RE: AMY)
          Too bad about that one. She sucked
          me dry. Like a pro.
          Amy smiles a little. Jerry GRABS CHARLIE, lifts him off his

                         FEET--
          Charlie, enraged, SPRAYS JERRY WITH GAS FROM the CANISTER --
          right in the eyes.
          Jerry recoils, HISSING. Adam and the OTHER VAMPS MOVE IN.
          Jerry's over it. He's on CHARLIE in a flash, FANGS BARED.
          About to RIP HIS NECK OUT.

          BLAM!
          PETER has the gun again -- has managed to pull himself up
          into a sitting position.
          He BLOWS away ONE OF THE SUPPORT BEAMS.
          BLAM! And ANOTHER.
          BLAM! And ANOTHER.
          BLAM -- he misses.

                         PETER
          Fuck.

          BLAM! AND ANOTHER.
          Charlie DIVES for SAFETY as the CEILING COLLAPSES in part of
          the basement. SUNLIGHT STREAMS in -- forcing JERRY, AMY and
          the other vamps into a corner.

                         PETER (CONT'D)

                         (TO JERRY)
          Fuck yeah! Nice sweater, loser!

          BLAM!
          Another BEAM collapses. BURYING JERRY, AMY and the others
          under DEBRIS from the floor above.
          A stunned beat.
          Peter slumps, exhausted from the effort.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.
          Charlie looks at him -- amazed.

                         PETER (CONT'D)

                         (WEAK)
          I'm better with stationary targets.

                         CHARLIE
          Yeah you are.
          Peter looks at him, sad.

                         PETER
          Get out of here. We don't have
          much time before they dig out.

                         CHARLIE

                         (RE: STAKE)
          I can save you. I have to kill him
          with this.

                         PETER
          You're a brave mother, I get it.
          And you were right. This is how I
          had to go... But we didn't count
          on an army.

                         CHARLIE
          He'll kill you both, he said--

                         PETER
          We're already dead.

                         (THEN)
          Go now, you live to fight another
          day. Stay -- there won't be one.
          Charlie stops. Swayed. Pained.

                         PETER (CONT'D)
          Do it.

          CLOSE ON CHARLIE
          Accepting it. It's what he has to do.
          He starts DIGGING.

                         PETER (CONT'D)
          Charlie!
          But Charlie ignores him, determined. Pulls his MASK DOWN
          over his face again.

                         PETER (CONT'D)
          Stop!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.
          WHAM! JERRY BURSTS OUT OF THE RUBBLE, attacks Charlie.
          Charlie falls back, PULLING JERRY with him into THE LIGHT
          Jerry BURSTS INTO FLAME -- but holds Charlie tight
          AMY and the other vamps start to claw their way OUT of the
          rubble.
          Charlie and Jerry fight -- nearly ENGULFED IN FLAMES now

                         PETER (CONT'D)
          Charlie!
          Peter gets up, painfully, moves to help.
          Raging and desperate -- Charlie and Jerry continue to battle.
          Finally, Jerry pulls Charlie down with him --rolls on the
          ground as they fight. Trying to put out the flames.
          Jerry starts to DISINTEGRATE -- he's about to EXPLODE into
          bits. Charlie's stake is now ON FIRE.

                         CHARLIE

          NO!
          A last desperate attempt. He can see Jerry's HEART, about to
          burn away.

          HE STAKES JERRY.
          AMY suddenly SCREAMS - she's burning inside, DYING. Or so it
          seems. The vampire is being burned out of her.
          PETER cries out too, reacting less violently. But in pain.

                         JERRY
          Still burning, looks down as the STAKE OF SAINT MICHAEL in
          his CHEST. Right through the heart.
          He starts to SHAKE VIOLENTLY -- faster and faster, just like
          Ed did -- becoming little more than a macabre BLUR.
          For a moment -- Jerry's human form hangs in the air...

                         JERRY
          Blow me.

          THEN HE BLOWS INTO A MILLION PIECES.

          ON CHARLIE AND PETER

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          Thinking fast, PETER tackles CHARLIE -- who is still in
          flames. They tumble into one of the open graves.
          DIRT pours in around them, extinguishing the fire.

                         ON AMY
          Transformed and healed. Herself again. She rushes to the
          edge of the open grave.

          ABOVE THE OPEN GRAVE
          Peter pulls Charlie's mask back. Charlie is burned,
          unconscious.

                         AMY
          Charlie!
          She crawls into the grave. Cradles Charlie in her arms.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          Charlie...
          Amy starts to cry. Peter looks on, concerned. Finally,
          Charlie opens his eyes. Says weakly...

                         CHARLIE
          Blow me? Seriously?
          Peter falls back -- exhausted. Laughing.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Those are his last words? What a
          tool.
          We pull away, leaving this tableau...
          UNTIL ADAM, MS. GRANADA and the OTHER MEMBERS of the tribe
          emerge from the rubble. Disoriented, freaked.
          A beat.

          MS. GRANADA
          Let's agree to never talk about
          this.

                         FADE TO:

          INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Charlie, Amy, Jane and Peter are in Peter's penthouse. It's
          a glittering night, a spectacular view.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.
          Jane, released from the hospital, looks healthy and glowing.
          She smiles at Peter, who also looks more together.
          She has a glass of wine -- he's drinking a COKE.

                         JANE
          Think you'll ever feel the same
          about a nighttime sky?

                         PETER
          Same as what? I was always
          terrified.

                         JANE
          Right. We're just catching up.

          ON AMY AND CHARLIE
          Charlie sees the connection between Peter and Jane.
          Shudders.

                         CHARLIE
          I'm not seeing that.

                         AMY
          She deserves some fun. Your mom
          fully cheated death.

                         CHARLIE

                         (SUGGESTIVE)
          You too. You deserve fun.

                         AMY
          Oh, I plan on it. Now that you've
          killed your first vampire...

                         CHARLIE
          I am so going to perform.
          Charlie KISSES her. It's intense, passionate. It's
          different, they're different. The childish part of them long
          gone.
          He runs his hands through her hair, pulls her close.
          SOMETHING BEEPS, talks...

                         VOICE
          "Frak!" "Frak!"

                         AMY

                         (PULLS BACK)
          What is that?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Charlie, a little sheepish, shows her. He's wearing a
          BATTLESTAR GALACTICA wrist watch.

                         CHARLIE
          Battlestar.

                         AMY
          Right.

                         CHARLIE
          It was Ed's.
          Amy smiles a little, softens.

                         AMY
          Right.

                         (THEN)
          Frak?
          PETER is passing. Hears this. Is down with it.

                         PETER
          Frak! Right on.

                         (TO AMY)
          Perfect Woman, can I get you a
          drink?

                         AMY
          I'll take another. Thanks.

                         CHARLIE

                         (TO PETER)
          I'll give you a hand.
          Charlie follows PETER into the DINING ROOM, where a BAR CART
          is set up. Peter moves to it. Pours himself a Midori.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          I thought you were on the wagon.

                         PETER
          It's dark.
          (off his look)
          I'm on the "day" wagon.

                         CHARLIE
          Thanks for inviting us.

                         PETER
          We should celebrate. Being alive.
          Your mom's clean bill of health.

                         CHARLIE
          You wanted to put the moves on her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         112

                         PETER
          What? No. What?

                         CHARLIE
          Just -- I'm watching you. I've got
          to look out for her.

                         PETER
          Yeah you do. So here's what I'm
          thinking. We faced the beast and
          we won. Can you imagine the
          possibilities if we had got that
          shit on film?

                         CHARLIE

                         VAMPIRES DON'T--

                         PETER
          Show up on film, yeah. But
          werewolves do, bigfoots do. We get
          proof, catch something -- we could
          build a stage act around that, you
          wouldn't believe. We'd blow those
          Cirque bitches away!

                         CHARLIE
          An act? Seriously? What about
          saving people from evil? What

                         ABOUT--
          A CHILLING LAUGH interrupts them. Distant. Eerie. And
          somehow familiar.
          Peter nods to his COLLECTION CABINETS.

                         PETER
          It happens. All this stuff...

                         CHARLIE
          Ever think about collecting
          something else? Snow globes or--
          Charlie stops, catches sight of something MOVING IN THE

          REFLECTION ON THE FLOOR-TO-CEILING WINDOW.
          Just a wisp, a phantom. The face - is it ED? His features
          twisted in a grimace of fear and pain... It's CHILLING.
          Charlie's spooked. But he looks again and the face is gone.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Yeah, definitely get new stuff.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.
          Peter leads CHARLIE OUT, back to the ladies in the other
          room. Still on about his idea...

          WE HOLD ON THEIR REFLECTION IN THE WINDOW

          PETER (O.S.)
          I'm serious, man. Do you know how
          much we could make? Think about
          how much people pay to see a tiger,
          or boobs, right? What if we had a
          tiger, boobs -- and a zombie!
          After they've gone we linger on the window. Is that Ed's
          eerie reflection again?, barely visible...

          AS WE GO TO BLACK

          ED (0.S.)
          You're so coooool Brewster!!

                         THE END
FRIGHT NIGHT

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. FULL MOON - NIGHT (AND CREDITS. ROLL)

          Clouds obscure the starless heavens for a moment, heavy and
          ominous in the black firmament. Then suddenly they clear,
          exposing a full moon streaked with red like a killer's
          face, a stalking moon staring down at man's evil on the
          earth below.
          A HOWL breaks the night, a wolf pursuing its prey perhaps,
          or perhaps something much, much worse. VOICES break the
          perfect stillness.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          What was that?

          MISS NINA (V.0.)
          Just a child of night, Jonathan.
          Come, sit here beside me on the
          veranda.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          It's chilly out here.

          MISS NINA (V.0.)
          Oh, no, it isn't. It's beautiful. I
          love the night so.

          2 EXT. RANCHO CORVALLIS - NIGHT

          A middling size town lost somewhere in the Southwest, the
          lights of its sixty some thousand residents twinkling like
          so many Christmas lights in the night.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          I've never seen you so beautiful
          before, Nina. So pale, so
          luminescent, so
          He suddenly stops. There is a moment. Then:

          MISS NINA (V.0. )
          Yes?

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          Your lips are so red.

          MISS NINA (V.O.)
          Are they? Would you like to kiss
          them?
          The CAMERA STARTS TO PUSH IN CLOSER AND CLOSER on the town
          as though searching for the source of the voices.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          3 EXT. CHARLEY'S STREET - NIGHT

          It's a typical middle class suburban street, full of pre-
          1 World War II houses, the substantial places they built
          then, two and three story homes with attics and basements.,
          porches and detached garages.
          There is the SOUND OF A LONG DRAWN OUT KISS as Jonathan and
          Miss Nina's lips meet. The CAMERA. MOVES DOWN the street,
          still looking for the voices.

          4 EXT. DANDRIGE AND BREWSTER HOUSE - NIGHT


                         V
          The CAMERA PAUSES TO STARE AT the Dandrige house, so dif-
          ferent in look and feel from all the other houses on the
          street. It's huge, almost forboding, its windows dark and
          vacant, its lawn overgrown and weed-infested, a home that
          has obviously been untended for a long time, unlived in and
          uncared for. However the "For Sale" on the lawn has a
          "Sold" sign just beneath it.
          The CAMERA PANS to the Brewster house next door, still
          SEARCHING for those voices. It's in sharp contrast to the
          Dandrige house, newly painted, its lawn neatly shorn, a
          house almost dwarfed in comparison to the Dandrige house,
          but a happy home, its windows lit and smiling out warmly at
          the night.
          The voices seem to be coming from the Brewster house, spe-
          cifically from a dark second-story window that is open to
          the night breeze.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          Why are you looking at me so
          strangely, Nina?

          MISS NINA (V.0.)
          Not you, Jonathan. Your neck. Has
          anyone ever told you it was
          beautiful?

           JONATHAN (V.O. )

                          (UNCERTAINLY)
           No.

           MISS NINA (V.0.)
           Come, lay your head on my breast.
           The CAMERA SLOWLY STARTS TO PUSH IN on the second-.story
           window.

                         5 OMITTED

          6 INT. BREWSTER HOUSE - CHARLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the window, past the billowing
          drapes to find itself staring at a TV, the flickering
          screen the only light in the room.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         6 CONTINUED:
          One of those terrible AIP/Hammer horror films is on the
          tube, a woman, obviously a vampire, talking to one of those
          vapid juveniles used so much in these types of films, the
          two of them standing on a veranda to some huge, old house.
          The young man rests his head against her breast, incredibly
          enough, unaware that she is bending toward his neck with
          these huge fangs.
          Just as. she is about to sink them into his jugular, a tall,
          saturnine man steps out of the darkness., wearing a rather
          daffy Victorian suit and carrying a stake and mallet in his
          hand. His name is PETER VINCENT.

          PETER (V.0.)
          Stop, you creature of the Night!
          The vampiress leaps to her feet, her hapless, intended
          victim forgotten. She faces Peter with a, hiss, her fangs
          sparkling in the moonlight.

          MISS NINA (V.O.)
          Who are you who interrupts my nightly
          feeding?

          PETER (V.O.)
          (drawing himself up to
          his full height)
          Peter Vincent, vampire killer!
          He rushes her, the stake held high to plunge into her
          breast and the CAMERA TURNS AWAY from the TV as the sounds
          of the movie CROSS FADE with the SOUNDS OF HEAVY BREATHING,
          LIPS MEETING, TONGUES INTERTWINING in the room itself.
          Only the room, a typical teenager's lair, seems devoid of
          life, the bed empty, schoolbooks untouched sitting on the
          desk. The CAMERA BEGINS TO SEARCH the room, looking for
          the source of this new sound, much more interesting than
          the old flick on the tube.
          And then it finds them, CHARLEY BREWSTER and AMY PETERSEN,
          two sixteen-year olds, on the floor to the far side of the
          bed, wedged between the bed and the window. They are both
          as American as their jeans and making out like crazy. They
          twis.t and turn on the floor, Amy alternating between enjoy-
          ing it and fighting Charley off, both of them white hot
          with their mutual need. As he tries to slip his hand under
          her blouse, she catches-a glimpse of the TV.
          The horror movie has faded out to be replaced by the
          interior of a local TV studio, a tacky graveyard set the
          centerpiece, the visage of Peter Vincent, much older now,
          rising out of a papier mache coffin and filling the screen
          as CREDITS END.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           Rev. 11/16/84 4.

                         6 CONTINUED: (2)

           PETER (V.0.)
          This is Peter Vincent, bringing you'
          Fright Night Theatre. Tonight's
          journey into horror is "Blood Castle,"
          one of my favorites. And for a very
          good season. I star -in it.
          He does this booming laugh that goes through about ten echo
          chambers as Charley, totally oblivious to the TV, works on
          Amy's bra, trying to get it undone, obviously something she
          doesn't want. She tries to distract him.

                         AMY
          Charley, Peter Vincent's on.

                         CHARLEY
          (fumbling with the bra)
          Forget Peter Vincent.

                         AMY
          But you love him.

                         CHARLEY
          I love you more --
          Behind them, the station break segues into a commercial, a
          bunch of kids singing and dancing joyfully to a Coca-Cola
          commercial. On the floor, Charley finally gets Amy's bra
          undone. That's it for her; she twists away.

                         AMY
          Charley, stop it.
          Be doesn't listen, going for her again, their finger fight-
          ing behind her back, hers trying to get the bra resnapped,
          his trying to keep it undone and get her blouse off at the
          same time. She suddenly pushes him away, really hard this
          time.

                         AMY
          Charley, I said stop it.
          Charley rolls over, leaping to his feet, frustrated as
          hell.

                         CHARLEY
          Jesus, give me a break, Amy. We've
          been going together almost a year and
          all I hear is "Charley, stop it!"'
          They stare at each other angrily, both of them breathing
          hard, their young hormones roiling inside them. Then they

          The horror movie is on again, Peter Vincent and Jonathan
          now carrying a coffin across a fog swept cemetery.
          Charley looks back at Amy, his features softening.

                         CHARLEY
          I'm sorry, Amy.
          She rises, both of them standing by the open window,
          staring at each other.

                         AMY
          Me, too.
          (she puts a hand out,
          touching his arm)
          I'm just scared, that's all.
          He nods understandingly, touched by her honesty and inno-
          cence, his basic decency winning out over his lust. Sud-
          denly she steps into his arms, kissing him as she never has
          before. She breaks, staring up into his face nervously.

                         AMY

                         (SOFTLY)
          Let's get into bed.:.

                         CHARLEY
          (staring at her, stunned)
          You mean it?
          She nods, stepping into his arms again, kissing him like
          he's never been kissed before, the two of them slowly turn-
          ing, Charley seeing the TV first with its grave digger
          scene, then the wall, and finally out the window over Amy's
          shoulder.
          And he freezes. There, below in the side yard, he sees two
          shadowy figures carrying what looks very much like a coffin
          toward the storm doors to the Dandrige house next door.
          His mouth drops open as Amyâ¢slips out of his arms and onto
          the bed, completely unaware of what he's seeing. She
          starts to take off her blouse, Charley no longer looking at
          her, his gaze glued to the weird scene he's seeing out his
          window.
          As her blouse comes off, she lays back in the bed, looking
          up at him, waiting for him to join her.

                         AMY
          Charley, I'm ready.
          He ignores her, grabbing his binoculars from his desk,
          whipping.them to his eyes and focusing in-on-the figures
          below.

          They're too dark to make out clearly, but they are JERRY
          DANDRIGE and BILLY COLE. An errant beam of moonlight hits
          the large, oblong box, and Charley gasps. It's a beautiful
          piece of work, huge, ornate, obviously incredibly old, and
          bound in brass.
          Amy stares at Charley with rising confusion and irritation.

          Amy, you're not going to believe this,
          but there are two guys in the yard
          below. And I think they're carrying a
          coffin.

                         AMY
          (glancing at the TV and
          seeing the very same scene)
          Sure, and they're on the moors,
          right.

                         CHARLEY
          Amy, I'm serious.

                         AMY
          So am I. Do you want to make love or
          not?
          Charley is still peering through the binoculars, the two
          figures below having gotten the storm doors open and now
          carrying the coffin into the basement of the house next
          door.

                         CHARLEY
          Amy, quick, come-here, you've got to
          see this.
          All he hears is his bedroom door slamming shut. He whirls
          to find Amy gone. Tossing the binoculars on the bed,, he
          dives after her.

          They stop, turning to stare through the doorway at
          Charley's mom, JUDY BREWSTER, sitting in the living room,
          watching the ten o'clock news on the downstairs TV. She's
          a young forty, pleasant looking and warm.

          the edges, but no less spectacular for it. She looks at

          looked to be a coffin into the basement. It's a three
          story house like Charley's but there any similarity ends.
          The Brewster house is newly painted and well lived in; the
          Dandrige house has long-been abandoned, the lawn overgrown,
          paint flecking from its side, the entire--place rundown and
          forlorn.

          directly on a sightline with his own room, but he doesn't
          see it, staring intently at his books.

          Charley sits at one of the tables, almost falling asleep
          face down in his cheeseburger and fries as he tries to
          study. Suddenly Amy slips in beside.him.

          fight with you again, okay?

                         AMY

          Over her shoulder he suddenly sees that the TV has gone to
          the local news, a picture of a girl who looks very much
          like the one he saw going into the Dandrige house the
          afternoon before on the screen. He is suddenly no longer
          listening or looking at Amy, his complete attention on the
          TV. She trails-off as she realizes she's lost his atten-
          tion, staring at him.

                         AMY
          Charley, are-you listening to me?
          He gets up abruptly and walks away, leaving her sitting
          there staring after him. He stops'below the TV, staring up
          at it as the newscaster's voice runs over the picture of
          the girl.

          found murdered this morning --
          Evil Ed steps up beside him, staring up at the 'screen along
          with him.

          16 EXT. BREWSTER AND DANDRIGE HOUSE - NIGHT

          tD The two houses sit there side by side,.only the Dandrige
          house has changed although it's hard to say exactly how.
          It just seems worse than before, more abandoned, more-hulk-
          ing, more... dead.

          17 INT. CHARLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Charley has the house next door staked out. He sits in a
          chair before his window, all the lights off in his room,
          only the flickering TV to keep him company. It's Peter
          Vincent on Fright Night, another one of his films on, this
          time the volume turned off. Charley holds his binoculars
          in his hand, staring at the dark window of the house next
          door, waiting.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          18 ZNT. CHARLEY'S ROOM - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT
          The TV is just flickering snow now, the channel having
          signed off hours before. Charley still sits in front of
          his window, but he's sound asleep, breathing deeply, lost
          in his dreams. Soft, sensual MUSIC snakes through his open
          window, enveloping him slowly and dragging him awake.
          Groggily he opens his eyes to find himself staring into the
          lit window of the bedroom next door. He sits up with a
          start.
          There is no drawn shade now. Be can see clearly into the
          room and a beautiful teenage girl with long blonde hair
          stands there, framed in the window, slowly taking her
          blouse off. Charley rubs his eyes., hardly able to believe
          what he's seeing. As he watches she drops the blouse to
          the floor and stands there, bare breasted. Charley gulps,
          fumbling for his binoculars.
          He gets them to his eyes just as Jerry Dandrige steps out
          of the shadows behind the girl, gliding across the room
          toward her with incredible grace. To Charley the whole
          thing has.a dreamlike quality, Jerry more an impression
          than a reality. He's thirty maybe, almost beautiful with
          alabaster skin and chestnut hair. He stops behind the
          girl, sweeping her hair back, exposing her tender, young
          neck. He slowly leans down as though to kiss her.
          As Charley watches through his binoculars, unable to tear
          his eyes away, Jerry Dandrige's upper lip slowly begins to
          pull back,. revealing just the hint of fangs, long, razor
          sharp, and sparkling pearly white in the moonlight.
          Suddenly, Jerry Dandrige stops, the fangs poised an inch
          above the girl's throat. He slowly raises his head, star-
          ing out the window across the side yard and into Charley's
          bedroom.

                          18 CONTINUED:
          It's almost as though he can see the boy watching him. -
          With an involuntary gasp of terror, Charley steps back into
          the deeper darkness of his room, his hand instinctively
          reaching up to-protect his own throat.
          Jerry Dandrigeâ¢slowly reaches up and pulls down the shade,
          cutting off all view into the room.
          Charley stands there for a moment, unable to believe what
          he just saw. The binoculars slip from his hand, crashing
          to the floor, and. he whirls, racing out of the room.

          19 INT. HIS MOTHER'S ROOM - NIGHT

          He bursts through the door to find his mother sound asleep
          in bed. He grabs her, shaking her awake.

                         CHARLEY
          Morn, you've yot to get up. I can't
          believe what s happening next door.

          (staring up as her son

                         SLEEPILY)
          What, what are you talking about?

                         CHARLEY
          He has fangs. The man who bought the
          house has fanas!

          Oh, Charley, I have to be at work at

                         SEVEN TOMORROW
          He hears a CAR DOOR SLAM in the yard next door. He jumps
          to the window, peering out into the back of the Dandrige
          house just in time to see Billy Cole walking away from a
          shiny new black Cherokee Jeep, its back door left open.
          Charley whirls and dashes out of the room, leaving his
          mother staring after him.

          He pounds down the stairs, taking'them two at a time, whips
          around the newel post and flies down the hall toward the
          kitchen.

          22 EXT. BACK YARD - DANDRIGE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Charley slips out his back door and through. the darkness
          into the adjoining yard.

                         22 CONTINUED:
          .There, among a clump of bushes, he crouches down, watching
          the black Jeep. The rear door is open as though to receive
          some burden, the yard empty, Billy Cole no longer'there.
          Suddenly the back door to the Dandrige house opens again
          and Billy comes out carrying a large bundle in a plastic
          trash bag over his shoulder. 'Charley's mouth falls open as
          he realizes the bundle could'easily be a woman's dead body.
          Billy dumps it in the back of the Jeep and slams the door,
          crossing. in front of the vehicle for the driver's door.
          Suddenly there is a terrific WHOOSH'through the air over
          Charley's head, the moonlight momentarily blotted out, the
          BEATING OF LARGE WINGS above causing the bushes around him
          to bend and sway. It's almost as though a huge bird, a bat
          perhaps, just swooped over his head from the top floor of-
          the Dandrige house. And then silence returns.
          Charley lifts his head, peering about in the darkness just
          in time to see a shape, more a shadow than a man, step out
          of the darkness no more than ten feet away. It's Jerry
          Dandrige.
          He glides toward the Jeep, tossing Billy a woman's purse.

                         JERRY
          Here, you forgot this.
          Billy one-hands it out of the air, turning back for the
          Jeep. Just then the back door to Charley's house bangs
          open, sending a shaft of light into the darkness. Judy
          Brewster stands there in the doorway, calling to her son.

                         JUDY
          Charley!
          Dandrig.e and Billy Cole freeze, both of them turning to
          look at the back door to the Brewster house, inadvertently
          staring right at the clump of bushes where Charley.is hid
          .ing.
          Dandrige takes a step forward, his eyes probing the dark-
          ness as though he can actually see through the murky black-
          ness right to where Charley hides.
          Terrified, Charley suddenly leaps to his feet and races
          back into his own yard, disappearing through the back door
          with his mother. Billy steps forward as though to follow
          the boy. Jerry puts out a restraining hand, stopping him.

          I saw him carry her body out in a
          plastic bag.

                         (RELIEVED)
          The kid's crazy, officer. I did take
          some bags out last night, but they
          were full of trash. Here, let me
          show you --

          28 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          He leads them into the living room which is'a mess of pack-
          ing crates, boxes, and furniture. He holds up a plastic
          trash bag stuffed with wrapping paper and cardboard boxes.

          CHARLEY,
          The bag I saw had a body in it, not

          garbage.

          LT. LENNOX
          Okay, let's see 'em --
          He takes a step to follow Billy out of the'room when
          Charley, increasingly desperate, stops him.

                         CHARLEY
          Look, I can prove he's lying. Let's
          look in the basement instead.

          LT. LENNOX
          What's down there?

                         BILLY
          (turning and staring

                         AT CHARLEY)_
          Yes, Charley, what's down there?
          Charley meets the big man's gaze and finds his tongue stuck
          to the roof of his mouth. The seconds, tick past. Still
          nothing from Charley. Billy turns to the Lieutenant with a
          smile.

                         BILLY
          Obviously the boy's made a mistake,

          He hops in his-car, slamming the door behind him as Charley

                         ME --
          Lennox ignores him, ROARING away in a cloud of burning
          rubber. Charley stares after him, not knowing what to do
          now.
          He hears the PORCH DOOR of the Dandrige house OPEN behind
          him and whirls to find himself staring at Billy Cole,
          standing on the porch looking back at him, a toothpick in
          his mouth. There's something very unpleasant in the big
          man's eyes:- like murder.
          Charley slowly backs away from him toward his car, Cole's
          eyes following him.. Charley glances down at his wrist-
          watch.' It's four in the afternoon. He glances up at the
          sun overhead. It's beginning to sink, late afternoon and
          all that implies drawing nigh. He looks back at Billy
          Cole. The man is smiling at him now, reading his thoughts.
          Charley leaps into his car and takes off down the street.

          Evil Ed sits at his desk,. hand painting a monster model of
          a ghoul as Charley bursts through the door and skids to a
          halt before him, breathing hard. Evil's room is a
          veritable museum of horror, movie posters of Frankenstein
          and the Wolfman dotting the wall, the shelves full of
          monsters', models, the floor littered with horror comics.

          I'm not kidding. Evil, please, just

          from his desk. He hands it to-Charley.

          Start with this. Of course, you have
          to have faith for it to work. Then
          get some wolfbane --

                         CHARLEY
          What?

                         EVIL ED
          Forget it. Get some garlic, links of
          the stuff you can wear around your
          neck and hang from your window. If
          he comes for you,, that'll be the
          way. Then, of course, there's holy
          water. But you need a priest to say
          a blessing over it first.
          He goes back to his painting. Charley stares at him.

          'I'm afraid so. Of course, they can
          change into wolves and bats at will
          and I don't know what you do about
          that. But your best protection right
          now is that a vampire can't enter
          your house without being invited by
          the rightful owner first.

                         CHARLEY

          Charley, this is.our next door
          neighbor, Jerry Dandrige.
          Charley freezes. Jerry Dandrige sits in the best chair, a
          drink in his hand, smiling at Charley. He's even better
          looking close up, almost blindingly beautiful, too much so
          actually.
          There's something disturbing about it, as though such good
          looks have to cover up an inner putrefaction, some sort of
          hidden, sweet, sickly rot just beneath the perfect pale
          skin.
          He rises, the smile widening as he sees the terror in
          Charley's eyes. He holds his hand out as Judy watches her
          son for his reaction.

                         JERRY
          Hello, Charley.
          Charley just stares at him.

                         JUDY
          Well, shake hands, Charley. There's
          no reason to be rude.
          Charley slowly crosses to Jerry and takes his hand, shaking
          it as one would the hand of a recently disinterred corpse.

          Charley turns back to stare at Jerry. Jerry smiles, speak-
          ing in a voice that flows like honey, charm and nascent
          sensuality oozing from his every pore.

                         JERRY
          What's wrong, Charley? Afraid I'd
          never come over without being invited
          first? You're quite right. But, of
          course, now that I've been made
          welcome, I'll probably drop by quite
          a bit.
          His voice changes, suddenly charged with double meaning,
          his eyes burning into Charley.

          Of course, Jerry. You're welcome
          anytime. It's so nice someone
          interesting has finally moved into
          the neighborhood. It's so dull
          around here. I mean how many nights

          Right, Judy.
          Charley watches this scene, backing across the room, terri-
          fied. He suddenly hits an end table, knocking it with a
          crash to the floor. Judy looks at him. He's ghost white.

          43. INT. CHARLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Charley-grabs the cross off his desk and nervously fingers
          it, turning to stare out his window at Jerry's window next
          door. The shade is pulled, but there's a light on behind
          it. It doesn't make Charley any less nervous.

                         DISSOLVE:

          44 EXT...DANDRIGE AND BREWSTER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Both houses sit quietly on the street, wrapped in the dark-
          ness of the night air. An ordinary enough image, two
          houses, sitting there, but there's something disturbing
          about it. After.a few seconds one realizes what it-is:
          the Dandrige house almost looks like it's about to pounce
          on its next door neighbor, the Brewster house.

          45 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Judy is sound asleep, a light breeze wafting the curtains.
          of her partially open window, sleeping mask over her eyes.

          46 INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT

          Darkness and silence, and nothing else but moonlight spill-
          ing through the window at the far end.

          47 INT.. CHARLEY' S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          He sleeps fitfully in his chair, his door locked behind
          him, his window barricaded with his desk.

          48 INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT

          Suddenly the shadowy outline of.what might be a huge bat
          swoops past the window outside followed by the BEATING OF
          MIGHTY WINGS. A second later something is heard landing on
          the roof with a heavy THUD.

          49 INT. CHARLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Charley sits bolt upright in his bed as he hears it, lis-
          tening hard. But now there's nothing but silence. He
          stares up at the ceiling, listening and waiting.
          Then he hears what SOUNDS LIRE FOOTSTEPS walking across the
          roof. And then silence again. Grabbing the cross and
          holding on to it tightly, he walks toward his door.

          50 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          He unlocks the door and pokes his head out, looking up and
          down the hall. Nothing. Then he hears it, a NOISE from
          the floor below. It sounds like fingernails scratching-.
          across glass. He tiptoes to the landing, staring down at
          the shadow enshrouded portico below. The NOISE IS LOUDER
          now, spookier, more insistent. Clutching his cross, he
          starts down the stairs.

          51 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT'

          Jerry Dandrige stands above Judy, staring down at her
          sleeping peacefully in her bed. The window behind him is
          now fully open. He glides across the room past Judy's
          bureau with her wigs sitting on it, past the wall mirror
          without leaving a reflection to mark his passing, and out
          the door with unnatural silence.

          52 INT. HALLWAY -.NIGHT

          Jerry closes the door behind him, giving it a sharp tug
          that slightly dislodges it-from it hinges, wedging it..tight
          against the frame. It's something no man of ordinary
          strength could accomplish that easily. He turns away,
          gliding across the hall toward the open door to Charley's
          bedroom.

          53 INT. STAIRWAY - PORTICO - NIGHT

          Charley stands on the stairs, staring through the doorway
          into the living room. There is nothing but shadows in
          there. And then he sees it, the source of the scratching
          sound.

          A tree branch, caressed by the wind, is slowly.moving back
          and forth across a pane of glass in one of the french doors
          to the patio. Relieved, Charley slips the cross into his
          pants pocket and turns, walking back up the stairs.

          54 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          He walks down the hall past his mother's bedroom, hardly
          giving it â¢ glance as he disappears into his own room.

          55 INT. CHAARLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Be shuts the door softly behind him, locking it, sits,
          turns on the TV, rising again nervously and... turns to
          find himself facing Jerry Dandrige. Be opens his mouth to
          scream. The vampire's hand whips out with blinding speed
          and seizes him by the throat, choking off all sound.

                         JERRY
          Now we wouldn't want to wake your
          mother, would we, Charley?

                         (SMILING)
          Then I'd have to kill her, too.
          Right?
          Charley nods and Jerry flings the boy the length of the
          room with inhuman strength, slamming him into the far
          wail. Charley slips to the floor, all the air knocked
          out of him. Jerry advances on'him as Charley fights to
          get his breath back.

                         - JERRY
          Do you realize the trouble you've
          caused me? Spying on me, almost
          disturbing my sleep this afternoon,
          telling policemen about me
          He reaches down and grabs the boy, jerking him erect, and
          slamming him against the wall again, Charley's legs
          dangling several feet above the floor. Jerry leans in,
          pressing his face close to Charley.

                         JERRY
          You deserve to die, boy
          And he. begins to slowly choke Charley, suddenly stopping,
          staring into the boy's face.

                         JERRY
          Of course, I could give you something
          I've never had... a choice. You
          forget abotrt me and I'll forget about
          you. What do you say, Charley?

          Judy can be heard RATTLING HER BEDROOM DOOR in its frame,
          trying to get it open. Jerry's head whips back and forth
          between the door to the hall and Charley, the SOUNDS of
          Judy struggling to get her bedroom door open becoming
          louder all the time.
          The door across the hall starts-to give with a groan. With
          a hiss of frustrated fury, the vampire whirls, throws open
          Charley's door, and dashes out into the hail.
          Charley throws off his shock at still being alive and
          plunges after him.

          56 INT. HALL - NIGHT

          Charley skids to a halt in the hall, sees the window at the
          far end is flung open wide, and dashes to it, sticking his
          head out and staring up at the night sky. Suddenly on the
          roof above him, there is the SOUND OF POWERFUL WINGS, beat-
          ing away into the night. air. And then nothing.
          He slowly pulls his head back in and closes the window
          behind him, locking it. He turns to find Judy stumbling
          out to her room at last and looking at him.

                         JUDY
          Charley, what happened?

                         CHARLEY

                         (THINKING FAST)
          I, I just had a nightmare.

                         JUDY

                         (INSTANTLY CONCERNED)
          Oh, no. You know, I had one last
          night. I was at this White Sale and
          there I was, standing at the counter,
          and I reached for my credit cards
          only to realize I was naked as the
          day I was born --
          Suddenly they both hear a dull THUD as if metal is bending,
          .then nothing. Judy stops, turning back toward the closed
          window as Charley peers through the glass, seeing the sha-
          dowy form of Jerry Dandrige slipping out of their garage
          and crossing into the.back yard of his own house.

                         JUDY
          Now what's that?
          She takes a step for the window only to have Charley grab
          her, gently guiding her back toward her bedroom.

                         CHARLEY
          Nothing, Mom. Just the raccoons in the
          garbage again. Why don't you go back
          to sleep. ,

                         JUDY

          you want a valium?

          He pushes her through her door into her bedroom, closing
          the door behind her and turning for his own room.

          57 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Charley closes the door behind him, clicking on the TV
          for company, hardly looking at it as he paces. the room,
          lost in thought. It's Fright Night again, another hor-
          ror film on. It's the last thing he needs to see, and
          he's about to lean over and turn.it off when the PHONE
          suddenly RINGS by his side, raking him jump.
          Be picks it up, but doesn't say anything, just listening
          at the receiver. Suddenly he bears Jerry's sibilant
          whisper.

          JERRY (V.O.)
          I know you're there, Charley, I can
          see you.
          Charley slowly turns, staring out his window. There, in
          the window of the house next door,. stands Jerry Dandrige,
          the phone to his ear, staring at Charley.

          ing his injured hand.

          I just destroyed your car, Charley.
          But-it's nothing compared to what I'm

          clothes, moping toward his car, taking a cigarette from
          his cigarette case as he goes. Eels in his fifties, tall, 
          saturnine, by nature very theatrical, but at this
          particular moment in time, also very depressed. Charley

          believing in vampires.

          more of you perhaps my rating would
          have been higher.,

          In fact I have one living next door.
          Would you help me kill him ?
          That stops Peter cold. He turns and stares at the boy.

          A moment. Then Peter turns away angrily.

          If this is your idea of a joke, I am
          not amused.

          deadly serious.
          Peter stares at him, sees he means it, and decides
          Charley's crazy. It makes him decidedly nervous.

                         PETER -

          fishes out his keys.

                         CHARLEY
          Please, you have to listen to me. The
          vampire tried to kill me last night-and
          trashed mv car when he didn't
          succeed. He'll be coming back for me
          tonight and if I don't get help, he's

          Peter shoves him aside,â¢hopping into his car, quickly lock-
          ing the door behind him, obviously terrified of Charley.
          As he starts the engine, Charley beats on the window.

          pronounce-him human. Like in "Orgy

          didn't have a reflection and then you

          He starts up the walk, Amy and Evil Ed following him.
          Charley runs after him, increasingly desperate.

          CHARLEY,
          But, Mr. Vincent, you don't know how
          powerful he is. He can change into a
          bat and fly through the night --
          Peter stops on the porch, knocking on the door, listening
          to the boy with half an ear.

                         PETER
          Of course, Charley, of course. But
          then he's never dealt with me before
          either.

                         CHARLEY

                         BUT --
          Billy Cole opens the door, his face lighting up when he
          sees Peter.He shakes his hand warmly.

                         BILLY
          Mr. Vincent, Billy Cole. This is a
          pleasure. Won't you all come .in?
          He steps back and.Peter, Evil Ed, and Amy enter the
          house. Charley has no choice but to follow.

          77 INT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - PORTICO - NIGHT

           Billy turns and yells up the stairs, all the clocks behind
           him ticking madly, the hour 6:30 p.m.

                         BILLY
          Hey, Jerry, they're here.
          Several seconds pass. Nothing happens. Peter turns to
          Billy.

                         PETER
          Perhaps he didn't hear you.

                         BILLY

                         (SMILING)
          Oh, he heard me all right.
          Suddenly a STEP CREAKS at the top of the staircase where
          the shadows are the heaviest. Slowly Jerry Dandrige walks
          down the stairs into view, first his elegant shoes, then
          his legs with their fashionable pants, and finally the rest
          of him, all beautifully turned out. His handsome face
          stares down. at them as he makes his entrance. There is
          something truly majestic about him, both incredibly attrac-
          tive and yet frightening at the same time.

          Jerry reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns to Peter
          with a blinding smile.

          Ah, Mr. Vincent.
          (shaking Peter's hand

                         WARMLY)
          I've seen all your films and I've

          people be?

                         PETER
          (doing the intros)
          This is Ed Thompson and Amy Peterson.

          with a wicked smile)
          Isn't that what vampires are supposed
          to do, Charley?
          Charley scowls at him. The others laugh. Jerry turns to
          the living room.

                         JERRY
          Please, come in --
          Be ushers Peter into the living room, Billy following. Amy
          and Evil Ed stare after Jerry, both totally captivated.

          She follows him into the living room. Evil Ed shoots
          Charley a disgusted glance.

          He follows the others. Left alone, Charley has no choice
          but to join them.

          78 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Jerry looks around at the packing crates and few pieces of
          dusty furniture and turns back to the others.

          It's all right, Mr. Vincent. I'm
          quite used to it by,now. As you may
          or may not know, Charley even brought
          the police over a few days ago.
          Peter, Amy, and Evil Ed all look at Charley, shocked.

                         AMY
          Charley, you didn't.

          Damn right, I did; Only the cops
          .didn't believe me anymore than any of
          you.
          (back to Jerry)
          But you'll believe me in a few
          seconds. Mr. Vincent, give him the
          holy water.

                         (WARNING HIM)
          Charley, there's no reason to be rude
          about this --

                         PETER
          (raising a placating hand)
          It's perfectly all right, Mr.

          water?

          Peter withdraws the vial from his pocket. Jerry eyes it
          warily, staring at Peter, his voice suddenly heavy with
          double meaning.

                         JERRY
          Are you sure that's holy water, Mr.
          Vincent?

                         PETER
          (playing it up)
          Positive. I saw Father Scanlon bless
          it down at Saint Mary's myself.
          Jerry takes the vial from his-hand, pulling the stopper,
          and sniffing at it, for the first time nervousness creeping
          into his manner.. Charley sidles up to Amy, whispering in
          her ear as Jerry prepares to drink the water.

                         CHARLEY
          Get ready to run. I'll protect you
          with this.
          He edges a cross out of his pocket, just giving her a
          glimpse of it. He glances up just as Jerry lifts his head
          back and. downs the contents of the vial in one swallow. He
          1 7 7 turns to Peter triumphantly.

                         JERRY
          There, satisfied?

                         PETER
          Totally.

                         (TO CHARLEY)
          Charley, you saw it. Are you
          convinced now that Mr. Dandrige isn't
          a vampire?
          Charley stares at Jerry and the vial, stunned almost into
          speechlessness.

                         CHARLEY
          But, it can't be --

                         PETER
          You just saw it, Charley. You know
          as well as I do that no vampire could
          drink blessed water.

                         CHARLEY
          Then it wasn't blessed!

          Charley looks at Jerry. Jerry stares back at hire, smiling.
          Charley suddenly whips the cross out of his packet and
          holds it up.

                         CHARLEY
          If he's not a vampire, then have him
          touch this?
          Jerry stiffens, his face losing its color, but none of the
          others notice. They're all looking askance at Charley.
          Peter steps up to the boy.

                         PETER
          Charley, you've already made a fool
          of yourself once. There's no reason
          to compound the error.

                         _ JERRY
          Yes, Charley, you've already.caused
          your friends quite enough pain.

          You don't want to cause them any
          more, do you?
          Charley sees.Dandrigeâ¢coiling to . spring, Billy sliding into
          place blocking the doorway to the portico. The tension
          level in the room is suddenly unbearable. Peter, Amy, and
          Evil Ed are aware of it although they don't know the
          reason. Charley slowly edges the cross back into his
          pocket.

                         CHARLEY
          No, no, of course not.,

                         JERRY
          And you're finally-convinced I'm not
          a vampire either,-correct?
          Their eyes lock; a moment passes. Then finally:

                         CHARLEY
          Yes.
          Jerry smiles at him and the tension suddenly flows out of
          the room. Billy even smiles. Jerry steps forward, usher-
          ing them all toward the portico.

                         JERRY

          Not at all, Mr. Dandrige. Glad to be

          Jerry ignores Charley, turning to Amy and Evil Ed as Peter
          steps back, reaching into his coat pocket for his cigarette
          case.

                         JERRY

          Please, call me Jerry.
          Her face is beginning to stiffen, her eyes turning blank.
          Charley looks at her in sudden alarm, remembering the girl
          he saw through the window that night.
          He grabs Amy by the arm, tugging. her toward the door.

                         CHARLEY

          Smiling, Jerry turns to Evil Ed as behind them all Peter
          opens his cigarette case, takes out a smoke, about to tamp
          it down on a thumbnail when he glances at the mirror on the
          inside of the-lid. He sees Amy, Evil Ed, and Charley
          grouped around where Jerry Dandrige should be standing, but
          he's not there. It's as though the kids are talking to
          thin air.

          we have many of the same interests.
          You know, in such things as horror
          movies and the occult.
          Peter's head jerks up and he looks at the doorway. Now he
          sees Jerry standing there, talking to the kids. Peter

                         4
          looks back down at the mirror again. No Jerry. His face
          goes chalk white, his mouth gasps for air, and he drops the
          case from his palsied hands. It smashes to the hardwood
          floor with a crash. Everyone turns and looks at him.

                         JERRY
          Something wrong, Mr. Vincent?
          Peter hurriedly scoops up the case, trying to hide his
          shaking hands and keep the tremor out of his voice.

                         PETER
          No, no, just my clumsiness. Come
          along, we must be going. Thank you

          Peter plunges down the walk to his ca-r, the kids hurrying
          to keep up with him. Charley looks at him.

          He stops by his car, fumbling his keys-out of his pocket,
          hardly able to fit them into the lock with his trembling
          hands.

                         CHARLEY

          me. Our lives depend on it.

                         PETER
          All right. He didn't cast a
          reflection in my mirror. Satisfied 
          now?

                         CHARLEY
          Mr. Vincent, you have to call the Polic
          e-and tell them --
           The-ENGINE finally CATCHES, and he ROARS away in a cloud of
           burning rubber, Charley watching him go, half frustrated to
          death.

          Billy and.Jerry peer out the window, watching the-kids
          walk away from the house.

          Well, at least they'll never
          believe the kid now.
          Jerry glances down and sees a sliver of mirror from
          Peter's cracked cigarette case at his feet. He picks
          it up, examining it. He casts no reflection in it.
          He holds it up for Billy to see.

                         JERRY
          No?

                         (RISING)
          Let's go.
          He grabs his leather jacket and moves- down the hallway
          toward the back door, Billy quickly following.

          SOB EXT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - STREET - NIGHT

          The kids are walking down the street away from the
          Dandrige house, the CAMERA CRANING UP to FOLLOW them
          as they recede in the distance, the darkness slowly
          swallowing them up.

          no reflection.

          Probably just a trick of the light.

                         CHARLEY
          (whirling on Amy)
          You felt how evil Dandrige was, didn't

          Wait a minute. We walk Amy home first.

          Why?

                         CHARLEY

          There are several tall buildings around, not many but
          enough. Street lamps cast pools of bright light and deep
          shadows everywhere. There are a few pedestrians out, a few
          cars passing by, but once again, not many.
          The three kids walk down the street. Evil Ed stops before
          the open mouth to a shadow encrusted alleyway.

                         EVIL ED
          .Let's cut through here.

                         CHARLEY
          No way. We want people and lights,
          the more the better.

                         EVIL ED
          Look, Brewster, vampires don't
          exist. Haven't you gotten that
          through your thick head yet?

                         CHARLEY
          What if you're wrong, Evil? What if
          Dandrige is a vampire and he thinks
          you know it. Would you walk down
          that alley then?
          The hair on the back of Evil Ed's neck starts to stand on
          end. Then he denies it.

                         EVIL ED
          Aw, fuck you, Brewster.
          He takes a step toward the alley. Charley grabs him.

                         CHARLEY
          Ed, please, just stick with us.

                         EVIL ED
          Forget it. You may be chickenshit,
          but I'm not.
          He disappears down the alley into the darkness. Amy and
          Charley stare after him. She turns to Charley.

                         AMY
          What do we ' do?..

                         CHARLEY Â¢
          Let him go. No vampire's gonna want
          hint anyway.. Probably give him blood
          poisoning.
          They're about to turn away when a blood curdling SCREAM
          ECHOES out of the darkness of the alleyway. It's Evil Ed.
          Charley and Amy dash headlong into the alley after him.

          shadow slick pavement, looking around.

                         CHARLEY
          Where is he?
          Amy spots him laying crumpled against a wall.

          They dash to him, kneeling by his side. Evil Ed's eyes are
          closed, his breathing shallow. Charley tries to shake him
          awake.

                         CHARLEY
          Ed, Ed, are you all right?
          Nothing from Evil Ed. Charley looks at Amy.

                         CHARLEY
          Jesus, I warned him --
          Evil Ed's eyes suddenly snap open, staring up wildly at
          Charley.

                         EVIL ED

          Kill me, Charley. Kill me before I
          turn into a vampire and --
          He suddenly heaves himself.at Charley, his mouth opening,
          going for his throat as Charley jerks back, terrified.

                         EVIL ED
          Give you a hickey!
          He suddenly lets Charley go, rolling on the pavement and
          laughing like a maniac, perfectly all tight. Charley
          springs to his feet, furious with him.

                         CHARLEY
          You asshole, you fucking asshole!
          Evil Ed rolls on the ground in hysterics, pointing at him,
          and laughing loudly.

          (flushed with anger)
          You'll get yours someday, Evil.
          He grabs Amy's hand and walks back down the alley toward
          the street and the lights. Evil Ed yells after him.

                         EVIL ED

                         (MOCKINGLY)
          Yeah., when? When I'm bit by a
          vampire? There are no such things as
          vampires, you fruit cake!
          Still chuckling to himself, he turns in the opposite direc-
          tion and-disappears down the alleyway into the darkness.
          A moment passes; nothing but silence.
          Then Jerry Dandrige steps out from a shadowy wall where it
          would be impossible for any mortal to have concealed
          himself. It's almost as though he materializes out of the
          night. He stares after Charley and Amy and then slowly
          turns to stare in the opposite direction after Evil Ed.
          He slowly walks in that direction.

          83A EXT. FARTHER DOWN THE ALLEY -.NIGHT

          Evil Ed walks along, feeling safe and secure. And then he
          hears it, FOOTSTEPS behind him, coming through the dark
          slowly toward him. He turns and looks back.

                         EVIL ED
          Charley, Amy, that you?
          He hears nothing but those FOOTSTEPS GETTING CLOSER.and
          CLOSER. The fear starts to work at him, twisting up his
          gut and making his forehead sheen with sweat. He steps
          forward, yelling out with false bravery.

                         EVIL ED
          If that's. you, it isn't working. I'm
          not scared!
          And then Jerry emerges out of the shadows, smiling at him.
          With a scream, Evil Ed turns and runs.

          Evil Ed runs like he's never run before,â¢pounding through
          the dark, smashing into traffic cans and falling to the
          ground, leaping to-his feet, ignoring his skinned hands and
          bruised knees, running for his life and knowing it.

          83C EXT. DEAD END NIGHT

          He suddenly skids to a halt, facing a brick wall. He
          whirls, his breath-coming in ragged gasps now, peering down
          the alleyway into the dark, listening to those FOOTSTEPS
          getting closer and closer. He slowly backs away until he
          has no further to go his back against the brick wall, on
          the verge of hysteria.

                         EVIL ED
          No, no --
          The FOOTSTEPS SUDDENLY STOP. Nothing but silence. The
          seconds tick past. He takes a step away from the wall,
          peering into the darkness with something like hope, preying
          that maybe, just maybe, Dandrige has given up.
          A voice suddenly whispers in his ear, no more than an inch
          away.

                         JERRY
          Hello, .Edward.
          Evil Ed turns with a scream to find Jerry standing right
          next to him. Almost insane with fear now, slobbering like
          a wounded animal, he backs away from the shadowy figure,
          hitting the corner and sliding to the cold pavement, almost
          curled up in a fetal ball, tears streaming from his eyes.
          Dandrige walks over to him, staring down with something
          like pity in his eyes.

                         JERRY
          You have nothing to fear from me.
          (in a voice like honey)
          I understand what it's like, being
          different. Only they won't make fun
          of you anymore or beat you up. I'll
          see to that. All you have to do is
          take my hand.
          Evil Ed slowly looks up at him through his tear-stained
          eyes to see Jerry staring-down at him, his. hand outstretch-
          ed to.him, a slight smile on his face, gentle, seductive,
          beguiling.

                         JERRY
          Here, Edward, take my hand.
          Evil Ed looks down at the hand outstretched to him.

          fingers, almost womanly, the nails impossibly long,
          perfectly shapped, tapering to five gleaming, razor sharp
          points.
          Evil Ed slowly reaches out and-takes the vampire's hand.
          Jerry smiles down at him and slowly leans down, lifting him
          up into the last embrace Edward Thompson will ever know.

          84 EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Charley and Amy walk rapidly along a street, heading toward
          Amy's home. He casts a glance at her.

                         CHARLEY
          How much further?

                         AMY
          About ten minutes --
          A DEATH RATTLE, long and-high-pitched, suddenly comes to
          them, ECHOING through the city streets, down alleyways and
          across apartment buildings, faint yet filled with so much
          terror it stops them in their tracks and leaves them
          staring fearfully about at the shadows.

                         CHARLEY
          What was that?

                         (SHOUTING)
          Not funny, Evil!
          Her voice bounces off the walls down the street and then
          dies, leaving them staring at the darkness and the shadows,
          fearful. Amy tries to act brave, turning to Charley.

                         AMY

                         C'MON --
          They start down the street again, Charley glancing
          nervously over his. shoulder in the direction of Evil Ed's
          scream.

                         CHARLEY
          Amy, what if Evil really was in
          trouble?

                         AMY
          Oh, come on, Charley, don't let him
          suck you in again --

          pole, its front ripped open, the wires inside shredded.-
          Before they can even gasp at the sight, they hear the SOUND

          flies across the building wall opposite them. That's all

          They come-racing down a street, under a bridge and start
          up the incline toward the ROAR above. They turn onto the
          bridge, starting to.cross it., slowing to a walk, breathing
          hard.

                         CHARLEY
          I think we lost him.

          Yeah.
          (stopping and turning

                         TO CHARLEY)
          Charley, you were right about the
          holy water. We faked it. I'm just 
          sorry I didn't believe you.

                         CHARLEY
          It's all right, Amy.
          He kisses her, takes her hand, and they start walking up
          the bridge.

                         CHARLEY
          We've got it made
          And they freeze.' There, high above them on one of the
          arches of the bridge, so high up no one could possibly get
          there unless they flew, stands Jerry Dandrige, staring down
          at them. With a scream, they whirl, racing off the bridge
          and down the street.

          They suddenly turn the corner only to find they are facing
          Jerry Dandrige, standing on the sidewalk directly in front
          of them, amused by the frozen expressions of horror on
          their faces.

                         CHARLEY-
          Run?
          He grabs Amy's hand, the two of them whirling and dis-

          step toward them and they whirl, diving down a side street.

          91 EXT. SIDE STREET - CLUE RADIO - NIGHT

          They tear down the street, teeing the Club Radio, a
          fashionable disco, across the street. Its entrance is
          jammed with people trying to get in, all of them dressed to
          the teeth in New Wave and neo-punk.

          Charley dives for it, dragging Amy after him just as Jerry
          appears. around the corner behind them, walking toward then
          with a steady gait, relaxed, in no great hurry, a hunter
          sure of his kill.
          Charley and Amy fight their way through the crowd until
          they reach the front door. A BOUNCER stands there, check-
          ing I.D.s and collecting the cover charge. He hardly looks
          down as Amy and Charley step up.

                         BOUNCER
          Five bucks apiece.
          Charley frantically searches his pockets and comes up with
          change and nothing else. Amy pulls out a ten dollar bill
          and hands it to him.

                         AMY
          I've got it --
          As Charley takes it from her, he glances over her shoulder
          and sees Jerry moving through the crowd toward them. He
          shoves the money at the Bouncer hurriedly.

                         CHARLEY

                         HERE --
          The man takes it and Charley grabs Amy, pulling her toward
          the door, watching over his shoulder as Jerry keeps coming
          closer and closer toward them. Suddenly the Bouncer
          reaches out and collars Charley'.

                         BOUNCER
          Hey, just a sec. How old are you
          two?

                         BOUNCER
          Let me see some I.D.
          Charley glances back. Jerry is just an arm's length away
          now. A MAN suddenly shoulders him aside just as he's about
          to grab Charley and Amy.

                         MAN
          Hey, wait you turn.
          Jerry turns and stares at the man. Whatever the man sees
          in Jerry's eyes gives him the,cold sweats and.he backs
          hurriedly away.

          Charley grabs Amy, using the moment to pull her away from
          the door and Jerry. The Bouncer shouts after them, holding
          up the ten spot.

                         BOUNCER
          Hey, what about your.money?
          Charley and Amy come out of the crowd, backing away from
          the door just as Jerry emerges, stepping after them. He's
          only ten feet away now, smiling as he approaches, both kids
          realizing it's hopeless to run at this point. Backing
          away, Charley and Amy cross the mouth of an alley. There's
          the CRASH OF A GARBAGE PAIL and Charley glances down the
          alley to see a dish washer from the club dumping garbage,
          the bright lights of the door into the kitchen shining like
          a beacon in the night.
          Charley grabs Amy's hand and jerks her down the alley after
          him as he races for the door.

          92 INT. CLUB RADIO KITCHEN - NIGHT

          He and Amy race through the mad house of a kitchen, one of
          the COOKS glancing up from chopping lettuce as they speed
          pass.

          Hey, you can't go in there!

          93 INT. CLUB RADIO - NIGHT

          They burst through the door to find themselves in a packed
          VIDEO DISCO, four huge screens overlooking the dance floor,
          all of them playing Michael Jackson's "Thriller." Charley
          and Amy disappear into the crush of people. A moment later
          the cook appears from the kitchen, signaling a bouncer cir-
          cling the floor, keeping a wary eye out for trouble.
          Charley and Amy fight their way through the sea of dancers,
          Charley looking about. He sees what he wants, a sign above
          a hallway reading. rest rooms and phone. He drags Amy in
          that direction.
          At the corner of the dance floor, the cook can be seen ges-
          turing to the bouncer, pointing in the direction the two
          kids took.

          94 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          They break through the crowd and down the short hallway to
          a bank of pay phones opposite the restrooms. Charley digs
          a dime outâ¢of his pocket, drops it, and dials. Amy screams
          at him to make herself heard above the din.

          There is a KNOCK at Peter's locked and barred door. He
          slowly rises from his chair, the cross clenched in his
          hand, staring at it, terrified. The KNOCKING COMES.AGAIN,
          louder this time. He presses his lips to the door, whis-
          pering.

                         PETER
          Who is it?

                         EVIL ED
          There's a vampire out here. Let me
          in.
          Peter slips the cross into his pocket and unlocks the door.
          Be pulls Evil Ed into the room, hurriedly locking and bar-
          ring the door behind him. Evil Ed has changed, and not for
          the better. His skin is more sallow, huge dark circles
          under his eyes, his lips bloodless, his collar pulled up
          tightly around his neck. Peter turns to him.

                         PETER
          What are we going-to do?

                         EVIL ED
          What are you going to do, not me.
          Peter stares at him as Evil Ed slowly reaches up and pulls
          down the collar of his shirt, revealing two small puncture
          marks on his throat. Peter's eyes widen in horror; Evil
          Ed's smile only grows wider.

                         EVIL ED
          I used to admire you, you know that.
          Of course, that was before I found
          out what â¢a fake you were.

          He advances on Peter, looming over him, Peter staring up at
          the boy in growing terror. Evil. Ed smiles at him, reveal-
          ing two huge fangs. Peter leaps out of the chair, dashing
          for the door, fumbling to undo the locks and bars with
          trembling fingers. Evil Ed watches, his rictus grin just
          growing wider.

                         EVIL ED
          Peter Vincent, the great vampire
          killer, indeed!
          He throws himself at Peter, grabbing him from behind and
          whirling him about, opening his mouth wide to sink his
          fangs into him. Peter straightens, grabbing the cross from
          his pocket and thrusting it directly into Evil Ed's face,
          slamming it into his forehead between his eyes.
          His skin sizzles and cracks, smoke rising, and Evil Ed
          backs away, bent over screaming in pain, his hands held to
          his face.
          He slowly looks up as Peter watches, frozen in horror.
          Evil Ed drops his hands from his face, revealing a smoking
          sign of the cross branded into his forehead. He stares at
          Peter.

                         EVIL ED
          What have you done to me?
          He turns to look into the wall mirror, but there's no re-
          flection.for him to see. He whirls on Peter, screaming at
          him like the spoiled brat he is.

                         EVIL ED
          What have you done to me?

          Peter rushes to the window, staring out at the street
          below. Nothing. He cranes his-'neck peering at the heavens
          above. Nothing. He draws his head back in, leaning

          of it all.

          answer.
          Unseen by either of them, Jerry Dandrige sweeps through the
          front door of the club, moving like a god among mere mor-
          tals, his eyes, now glowing a faint red, sweeping the crowd
          of dancers as he moves toward the dance floor.

          Peter sits in the dark, clutching a cross, trying not to
          shake as he watches the-RINGING PHONE, too terrified to an-
          swer. It keeps on RINGING.

          Answer me, damnit, answer me --
          Behind him Amy stiffens, staring out onto the dance floor
          at the sea of people. Moving through the dancers like a
          golden god moving amid mere mortals walks Jerry Dandrige.
          The hot, colored lights of the dance floor highlight his
          hair, accentuating his gracefulness, making him seem even
          more beautiful than he is.
          He stops just at the edge of the floor and holds his hand
          out to Amy, the orgiastic dancing swirling on behind him,
          the pounding, SENSUAL BEAT OF THE FUNK ROCK washing over
          them both. His eyes burn into hers, willing her to come to
          him.
          Terrified, she turns back toward Charley. In that moment
          Jerry disappears from the mouth of the hallway, Amy turn-
          ing back just as she's about to grab Charley only to see
          he's gone. She stops, more intrigued than frightened,
          the image of that beautiful man holding out his hand to
          her sharp in her mind. She takes a step forward down the
          hall, continuing down the hall until she has a clear view
          of the dancers. Jerry's nowhere to be seen.
          Behind her., . Charley is just about to turn and glance. in 
           her direction when a voice answers on the other end of 
          the line.

           Yes.
           Charley cups one hand over his ear, bending dawn to hear
           better. Behind hint Amy slowly disappears down the hall- 
          way and onto the dance floor.

          Mr. Vincent, this is Charley Brewster.

          Charley emerges from the hall, looking about in the crush

          a table, a man yelling up at hiXi angrily.

          around their mirror of white powder. He moves quickly
          away, searching for Amy. He stops by the wall of poseurs
          cruising everything that walks by, asking a girl that looks
          from behind as though she must be Amy's age.

          The girl turns to him,. revealing herself as a woman well
          into her mid-forties, decked out like a teenager, Sylvia
          Miles ten years ago, staring at him hungrily.

                         OLDER WOMAN
          Forget her, take me instead
          She reaches out to kiss Charley and he flees the crowd of
          flesh.watchers laughing at him as he goes.
          He moves along a wall of LESBIANS, stopping one, his des-
          peration growing.

          I'm looking for a girl --

                         LESBIAN
          So am I.
          Before Charley can recover a woman moves into her arms,
          Charley, shocked and disconcerted, backing away until he
          bumps to a halt against a heavy metal biker, the kind of
          guy who's into Twisted Sister. The parody of biker throws
          him to the floor for the insult, his friends, walking par-
          odies of bikers, laughing at Charley as he leaps to his
          feet and backs away into the crowd.
          He breaks free of the packed humanity, stopping on the
          stairs. It is at that moment that he catches a glimpse of
          Amy on the dance floor, dancing with Jerry. He hurries
          down the stairs and onto the floor.
          On the dance floor, Amy moves.with Jerry, their bodies
          locked together, slowly falling. into his eyes, dancing
          slower and slower with him until finally she has no will
          left of her own. She is "in love" with him. It is at that
          moment that she bends her head forward, laying it on his
          shoulder, exposing her neck to him, her eyes staring at the
          wall as they revolve around and around, Jerry bending down
          to kiss her neck, his mouth slowly opening. It is at that
          moment Amy sees her reflection in the mirrors mounted
          against one wall;.she is dancing alone. Shocked back to
          her senses, she goes rigid in Jerry's arms, trying to pull
          away from him, screaming as the music and the dancers stop.

                         'AMY
          Charley!
          Across the dance floor, Charley hears her SCREAM and pushes
          his way through the sea of humanity, fighting his way to
          her side where she stands with Jerry, once again caught in
          his eyes, slowly losing her will. Charley grabs Jerry by
          the shoulder, trying to pull him away from Amy.

          in his arms, her eyes locked on. his face.

          What's wrong, Charley? Jealous?
          He grinds his pelvis against.Amy, dry humping her in front
          of Charley. She throws her head back, her mouth opening in
          .something close to ecstasy, her eyes glazed, staring up at
          him with adoration, giving herself to him as she cocks her
          head to one side, exposing her tender young throat.
          Charley goes crazy.

          Charley's fist in the palm of his hand easily. Be stares
          down at the boy, smiling cruelly.

          .JERRY
          You shouldn't lose your temper,
          Charley. It isn't polite.
          He tightens his grip, slowly squeezing Charley's fist. You
          can almost hear the knuckle bones grinding as Charley's
          face'contorts in agony, driving him to his knees before
          Jerry. Charley looks up at him, tears of pain streaming
          down his face.

          my house, just the two of you. That
          is if you ever want to see Amy again.
          He casually releases Charley, letting the boy drop to the
          floor as he disappears with Amy into the swirling mass of
          dancers. Charley leaps to his feet, ignoring the pain in
          his hand and plunges after them.
          Charley breaks free of the swirl near the bar, looking
          everywhere and not seeing either of them. Suddenly he's
          grabbed by a strong, pair of arms. He looks up to find
          himself staring into the face of a huge, black BOUNCER.

          front door, starting to move through it with Amy when sud-

          You want chicken, man, you. go to some
          other club.
          Jerry snarls, his eyes beginning to glow, his hair slicking
          back slightly, the hint of fangs beginning to protrude over
          his upper lip as rage overtakes him. He raises his right
          hand, holding it out in.front of. the bouncer's face so the
          man can clearly see what is happening. The nails on the
          four fingers pop out, literally elongating several inches
          in front of the man's eyes, growing into razor sharp claws
          that sparkle in the overhead lights.

          whistle through the air, tearing his throat out in one
          swipe, scattering blood everywhere, blinding several of the
          dancers swirling.by, hitting people drinking at the bar, a
          couple necking in a corner, blood flying everywhere.
          Jerry steps around the corpse as it topples backward over a
          table of coke users, the bouncer's dead eyes staring up at
          them. Leon dashes up, - lunging for Jerry. The vampire's
          hand snaps out, grabbing`him by the throat, squeezing,
          driving those claws deep into the man's neck, holding him
          like a chicken, enjoying a second of his death throes and
          then casually flinging him into the center of the floor,
          bringing the music and all the dancing to a shrieking halt
          as this new group of people stare at another dead body.

          into his suitcase, preparing to abandon his mementos of
          a lifetime in his rush to get out of town while he's
          still alive.
          There's a KNOCK at the door. Be looks up, terrified.

                         PETER
          Who is it?

          CHARLEY (O.S.)
          Charley Brewster. Let me in.

          The door cracks open an inch, a chain across the latch.
          Peter peers out at him.

                         PETER
          Are you one of them, too?

                         CHARLEY
          What are you talking about?
          Peter thrusts his cross out through the crack.'

          Here, grab this.
          Charley does as told. Peter peers at his hand. No smoke.
          He hurriedly slips the chain from the door and pulls the
          boy inside.

          124 INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Peter relatches the door and hurries back to his packing.
          Charley watches him.

                         CHARLEY
          What are you, doing?

          You can't.

                         PETER
          Wanna bet? Watch me.
          Peter closes the suitcase, hurrying for the door. Charley
          steps in front of him, blocking his path.

                         CHARLEY
          Dandrige has Amy. He says he'll kill
          her unless we come to his house.
          Peter stops, staring at Charley, stunned. The blood drains
          from his face.

                         PETER
          Oh, my God.

          Amy slowly regains consciousness, opening her eyes to find
          herself laying on the floor, Jerry Dandrige looming over
          her. She cowers back, looking about the bedroom.

                         JERRY
          You don't really care.
          He hits play on the TAPE DECK. FUNK ROCK, hot and driving,
          snakes out of the speakers. He turns back to her, holding
          out his hand. She looks away, then glances up only to find
          herself trapped in his gaze.
          He starts.to weave his way across the floor toward her,.
          every move a suggestion, an invitation, all of it somehow
          hypnotic. She stares at him, fighting to break free.
          Finally she manages to turn her head away, staring at the
          floor, screaming at him.

                         AMY
          Liarl I love him...
          It doesn't faze him; he just keeps moving to the beat,
          slowly, oh, so slowly, coming closer and closer to where
          she sits on the floor, his voice stroking her as he comes.

                         JERRY
          Am I lying, Amy?
          He stops above her, leaning down, his voice a husky, post-
          coital whisper.

                         JERRY
          Am I?
          And she's gone, his eyes drawing her in and swallowing her
          up, drowning her in their faint red glow. He holds out his
          hand to her.
          She slowly takes it and-he raises her up into his arms,
          moving in place to the MUSIC with her, smiling down as she
          stares up at him blindly. He gently pushes her head down
          on his shoulder, exposing her tender young neck.
          And then he slowly bends down, his mouth opening to expose
          those two, razor sharp fangs with their alabaster cast,
          slowly, delicately sliding them beneath her skin.

          Her body arches, both arms pressing him to her, her body
          clinging to his. And then she screams, bucking under him
          like she's having something like a sexual climax, only
          better, much better.
          And just underneath her scream.is this horrid, greedy,
          SUCKING NOISE, Jerry Dandrige, feeding.

                         CUT TO:

          125A EXT. SIDE YARD OF A HOUSE - NIGHT

          Charley walks through the darkness, with cross and stake
          held in his hands, slowly approaching the Dandrige house
          through a side yard across the street.
          The shadows loom up over him, the wind causing the TREE
          BRANCHES to RUSTLE, Charley growing more and more nervous
          with every passing second.

          126 EXT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - NIGHT

          -Charley steps out of the darkness of the trees across the
          street from the Dandrige house, stopping to stare at it.
          The huge, silent, dark.house no longer looks like every
          other house on the block.
          It seems to have assumed a life of its own and turned into
          a hulking, brooding monster, about to leap forward and
          pounce on him.
          Charley grips his stake and hammer, checks the cross stuck
          in his jacket pocket, takes'a deep breath, squares his
          shoulders, and starts the slow walk toward the Dandrige
          house. Through the trees-he moves, into the shadows and
          darkness, across the street, closer and closer,to that
          hulking,, evil house.
          Suddenly a'hand snaps out of the darkness, grabbing him by
          the shoulder.

          Peter Vincent, ready to do battle
          with the undead.
          Charley whirls to find himself staring into Peter Vincent's
          drawn face. He wears his Victorian suit, his whole
          demeanor that of his public persona, the vampire killer.

          which now seems to be staring at them, about to charge

          eyes are on that malevolent looking house, the house
          looming larger and larger above him as they get closer and
          closer.
          Peter begins to slow, his nerve draining away as the true-
          evilness of the. place begins to eat at him. He finally
          comes to a halt, staring at the house. Charley stops,

          He reaches out, takes the cross. from Peter's hand and
          crumples it, contemptuously tossing. it aside. Be turns
          back to Peter.

          You have to have faith in order for
          it to work on me, Mr. Vincent.
          He starts down the stairs again, Peter backing away,
          terrified, his nerve completely gone now. Charley steps
          forward, staring up at Dandrige defiantly. He whips out
          his cross, thrusting it at the vampire.

                         CHARLEY
          Stop!
          Jerry stops, staring at the cross. Charley starts up the
          stairs toward him, the cross held in front of him.

                          BACK --
          Jerry backs up the stairs, away from the cross,
          disappearing into the darkness at the top of the landing.
          Charley glances back at Peter triumphantly.

                         CHARLEY
          We're gonna make.it --
          Billy Cole suddenly steps out of the darkness in front of
          him, rips the cross from the boy's hand and viciously
          backhands him across the face. With a scream, Charley
          smashes through the. stairway railing, plunging to the
          hallway floor below. He lands with a solid thud, lying
          there, groaning.
          Jerry steps in front of Billy, staring down at Peter on the
          stairway, smiling at him. Then he slowly starts down the
          stairs toward Peter. With a scream, the actor whirls,
          racing down the steps and out the front door.

          128 INT. BREWSTER HOUSE - PORTICO - STAIRWAY - NIGHT

          Peter smashes through the front door, yelling up the
          stairway.

                         PETER
          Mrs. Brewster!
          No answer. He grabs the phone from the table and punches
          out a number, speaking hurriedly into it.

                         PETER
          Hello, operator, get me the police.
          Operator?
          No response, not even a dial tone. He holds the phone up
          only to see the cord has been ripped from the wall.
          His eyes widen in horror, his gaze snapping back up the
          stairs.
           PETER (Cont.)
          Mrs. Brewster --
          He plunges up the stairs.

          He bursts through the door to see Judy in bed, the back of
          her head to him, her blond hair lying across the pillow.
          He hurries across the room. toward her, relief sweeping his

          I know. I did it.
          He grins up at Peter as he.-slowly rises, the wig
          slipping from his head, his features already
          transformed subtly into those of a vampire, the hair
          slicked back on his head, his face elongated, two huge
          white fangs slashing over his lower lip.
          Peter staggers back, staring at him in horror.

                         PETER
          Where's Charley's mother?

                         EVIL ED

          left - a note for Charley.

          With a scream, Peter whirls and plunges out of the room.

          130 INT. HALL WAY - NIGHT

          Peter races down the hallway only to bit a table in the
          dark, crashing to the floor on the landing, the.table
          splintering beneath him. He sits up, groaning, holding his
          leg.
          He suddenly hears a GROWLING, low and deep and vicious,
          coming from the other end of the hallway. He looks up,
          .staring into the darkness.
          Suddenly, a HUGE WOLF, as ugly as Evil Ed, tears out of the
          master bedroom, skidding to a halt, staring back at Peter.
          It's eyes glow like red-hot coals in the dark, saliva drip-
          ping from its huge fangs.
          Peter scrambles to his feet, about to plunge down the
          stairs when with a terrible SNARL, the huge animal bounds
          down the hall toward him.
          With a scream, Peter picks up a splintered leg of the table
          just as the wolf launches itself into the air toward his
          jugular vein.

          He slams the jagged piece of wood into the animal's chest
          as it flies past, its snapping jaws missing his throat by
          an inch, the wolf hits the landing railing and plows
          through it, almost in slow motion, plunging over the side.

          131 INT. PORTICO - STAIRWAY - NIGHT-

          The wolf tumbles through the air in a blur of fur and
          fangs, down and down until suddenly Evil Ed smashes into
          the hardwood floor below with a terrible THUD. He lays
          there, the long wooden splinter buried in his heart.
          Peter hurries down the stairs, stopping above him and
          staring down, watching in fascinated horror as humanity
          leaks back into his eyes, his face transforming into that
          of a normal teenage boy as he dies.
          He looks up at Peter with suddenly soft, brown eyes.

                         I'M SORRY

          waste and horridness of it all..

          Jerry comes through theï¿½door with Charley over his shoulder
          and dumps him on the floor a few feet from where Amy lies,
          curled up in a fetal ball.
          He nods at. Amy as Charley slowly opens his eyes, regaining
          his senses.

                         JERRY
          You wanted her, there she is.
          Charley glances to his side, sees Amy lying there, and
          crawls to her. He gently turns her toward'him.

                         AMY --
          His words die on his lips. Amy's eyes are clenched shut,
          her face drenched with sweat, her entire body trembling.
          Jerry .watches his horrified reaction, smiling.

                         JERRY

          Nothing much. I just bit her a
          little bit, that's all.
          Jerry just stares-at him silently, leaving no room for the
          boy to disbelieve him. Charley suddenly leaps for him,
          furious with rage.

                         CHARLEY
          You bastard!
          .Jerry casually knocks him aside, flinging him through the
          air against the far wall with his incredible strength.
          Charley crumples to the floor, stunned. Jerry walks over
          to him and drops a wooden stake at his feet.

          With a bow he lets himself out of the room, closing the
          door behind him. The key can be heard turning in the
          lack. Charley stares around for a moment, gathering his
          senses. He sees the window has been boarded up with plank
          after plank and nail after nail. It would be impossible
          for him to rip it apart, just as it would be impossible for
          anyone to-hear him through.it were he to scream.
          He crawls to Amy, gently turning her over only to see that
          she has already begun to change, her upper lip slipping
          back as he stares at her, revealing lengthening bicuspids,
          the beginnings of fangs. Her eyes are black, like bottom-
          less pits. He raises his head and screams, his voice 
          filled with anguish and despair.

                         CHARLEY
          No!

          Dandrige pauses halfway down the stairs, listening to the
          agony in Charley's voice as the scream dies away. He
          smiles, then continues to walk down the stairs.

          slowly toward the front door.

          stairs.

          coffin Charley saw them carrying into the house on that
          first night so long- ago. They pause in their work as they

          the shadows at the bottom of the stairs where Billy's body
          lies, his eyes glowing as they burn into the corpse for a
          moment before shifting back to Charley and Peter.
          He smiles at the boy.

                         JERRY
          Do you?
          He steps back into Amy's room, disappearing from sight.
          Peter looks at Charley.

          What did he mean?

                         PETER
          Nothing. He's just bluffing.
          Charley continues up the stairs-slowly, the cross held out
          in front of him, Peter hugging his back. Behind them, down
          at the foot of the stairs,,Billy slowly sits up. Peter and
          Charley continue climbing, their gazes fixed ahead. Behind
          them Billy stands and starts to walk up the stairs toward
          them, the first STEP he hits GROANING under his heavy
          weight.
          Charley and Peter freeze, turning to look back. They see
          the huge man coming up the stairs toward them, a thin trail
          of blood leaking from the bullet hole in his forehead.
          Peter whips his pistol out with trembling hands and UNLOADS
          THE ENTIRE REVOLVER into the man, casting a pale of
          gunsmoke in front of him and Charley, obscuring their view
          of the stairway below.
          Suddenly Billy Cole appears through the thick cloud, back-
          ing them up the stairs. Peter stumbles, falling backward,
          .unable to rise in time. Billy leans down, grabbing him and
          jerking him into the air like a ragdoll.,. about to fling him
          over the ballustrade to the floor far below.
          Charley suddenly leaps forward, slamming his stake into the
          creature's heart.

                         CHARLEY
          No!
          Billy Cole freezes, his eyes widening. Be drops Peter
          crashing to the steps and staggers back, grabbing the rail
          for support, hanging there below Peter and Charley for what
          seems an eternity, the stake protruding from his heart..
          As the two watch in horror, Cole's face slowly begins to
          dissolve, skin putrefying and slipping away, revealing the
          grinning skull beneath, the process of dissolution acceler-
          ating as the seconds tick past.
          Suddenly the legs turn to bone and.what remains of the
          body, no more than a skeleton in clothes now, tumbles
          backward down the stairs with a clatter, to land with a
          crash on the floor below, bones rolling in-every direction
          across the portico. They stare down the stairs at his
          remains.

                         CHARLEY

          Peter scrambles to his feet, he'and Charley backing
          hurriedly up the stairs, terrified by what they've seen.
          i 143 INT. AMY'S ROOM - NIGHT
           They rush into Amy's room, Peter stopping to stare at the 
          open window, left that way by Dandrige when he entered and
          left. Charley ignores it, hurrying to Amy, and kneeling by
          her side. He gently turns her over to expose lengthening
          bicuspids as Peter sticks his head out the window. Her
          irises are now more red than before, signaling the trans-
          ition she is making from the living to the walking dead.

          143A EXT. JERRY'S WINDOW - SIDE OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Peter glances down, searching for Jerry as above him,
          clinging flat to the wall like a fly, is Jerry. The vam-
          pire smiles, slowly drawing back his clawed hand to tear
          Peter's throat out when the man cranes his neck to look
          over his shoulder. He is just about to when Charley calls
          to him from the room within.

                         CHARLEY
          Peter!
           Peter ducks in just as Jerry's about to strike.

          143B INT. JERRY'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Charley looks up from Amy's-unconscious body at Peter.

                         CHARLEY
          She's worse. C'mon, we're running
          out of time --
          The two men rush out of the room.

          143C EXT. JERRY'S WINDOW - SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT

          The SUBJECTIVE CAMERA does a 180 degree turn, staring in
          through the window out the open door onto the balcony.
          Jerry.sees Peter and Charley standing out there, hears
          their voices.

                         CHARLEY

          They rush to the attic door, the two men disappearing up
          the dark stairs.

          145 INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

          They come up the staircase to find themselves enclosed in
          darkness. Peter pulls out a flashlight and flicks it on,
          shining it about the musty, filthy room. He pauses as rats
          scatter beneath the unexpected blaze.
          He continues to search with the flashlight, picking out the
          remains of a--ruined window at the far end, the glass shat-
          tered, the window itself flung wide open.

                         CHARLEY
          Well, he was here --
          The beam moves on, only to suddenly stop on a large chest
          shoved in a corner.

                         PETER
          There, his-coffin.
          Both of them approach, staring down at the long chest.
          Peter hands the flashlight to Charley, pulling a stake from
          his pocket, a hammer from his belt. He raises the stake in
          the air, the hammer ready. He nods at the coffin.

                         PETER
          Open i t.
          Charley throws his shoulder against the lid, heaving. The
          lid opens with a GROAN, Peter about to stab down only to
          find it empty.

                         CHARLEY
          (almost in despair)
           God' damn him. Where is he?

          The SUBJECTIVE CAMERA STARES in at them, then SLOWLY BE-
          GINS TO DRIFT up the side of the house toward the roof
          above.

          145B EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

          The CAMERA GOES UP onto the roof and down around the
          chimney to discover Jerry sitting there as though he's
          just alighted.

          Charley and Peter stare up at the beams overhead as dust
          trickles down, the THUD of Jerry landing above them on
          the roof still loud in their ears.

                         PETER
          Well, now we know where he is.

                         CHARLEY
          Yeah, but what's he doing up there?

          146 EXT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT

          Jerry sits on the roof, squatting there like some huge
          nocturnal bird of prey, his eyes closed, his lips moving
          in a whisper.

          147 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Amy lies on the floor, hardly moving now. Suddenly she
          groans and rolls over, throwing a hand over her face as
          though trying to ward off some particularly terrible night-
          mare.

          .148 EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

          Dandrige's face darkens even more in concentration.

                         JERRY
          Amy, awake, I command you to awake!

          149 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Amy's eyes slowly open. There's not a vestige of human
          life in them. She blinks and her eyes go completely red,
          glowing in the dark.
          Dandrige's voice fills her. mind like distant thunder.

                         JERRY'S VOICE
          Now show me how much you love me,
          Amy, kill them both!
          She rises and moves like a zombie messenger of death toward
          the door to the hallway and the attic above.

          149A INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

          Charley and Peter are still staring up at the attic ceil-
          ing above, the waiting becoming unendurable for Charley.

                         CHARLEY
          I'm going up there.
          He heads for the open window at the far end of the
          attic nearest the stairs.

          is already out the window.

          149B EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

          Charley climbs onto the roof, a cross in his hand, a stake
          in the other. The roof looks deserted, but hidden behind
          the chimney stands Jerry, waiting for the boy. Unaware of
          the danger., Charley reaches the chimney and stealthily be-
          gins to circle it, sensing danger, the cross and stake in
          hand. He suddenly reaches the side where last we saw Jerry
          only to find no one there. He stands there puzzled,
          looking about.

          Peter stands alone at the far end next to the coffin, ner-

                         PETER
          Where the hell is he?
          And in the window directly behind his back, Jerry rises up
          out of the dark, no more than a few feet away, only 'a thin
          pane of glass separating Peter from his clawed hand. He
          raises it to strike through the glass at Peter just as
          .Charley slides in the open window at the far end from the
          roof and sees Jerry in the window behind Peter.. He screams
          out.

                         CHARLEY
          Peter, behind you!
          Peter whirls, holding up his cross and as quickly as he
          appeared from the night, Jerry slips back into it, leaving
          Peter staring at the window, terrified at the close call as
          Charley reaches his' side.

          Peter nods numbly as a huge shadow rises up along the
          staircase wall at the far end of the attic behind them,
          a shadow that suggests Jerry is coming up the stairs
          from the floor below toward them.
          A STAIR CREAKS behind them and Charley and Peter whirl
          to see Amy step out of the stairwell. She looks incred-
          ibly beautiful as though somehow her moment with Dandrige
          has transformed her from virginal girl to a full grown
          woman, dripping with sensuality. Charley steps forward,
          about to rush into her arms.

          Charley looks at Amy as she clears the steps and turns to-
          ward them. Peter shines his flashlight into her face. The
          eyes glow red, the face lifeless, fangs, larger now than
          before, protruding.from her upper lip.

                         CHARLEY
          Oh, my God --
          Suddenly they hear Dandrige cruelly laughing at them from
          the floor below, laughing like this is the best joke he's
          ever heard..

                         CHARLEY
          He's downstairs now --
          Amy suddenly launches herself at Charley, seizing.him by
          the throat and throwing him to the floor, landing on top of
          him. He grabs her by the shoulders, holding her back as
          she tries to plunge her fangs into his neck. Peter steps
          up behind her, a stake raised in his hands, about to plunge
          it into her back.
          Charley screams up at him.

                         CHARLEY
          No!
          Peter shifts his grip on the stake, holding it like a club,
          and brings it slamming down on her back. She collapses un-
          conscious on top of Charley. He shoves her off, climbing
          to his feet, and turning toward the staircase to the floor
          below.

                         CHARLEY
          What?
          The CAMERA PASSES Jerry's bedroom window, catching a
          glimpse of Peter on the balcony just as he replies to
          Charley.

                         PETER
          I don't know. Just my nerves, I
          guess.

          151F INT. HOUSE - SECOND-FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT

          Behind Peter there is suddenly a POUNDING at the attic
          door. Its Amy, trying to get out. Peter stares wor-
          riedly at the attic door as the POUNDING from within be-
          comes more VIOLENT.
          Suddenly ALL THE CLOCKS on the wall below GO OFF, signaling
          that it's 6 a.m., dawn, time for Jerry to go to bed. 
          Peter takes his eyes off the clocks as the LAST CHIME DIES, 
          looking at Charley over the Balustrade.

                         PETER
          Keep searching for him. Se's got to
          be close. It's almost dawn.
          Charley heads back down the hallway toward the basement as
          above on the landing, Peter stares around, about to try
          another door when suddenly the huge stained glass window
          directly behind and above him bursts apart in an EXPLOSION
          OF SHATTERING GLASS and Jerry Dandrige plunges in from the
          outside, landing in a crouch before Peter.
          He rises as the. older man backs away.
          Charley rushes down the hail back into the portico, brought
          by the sound of the crash. He's about to start up the
          stairs when Dandrige turns and stares down at him.
          Charley ignores him, starting up the stairs. Peter speaks
          to him, never taking his gaze from Dandrige.

                         PETER
          Stay there, Charley --
          Charley freezes, staring up at the vampire and the man
          above, watching, waiting. Dandrige's gaze bores into
          Peter.

                         JERRY
          So. Just the two of us at last.

          He-takes a step for Peter. Peter whips out a cross,
          thrusting it at him. Dandrige stops, smiling at him.
          He starts for him again, Peter holding his ground, the
          cross thrust out in front of hiin.

                         PETER
          Back!

                         JERRY

                         (SMILING THINLY)
          You have to have faith for that
          to work, Mr. Vincent. Remember?
          Peter continues to hold his ground, the cross held up
          higher, staring defiantly back at Dandrige, refusing to
          drop his gaze. And then it happens: the vampire jerks to
          a halt, staring with slowly dawning fury at Peter, real-
          izing by whatever invisible force it is emanating from that
          cross that indeed Peter has recovered his faith. He stands
          there, stymied, snarling at the man.
          Peter peers over his shoulder, out the ruined window. On
          the horizon, the first pink tendrils of dawn are breaking.
          Now it's Peter's turn to smile as he shifts his gaze back
          to Dandrige.

                         PETER
          Look over your shoulder.
          Dandrige cranes his neck to see the rising dawn through the
          open window, the sun beginning to glint its golden rays
          even as he stares at it. He turns back to Peter, roaring
          with fury.

                         JERRY
          No!
          Peter picks up his stake and dives for the vampire,
          Dandrige is too quick for him.
          He throws himself off the landing, tucking his body into a 
          somersault as he hurls through the air toward the portico
          floor below, turning into a whirling ball of spinning flesh
          only to suddenly emerge- from it no longer a man, but now an
          enormous bat.
          The' bat straightens in midair above the portico and zooms
          down the hallway, smashing into Charley chest high, blowing
          him off his feet as his claws rake the boy, sending two
          bloody furrows down his chest as the bat whips past him and
          disappears down the hallway into the darkness.

          Peter recovers above, hurrying down the stairs to the
          portico below. He rushes to Charley's side, helping the
          badly shaken boy to his feet.

                         PETER
          Are you all right?

                         CHARLEY
          Yes.
          Amy begins POUNDING AT THE ATTIC DOOR. above again. The two
          men look up as it begins to splinter.

                         PETER
          Quick, he's in the basement.
          He helps the boy. down the hall, the two of them disappear-
          ing through the basement door. A second later the attic
          DOOR above RIPS FROM ITS HINGES, CRASHING to the floor.
          Amy steps out of the attic, her eyes sightless, a stake
          grasped in her hand.' She walks like an automaton down the
          stairway toward the portico below..

          152 INT. BASEMENT - DAWN

          Charley anaa$ Peter hurry down the stairs into the dark room,
          its windows covered with blackout drapes. The floor is a
          mass of antiques, row after row of them, many covered with
          dust cloths. Peter dives for the first one, ripping the
          cloth off only to discover an armoire. He rushes to the
          next one.

                         PETER
          Quick, his coffin has to be here

                         SOMEWHERE --
          They race down the aisle continuing to rip dust covers away
          only to discover a line of mirrors, several of them
          obviously removed from pieces in the house above. They
          stop, staring at them.

                         CHARLEY
          Well, now we know what he did with
          the mirrors --
          The DOOR to the stairway- CREAKS open behind them, lost
          somewhere in the dark. Peter whirls, looking back the way
          they just came.

          out.

                         CHARLEY
          But Charley has disappeared into the darkness before Peter
          can stop him.
          Charley appears down the row of antiques, stopping at the
          foot of the stairs and staring up at.the basement door
          above. It is partially open, allowing just a sliver of
          light into the darkness. He calls out, clutching his stake
          nervously.

                         CHARLEY
          Who's there --
          Amy appears out of the darkness behind him, slowly.
          approaching; her face deathly white, her lips blood red,
          her eyes almost glowing in the dark. He hears her at the
          last second, whirling to face her with a gasp. She reads
          the fear on his face and smiles sadly, reaching out a hand
          to him.

                         AMY
          Don't be frightened, Charley.
          She takes a step closer and he steps away. Amy stops,
          staring at him; then she slowly begins to advance on him,
          unbuttoning her blouse, her voi ce a husky, purring whisper.

                         AMY
          Charley, I love you --
          (he backs away; she
          keeps coming closer,
          exposing more and
          more of her body)
          What's wrong, Charley, don't you want
          me anymore?
          He suddenly breaks her spell, coming to his senses and
          whip ping out his cross, thrusting it. in her face. She
          whirls away with a snarl, burying her face in her hands,
          softly beginning to weep.

                         AMY
          It's not my fault, Charley. You
          promised you wouldn't let him get
          me, you promised.

          his side.

          and dives for his exposed throat. He whips the cross up,
          but'not in time, her forearm smashing into his wrist,
          sending the cross whirling away into the darkness. Amy
          straightens, smiling at him, the. huge fangs sparkling in
          the light from the open doorway above. -

          She begins to walk toward him, her sexual interest in
          Charley gone, replaced by mad, driving hunger.
          At the other end of the room, Peter desperately weaves his
          way among the pieces of furniture dotting the floor,
          looking for the coffin. He stops before a huge armoir,
          whips it d own to discover it empty, and is about to move on
          when he glances down. There, at the corner of the armoir,
          is a small hole with rats scurrying in and out. Realizing
          something must be behind the huge piece of furniture, he
          shoves it aside, toppling it CRASHING to the floor.
          A hidden alcove, more a dais than anything else, is
          revealed, a huge window at the back covered with a blackout
          curtain, and Jerry's ornate brassbound coffin sitting in
          the middle, covered with CHATTERING, crawling RATS.
          Peter stares at it, horrified, calling out into the
          darkness behind him.

                         PETER
          Charley, I found it --
          Back at the other end of the room, Charley is backing away
          from Amy as she slowly stalks him, the stake she picked up
          in the attic-in her hands. Charley yells back at Peter.

                         CHARLEY
          Get it open!
          She suddenly leaps for him, .stabbing with the stake only to
          miss him by inches, sending it plunging through the back of
          a chair with her growing strength, shattering it against
          the stone wall behind the chair. She turns on Charley,
          empty-handed now, continuing.to stalk him.
          Before-the dais, Peter stifles his revulsion of the rats
          and leaps forward, rushing to the side of the coffin and
          fumbling with the clasps only to discover they're locked.
          he cries out again..

                         PETER
          He'_s locked it somehow from the
          inside..
          He grabs a hammer from his pocket and starts pounding at
          the clasps, trying to free them while at the side of the
          room Charley continues to back away from Amy, calling back.

                         CHARLEY

                         HURRY --
          He goes to dodge Amy when she leaps forward, shoving a
          bureau across his path, blocking his escape. She smiles at
          him, continuing to back him into a corner.

          Back at the coffin, the clasp finally comes loose beneath
          Peter's pounding and he moves to the next one, smashing at
          it with the hammer desperately. Back at the side of the
          room, Charley dodges Amy, leaping over a pile of refuse in
          his desperation to escape, the girl vampire diving after
          him, her fingers clawing into his back and shredding his
          shirt as he twists out of her grasp.

          Back at the dais, Peter breaks the last clasp, throws the
          coffin lid open, sees Jerry resting beneath him, the king
          vampire's eyes closed.
          He fumbles a spare stake from his belt, pressing it to
          the creature's heart, about to slam it home with the
          hammer when suddenly behind him Charley crashes INTO VIEW
          on the floor, Amy fixed to his back, rising over his,
          struggling to sink her fangs in his neck. Peter whirls at
          the NOISE, momentarily distracted.
          In the coffin, Jerry's eyes snap open, fixing on Peter.
          With a snarl he sits right up in the coffin behind Peter,
          the man turning back only to find himself face to face with
          the enraged vampire. Jerry opens his mouth, about to kill
          him when Peter slams it home, missing his heart and
          impaling his shoulder.
          The old -actor falls back as the vampire rises out of his
          coffin, the stake protruding from his shoulder, Amy
          stopping in her struggle to kill Charley, both she and the
          boy staring.up at the huge vampire looming over all three.
          With superhuman deliberation, Dandrige pulls the stake
          from his chest and hurls it away. It smashes into a far
          wall, splintering a window, sending a thin ray of light
          into the room. Dandrige turns on Peter, his face con-
          vulsed with hatred. He leaps for him, smashing him into
          a wall, about to sink his fangs into Peter's neck as
          Charley watches.

          curtain covering the window at the back of the.dais. - She
          jumps after him, grabbing him just as his fingers close
          around the curtain. She pulls him to the floor, her mouth
          open, about to sink her fangs in him as the drape comes
          with him, tearing from the window and sending a huge bolt
          of sunlight streaming into the dank room.

          it hits Jerry Dandrige squarely in the back, whirling him
          away from Peter, picking him up and throwing him across the
          room, slamming him into the far wall, pinning him there
          several feet above the floor.
          He writhes in the golden beam, twisting this way and that,
          but unable to escape as his body slowly begins to smoulder,
          a million small fires breaking out all over him as begins

          the vampire's body suddenly EXPLODES in a whooshing ball of
          flame that incinerates him instantly, leaving nothing
          behind but the ECHOING SCREAM of a soul finally going to
          hell.

          room at Peter who sits beside the coffin, wiping Dandrige's.
          blood from his face and mouth with his handkerchief,
          nothing but silence in the room now, the sun shining mer-

          evening we met them. They break for a moment as Peter
          Vincent comes up on the screen.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         
          gr Rev. 11/25/84 103.

                          154 CONTINUED:

           PETER (V.0.)
          This is Peter Vincent, once more back
          with you as host of Fright Night. I
          thought I'd let the vampires rest for
          a little while.
          (winking into camera)
          Right, Charley?
          (back into his host

                         ROLE)
          Tonight the threat comes not from
          beyond the grave, but from beyond the
          stars as alien beings stalk an unwary
          summer camp in "MARS WANTS FLESH."

                         (PAUSE)
          I do not star in it.
          Amy turns back to Charley, the two of them staring at each
          other, obviously deeply in love. Then she slowly begins to
          undress. Smiling he rises, inadvertently turning to his
          window as he takes his shirt off, much as he did the first
          night. He freezes.
          There in Jerry's window, looking back at him, are a pair of
          red glowing eyes. Charley blinks. He looks at the window
          again. The eyes are gone...
          Behind him, Amy looks at him questioningly.

                         AMY
          Charley, is something wrong?
          With a quizzical shake of his head, Charley slams the
          window shut and turns to her.

                         CHARLEY
          No, nothing.
          He jumps into bed with her,, the two of them beginning to
          make- love as the CAMERA PANS off them to the window,
          pushing out through the window closing in on Jerry's window
          across the way. A pair of red eyes stand there in the
          darkness, staring and staring as the CAMERA MOVES CLOSER
          AND CLOSER. They blink; . they're for real; there is another
          vampire out there and he is watching Charley.

          FADE OUT.

                         THE END
FROM DUSK TILL DAWN

	FADE IN:

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

	A convenience store in a Texas Suburb. No other businesses
	surround it.

	CLOSE-UP: A light switch is flipped on.

	The sign on top of the store lights up. It reads: BENNY'S
	WORLD OF LIQUOR.

	TITLE CARD:

				BIG SPRING, TEXAS
			   109 MILES WEST OF ABILENE
			345 MILES EAST OF THE MEXICAN BORDER

	A Texas Ranger patrol car pulls into the parking lot and
	a real live Texas Ranger, EARL MCGRAW, steps out. McGraw is
	in full ranger uniform - button shirt, cowboy hat, boots,
	mirrored shades, tin star and a colt revolver on his hip.

	It's about an hour and a half before sundown and McGraw is
	off duty for the day.

	The only other car in the parking lot is a 1975 Plymouth


	INT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

	A young Hawaiian Shirt wearing man named PETE sits on a
	stool behind the counter.

	A few CLOSE-UP:STOMERS fiddle about.

	A MAN wearing a black suit, black tie, and wire rim
	glasses holds hands with a PRETTY BLONDE GIRL in cutoffs and
	bare feet. They look through magazines.

	Another black suit wearing MAN holds hands with a RED-HEADED
	GIRL in a prep school uniform. They look through the
	beer cooler in the back of the store. Both girls are around
	seventeen.

	MCGRAW enters the store.

				MCGRAW
		Hot goddamn day!

				PETE
		Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with
		the air conditioner blastin' all day
		long.

				MCGRAW
		Not even for lunch?

				PETE
		I'm by myself today, ate my lunch
		outta the microwave.

	McGraw walks over to the beer cooler, as if done ritually
	every night (it is), takes out a beer, pops it open and
	joins Pete by the front counter.

				MCGRAW
		Jesus Christ man, that microwave food
		will kill ya as quick as a bullet.
		Those burritos are only fit for a
		hippie high on weed. Pull me down a
		bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin'
		tanked tonight.

				PETE
		Whatsamatter?

				MCGRAW
			(sighs)
		Awww, it's just been a shitass day.
		Every inch of it hot and miserable.
		First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip
		got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid
		boy of hers was workin' the grill.
		That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit
		from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast
		at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a
		blanket like a sick dog by ten
		thirty.

				PETE
		Isn't there a law or something
		against retards serving food to the
		public?

				MCGRAW
		Well, if there ain't there sure oughta
		be. Who knows what goes on inside 
		Mongoloid's mind?

				PETE
		You could sue the shit out of her, ya
		know. That kid belongs under a circus
		tent, not flippin' burgers. You could
		own that fuckin' place.

				MCGRAW
		What the hell would I do with that
		grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got
		enough of a cross to bear just taking
		care of that potato head. Then all
		this Abilene shit happened. You
		heard about that bank robbery in
		Abilene, didn't ya?

				PETE
		That's all that's been on the box
		all day. They killed some people
		didn't they?

				MCGRAW
		Four Rangers, three cops, and two
		civilians. And they took a lady bank
		teller as a hostage.

	Pete doesn't say anything.

				MCGRAW
		They'll probably make a run for the
		border, which would bring 'em this
		way. And if we get our hands on
		those shit asses, we're talking
		payback time. We'll get 'em all right.
		I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your
		commode.

				PETE
		Knock yourself out.

	McGraw drops his last drip of beer, crushes the can and
	exits in the bathroom.

	The black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and,
	with the prep school girl in tow, walks rapidly toward Pete.
	We see that the girl is crying.

				BLACK SUITED MAN #1
			(to Pete)
		Do you think I'm fuckin' playing with
		you, asshole?
			(points to the tearful prep
			 school girl)
		Do you want this little girl to die?
			(pointing to the blonde with
			 the other guy)
		Or that little girl? Or your
		bosombuddy with the badge? Or
		yourself? I don't wanna do it, but
		I'll turn this fuckin' store into the
		Wild Bunch if I even think you're
		fuckin' with me.

	The two men in black suits are the notorious Abilene
	bank robbers, SETH and RICHARD GECKO, "The Gecko Brothers."
	And the other customers are all being held hostage. Seth
	is the one with the prep girl. Richard is the one with
	the blonde.

	Everybody speaks low and fast.

				PETE
		What do you want from me? I did what
		you said.

				SETH
		Letting him use your toilet? No store
		does that.

				PETE
		He comes in here every day and we
		bullshit. He's used my toilet a
		thousand times. If I told him no,
		he'd know something was up.

				SETH
		I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta
		here, in his car, and down the road or
		you can change the name of this
		place to "Benny's World of Blood."

	Richard, holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl,
	leans next to Seth's ear and whispers something. Seth looks
	at Pete.

				SETH
		Were you giving that pig signals?

				PETE
		What? Are you kidding? I didn't do
		anything!

	Richard whispers something else in Seth's ear.

				SETH
		He says you were scratching.

				PETE
		I wasn't scratching!

				SETH
		You callin' him a liar?

	Pete controls himself.

				PETE
		I'm not calling him a liar, okay? I'm
		simply saying that if I was
		scratching, and if I did scratch, it's
		not because I was signaling the cop,
		it's because I'm fuckin' scared
		shitless.

	Richard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to
	Seth.

				RICHARD
		The Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't
		I just go in there, blow his head off
		and get outta here.

				PETE
		Don't do that! Look, you asked me to
		act natural, and I'm acting as natural
		-- in fact, under the circumstances, I
		think I ought get a fuckin' Academy
		Award for how natural I'm acting. You
		asked me to get rid of him, I'm doing
		my best.

				SETH
		Yeah, well, your best better get a
		helluva lot fuckin' better, or you're
		gonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot
		worse.

	The toilet FLUSHES.

				SETH
		Everybody be cool.

	Everybody goes back to what they were doing.

	McGraw steps back out of the back. He appears to be unaware
	of the situation.

				MCGRAW
		Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at
		it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit
		in front of the box and just drink
		booze. How much is the bottle?

				PETE
		Six-fifty.

	Out of nowhere Richard WHIPS out his forty-five automatic
	and SHOOTS McGraw in the head.

	McGraw goes down screaming.

	Richard stands over him and SHOOTS him twice more.

	Seth charges forward.

				SETH
			(to Richard)
		What the fuck was that about?

				RICHARD
			(in a low monotone)
		He signaled the Ranger.

				PETE
			(hysterical)
		I didn't.
			(to Seth)
		You gotta believe me, I didn't.

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		When they were talkin', he mouthed
		the words "Help Us."

				PETE
		You fuckin' liar, I didn't say shit!

	Richard SHOOTS Pete and Pete falls down behind the counter.

	Seth grabs Richard and throws him up against the wall.

				SETH
		What the fuck is wrong with you --

				RICHARD
		Seth, he did it. You were by the beer
		cooler with your back turned. I was by
		the magazines, I could see his face.
		And I saw him mouth:

	Richard mouths the words, "Help Us."

	While Pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding
	from his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls
	out a gun from it.

	Seth releases his brother.

				SETH
		Start the car.

				RICHARD
		You believe me don't cha?

				SETH
		Shut up and start the car.

	Richard walks away from Seth and crosses the counter...

	...when Pete SPRINGS up, gun in hand, and SHOOTS Richard in
	the hand.

	Richard FALLS to his knees, howling.

	Both Pete and Seth SPRAY the store with gunfire.

	Seth DIVES down an aisle. He reloads.

	Pete DUCKS behind the counter. He reloads.

	Richard has crawled to safety behind an aisle.

	The two girls have run out screaming.


				SETH
			(yelling)
		Richie? You okay?

				RICHARD
			(yelling)
		I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot!
		I told you that bastard said, "Help
		us!"

				PETE
			(yelling)
		I never said help us!

				SETH
			(yelling)
		Well that don't matter now, 'cause
		you got about two fuckin' seconds
		to live! Richie!

				RICHARD
			(yelling)
		Yeah?

				SETH
			(yelling)
		When I count three, shoot out the
		bottles behind him!

				RICHARD
		Gotcha!

				SETH
		One... Two... Three.


	The two brothers start FIRING toward the counter.

	They HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete.

	Pete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol
	RAIN down on him.

	Seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf.

	Richard keeps FIRING.

	Seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on
	fire with his Zippo, then tosses it.

	The flaming roll of paper towels FLIES through the air.

	The fireball lands behind the counter.

	The entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Pete
	screams from behind the counter.

	Seth smiles to himself and stands.

	Richard shakes his head in amusement and stands.

	Pete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES
	still holding his weapon and FIRING.

	Seth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's.

	Pete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess
	Pastry display.

	Seth and Richard rise from the rubble.



	EXT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

	They exit the store squabbling. The store is bursting into
	flames.

				SETH
		What did I tell you? What did I tell
		you? Buy the road map and leave.

				RICHARD
		What am I supposed to do, Seth?
		He recognized us.

				SETH
		He didn't recognize shit.

	Both Seth and Richard stand on opposite sides of the car.

				RICHARD
		Seth, I'm telling you, the way he
		looked at us -- you especially --
		I knew he knew.


	They both climb in the car, Seth behind the wheel. Seth
	starts it op. The souped up engine ROARS to life. We can
	hear Seth mumbling under the motor.

				SETH
		Low profile. Do you know what the
		words "low profile" mean?

	CLOSE-UP: SETH'S FOOT PUNCHES GAS.

	The Plymouth tears out of the parking lot backwards, hits
	the street, and speeds off down the road.

	We CRANE UP HIGH to see the car leaving a trail of dust
	behind it, as the store burns out of control.

	OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE.

	Raunchy, honky-tonk MUSIC fills the theater.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. TEXAS PANHANDLE - DAY

	The Plymouth tears ass across Texas plains. As TITLES PLAY
	OVER, we see Seth and Richard enjoying their getaway/road
	trip. Seth behind the wheel, pops open a bottle of
	prescription pills, empties out four of the red capsules in
	his hand, pops them in his mouth, and washes it back with a
	slug of Jack Daniel's from a pint bottle.

	Richard looks at Seth through the hole in his hand. Like a
	boxer, Richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffer's tape.

	The camera leaves the boys, as they woosh down the street,
	and goes along the length of the car to the trunk. It hangs
	on the trunk. Then we see through the trunk, like Superman:

	AN OLDER WOMAN tied up and helpless in the trunk.

	The rest of the titles play over black as the song
	continues.

	CREDIT SEQUENCE ENDS

								  CUT TO:

	EXT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

	Emma and Pete's Gravy Train is a truck stop off of Highway
	290.

	SUBTITLE APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN':

		   FORT STOCKTON
		238 MILES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER


	INT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

	Emma and Pete's PATRONS are made up of regulars, truckers,
	cowboys and road-weary travelers. The CAMERA DOLLIES through
	the maze of tables, patrons, and waitresses.

	It stops when it gets to a table occupied by the FULLER
	FAMILY. The Fullers definitely fall into the road-weary
	category. The members of the unit consist of the father,
	JACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edges,
	and his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who
	possesses what can only be described as an apple pie
	sensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl,
	complete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's
	Vietnamese adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired kid
	who always wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy metal
	garage band he plays guitar for, "Precinct 13." The three
	of them are wolfing down a late lunch.

				JACOB
		We got about two more hours of day
		light left. That'll get us into
		El Paso, which is right next to the
		border. We'll stop at a motel --

				SCOTT
		Stop? We're not going to actually
		stop at a motel, are we?

	Scott and Kate speak together, obviously repeating something
	that Jacob has said about three hundred times.

				SCOTT AND KATE
		We've got a Winnebago. We don't need
		those over priced roach havens. We're
		self contained.

				JACOB
		Okay, Okay, maybe I was a little
		overzealous, but give me a break, I
		just bought it.

	Scott and Kate continue the impersonation.

				SCOTT
		Why, just look at all this. You got
		your kitchen --

				KATE
		-- you got your microwave --

				SCOTT
		-- you got your sink --

				KATE
		-- you got your shower --

				SCOTT
		-- see this, television!

				KATE
		Feel this, real wood paneling. That's
		real wood, too, not that fake stuff.

				JACOB
		Unless you two wiseacres wanna be
		introduced to the joys of hitchhiking,
		what say we drop this?

				SCOTT
			(to Kate)
		The truth hurts.

				KATE
			(to Scott)
		It's the bitterest of pills.

				JACOB
		You two ought to start a stand-up
		act, because you're just wasting your
		humor on me.

				KATE
		Ain't it the truth.

				SCOTT
		Why do you want to stop?

				JACOB
		I'm exhausted.

				SCOTT
		Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us
		into Mexico.

	Jacob gives Scott a look that says, "You aren't touching my
	new motor home."

				JACOB
		I just bet you would. Don't even thin
		about it. Besides, I want to have one
		night's sleep in an
		honest-to-goodness bed. The beds in
		the home are okay, but they're not
		like a real bed.

				KATE
		Hey, if we go to a motel, we can
		swim.

				SCOTT
		I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to
		the bathroom.

	Scott gets up from the table and walks out back to the
	restroom.

	Jacob and Kate are left alone. There's an awkward moment of
	silence before...

				KATE
		Dad, when I called the machine to
		check our messages there was one from
		Bethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he
		wouldn't permanently replace you until
		we came back. He said when we come
		home, if you still feel the same
		way --

				JACOB
		That's very nice of Ted, but I'll
		call him tomorrow and tell him not
		to bother waiting.

				KATE
		I didn't want to talk about this in
		front of Scott because he gets upset.
		But you don't believe in God
		anymore?

				JACOB
		Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I
		know this is hard on you kids. After
		Jenny's death, this is probably the
		last thing you need. But I can't do
		it any longer. My congregation needs
		spiritual leadership. Well, they can't
		get that from me anymore. My faith is
		gone. To answer your question, yes,
		I do believe in Jesus. But do I love
		them? No. After Jenny died, I just
		thought, what's the point?

				KATE
			(pushing him)
		It's just, all our lives you've been
		a pastor. For twenty years you've
		preached trust in the lord. And then
		one day you wake up and say fuck him?

				JACOB
		I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not
		connected anymore.

				KATE
		That happens, you'll get it back.

				JACOB
		Kate, give your old man a little
		credit. Every person who chooses the
		service of God as their life's work
		has something in common. I don't care
		if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun,
		a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many,
		many times during your life you'll
		look at your reflection in the mirror
		and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've
		all done it. I'm not going through a
		lapse. What I've experienced is closer
		to awakening. I'm not trying to shake
		your faith. I've just decided not to
		devote my life to God anymore.

				KATE
		What do you think Mom would say?

				JACOB
		Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

								  CUT TO:

	CLOSE UP: COUNTER BELL. A hand slams down on it. RING.


	INT. LOBBY - DEW DROP INN - DAY

	Seth stands at the front desk of the Dew Drop Inn. A
	standard issue Texas motel. Richard sits outside in the car.
	Nobody responds to the bell. Seth BANGS it impatiently five
	times.

				TEXAS VOICE (O.S.)
		Hold your horses!

	An OLD-TIMER walks through a curtain behind the counter.
	He's eating a BBQ rib.

				OLD-TIMER
			(rough)
		Whatcha want?

				SETH
		Whatcha think I want, ya mean old
		bastard? I wanna room.


	EXT. COURTYARD - DEW DROP INN - DAY

	Richard sits in the car listening to Merle Haggard on the
	radio. He watches from his perspective, Seth taking the
	walking outside and getting in the car. Seth starts it up,
	and drives them to their room.

				RICHARD
		Do they have cable?

				SETH
		No.

				RICHARD
		Do they have an X-rated channel?

				SETH
		No.

				RICHARD
		Do they have a waterbed?

				SETH
		They don't have anything except four
		walls and a roof, and that's all we
		need.

	Their car drives up to room #9, but they park backing up the
	trunk close to the door.

	The two brothers get out of the car.

				SETH
			(tossing Richie the motel keys)
		Open the door. We gotta do this fast.

	Richie opens the door.

	Seth goes to the trunk, looks around the court yard. It's
	empty.

	CLOSE UP: KEY going into the trunk lock, turning.

	TRUNK POV: Seth looking into the camera.

	SETH'S POV: A WOMAN in her late forties is lying scrunched
		up in the trunk.

	She is the HOSTAGE BANK TELLER from Abilene. She's stiff,
	scared and looks an absolute mess.

				SETH
		Don't say a word.

	The two brothers, quick as lightening, yank the woman out of
	the trunk and whisk her into the motel room. SETH closes the
	trunk, looks around for any Johnny eye-witnesses, doesn't
	see any, slams the door.


	INT. SETH AND RICHARD'S ROOM - DAY

	Seth turns from the door, sees the hostage woman standing.

				SETH
		You. Plant yourself in that chair.

	She sits down in the chair.

				HOSTAGE
		What are you planning on doing with --

				SETH
		-- I said plant yourself. Plants don't
		talk. You wanna get on my good side?
		Just sit still and don't make a peep.

	She shuts up.

	Richard slowly takes off his jacket. He winces from his
	wound.

				SETH
		Let me help you.

	He helps him get his jacket off.

				SETH
		How's it feel?

				RICHARD
		How ya think, it hurts like a
		son-of-a-bitch.

	Richie goes over to the bed and lies down on it. Seth takes
	the pillow and stacks them for Richie to prop his back up
	against.

				SETH
		I got both rooms on either side of us,
		so we don't gotta worry about
		eavesdropping assholes. How's that
		feel? You okay?

				RICHARD
		Feels good.

				SETH
		I'm gonna go get the money.

	Seth goes into the car, takes out a big suitcase. He scans
	the perimeter with his eyes, goes back inside.


	INT. MOTEL ROOM #9 - DAY

	Seth comes back in, lays the suitcase on the bed. Richie has
	the TV remote control in his hand and he's flipping
	stations. Seth looks at his watch.

				SETH
		It's about five o'clock.
			(to hostage)
		What time does it get dark around
		here?

				HOSTAGE
		About seven.

				SETH
		Good. I'm going towards the border to
		check things out while it's still
		daylight. Call Carlos and arrange the
		rendezvous.

				RICHARD
		Hey, when you talk to him, see if you
		can arrange a better deal than thirty
		percent.

				SETH
		That's their standard deal, brother.
		They ain't about to change it for us.

				RICHARD
		Did you even to try to negotiate?

				SETH
		These guys ain't spic fire cracker
		salesman from Tijuana. They don't even
		know the meaning of the word "barter".
		You wanna stay in El Ray? You give
		them thirty percent of your loot. It's
		scripture. So it is written, so shall
		it be done. You want sanctuary, you
		pay the price, and the price is thirty
		percent.

				RICHARD
		All I'm saying --

				SETH
		-- This conversation is over.

	Richie shrugs and turns back to TV, Seth turns to the
	hostage, grabs a chair and slides it up in front of her.

				SETH
		Now, we need to have a talk. What's
		your name?

				HOSTAGE
		Gloria.

	He shakes her hand.

				SETH
		Hello, Gloria, I'm Seth and that's my
		brother Richie. Let's cut to the
		chase. I'm gonna ask you a question
		and all I want is a yes or no answer.
		Do you want to live through this?

				GLORIA
		Yes.

				SETH
		Good. Then let me explain the house
		rules. Follow the rules, we'll get
		along like a house on fire. Rule number
		one: No noise, no question. You make a
		noise...
			(he holds up his .45)
		...Mr. 45 makes a noise. You ask a
		question, Mr. 45 answers it. Now are
		you absolutely, positively clear about
		rule number one?

				GLORIA
		Yes.

				SETH
		Rule number two: You do what we say,
		when we say it. If you don't, see rule
		number one.

	Seth takes the .45, places the barrel next to the woman's
	cheek. She squirms and shuts her eyes. He pulls back the
	hammer.

				SETH
		Rule number three: Don't you ever try
		and fuckin' run on us. 'Cause I got
		five little friends, and they all run
		faster 'n you can. Got it?

	She nods her head yes.

	He takes the gun away and replaces the hammer.

				SETH
		Open your eyes.

	She does.

				SETH
		Gloria, you hang in there, follow the
		rules, and don't fuck with us, you'll
		get out of this alive. I give you my
		word. Okay?

	She nods her head yes.

	Seth rises.

				SETH
		I'll be back in a bit.

	He exits.

	Richard looks to the TV, then looks to Gloria sitting
	across the room in the chair.


				RICHARD
		Wanna come up here on the bed and
		watch TV with me?


	You can tell she doesn't want to.

	He pats the empty space next to him.

				RICHARD
		Come on.

	She gets out of her chair, walks across the bed, and sits
	next to him.


	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

	A phone booth outside of a gas station. Seth is in the
	middle of a conversation with the party on the other end.

				SETH
		Things are real hot here. Crossing's
		gonna be a bitch.
			(pause)
		Don't worry, we'll get across. But
		when we do, where do we go?
			(pause)
		Can we make it as close to the border
		as possible? Texas wants our balls.
		The quicker we're in your protection,
		the better I'll feel.
			(pause)
		Okay, where?
			(pause)
		The Titty Twister?
			(he laughs)
		I love it already. Okay, Carlos, I'll
		see you and your men at the "Titty
		Twister" tomorrow morning.
			(pause)
		Bye, my friend.

	Seth hangs up the phone, lights up a cigarette with his
	Zippo lighter and exits frame. After Seth exits, leaving
	the frame empty, a subtitle appears:

	INT. SETH AND RICHARD'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Richard lies on the bed by himself, propped up by pillows,
	watching TV, taking on hits from a water bong in the
	shape of a wizard.

	ON TV

	A local newscaster named KELLY HOUGE is reporting a story
	about the brothers.

				KELLY HOUGE

	VIDEO INTERVIEW

	Kelly Houge interviewing STANLEY CHASE of the FBI.

				STANLEY CHASE
		For the time being we are very
		confident we will apprehend the
		fugitives in the next forty-eight
		hours. The Bureau, local law
		enforcement and the Texas Rangers
		have all joined forces in forming a
		dragnet to snare Seth and Richard
		Gecko.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Agent Chase, does it appear that they
		are heading for Mexico.

				STANLEY CHASE
		Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already
		alerted the Mexican authorities. They
		intend to cooperate every way possible
		in bringing these fugitives to
		justice.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Are you optimistic about the safety of
		the hostage they took in Abilene,
		Gloria Hill?

				STANLEY CHASE
		We've received no news one way or the
		other. We can only hope for the best.

				KELLY HOUGE
		What about the report from an
		eyewitness at the liquor store who
		said one of the brothers was shot?

				STANLEY CHASE
		This can't be confirmed at this time,
		but we do believe it to be true. We
		have reason to believe it was the
		youngest brother Richard, and he was
		shot in the vicinity of his neck and
		shoulders by the store's clerk.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Is it safe to assume that because the
		death count involved and the loss of
		life of law enforcement officers, that
		the Bureau, the Rangers and the police
		force are taking this manhunt
		personally?

				STANLEY CHASE
		I would say that's a very safe
		assumption.

								  CUT TO:

	RICHARD SMILES.

				RICHARD
			(Newscaster's voice)
		Is it safe to assume since the law
		enforcement authorities in the great
		state of Texas are homosexuals of a
		sick and deviate nature, that they
		will be too busy fucking each other
		up the ass to actually catch The
		Gecko Brothers?
			(in an FBI voice)
		I would say that's a very safe
		assumption.

	He changes a channel on the television. We see a Casper the
	Friendly Ghost cartoon on the screen.

				CASPER
		Would you play with me?

	A big burly COP turns around.

				COP
		Sure, little boy... A GHOST!!!

	The cop heads for the hills. Casper cries.

	Seth enters the room carrying a six pack of beer and two
	take-out bags of Big Kahuna burgers.

				RICHARD
		Shit, I started to get worried. Where
		the fuck ya been?

				SETH
		Sight seein'.

				RICHARD
		What'd ya see?

				SETH
		Cops.

				RICHARD
		Didya look at the border?

	Seth dumps the burgers on the bed. Both men pop open beers
	and Richard goes to town on a hamburger. Seth flips off
	the TV

				SETH
		Yeah, I saw the border. Through
		binoculars from on top of a high
		building. That's about as close as I
		risked getting. What's the TV say?

				RICHARD
		They're going to apprehend us in
		forty-eight hours.

	Seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		I gotta figure a way to get across
		that goddamn border. Longer we fuck
		around El Paso our lives ain't worth
		a shit.

				RICHARD
		Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig
		in and wait for things to cool down.

				SETH
		Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin'
		worse before it gets any fuckin'
		better. We showed our ass in Texas. We
		killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They
		ain't gonna stop lookin' till they
		find us, and when they find us,
		they're gonna kill us. Texans take it
		very personal when ya kill their law
		enforcement officers. The El Paso
		police have already started a motel
		and hotel search for us.

				RICHARD
		How do you know?

				SETH
		I heard it on the radio. We gotta get
		our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos
		is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a
		rendezvous on the other side, then
		Carlos and his boys will escort us to
		El Ray and --

	Seth stops talking and looks around.

				SETH
		Where's the woman?

				RICHARD
		What?

	Seth's out of his chair.

				SETH
		What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin'
		woman, the hostage. Where the fuck
		is she, Richard!?

				RICHARD
		She's in the other room.

				SETH
		What the fuck is she doin' there?!

	He goes to the door of the adjoining room.

				RICHARD
		Seth, before you open the door, let
		me explain what happened.

	Seth stops and looks at his brother. He knows what he means.
	He can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling.
	Then he BURSTS open the door.

	The dead, naked body of Gloria Hill lies on the bed. It's
	obvious Richard raped her and killed her.

	Seth covers his eyes with his hands. He slowly enters the
	room with the dead body.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you?

	Richard rises from the bed.

				RICHARD
		Now, Seth, before you flip out, let me
		just explain what happened.

	Seth slowly turns to his brother, then walks toward him.

	Richard backs up.

				SETH
		Yeah, explain it to me. I need an
		explanation. What's the matter with
		you?

				RICHARD
			(low and calm)
		There's nothing wrong with me,
		brother. That woman tried to escape
		and I did what I had to do.

				SETH
		No.
			(pause)
		That woman wouldn't of said shit if
		she had a mouthful.

				RICHARD
		Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
		wrong, wrong! Once you left, she
		became a whole different person.

				SETH
			(slowly approaching)
		Is it me? Is it my fault?

				RICHARD
		It's not your fault, it's her fault!

	Seth grabs Richard and THROWS him in the corner of the room,
	holding tightly to his wrist.

				SETH
		Is this my fault? Do you think this
		is what I am?

				RICHARD
		What?

				SETH
		This is not me! I am a professional
		fucking thief. I steal money. You try
		to stop me, god help you. But I don't
		kill people I don't have to, and I
		don't rape women. What you doin' ain't
		how it's done. Do you understand?

				RICHARD
		Seth, if you were me --

				SETH
		Just say yes! Nothing else, just say
		yes.

				RICHARD
		Yes.

				SETH
		Yes, Seth, I understand.

				RICHARD
		Yes, Seth, I understand.

	Seth hugs his little brother. Tight.

				SETH
			(whispers in Richie's ear)
		We get into Mexico, it's gonna be
		sweet Rosemary, hundred-proof liquor,
		and rice and beans. None of this
		shit's gonna matter.


	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

	Scott and Kate are in the front seat of their parked motor
	home. The motor home's parked in front of the Dew Drop
	Inn's front office. We see Jacob inside getting a room from
	the Old-Timer.

				KATE
		I can't believe he's stopping here.
		This place looks totally cruddy.

	Jacob walks out of the office. Kate yells from the motor
	home.

				KATE
		Dad, why are we stopping here?

	He opens the meter home door and climbs in.

				JACOB
		There's nothing wrong with this
		place.

				KATE
		It's a flop house.

				JACOB
		It's not a flop house. It's basic
		and simple. That doesn't make it a
		flop house.

				KATE
		If it doesn't have a pool, we're
		looking for a new place.

	Starting the huge car and slowly maneuvering it through the
	courtyard.

				JACOB
		It has a bed. That's all I care about.

				KATE
		Other places have beds, they also have
		cable TV, a gym, room service...


	EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

	Seth walks out of room #9 with a beer in his hand. He's
	thinking about how he's going to get over the border
	tonight. Lost in thought, he steps out in the path of the
	Fuller's motor home.

	Jacob slams on the brakes. Seth jumps back, startled. Both
	Kate and Scott are TOSSED out of their seats onto the floor.
	THUD... THUD...

				KATE
		Owww, my head.

	Jacob (pissed) honks his horn at Seth and yells out the
	window.

				JACOB
		Watch where you're going!

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD

	Seth just stands right in their way without moving, gazing
	up at the giant motor home.

	JACOB BEHIND THE WHEEL

	Kate and Scott join him up front looking at this weirdo.

				SCOTT
		What's this guy's problem?

				JACOB
		I have no idea.

	Seth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to
	move. Not threatening, just looking at them.

	HONK!

				JACOB
		Anytime, man.

	The horn snaps Seth back to this world. A smile breaks out
	on the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one
	side to let them pass.

	Pass they do!

				KATE
		Creepy guy.

	SETH

	The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's
	just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed
	unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the
	border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into
	room #9.


	INT. FULLERS' MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

	The Fullers are in room #12. It's identical to the one that
	the Gecko boys are in, except that the paintings above the
	beds are different. Jacob has fallen asleep in his clothes
	on the bed.

	Scott sits in a chair, headphones on, playing an unplugged
	electric guitar. Kate is nowhere in sight.

	KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK... on the door. Scott doesn't hear
	shit but his music. Jacob stirs a bit, but doesn't wake up.
	POUND... POUND... POUND... on the door. Jacob SPRINGS UP.
	He looks over at Scott, who, lost in guitar heaven, is
	oblivious of the knocker, then to the door.

				JACOB
			(yelling)
		What?

	From the other side of the door comes a friendly voice.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		I'm your neighbor in room 9, I hate to
		disturb you, but I'd like to ask a favor.

	Jacob swings his feet to the floor, stands up and walks to
	the door. As he passes Scott, he says, in his direction --

				JACOB
		I hope none of this is disturbing you.

	Scott can't hear him, but when he sees his dad look at him,
	he smiles.

	Jacob opens the door and sees...

	... Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the
	nicest guy in the entire world.

				RICHARD
		Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name is
		Don Cornelius. No, not the Don
		Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my
		lady friend need some ice and we don't
		seem to have an ice bucket. Could we
		possibly borrow yours? I'll bring it
		right back.

				JACOB
			(still partially asleep)
		Sure.

	We follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel
	ice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a
	couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks.

	He sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door
	closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him.

				JACOB
		What is this?

	Seth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground.

				SETH
		It's called a punch.

	Scott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him
	and instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's
	mouth.

				RICHARD
		Sit down.

	Scott lowers himself back down onto his seat.

				RICHARD
		Good boy.

	Jacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from
	his lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him.

				SETH
			(to Jacob)
		What's your name?

				JACOB
		Jacob.

				SETH
		Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass
		down on the bed. Make a wrong move and
		I'll shoot you in the face.

	Jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed.

				SETH
			(to Richard)
		Okay, move the Jap over there.

	Keeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise...

				RICHARD
		Upsy daisy.

	...guiding him over to the bed by his father.

	Richard removes the gun from Scott's mouth and stands next
	to his brother, looking down at their two hostages.

				SETH
			(to his hostages)
		What's the story with you two? You a
		couple of fags?

				JACOB
		He's my son.

				SETH
		How does that happen? You don't look
		Japanese.

				JACOB
		Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.

				SETH
		Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.

				JACOB
		What's this about, money?

				SETH
		It's about money, all right, but not
		yours. You see, me and my brother here
		are in a little hot water and we need
		your assistance.

	The door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad
	Kate walks in.

	The brothers spin their guns in her direction.

	Kate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet
	and move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun
	ready to spit.

				SETH
			(to Scott and Jacob)
		Stop!

	Jacob and Scott freeze.

	Richard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and
	positioning himself behind the terrified Kate.

				KATE
		What's going on?

				RICHARD
		We're having a wet bikini contest,
		and you just won.

				JACOB
			(to Kate)
		It's okay, honey. Everything's going
		to be all right.

				SETH
		Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't
		do nothin' stupid.
			(he turns to Jacob and Scott,
			 who are still standing)
		You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!

	They slowly sit.

	Richard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate.

	Both Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Both
	for their own reasons.

				SETH
			(to Jacob)
		Where are the keys to the motor home?

				JACOB
		On the dresser.

				SETH
		Richie, take the keys. Start that big
		bastard up, and drive it up front.

	Richard doesn't move from his position behind Kate. Kate
	feels his eyes on her. She slowly turns and looks at him.

	He looks in her face.

	CLOSE-UP KATE
		
	She smiles at him.

				KATE
		Richie, will you do me a favor and eat
		my pussy?

	CLOSE-UP RICHARD
		
				RICHARD
		Sure.


				SETH (O.S.)
		Richard!

	Richard's eyes go to Seth.

	Everybody is where they were. Kate never turned around.

				SETH
		Not when you get around to it, now.

	Without saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the
	room.

				SETH
			(pointing at Kate)
		You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and
		put on some clothes.

	She grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the
	bathroom.

	Seth GRABS her wrist.

				SETH
		You got three minutes. One second
		longer, I shoot your father in the
		face. Do you understand what I just
		said?

				KATE
		Yes.

				SETH
		Do you believe me?

				KATE
		Yes.

				SETH
		You damn well better. Go.

	She goes into the bathroom.

				JACOB
		Look, if you want the motor home, just
		take it and get out.

	Seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male
	hostages.

				SETH
		Sorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that
		easy.

	We hear the motor home "HONK" twice outside.

				SETH
		Get ready to move out, we're all going
		on a little ride.

	Jacob shakes his head "no."

				JACOB
		Not a chance.

				SETH
		Come again?

				JACOB
		If you're taking people, take me. But
		my kids aren't going anywhere with
		you.

				SETH
		Sorry, I need everybody.

				JACOB
		My children are not going with you,
		and that's that.

				SETH
			(angry)
		That's not fuckin' that...
			(holds up his gun)
		this is fuckin' this.
			(he calms down and looks
			 at Scott)
		Go sit over there.

	Scott gets up and walks to the other side of the room,
	leaving the two men alone. Seth speaks in a quiet,
	conversational tone.

				SETH
		I ain't got time to fuck around with
		you, so I'll make this simple. Take
		your kids and get in the car, or I'll
		execute all three of you right now.
			(he cocks the gun and puts
			 it right in Jacob's face)
		What's it gonna be, yes or no answer?

	Jacob looks at him.

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Good.
			(to Scott)
		Your old man's all right, he just
		saved your life.

	Seth BANGS on the bathroom door.

				SETH
		Times up, Princess.

	The bathroom door opens. Kate stands there, wearing a
	T-shirt, jeans and bare feet.

				SETH
		Okay, ramblers, let's get to rambling.

		Where are you taking us?

				KATE

	He doesn't smile.

	In the front part of the motor home, Jacob sits behind the

	calmly.

	Seth comes to a snapshot of Jacob and his wife.

				SETH
		Who's this?

				JACOB
		My wife.

				SETH
		Where is the little lady?

				JACOB
		In heaven.

				SETH
		She's dead?

				JACOB
		Yes, she is.

				SETH
		How'd she die?

				JACOB
		Auto wreck.

				SETH
		Come on, gimme some more details.
		How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk
		kill her?

				JACOB
		No. It was a rainy night, the brakes
		on the car weren't great. She had to
		stop suddenly. She slid on the road,
		she crashed, she died.

				SETH
		Died instantly?

				JACOB
		Not quite. She was trapped in the
		wreck for about six hours before she
		passed on.

				SETH
		Whewww! Those acts of God really stick
		it in and break it off, don't they?

				JACOB
		Yes, they do.

	Seth looks back at the wallet. He sees Jacob's minister's
	license.

				SETH
		Is this real?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		I've seen one of these before. A
		friend of mine had himself declared
		a minister of his own religion. Away
		to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're
		doing, or are you the real McCoy?

				JACOB
		Real McCoy.

				SETH
		You're a preacher?

				JACOB
		I was a minister.

				SETH
		Was? As in not anymore?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Why'd ya quit?

				JACOB
		I think I've gotten about as up close
		and personal with you as I'm gonna
		get. Now if you need me like I think
		you need me, you're not gonna kill me
		'cause I won't answer your stupid,
		prying questions. So, with all due
		respect, mind your own business.

				SETH
		I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't
		be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this
		friendly. But you're right, enough
		with the getting to know you shit.
		Now, there's two ways we can play this
		hand. One way is me and you go round
		an' round all fuckin' night. The other
		way, is we reach some sort of an
		understanding. Now, if we go down that
		first path at the end of the day, I'll
		win. But we go down the second, we'll
		both win. Now, I don't give a rat's
		ass about you or your fuckin' family.
		Y'all can live forever or die this
		second and I don't care which. The
		only things I do care about are me
		that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and
		our money. And right now I need to get
		those three things into Mexico. Now,
		stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it
		you don't give a shit about seeing me
		and my brother receiving justice, or
		the bank getting its money back. Right
		now all you care about is the safety
		of your daughter, your son and
		possibly yourself. Am I correct?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		I thought so. You help us get across
		the border without incident, stay with
		us the rest of the night without
		trying anything funny, and in the
		morning we'll let you and your family
		go. That way everybody gets what they
		want. You and your kids get out of
		this alive and we get into Mexico.
		Everybody's happy.

				JACOB
		How do I know you'll keep your word?

				SETH
		Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with
		this shit.

				JACOB
		You want me to sit here and be
		passive. The only way being passive in
		this situation makes sense is if I
		believe you'll let us go. I'm not
		there yet. You have to convince me
		you're telling the truth.

				SETH
		Look, dickhead, the only thing you
		need to be convinced about is that
		you're stuck in a situation with a
		coupla real mean motor scooters. I
		don't wanna hafta worry about you all
		fuckin' night. And I don't think you
		wanna be worrying about my brother's
		intentions toward your daughter all
		night. You notice the way he looked
		at her, didn't ya?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Didn't like it, did ya?

				JACOB
		No, I didn't.

				SETH
		Didn't think so. So, as I was saying,
		I'm willing to make a deal. You
		behave, get us into Mexico, and don't
		try to escape. I'll keep my brother
		off your daughter and let you all
		loose in the morning.

				JACOB
		You won't let him touch her?

				SETH
		I can handle Richie, don't worry.

	The two men look at each other for some measure of trust.
	Seth sticks out his hand.

				SETH
		I give you my word.

	Seth can't help but think about the last time he gave his
	word.

				SETH
			(hand sticks out)
		My words, my law. Better you not take
		it, and that's just where we are,
		then take it and not mean it.

	Jacob takes his hand, but looks right into Seth.

				JACOB
		If he touches her, I'll kill him. I
		don't give a fuck how many guns you
		have, nothing will stop me from
		killing him.

				SETH
		Fair enough. You break your word, I'll
		kill all of you.
			(calling to the back)
		Kate, honey!

				KATE
		Yeah.

				SETH
		You must have a bible in here, don't
		cha?

				KATE
		Yeah, we got a bible.

				SETH
		Get it and bring it up here, will
		ya, please?

	Kate goes into a drawer, pulls out a bible and brings it up
	front.

				SETH
		Hold it right there, sweetie pie.
			(to Jacob)
		Put your hand on it.

	Jacob does.

				SETH
		Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't
		try to escape and you'll get us across
		the border.

				JACOB
		I swear to God I won't try to escape
		and I'll do my best to get you into
		Mexico.

				SETH
		You best better get it done, Pops.

	Seth places his hand on the Bible.

				SETH
		I swear to God I'll let you loose in the
		morning. And your daughter will be safe. And I
		also swear if you do anything to fuck me up,
		I'll slit all your throats.

				RICHARD
		Did ya mean what you said back there?

	Kate turns to him.

				KATE
		What?

				RICHARD
		In the room. Were you serious, or were
		you just foolin' around? I'm just
		bringing it up, 'cause if you really
		want me to do that for you, I will.

				KATE
		Do what?

				RICHARD
			(in a whisper)
		What you said to me in the room.

				KATE
			(whispers back)
		What did I say?

				RICHARD
			(whisper)
		You asked me if I would --

				SETH (O.S.)
		Richard!

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		What?

	Seth and Jacob.

				SETH
		I told you to watch those kids, I didn't say
		talk to 'em. You guys ain't got nothin' to say
		to one another. So cut the chatter.

	Richard turns to Kate.

				RICHARD
			(quiet)
		We'll talk later.

	Kate still hasn't a clue what he means.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. THE MEXICAN BORDER - NIGHT

	Automobiles are lined up, waiting one by one to go into
	Mexico. Cop cars with their red and blue lights flashing
	are all over the place. Border Patrol men and Police are
	stopping all cars. Pulling up to the end of the line is the
	Fuller's mobile home.


	INT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

	Jacob at the wheel, Seth in the passenger seat. Seth jumps
	up and goes into action.

				SETH
		Okay everybody, it's show time.
		Richie, take Kate in the bathroom.

	Richard grabs the terrified Kate and drags her in the bathroom,

				SETH
		Scott, you come up front with your
		daddy.

	Scott does. Seth, keeping low, gets behind Jacob.

				JACOB
		I'm telling you, don't hurt her.

				SETH
		As long as you're cool, she'll be
		cool. What're ya gonna say?

				JACOB
		I don't have the slightest idea.

				SETH
		Well, you just keep thinkin' of that
		gun next to Kate's temple.

	Seth disappears into the bathroom with Kate and Richard,
	closing the door behind him.

	Father and son are alone for the first time since this whole
	thing began.

				SCOTT
		What are you gonna do?

				JACOB
		I'm gonna try and get us across the
		border.

				SCOTT
		No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that
		they're back there.

	Jacob is surprised to hear Scott say this.


	INT. BATHROOM - MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

	The bathroom, which consists of a shower, a toilet and a
	small sink, is a tight fit with three people in it.

	Richard has his back against the wall, with his arm around
	Kate, holding her in front of him. One hand is over her
	mouth, the other holds a .45 against her head.

	Kate's eyes are wide with fear.

	Seth stands, .45 in hand, ready to fire if the wrong person
	should open the door.

	Everybody talks low and quiet.

				RICHARD
		This isn't gonna work.

				SETH
		Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,

				RICHARD
		I just want to go on record as saying
		this is a bad idea.

				SETH
		Duly noted. Now, shut up.

	Everyone's quiet for a second, till Richard breaks it.

				RICHARD
			(to himself)
		They're gonna search the van.

				SETH
			(offhand)
		As long as you don't act like a
		fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.

				RICHARD
		What does that mean?

				SETH
			(distracted)
		What?

	Richard lets Kate go, she quickly moves to the side.

				RICHARD
		You just called me a fuckin' nut.

				SETH
		No, I didn't.

				RICHARD
		Yes, you did. You said as long as I
		don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying
		that I've been acting like a fuckin'
		nut.

				SETH
		Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay
		cool.

				RICHARD
		You meant that, but you meant the
		other, too.

	Kate can't believe what she's watching. Neither can Seth.

				SETH
			(serious as a heart attack)
		This ain't the time, Richard.

				RICHARD
			(his voice rising)
		Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a
		fuckin' nut, and where I come from,
		that stops the train on its tracks.

				SETH
			(real quiet and violent)
		Keep your voice down.

				RICHARD
			(quiet back)
		Or what?

	BACK TO JACOB AND SCOTT		

				JACOB
		Have you forgotten about your sister?

				SCOTT
		They're gonna kill us. They get us
		across the border, they're gonna take
		us out in the desert and shoot us.

				JACOB
		If they get over the border, they're
		gonna let us go.

				SCOTT
		Dad, I watch those reality shows.
		They never let anybody go. Any cop
		will tell you, in a situation like
		this, you get a chance, you go for it.
		This is our chance.

				JACOB
		What about Kate?

				SCOTT
		They're gonna kill her anyway. At
		least now with all these cops we've
		got a fighting chance.

				JACOB
		Son, I have this situation under
		control. I know exactly what I'm
		doing. You're going to have to trust
		me on this.

				SCOTT
		If trusting you means trusting those
		fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If
		you don't tell the cops, I will.


	Jacob grabs Scott by the front of his shirt, and yanks him
	to him.

				JACOB
		Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna
		do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear
		me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm
		running this show, I make the
		decisions.

				SCOTT
		He's running the show.

				JACOB
		I'm running the show. I make the
		plays, and you back the plays I
		make. Stop thinking with your fucking
		balls. Kate in a room with a couple of
		desperate men with nothing to fucking
		lose ain't the time to "go for it."
		I need your cover. Cover my ass.

	There's a HONK behind them.

	They both look out the window. It's their turn with the
	BORDER PATROL GUARDS. JACOB takes the wheel and drives up.

	A stern BORDER GUARD approaches JACOB'S window.

				BORDER GUARD
		How many with you?

				JACOB
		Just my son and I.

				BORDER GUARD
		What is your purpose in Mexico?

				JACOB
		Vacation. I'm taking him to see his
		first bullfight.

	BACK TO BATHROOM

				RICHARD
		I'm curious. What was the nuttiest
		thing I did?

				SETH
		This ain't the time.

				RICHARD
		Oh, I know, was it possibly when your
		ass was rotting in jail and I broke it
		out? Yeah, you're right, that was
		pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention
		stupid. But you know what? I can fix
		that right now.

	SETH HAULS off and PUNCHES Richard smack in the head.
	Richard HITS the floor, Guard, Jacob, and Scott hear
	Richard fall in the bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD
		What was that?

				JACOB
		Oh, that's just my daughter in the
		bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD
		You said it was just you and your son.

				JACOB
		I meant me, my son and my daughter.

	CLOSE-UP BORDER GUARD

				BORDER GUARD
		Open the door. I'm coming aboard.

	BACK TO BATHROOM

	CLOSE-UP KATE

	We can only see Kate's face. It's scared. We hear rustling
	around the bathroom, but we don't know what it is.

	Then it's quiet. Then we hear talking outside the door, but
	we can't make it out. Then we hear a knock.

				KATE
		I'm in the bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD (O.S.)
		It's the Border Patrol. Open up.

				KATE
		It's open.

	We hear the door open and see the light change on Kate's
	face. She's looking up.

	BORDER GUARD in the doorway looking in.

	HE SEES: Kate by herself, pants around her ankles, sitting
	on the toilet.

				KATE
		Do you mind? Shut the fucking door.

				BORDER GUARD
		Excuse me.

	He closes the door. Kate lets out a breath. We wait a beat,
	Seth pulls back the curtain in the shower, we see Richie on
	the floor of the shower knocked out.

	Seth and Kate meet eyes.

	He gives her the O.K. signal.

								  CUT TO:

	BACK WINDOW MOTOR HOME

	We see through the back window of the motor home, the border
	getting smaller as we drive away from it.

	Scott knocks on the bathroom door.

				SCOTT
		It's clear.

	Seth BURSTS out of the bathroom.

				SETH
		Goddamn, that was. intense!

	Seth goes to the back window. He sees the border getting
	farther and farther away. No cars following.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		We did it.
			(pause)
		We're in Mexico.

	Seth throws his head back and SCREAMS for joy.

	Kate, emerging from the bathroom, reacts to Seth's scream,
	along with Scott.

	Seth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of
	the van.

	Everybody else is still tense as shit. But Seth lets go of
	all his tension, and becomes a new man before our eyes. He
	turns to Kate.

				SETH
			(loud and happy)
		Come here, Kate!

	Kate, nervous, takes a step back.

	He charges for her. GRABS her, hugs her around her waist,
	and spins her around. When he lets her go, she stumbles
	dizzily onto the bed.

				SETH
			(to Kate)
		You were magnificent! You told him to
		shut the fucking door. I'm hiding in
		the shower, and I'm thinking to
		myself, "Did I just fuckin' hear what
		I just fuckin' heard? And what does he
		do -- he shuts the fucking door!

	Kate kind of half smiles.

				SETH
		If I was a bit younger, baby, I'd
		fuckin' marry you!

	Seth goes up front and slaps Jacob on the back.

				SETH
		I gotta hand it to ya, Pops, you
		raised a fuckin' woman.

	Jacob doesn't share Seth's enthusiasm, but he is relieved.

				JACOB
		We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico.
		Now it's time for your part, letting
		us go.

				SETH
		Pops, when you're right, you're right,
		and you are right.

				KATE
			(suddenly brightens)
		You're gonna let us go?

				SETH
		In the morning, darlin', in the
		morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are
		F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys
		through hell, and I know I've been one
		rough pecker, but from here on end you
		guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help
		me pick Richie up, and lay him down.
		Jacob, keep going on this road till
		you get to a sign that says, "Digayo."
		When you get to Digayo, turn this big
		bastard left, go on down for a few
		miles, then you see a bar called "The
		Titty Twister." From what I hear, you
		can't miss it.

				JACOB
		Then?

				SETH
		Then stop, 'cause that's where we're
		going.

	He slaps him once again on the back, and leaves to attend
	to Richard.

								  CUT TO:

	CLOSE-UP RICHARD without glasses. Unconscious, Seth slaps
	his face.

				SETH (O.S.)
		 C'mon, kid, wake up. Don't make a
		 career out of it.

	Richard starts coming to and opens his eyes. Seth sits at the
	foot of the bed.

				SETH
		You okay?

				RICHARD
			(disoriented)
		Yeah, I think so. What happened?

				SETH
		I don't know, you just passed out.

				RICHARD
		I did?

				SETH
		Yeah, we were just standing there. You
		said something about your shoulder
		hurting, then you just hit the ground
		like a sack of potatoes.

				RICHARD
		Really?

				SETH
		Yeah, when you fell your head smacked
		the toilet hard. It scared the shit
		outta me. Sure you're okay?

				RICHARD
		Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little
		fucked up.

				SETH
		Well, let me tell ya something, gonna
		clear your head right up. We are
		officially Mexicans.

				RICHARD
		What?

				SETH
		We are...
			(singing)
		"South of the border down Mexico way."

				RICHARD
		We are?

				SETH
		Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous
		right now. We get there, we pound
		booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts
		us to El Ray. And then me and you,
		brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya
		like them apples?

	Slowly shaking the cobwebs out of his head.

				RICHARD
		Far out.
			(pause)
		Where are my glasses?

				SETH
		They broke when you fell.

				RICHARD
		Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!

				SETH
		Don't worry about it, we'll get you
		some glasses.

				RICHARD
		What dya mean, don't worry about it.
		Of course I'm gonna worry about it,
		I can't fuckin' see.

				SETH
		When we get to El Ray, I'll take care
		of it.

				RICHARD
		Yeah, like a Mexican
		hole-in-the-wall's gonna have my
		fuckin' prescription.

				SETH
		It's not a big deal, unless you make
		it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy,
		Richie, stop bringing me down with
		bullshit.

	Jacob calls to the back.

				JACOB
		Guys! We're here.

								  CUT TO:

	A neon sign that flashes:

		THE TITTY TWISTER
		 Hiker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn

	Underneath the joint's proud name on the sign, and
	on top of "Biker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn" is a
	well-endowed woman, whose breast is being twisted
	by a neon hand.


	EXT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT
	The neon sign sits on top of the rudest, sleaziest, most
	crab-infested, strip joint, honky-tonk whorehouse in all of
	Mexico.

	The Titty Twister is located out in the middle of
	nowheres ville. It sits by itself with nothing around it for
	miles. A plethora of choppers and eighteen wheelers are
	parked out in front. The walls almost pulsate from the LOUD,
	RAUNCHY MUSIC within the structure. Signs cover the walls
	outside reading things like: 

	"NUDE DANCING", "WHORES", "BEER", "AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD",
	"BIKERS AND TRUCKERS ONLY", "OPEN DUSK TILL DAWN",
	"THURSDAY COCKFIGHT NIGHT", "WEDNESDAY DOGFIGHT NIGHT",
	"DONKEY SHOW MONDAYS", "EVERY FRIDAY BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT TO
	THE DEATH, FEATURING THE LOVELY SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM",
	"ATHENA AND DANNY THE WONDER PONY", and "THE SLEAZY TITTY
	TWISTER DANCERS."

	In the parking lot, a BIKER and a TRUCK DRIVER beat the shit
	out of each other, one with a pipe, the other with a hammer.
	A SECOND BIKER fucks a Titty Twister WHORE against the wall.
	A greasy man, known as CHET PUSSY, stands in the parking
	lot, soliciting customers through a Mr. Microphone.

				CHET
		Pussy, pussy, pussy! All pussy must
		go. At the Titty Twister we're
		slashing pussy in half! This is a
		pussy blow out! Make us an offer on our
		vast selection of pussy! We got white
		pussy, black pussy, Spanish pussy,
		yellow pussy, hot pussy, cold pussy,
		wet pussy, tight pussy, big pussy,
		bloody pussy, fat pussy, hairy pussy,
		smelly pussy, velvet pussy, silk
		pussy, Naugahyde pussy, snappin'
		pussy, horse pussy, dog pussy, mule
		pussy, fake pussy! If we don't have
		it, you don't want it!

	The Fullers' recreational vehicle pulls into the parking
	lot and stops.


	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

	What's left of the Fuller family and the Gecko family look
	out the windshield onto the sight that is the Titty Twister.

				SETH
			(to the group)
		Okay, troops, this is the homestretch.
		Here's the deal; this place closes at
		dawn. Carlos is gonna meet us here
		sometime before dawn. Which by my
		guesstimate is somewhere between three
		or four hours from now. So we're gonna
		go in there, take a seat, have a drink
		-- have a bunch of drinks, and wait
		for Carlos. That could be an hour,
		that could be three hours, I don't
		know which. But when he gets here,
		me and Richie are going to leave
		with him. After we split, you guys
		are officially out of this stewpot.
		Let me just say I'm real happy about
		where we're at. We got a real nice, "I
		don't fuck with you -- you don't fuck
		with me" attitude going on. Now, if
		everybody just keeps playin' it cool
		-- and I'm talking to you, too, Richie
		-- everybody's gonna get what they
		want. Comprende, amigos?

	Everybody nods and mutters in agreement.

				SETH
		Okay hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
		I'm buyin'.


	EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
	The camper door FLIES OPEN and the two brothers and the
	Fuller family step out into the night.

	They look across the parking lot at the Titty Twister.
	It literally looks in some ways like the entrance to hell.

				JACOB
		Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

				SETH
		Shit, I been to bars make this place
		look like a fuckin' 4-H club.

				RICHARD
		I gotta say I'm with Jacob on this. I
		been to some fucked up places in my
		time, but that place is fucked up.

	Seth can't believe it.

				SETH
			(in a baby talk voice)
		Aww-w, whatsa matter, is the little
		baby too afraid to go into the big
		scary bar?

	The two brothers square off, not like strangers fighting,
	but like brothers fight. They talk real quiet, but real
	personal.

				RICHARD
		That's what you think?

				SETH
		That's how you're lookin', Richie.

				RICHARD
		I'm lookin' scared?

				SETH
		That's what you look like.

				RICHARD
		You know what you look like?

				SETH
		No, Richie, what do I look like?

				RICHARD
		You're lookin' green.

	That's not what Seth expected to hear.

				SETH
		How?

				RICHARD
		Where are you right now?

				SETH
		What do you mean?

				RICHARD
		Where are you?

				SETH
		I'm here with you.

				RICHARD
		No, you're not. You're sippin'
		margaritas in El Ray. But we're
		not in El Ray. We're here --
		getting ready to go in there.
		You're so pleased with yourself
		about getting into Mexico, you
		think the job's down. It ain't.
		Get back on the clock. That's a
		fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around
		there for a coupla hours, in all
		likelihood, we'll get fucked with.
		So get your shit together, brother.

				SETH
		My shit is together.

				RICHARD
		It don't look together.

				SETH
		Well, it is. Just because I'm happy
		doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're
		just not used to seein' me happy,
		'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin'
		years since I been happy. But my shit
		is forever together.

	Richard believes Seth's response.

				RICHARD
		Okay, just checkin'.

	They walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into
	the microphone.

				CHET
			(yelling into the microphone)
		Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.
		Buy any piece of pussy a tour regular
		price, you get another piece of pussy,
		of equal or lesser value, for a penny.
		Now try and beat pussy for a penny!
		If you can find cheaper pussy
		anywhere, fuck it!

	Chet notices our heroes, especially young Kate.

				CHET
			(in microphone, towards Kate)
		What's this? A new flavor approaching.
		Apple Pie Pussy.

				SETH
		Step aside, asshole.

	Chet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST.

				CHET
		Not so fast, Slick.

	Seth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till
	the BONE SNAPS in two.

	Chet lets out a SCREAM.

	Seth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's
	NOSE.

	Chet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth.

	Seth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that
	SNAPS Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK.

	After HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight
	to Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER.

	Chet is OUT.

	The whole altercation took two seconds.

	Everyone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at
	everyone.

				SETH
		Now, is my shit together, or is my
		shit together?

	Richard and Seth laugh with each other.

				RICHARD
			(slappin' Seth five)
		Your shit is forever together!

	They head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second,
	and gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks,


	INT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT

	If the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world
	from the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, "You
	ain't seen nothin' yet." This is the kind of place where
	they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood
	and the beer at closing.

	In the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers,
	while a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played
	at ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage
	BAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of
	bikers and truckers.

	One of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his
	name is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in
	the saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is
	ATHENA, his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the
	crowd.

	Bikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out
	here about one every ten minutes. The customers may start 'em,
	but the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em.

	Seth, Richard, Jacob, Scott and Kate walk through the door.
	They each individually take in the sights and the smells.
	Seth is the first to say something.

				SETH
		Now this is my kinda place! I could
		become a regular.

	The man behind the bar is RAZOR CHARLIE. He eyes the group
	as they approach.

	Their difference from the usual road waif nomads who
	populate the Twister disturbs him. He exchanges a knowing
	look across the room with Big Emilio, as the group bellies
	up to the bar.

				SETH
		Whiskey!

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(in English)
		You can't come in here.

				SETH
		What dya mean?

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		This is a private club. You're not
		welcome.

				SETH
		Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough
		to drink here?

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		This bar is for bikers and truckers
		only.
			(points his finger to Seth)
		You, get out!

	Big Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places 
	HIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seth's shoulder.

				BIG EMILIO
			(to Seth in Spanish)
		Walk, Pendaho.

	Seth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder.

				SETH
			(low)
		Take your hand off me.

				BIG EMILIO
			(Spanish)
		I'm going to count to three.

				SETH
		No, I'm going to count to three.

				BIG EMILIO
		Uno...

				SETH
		Two..

	Jacob jumps in the middle.

				JACOB
		Now wait a minute, there's no reason
		to get ugly. There's just a
		misunderstanding going on here. You
		said this bar is for truckers and
		bikers, Well, I'm a truck driver.

	Everybody looks at Jacob.

	As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet.

				JACOB
		If you look outside your door, parked
		in your parking lot, you'll see a big
		ass recreational vehicle. That's mine.
		In order to drive that legally, you
		need a class two driver's license.
		That is the same license that the
		DMV requires truck drivers to carry
		in order to drive a truck.
			(he takes the license out
			 of his wallet and lays it
			 on the bar)
		That is me, and this is my class two
		license. This is a truck driver's bar,
		I am a truck driver, and these are
		my friends.

	Everybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech.

	Razor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at
	everyone in the party and smiles.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(to Jacob)
		Welcome to the Titty Twister. What
		can I get you?

	Seth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio's paw.

				SETH
		Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.

	Razor Charlie's eyes go to Seth. Even though he has a big
	smile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill Seth.
	But instead he just says,

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		Coming right up.

	Razor Charlie goes for the bottle. Big Emilio gives the
	party one last look and walks away. Richard gives Jacob a
	buddy punch on the shoulder.

				RICHARD
		Good job, Pops.

	Seth's still frying an egg on his head.

				SETH
		That's just fuckin' typical. Biggest
		number one problem with Mexico, it's
		not service oriented. I was feelin'
		so good, and those fuckin' spies
		brought me down.

	Richard puts his arm around Seth.

				RICHARD
		Fuck 'em, shake it off.

	Razor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. Seth looks
	at the guy, still pissed.

				SETH
		You serve food, Jose?

	Razor Charlie knows Seth's taunting him with a racial slur,
	but he just smiles and says,

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		Best in Mexico.

				SETH
		I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a
		table, send over a waitress to take
		our order.

	Seth walks away, and the group follows him.

	We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor
	Charlie's head.

	The five of them move across the floor to a table. As they
	walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments
	from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter.

	The dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested,
	wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him.

	Richard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.

				RICHARD
		Anytime you want a lap dance with that
		broad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo.

	He gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the
	surroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange
	words about the party in Spanish.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(in Spanish)
		They're not the normal road trash we
		normally feed on. But it'll be okay.
		No one knows they're here.

	The five of them find a table and sit down.

	Seth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey
	bottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass.

				SETH
		Who else?

				JACOB
		Pass.

				SETH
			(picking a fight)
		Why not, against your religion?

				JACOB
			(won't be baited)
		No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking
		now.

				SETH
		Suit yourself, more for me.
			(to Scott)
		Scotty?

	Scott shakes his head no.

				SETH
			(to Kate)
		How 'bout you?
			(pointing at Scott and Kate)
		are safer in here with us than
		wandering around a Mexican border town
		all night long. Just don't do nothin'
		stupid and we'll all get along fine.
			(to Scott)
		Scotty, you sure you don't want a
		drink?

				SCOTT
		Okay, I'll have one.

				JACOB
		No you won't.

	Seth pours Scott a shot.

				SETH
		Sorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I
		don't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms
		up, boy.

	Scott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an
	on-drinker's tremor.

	Seth turns to Kate.

				SETH
		How about you, cutie pie? Ready for
		round two?

				KATE
		Okay.

	Seth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and
	knocks it back.

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you
		just created a monster.

	Jacob turns to Seth and asks quietly.

				JACOB
		Why are you so agitated?

				SETH
		I'm still stewing about that ape
		laying hands on me. And that fuckin'
		bartender sticks a weed up my ass,
		too.

				JACOB
		He backed down.

				SETH
		He's smilin' at us. But behind his
		smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack."
		I hear that loud and clear.

				JACOB
		What are you going to do?

				SETH
			(picking up the whiskey bottle)
		I'm gonna just sit here and drain
		this bottle. And when I've drunk the
		last drop, if I still feel then, the
		way I feel now, I'm gonna take this
		bottle and break it over his melon
		head.

				JACOB
		Before we stepped in here, you told
		all of us to be cool. That means you,
		too.

				SETH
			(tossing it off)
		I never said do what I do, I said do
		what I say.

				JACOB
		Are you so much a fucking loser, you
		can't tell when you've won?

	Richard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can
	believe what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays
	down his drinking glass.

				SETH
		What did you call me?

				JACOB
		Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I
		asked a question. Would you like me to
		ask it again? Very well. Are you such
		a loser you can't tell when you've
		won?
			(pause)
		The entire state of Texas, along with
		the FBI, is looking for you. Did they
		find you? No. They couldn't. They had
		every entrance to the border covered.
		There's no way you could get across.
		Did you? Yes, you did. You've won,
		Seth, enjoy it.

	Seth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle.

				SETH
		Jacob, I want you to have a drink with
		me. I insist.

	Jacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze
	in Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses.

				SETH
		To your family.

				JACOB
		To yours.

	They both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down.

				JACOB
		Now, is your shit together?

				SETH
		Forever together.

	Seth turns to Scott.

				SETH
		In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take
		it that's yours.

				SCOTT
		Yeah, it's mine.

				SETH
		Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.

								  CUT TO:

	Seth sitting at the table, playing guitar, singing Mexican
	songs. Some bikers, truckers, and whores have gathered
	around their table. Everyone's groovin'. Seth finishes the
	song. Everybody applauds.

	Razor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone
	that he uses to announce dancers.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(announcer voice in Spanish)
		And now for your viewing pleasure. The
		Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome
		of Evil. The most sinister woman to
		dance on the face of the earth. Lowly
		dogs, get on your knees, bow your
		heads and worship at the feet of
		SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM!

	The lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening
	notes of the Coaster's "Down in Mexico" fills the room.

	The crowd hushes up.

	And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.

	This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that
	Stendhal described in "As the Promise of Happiness," but
	the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.

	She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the
	stage, but like she owned the world.

	And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the
	world is proud to be her possession.

	All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the
	Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially
	Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and
	accompanies from the table with the guitar.

	When the music builds to its explosive section.

	Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the
	room.

	She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with
	the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up
	looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie
	and points at Seth's table, describing what happened.

	As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up
	from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.

	Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.

	Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard.
	She STANDS OVER him.

	While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky
	bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.

	She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her
	toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.

				SANTANICO
			(to Richard in Spanish)
		Drink up.

	Richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The
	CROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she
	surveys.

	Jacob and Scott are embarrassed.

	Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power
	this woman has over a man she's deathly feared.

	Seth laughs out loud a Mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keeping
	the beat with his guitar.

	Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions
	over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what
	Seth and company did to Chet.

	Richard continues to suck her toes.

	The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's
	mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks
	down at the seated Richard.

	She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His
	mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE
	OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey
	from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd
	applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob
	and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds,
	none louder than Seth.

				SETH
		Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what
		I call a fuckin' show!

	One of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe,
	which she puts on.

	Richard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.

				SETH
			(snapping his fingers)
		Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask
		your new friend to join us?

				RICHARD
		Yeah.

				SETH
		Well, then ask her, dumb ass.

				RICHARD
			(looking up at Santanico)
		Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to
		join us?

				SANTANICO
			(to Richard)
		Muy bien, gracias.

	Santanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.

				SETH
		Richie, you lucky bastard!
			(to Santanico)
		Now, little lady, you could of just as
		easily done that to me. Who a Nelly!
		You got my dick harder 'n Chinese
		arithmetic.

	The table laughs.

				SETH
		Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red
		Riding Hood is walking through the
		forest and she comes across Little Bo
		Peep, and Little Bo Peep says:
		"Little Red Riding Hood, are you
		crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf
		is walking these woods and if he finds
		you he's gonna pull down your dress
		and squeeze your titties?" Then Little
		Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt
		and taps a .357 Magnum she has
		holstered on her thigh and says: "No
		he won't."

	As Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big
	Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.

				JACOB
			(to himself)
		Oh, shit.
			(to Seth)
		Seth --

	Seth waves him away.

				SETH
		Not now. So finally she comes across
		the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad
		Wolf's laughing and says: "Little Red
		Riding Hood, you know better than to
		be walking around these woods alone.
		You know I'm just gonna have to pull
		down your dress and squeeze your
		titties." Then Little Red Riding Hood
		whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks
		it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and
		says: "No you won't. You're gonna eat
		me, just like the story says."

	Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard,
	Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say
	anything --

	The Titty Twister trio stand over the table.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(to Chet in Spanish)
		Which one?

				CHET
			(pointing at Seth)
		This piece of shit broke my finger
		and my nose...
			(pointing at Richard)
		then this fag kicked me in the ribs
		while I was down.

	That's all Big Emilio has to hear.

				BIG EMILIO
			(to The Gecko Brothers)
		Up!

				RICHARD
		Fuck off, ape man!

	Big Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by
	the shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from
	his wounded shoulder.

	Santanico steps back from the table.

	Seth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into
	Big Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor.
	Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake
	and SLASHES Seth across the face.

	Seth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to
	his laid open cheek.

	Richard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound,
	brings up his .45 and starts BLASTING.

	Razor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly
	before he hits the floor.

	Jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay
	out of gunfire.

	The bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what
	they were doing.

	The music continues to play, though the dancers stop
	dancing.

	Santanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells
	something.

	Her NOSTRILS FLARE.

	Richard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief
	and puts it to his face.

				RICHARD
		How are you?

				SETH
		Scarred for life, that's how I am!

	Seth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.

				SETH
		You thought it was pretty funny,
		didn't you?

	Both brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right...
	left... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards
	the crowd.

				SETH
		Everybody be cool, or you'll be just
		as dead as these fucks!

	SLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face.

	SLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor.

	The CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the
	waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.

	SLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls
	to the floor, splattering.

	WE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills
	her nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face
	could easily be read as intense sexual desire.

	CLOSE-UP KATE ON FLOOR

	Looks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's
	transformation.

	Her NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodent's. The whites
	of her eyes turn YELLOW. The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from
	her mouth. Kate yells from the floor.

				KATE
			(yelling)
		Richie, look out!

	Before Richie can turn around.

	SANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and
	SINKS her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER.

	Richard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM.

	Seth turns to his brother's cry.

	He sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached to
	a cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs buried
	deep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming
	about, trying to knock her off.

	Richard screams to Seth:

				RICHARD
		Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!

	Seth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He
	can't get a clear shot.

	Jacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing.

	Richard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico
	rides him down to the floor.

	Seth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the
	vamp in the head, blowing her off his brother.

	Richard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about
	half way before he stops, saying:

				RICHARD
			(with his dying breath)
		Fucking Bitch!

	He tumbles over, a corpse.

				SETH
		Richie.

	Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet
	Pussy pop open. The "dead" men sit up with evil grins on
	their faces.

	The patrons scream.

	A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock
	with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar
	and yells:

				WHORE
		Dinner is served!

	The bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching
	the impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers
	and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have
	turned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping
	VAMPIRES.

	The vamps attack.

	What follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been
	sitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven
	necks.

	Naked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other.
	Truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size.
	The patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the
	monsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades,
	anything.

	Jacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar.
	They hide and watch.

	Seth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand,
	too freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands
	motionless, watching what he can't believe.

	Behind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard,
	eyes POP OPEN.

	She RISES in her snake/dance way.

	Seth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised.

				SANTANICO
		Let's see if you taste as good as your
		brother.

	She approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM...
	CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her
	hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.

	Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the
	JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the
	FLOOR and INTO the WALL.

	A bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the
	side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a
	pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps.

	Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a
	switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the
	bar to the other.

	The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE,
	goes head to head with a stripper.

	The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has
	close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the
	vamp bitch blow for blow.

	Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head
	and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her
	on the wooden leg.

	FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie
	appears, straight razor in hand.

	Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor
	Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool
	cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie
	UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half.
	Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of
	the cue in Razor Charlie's heart.

	Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the
	vampire's death scream.

	Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He
	tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his
	chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but
	the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block
	placed on his chest.

				SANTANICO
		I'm not gonna drain you completely.
		You're gonna turn for me, You'll be
		my slave. You'll live for me. You'll
		eat bugs because I order it. Because
		I don't think you're worthy of human
		blood, you'll feed on the blood of
		stray dogs. You'll be my foot stool.
		And at my command, you'll lick the dog
		shit from my boot heel. Since you'll
		be my dog, your new name will be
		"Spot". Welcome to slavery.

	SLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing
		 end over end.

	CLOSE-UP SANTANICO

	looking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when
	the bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING.

	We see that Jacob behind the bar threw it.

	Santanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is
	momentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth.

	Seth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.

	Santanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes
	the liquor-soaked robe ignite.

	Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.

	Big Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry.

				BIG EMILIO
		Noooooo!

	He turns his hateful gaze on the two humans.

	Seth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they
	see him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to
	Jacob.

				SETH
		We may be in trouble.

	Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla
	walks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting
	vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp
	out Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack
	him, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed
	aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort.

	Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off
	Seth and Jacob.

	Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a
	weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.

	Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their
	wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him
	look like a huge walking shark.

	Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey, you, monkey man!

	Big Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room.

				SEX MACHINE
		Anything you gotta say to them, say
		to me first.

	Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He
	effortlessly knocks them away.

	They both hit the ground.

	Sex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to "come
	ahead."

	Big Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway
	locomotive.

	Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two
	huge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the
	Gargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one
	buckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio,
	who HITS the floor.

	Once on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp,
	BEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The
	vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the
	savage beating.

				SEX MACHINE
		That's enough.

	Jacob and Seth stop.

	Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the
	end tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into
	big vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and
	dies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead
	vamp.

	Chet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He
	breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from
	around his mouth.

	Kate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears
	over the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to
	protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his
	trouble. Chet dives at Kate.

				CHET
		You know what everybody says about me?
		I suck!

	Chet goes to bite Kate, grabbing at her t-shirt, and sees
	her crucifix. HE recoils backwards. Scott grabs hold of
	his head from behind. Kate jumps up from the floor, rips
	off her cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard, opening
	his mouth. She SHOVES the cross inside. Chet's eyes roll
	up back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.

	GULP.

	Chet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard
	moving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his
	mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. He
	jumps up from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain.
	He jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, screaming
	all the while.

	Kate and Scott watch him from the bar, mischievous grins on
	their faces.

	Chet is on his knees, arms stretched out, yelling at the top
	of his lungs like a vamp King Lear.

				CHET
		I-AM-IN-AGONNNYYYY!

	Chet breaks off a chair leg, muttering to himself.

				CHET
		Stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the
		pain, stop the pain, stop the pain...

	He plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the
	vampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being
	staked, Chet lets out a sigh of relief.

	By this time there are not too many people left. Most of the
	vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the
	customers have been butchered or drained.

	All that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers
	and two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his
	kids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who
	are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding
	wooden stakes.

	The four human men group together. The four female vampires
	charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood.
	Seth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and
	slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four
	staked bodies hit the floor.

	Kate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's
	side.

	They all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has
	taken place. The floor is littered with dead bodies.

				FROST
		Ain't they supposed to burn up or
		something?

	At that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating
	everyone's face. The sound of quick burning flames fills
	the air. Everybody shields their eyes from the intense
	light, which lasts only a split second.

	It vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All
	that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies
	once lay.

	They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN
	for the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's
	useless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging.

	Except for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over
	to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it.

	He takes his dead hand.

				SETH
		Richie, I'm sorry I fucked things up.
		You'd really like it in El Ray. We'd
		find peace there. I love you little
		brother, I'll miss ya bad.

	Seth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD 'S EYES
	POP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise.

				RICHARD
		I'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I
		love you, too.

	Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him
	down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away.
	He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down
	to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big
	bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him
	from Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have
	surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his
	head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a
	wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to
	where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the
	wood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth
	whips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.

				SETH
		Touch my brother with that stake,
		biker, and vampires won't need to
		suck your blood, they'll be able to
		lick it up off the floor.

				SEX MACHINE
		He ain't your brother no more.

				SETH
		That's a matter of opinion, and I
		don't give a fuck about your's.

	Jacob, Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to
	the ground.

				JACOB
		Don't be an idiot, he'll kill us all!

	Seth aims his gun at the group.

				SETH
		Shut up!

	Richard's giggling.

				RICHARD
		Yeah, shut up.

	Seth, still holding the outstretched gun, takes the stake
	out of Sex Machine's hand. Seth lowers the .45.

				SETH
		Hold him down.

	The smile evaporates from Richard's face.

				SETH
		Richie, here's the peace in death I
		could never give you in life.

	Seth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of
	his .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's
	heart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the
	body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo.
	Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar.
	He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate,
	of all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at
	the bar.

				KATE
		Are you okay?

				SETH
		Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The
		world's my oyster, except for the
		fact that I just rammed a wooden
		stake in my brother's heart because
		he turned into a vampire, even
		though I don't believe in vampires.
		Aside from that unfortunate business,
		everything's hunky-dory.

				KATE
		I'm really sorry.

				SETH
		Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half
		a chance you'd feed us to them!

				JACOB
		Then why didn't I?

	Jacob walks over to Seth.

				JACOB
		I saved your life. I didn't have to,
		but I did. And I'm sorry you lost your
		brother. I'm sorry he's dead. I'm
		sorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're
		gonna get out of this we need each
		other. And we need you sober and
		thinking, not drunk and...

	As Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has
	grown LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to
	identify it.

				JACOB
		What the hell is that?

				FROST
		At first I just thought it was birds.

				SEX MACHINE
		No, it's more of a gnawing sound.
		Birds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats
		gnaw.

	Seth puts the bottle in his hand down.

				SETH
		It's bats.


	EXT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

	The outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with
	hats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get
	inside.


	INT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

	Everybody listens to the bats SCRATCHING and clawing all
	along the walls, the roof and at the front door. Everyone's
	scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to
	do next. The door begins to crack and splinter, little
	claws poke their way through.

				JACOB
		Give me a hand!

	Jacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area
	the bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other
	items to help secure and barricade the door.

	As the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and
	the windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops
	open his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious
	activity. Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new
	friend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's
	putting a board into place. He springs to his feet and
	POUNCES on her, just as Sex Machine turns from across the
	room in her direction.

				SEX MACHINE
		Watch out, girly!

	The biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a
	scream. The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but
	she's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The
	others hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine,
	Big Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue.
	As the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out
	of Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the
	vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her
	and spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and
	SWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking
	the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the
	vamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one
	of the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's
	heart. He dies and bursts into flames.

	At that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting
	position. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the
	ground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.

				SEX MACHINE
			(mumbling to himself)
		Goddamn fuckin' vampires.

	The biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine, Vampire
	Hunter. He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their
	feet. Both SPEW green blood, scream, die and burst into
	flames. The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap,
	SMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for
	a loop.

	As CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS
	on his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a
	stack of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate
	by the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is
	lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine
	raises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the
	vamp's black heart. Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames,
	which hits the whiskey, starting a giant fire.

				SEX MACHINE
		Fire!

	Frost and Jacob stop barricading and run to the fire.

				FROST
			(to Sex Machine)
		We'll put this out. You stake the rest
		of these fuckers.

				SEX MACHINE
		Way ahead of ya.
			(to Kate)
		What's your name, girly?

				KATE
		Kate, what's yours?

				SEX MACHINE
		Sex Machine. Pleased to meet'cha.
		Kate, let's stake these blood-sucker
		fuckers.

	Kate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to
	work STAKING the dead bodies.

	Jacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and
	whatever else is at hand.

	A hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered
	over. Little claws scrape their way through. Scott stands
	in front of the window.

				SCOTT
			(yelling)
		We got a problem!

	Seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott's
	direction. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS
	a little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which is
	SQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its
	body through the newly formed hole.

	Seth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45,
	point-blank range at the head of the bat/rat.

	The bat/rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and YANKS
	his head back through the hole.

	Seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment,
	when...

	WHAM !

	The bat/rat BURSTS through the hole, like shot out of a
	cannon, HITTING Seth in the gut and sending him FLYING,
	LANDING HARD on his back.

	Once Seth hits the ground, the bat-thing (which has the body
	of a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity-split
	RUNS UP Seth's body to his juggler. Seth's hand GRABS the
	bat's neck, and tries to PUSH it away. But the bat-thing has
	its CLAWS DUG in Seth's clothes. The bat-thing is just
	inches from Seth's face. Its mouth is SNAPPING.

				SETH
		Get this bastard off of me!

	Frost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and
	GRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth.

	Sex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their
	preventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a
	dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The
	body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood
	squirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake
	down in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo.
	Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of
	his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him
	get bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy.

	Frost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in
	front of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a
	while, then...

	BASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some
	fight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head
	against the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the
	bat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a
	cup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's
	heart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of
	FLAMES, followed by a pile of goo.

	Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered
	window with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with
	the bat-thing.

	Jacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together,
	exhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue
	to try and claw their way in.

				JACOB
		Is everybody okay?

	Everyone mutters "yeah."

				JACOB
		Okay, does anybody here know what's
		going on?

				SETH
		Yeah, I know what's going on. We got
		a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside
		trying to get inside and suck our
		fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and
		simple. And I don't wanna hear any
		bullshit about "I don't believe in
		vampires" because I don't fuckin'
		believe in vampires either. But I do
		believe in my own two fuckin' eyes,
		and with my two eyes I saw fuckin'
		vampires! Now, does everybody agree
		we're dealin' with vampires.

	Everybody agrees.

				SETH
		You too, preacher?

				JACOB
		I'm like you. I don't believe in
		vampires, but I believe in what I saw.

				SETH
		Good for you. Now, since we all
		believe we're dealing with vampires,
		what do we know about vampires?
		Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a
		cross?

				JACOB
		In the Winnebago.

				SETH
		In other words, no.

				SCOTT
		What are you talking about? We got
		crosses all over the place. All you
		gotta do is put two sticks together
		and you got a cross.

				SEX MACHINE
		He's right. Peter Cushing does that
		all the time.

				SETH
		I don't know about that. In order for
		it to have any power, I think it's
		gotta be an official crucifix.

				JACOB
		What's an official cross? Some piece
		of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that
		official? If a cross works against
		vampires, it's not the cross itself,
		it's what the cross represents. The
		cross is a symbol of holiness.

				SETH
		Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses
		covered, moving right along, what
		else?

				FROST
		Wooden stakes in the heart been
		workin' pretty good so far.

				SEX MACHINE
		Garlic, holy water, sunlight... I
		forget, does silver do anything to a
		vampire?

				SCOTT
		That's werewolves.

				SEX MACHINE
		I know silver bullets are werewolves.
		But I'm pretty sure silver has some
		sort of effect on vampires.

				KATE
		Does anybody have any silver?

				ALL
		No.

				KATE
		Then who cares?

				SCOTT
		When's sunrise?

	Jacob looks at his watch.

				JACOB
		About two hours from now.

				KATE
		So all we have to do is get by for a
		few more hours and then we can walk
		right out the front door.

				SEX MACHINE
		Yeah, that's true, but I doubt our
		barricades, that door, those plastered
		windows and these walls will last two
		more hours with those bat fucks
		fuckin' with 'em.

				JACOB
		Has anybody here read a real book
		about vampires, or are we just
		remembering what a movie said? I mean
		a real book.

				SEX MACHINE
		You mean like a Time-Life book?

	Everybody laughs.

				FROST
			(in a cowboy voice)
		John Wesley Hardin, so mean he once
		shot a man for snorin'.

				JACOB
		I take it the answer's no. Okay then,
		what do we know about these vampires?

				SETH
		Aside from they're thirsty.

				FROST
		Well, one thing, they might got super
		human strength, but you can hurt 'em.

				JACOB
		Yeah, that bottle upside the head of
		Santanico didn't kill her, but it
		didn't feel too good either.

				SEX MACHINE
		Another thing, you try and ram a
		broken chair leg in a human, you
		better be one strong son-of-a-bitch.
		The human body is one rough-tough
		machine. But these vamps got soft
		bodies. The texture of their skin is
		softer, mushier. You can push shit
		right through 'em. Conceivably, if
		you hit one hard enough, you could
		take their fuckin' head off.

				SCOTT
		You could take their head off.

				SETH
		Actually, our best weapon against
		these satanic cocksuckers is this man.
			(he points at Jacob)
		He's a preacher.

	Frost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob.

				SETH
		As far as God's concerned, we might
		just as well be a piece of fuckin'
		shit. But he's one of the boys. Only
		one problem, his faith ain't what it
		used to be.

	Jacob PUNCHES Seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor.
	Jacob stands over him.

				JACOB
		I've had enough of your taunts.

	Seth looks up from the floor.

				SETH
		I'm not taunting you. We need you. A
		faithless preacher doesn't mean shit
		to us. But a man who's a servant of
		God can grab a cross, shove it in
		these monsters' asses. A servant of
		God can bless the tap water and turn
		it into a weapon.

	Seth rises.

				SETH
		I know why you lost your faith. How
		could true holiness exist if your wife
		can be taken away from you and your
		children? Now, I always said God can
		kiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I changed
		my lifetime tune about thirty minutes
		ago' cause I know, without a doubt,
		what's out there trying to get in
		here is pure evil straight from hell.
		And if there is a hell, and those
		monsters are from it, there's got to
		be a heaven. Now which are you, a
		faithless preacher or a mean,
		mother fuckin' servant of God?

	Jacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob
	sticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.

				JACOB
		I'm a mean, mother fucking servant of
		God.

	The laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only
	sound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing.
	It immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit
	they're in.

				KATE
		I don't know if I can take two hours
		of that noise.

				FROST
		You can. You'll take it 'cause ya got
		no choice. How'd ya like twenty four
		hours of it, lying in a muddy ditch
		with only the rotting corpses of your
		friends to keep you company?

				JACOB
		What are you talking about?

				FROST
		Back in '72 I was in Nam, trapped
		behind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole
		with my entire squad dead. They
		thought they killed everybody, and
		except for me, they were right. But it
		wasn't for lack of trying. A grenade
		blew up right next to me, that's why
		I'm so pretty.

	They thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all
	the bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing
	possum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me,
	listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after
	hour...

	As Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and
	the camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He
	can't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he
	doesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE
	say:

				MALE VOICE (V.O.)
		Thirst.

	"Who the fuck was that?" he thinks to himself. He turns
	around: nobody's there. No one else in the group seems to
	hear it, A FEMALE VOICE seductively says:

				FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
		Thirst.

	We hear Sex Machine's thought in a voice answer.

				SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
		Stop fucking saying that!

				TWO MALE VOICES (V.O.)
		Thirst!

				SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
		That bite weren't nothin'. It just
		hurt like a son-of-a-bitch, that's
		all. It barely punched the skin.

	Sex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The
	biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing
	all the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are
	many voices, male, female, children saying:

				VOICES (V.O.)
		Thirst... Thirst... Thirst...

	Sex Machine begins looking at the other members of the group
	in a thirsty way. He stares at each of their necks, closer
	and closer until he can see the veins on Frost's neck
	actually pulsating, throbbing, beckoning to him. Sex Machine
	has turned into a vampire.

	The sound comes back as Frost finishes his story.

				FROST
		...and then when I came back to my
		senses, I realized I had killed the
		entire V.C. squadron single handedly.
		My bayonet had blood and chunks of
		yellow flesh on it like some cannibal
		shish kabob. And to this day I don't
		have the slightest idea how I --

	Sex Machine lets out a hideous cry.

				SEX MACHINE
		THIRST!

	Frost SCREAMS as Sex Machine grabs hold of him and BITES
	into his neck.

	The group tries to PULL the TWO men apart.

	Jacob gets his arm around Sex Machine's neck and tries
	pulling.

	Sex Machine takes his teeth out of the biker's neck and
	SINKS them in Jacob's arm.

	Jacob SCREAMS and lets go.

	Seth, Kate and Scott react to Jacob being bit.

	Sex Machine GRABS Jacob and TOSSES him effortlessly over the
	bar, CRASHING into a shelf full of liquor bottles.

	Frost HOPS around the room, mad as a hornet, holding his
	bleeding neck.

				FROST
		I been bit! He fuckin' bit me!

	Sex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face, dropping him like a
	sack of potatoes.

	He smacks the shit out of Kate. She goes FLYING into a
	table.

	Sex Machine turns, seeing Frost breaking off a big table
	leg. Frost looks at the big vamp.

				FROST
			(to Sex Machine)
		You're dead, mother fucker! You're
		gonna bite me! You just turned me
		into a vampire, asshole!

				SEX MACHINE
		What are you gonna do about it?

	Frost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off,
	straight at Sex Machine.

	Sex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and
	pulls it back, so he can really haul off.

	Frost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets
	loose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the
	floor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face
	COLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so
	hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him
	through the air.

	Seth sees where Frost is heading and says:

				SETH
		Oh shit!

	Jacob sees.

				JACOB
		Good lord!

	Frost, in mid-air, HITS the barricaded, plastered overwindow
	and CRASHES through it.

	Sex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of
	bat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the
	hand and runs for the backroom.

	Behind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the
	ground.

	Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott,
	who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the
	back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An
	ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the
	door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard
	as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams,
	howls and snaps in fury.

	Seth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his
	.45 in its big mouth.

				SETH
		You wanna suck something, suck on
		this!

	He FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over
	the wall.

	Kate yells:

				KATE
		We have to go back for Daddy!

				SETH
		Daddy's dead.

				KATE
		Noooo!

	She spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door
	and help her father. Scott grabs her and pushes her up
	against the wall.

				SCOTT
		He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was
		too far away. If flinging that door
		and filling this room with those
		bat-things would save him, I'd fling
		it. The only thing it'll do is turn us
		into one of them.

				SETH
		He needs our help!

				SCOTT
		He's beyond our help. You saw him get
		bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it.
		You can't help him. I've got no one
		left to lose but you. I can't be alone
		again. We're sticking together.

	Just then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room.


	INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT

	Jacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting
	appropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at
	bay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of his
	restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is making
	his way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot of
	the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures.

	The creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of
	holiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad,
	whirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above and
	in front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of
	god. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire
	stake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bible
	in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone.
	As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost
	lying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a
	candy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even this
	repugnant sight trip him up.

	Jacob has backed himself up by the door.

				JACOB
		Open the door.

	The door FLIES open. Jacob jumps inside. The door SLAMS
	shut.

	Jacob hugs daughter and son. As he hugs them, we see his
	bloody arm.

	When he releases them, they can't help but notice.

				SETH
		Did he...?

				JACOB
		Yep.

	Seth explodes, knocking over boxes, busting chairs, tipping
	over tables and cussing a blue streak.

				SETH
		Fuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin'
		vampires! Mother fuckin' vampires!
		Goddamn mother fuckin' vampires!

	Seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the
	creatures on the other side.

				SETH
		You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm
		gonna fuckin' kill every last one of
		you godless pieces of shit!

				JACOB
			(to Seth)
		You bet your sweet ass you are, and
		I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't
		got much time.

	Kate is crying, she knows what's happened to her father.

				KATE
		You're gonna be okay, aren't you,
		daddy?

				JACOB
		No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect,
		I'm already dead.

	Scott and Kate, crying, grab their father and hold on for
	dear life. Jacob wants to cry, but if he breaks down, the
	kids will never have the courage for what they must do.

				JACOB
			(to his children)
		Children, listen to me. I love you two
		more than anybody. And I just want you 
		to know you've made me proud all your
		lives. But never more so than tonight.
		And I wish we could sit here and cry
		till I pass on, but we can't. Because
		I'm not going to pass on. I'm going to
		turn into a monster. And when I do,
		I'm going to be dangerous. But before
		that happens, just know I love you.
			(to Seth and the kids)
		Now, I'd say in the next twenty or
		thirty minutes our friends outside
		will bust in this door. And I'll
		probably turn into a vampire within
		the hour. Now, you have two choices.
		You can wait for me to turn, then deal
		with me, then wait for them to burst
		inside here and the three of you will
		deal with them. Or, we can kick open
		that door and the four of us can hit
		'em with everything we have, and carve
		a path right through 'em to front
		entrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em,
		we gotta go at 'em now. I confused
		them, I scared them, I took them off
		guard. But they're going to get
		unconfused, they're going to get
		unscared, they're going to get
		together and they're going to hit that
		door like a ton of bricks. And when
		that moment arrives, we gotta be
		ready.

	Jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled
	with boxes and crates.

				JACOB
		What's this stuff?

				SETH
		My guess is that this little dive's
		been feeding on nomad road waifs like
		bikers and truckers for a longtime.
		This is probably some of the
		shipments they stole off the trucks.

				JACOB
		Well, I say lets tear this place apart
		for weapons. So when they burst
		through that door, we'll make 'em wish
		they never did.

				SETH
		I don't give a shit about living or
		dying anymore. I just want to send as
		many of these devils back to hell as
		I can.

				JACOB
		Amen.

	MONTAGE

	The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A
	lot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee,
	teddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what the
	doctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield
	a shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy stores
	are a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of
	balloons. And captured en route to a hardware store are
	shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers.

	Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes.

	Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the
	backroom sink.

	Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet
	in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo.

	Vampires all start converging on the back room door,
	getting their courage back.

	Kate makes water balloons.

	Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth
	attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer.

	Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons,
	turning it into holy water.

	Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come.
	The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes,
	begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side.
	The room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching,
	pounding, squeaking and screaming.

	Finally they're ready.

	Jacob turns to his kids.

				JACOB
		Before we go any further, I need you
		three to promise me something. I'll
		fight with you to the bitter end,
		but when I turn into one of them, I
		won't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a
		lap dog of Satan. I want you three to
		promise you'll take me down, no
		different from the rest.

	The kids can't say the words.

				SETH
		I promise.

				JACOB
		Kate, Scott?

				KATE
		I promise.

				JACOB
		Scott?

				SCOTT
		Yeah, I promise.

	Jacob doesn't believe them.

				JACOB
		Why don't I believe you?
			(he picks up the .45)
		I'm gonna ask you two again, then I
		want you to swear to God that you'll
		kill me. If you don't, I'm gonna
		just kill myself right now. Now,
		since you need me I think you better
		swear. Kate, do you swear to God
		that when I turn into one of the
		undead, you'll kill me?

	Kate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his
	temple.

				JACOB
		Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm
		only gonna count to five. One...two...
		three... four...

				KATE
		Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!

				JACOB
		Not good enough, swear to God.

				KATE
		I swear to God, our father, that when
		you change into one of the undead, I
		will kill you.

				JACOB
		Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even
		less time, so I'm only giving you the
		count of three. One...

				SCOTT
		You don't believe in suicide.

				JACOB
		It's not suicide if you're already
		dead. Two...

				SCOTT
		Okay, I'll kill you when you change,
		I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.

				JACOB
		Thank you, son.

				SETH
		Okay, vampire killers, let's kill some
		fuckin' vampires.


	INT. BARROOM - NIGHT

	The vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKING
	down the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst through
	the door.

	Waiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns
	and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like
	grenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden
	stakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holding
	the jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room
	into the bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside.

	What we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la "The Wild
	Bunch." A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps just
	watch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then,
	like the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by
	starting up the jackhammer.

				SETH
		Kill 'em all!

	Jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react.

	The kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire
	flesh.

	The pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk
	forward.

	They are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards
	the door.

	Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds
	in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in
	green vamp blood.

	Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand
	and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the
	other.

	Flame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit.

	Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and
	toss them into the crowd.

	They burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming
	in pain.

	From its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and
	HURLS toward the group.

	Jacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES.

	The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.

	Seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming
	the hammer stake into vampire chests.

	The front door is barricaded again by a big table and other
	junk.

				SCOTT
			(yelling)
		Why did they block the door again?

				JACOB
			(yelling)
		To keep the daylight out! This is
		where they sleep! Get to the door!

	Seth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a
	half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from
	above in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The
	Sex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth
	off the ground.

	Seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room,
	he CRASHES into a table.

	The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer
	sticking out of his chest, dead.

	Kate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She
	screams:

				KATE
		Seth!

	Seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires
	on all sides. With no weapons, he puts up on dukes.

				SETH
		Okay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite
		and feel all right!

	Kate clusters with her father and Scott.

				KATE
			(yelling)
		I'm going for 'em!

				JACOB
		No!

				KATE
		Everybody goes home!

	Kate turns into a squirt gun firing, water-balloon throwing,
	one-woman army, as she breaks from her father and heads in
	Seth's direction.

				KATE
			(screaming)
		Die, monster, die! Die, monster, die!

	Kate mows down the group by Seth, they lie on the floor,
	burning in agony. Kate takes Seth's hand and gives him a
	couple of water balloons and a stake.

				KATE
			(to Seth)
		Watch my back!

				SETH
		Anytime.

	Cutting through vampires, the two make their way across the
	bar.

	Jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in
	fiery death.

	Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons.

	As Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He
	can't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts
	to hear the words: "Thirst, thirst, thirst." He notices the
	vampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit
	happy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow.
	His eyes are yellow.

	Scott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster.

	Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and
	sinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody
	murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood.

	Scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and
	SMASHES it against Jacob's head.

	The holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go
	of Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor.

	Scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it
	up to fire.

	A totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares
	with the boy he once called his son.

	Scott's eyes turn to steel.

				SCOTT
		I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's
		name.

	He FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead,
	creating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire
	head bursts into flames, then explodes.

	From across the room, Fate sees her daddy ignite. She
	cries out. In the thick of the battle, Seth yells:

				SETH
		Fight now, cry later.

	Kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face
	with a holy water balloon, which melts his head.

	A bat-thing lands on the back of Scott's neck. He screams as
	it bites into him. He drops the .45.

	Kate sees Scott get bit.

				KATE
		Oh my god.

	Another bat-thing lands on Scott's arm and takes a bite.
	Scott screams.

				KATE
		You bastards!

	She goes to spray them when her Uzi runs out of water.

	Now seven bat-things are on Scott biting and sucking blood.
	Scott is in agony.

				SCOTT
		Kill me, Kate! 

	Kate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming
	up by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three
	times.

	One... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then
	all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott.

	The remaining vamps approach.

	All the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy
	balloon.

				SETH
		How many bullets left, kid?

				KATE
		Not many.

				SETH
		Well, when you run out of weapons,
		just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em
		sing for their supper.

	The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat
	things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth
	throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two
	bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor.

	The two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before
	them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands
	holding the .45, arm outstretched.

				KATE
			(to Seth)
		Should I use the last bullets on us?

				SETH
		You use 'em on the first couple of
		these parasites that try to bite you.

	The vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights
	on the face of an approaching vampire.

	Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first
	vampire's head that gets in swinging distance.

	Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot
	through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched
	vamps scream like they've never screamed before.

				SETH
		Shoot more holes!

	Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall
	behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and
	Seth with a safe, lighted area.

	The .45's empty.

	The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being
	able to get at them.

	The two survivors hold hands, when...

	All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on
	from the outside.

	The vamps look towards it in horror.

	From the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a
	Spanish accent.

				VOICE (O.S.)
			(in Spanish)
		I'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in
		there?

				SETH
			(yelling)
		Carlos!
			(in Spanish)
		Help us, bash the door. Bash the door
		in!

				CARLOS (O.S.)
			(in Spanish)
		Danny, Manny, knock down the door.
		Hurry, hurry!

	The vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly
	around the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto
	each other.

	The front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from
	the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the
	door.

	The table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward.

	The door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps
	are instantly fried, bursting into flames.

	The Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and
	MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves
	in fright.

	Vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight
	hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending
	hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room.
	Vamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps
	combust in fiery explosions.

	The Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control.

	Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through the
	door into the parking lot.


	EXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING

	Carlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk
	them away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by
	Carlos's Mercedes.

				CARLOS
			(to Seth)
		What the fuck was going on in there?

	Seth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his
	breath. Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in the
	kisser. Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth.

				CARLOS
			(in Spanish)
		Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?

				SETH
		Why the fuck, outta all the god
		forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you
		have us rendezvous at that place?

				CARLOS
		I don't know, one place's as good as
		another.

				SETH
		Have you ever been there before?

				CARLOS
		No, but I passed by it a couple of
		times. It's out in the middle of
		nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place,
		so there wouldn't be a lot of police.
		And it's open from dusk till dawn.
		You said meet you in the morning.

				SETH
		Well, because you picked that place
		out of a hat, my brother's dead now.
		And this girl's family's dead.

	Carlos stands up again.

				CARLOS
		I'm sorry to hear that. What were
		they, psychos?

				SETH
		Did they look like psychos? They
		were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't
		explode when sunlight hits 'em, I
		don't care how crazy they are.

	Danny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing
	themselves again.

				CARLOS
		Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up
		to you?

				SETH
		You can't, but fifteen percent instead
		of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a
		good start.

				CARLOS
		Twenty-eight.

				SETH
		Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's
		dead and he's not coming back, and
		it's all your fault. Twenty.


	They look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.

				SETH AND CARLOS
			(in Spanish)
		Twenty-five.

	Seth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over
	to a red 1990 Porsche 911.


				CARLOS
		You like the car?

				SETH
		I said new, this is an '90.

				CARLOS
		It's hardly been used at all. I got it
		from a drug dealer who only drove it 5
		times in as many years. Swear to God.
		That's like new.

				SETH
		So do I just follow you?

				CARLOS
		Yeah, follow us.


				SETH
		So let's do it.

				CARLOS
			(to Danny and Manny)
		Vamanos!

	Carlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes.

	Seth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate.

	Kate stands alone.

	The whole desert seems between them.

	So much to say ... but no words.

				SETH
		I'm sorry.

				KATE
		Me too.

	Long pause.

				SETH
		See ya.

				KATE
		Later.

	Seth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate
	says behind him:

				KATE (O.S.)
		Seth.

	Seth turns around.

				KATE
		You want some company?

	Seth smiles.

				SETH
		Kate honey, I may be a bastard. But
		I'm not a fuckin' bastard.

	He blows her a kiss across the desert.

	She blows one back.

	Seth's in his car and GONE.

	Kate turns around, faces endless desert before her, and
	begins her long walk home.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

	A convenience store in a Texas Suburb. No other businesses
	surround it.

	CLOSE-UP: A light switch is flipped on.

	The sign on top of the store lights up. It reads: BENNY'S
	WORLD OF LIQUOR.

	TITLE CARD:

				BIG SPRING, TEXAS
			   109 MILES WEST OF ABILENE
			345 MILES EAST OF THE MEXICAN BORDER

	A Texas Ranger patrol car pulls into the parking lot and
	a real live Texas Ranger, EARL MCGRAW, steps out. McGraw is
	in full ranger uniform - button shirt, cowboy hat, boots,
	mirrored shades, tin star and a colt revolver on his hip.

	It's about an hour and a half before sundown and McGraw is
	off duty for the day.

	The only other car in the parking lot is a 1975 Plymouth


	INT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

	A young Hawaiian Shirt wearing man named PETE sits on a
	stool behind the counter.

	A few CLOSE-UP:STOMERS fiddle about.

	A MAN wearing a black suit, black tie, and wire rim
	glasses holds hands with a PRETTY BLONDE GIRL in cutoffs and
	bare feet. They look through magazines.

	Another black suit wearing MAN holds hands with a RED-HEADED
	GIRL in a prep school uniform. They look through the
	beer cooler in the back of the store. Both girls are around
	seventeen.

	MCGRAW enters the store.

				MCGRAW
		Hot goddamn day!

				PETE
		Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with
		the air conditioner blastin' all day
		long.

				MCGRAW
		Not even for lunch?

				PETE
		I'm by myself today, ate my lunch
		outta the microwave.

	McGraw walks over to the beer cooler, as if done ritually
	every night (it is), takes out a beer, pops it open and
	joins Pete by the front counter.

				MCGRAW
		Jesus Christ man, that microwave food
		will kill ya as quick as a bullet.
		Those burritos are only fit for a
		hippie high on weed. Pull me down a
		bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin'
		tanked tonight.

				PETE
		Whatsamatter?

				MCGRAW
			(sighs)
		Awww, it's just been a shitass day.
		Every inch of it hot and miserable.
		First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip
		got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid
		boy of hers was workin' the grill.
		That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit
		from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast
		at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a
		blanket like a sick dog by ten
		thirty.

				PETE
		Isn't there a law or something
		against retards serving food to the
		public?

				MCGRAW
		Well, if there ain't there sure oughta
		be. Who knows what goes on inside 
		Mongoloid's mind?

				PETE
		You could sue the shit out of her, ya
		know. That kid belongs under a circus
		tent, not flippin' burgers. You could
		own that fuckin' place.

				MCGRAW
		What the hell would I do with that
		grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got
		enough of a cross to bear just taking
		care of that potato head. Then all
		this Abilene shit happened. You
		heard about that bank robbery in
		Abilene, didn't ya?

				PETE
		That's all that's been on the box
		all day. They killed some people
		didn't they?

				MCGRAW
		Four Rangers, three cops, and two
		civilians. And they took a lady bank
		teller as a hostage.

	Pete doesn't say anything.

				MCGRAW
		They'll probably make a run for the
		border, which would bring 'em this
		way. And if we get our hands on
		those shit asses, we're talking
		payback time. We'll get 'em all right.
		I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your
		commode.

				PETE
		Knock yourself out.

	McGraw drops his last drip of beer, crushes the can and
	exits in the bathroom.

	The black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and,
	with the prep school girl in tow, walks rapidly toward Pete.
	We see that the girl is crying.

				BLACK SUITED MAN #1
			(to Pete)
		Do you think I'm fuckin' playing with
		you, asshole?
			(points to the tearful prep
			 school girl)
		Do you want this little girl to die?
			(pointing to the blonde with
			 the other guy)
		Or that little girl? Or your
		bosombuddy with the badge? Or
		yourself? I don't wanna do it, but
		I'll turn this fuckin' store into the
		Wild Bunch if I even think you're
		fuckin' with me.

	The two men in black suits are the notorious Abilene
	bank robbers, SETH and RICHARD GECKO, "The Gecko Brothers."
	And the other customers are all being held hostage. Seth
	is the one with the prep girl. Richard is the one with
	the blonde.

	Everybody speaks low and fast.

				PETE
		What do you want from me? I did what
		you said.

				SETH
		Letting him use your toilet? No store
		does that.

				PETE
		He comes in here every day and we
		bullshit. He's used my toilet a
		thousand times. If I told him no,
		he'd know something was up.

				SETH
		I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta
		here, in his car, and down the road or
		you can change the name of this
		place to "Benny's World of Blood."

	Richard, holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl,
	leans next to Seth's ear and whispers something. Seth looks
	at Pete.

				SETH
		Were you giving that pig signals?

				PETE
		What? Are you kidding? I didn't do
		anything!

	Richard whispers something else in Seth's ear.

				SETH
		He says you were scratching.

				PETE
		I wasn't scratching!

				SETH
		You callin' him a liar?

	Pete controls himself.

				PETE
		I'm not calling him a liar, okay? I'm
		simply saying that if I was
		scratching, and if I did scratch, it's
		not because I was signaling the cop,
		it's because I'm fuckin' scared
		shitless.

	Richard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to
	Seth.

				RICHARD
		The Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't
		I just go in there, blow his head off
		and get outta here.

				PETE
		Don't do that! Look, you asked me to
		act natural, and I'm acting as natural
		-- in fact, under the circumstances, I
		think I ought get a fuckin' Academy
		Award for how natural I'm acting. You
		asked me to get rid of him, I'm doing
		my best.

				SETH
		Yeah, well, your best better get a
		helluva lot fuckin' better, or you're
		gonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot
		worse.

	The toilet FLUSHES.

				SETH
		Everybody be cool.

	Everybody goes back to what they were doing.

	McGraw steps back out of the back. He appears to be unaware
	of the situation.

				MCGRAW
		Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at
		it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit
		in front of the box and just drink
		booze. How much is the bottle?

				PETE
		Six-fifty.

	Out of nowhere Richard WHIPS out his forty-five automatic
	and SHOOTS McGraw in the head.

	McGraw goes down screaming.

	Richard stands over him and SHOOTS him twice more.

	Seth charges forward.

				SETH
			(to Richard)
		What the fuck was that about?

				RICHARD
			(in a low monotone)
		He signaled the Ranger.

				PETE
			(hysterical)
		I didn't.
			(to Seth)
		You gotta believe me, I didn't.

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		When they were talkin', he mouthed
		the words "Help Us."

				PETE
		You fuckin' liar, I didn't say shit!

	Richard SHOOTS Pete and Pete falls down behind the counter.

	Seth grabs Richard and throws him up against the wall.

				SETH
		What the fuck is wrong with you --

				RICHARD
		Seth, he did it. You were by the beer
		cooler with your back turned. I was by
		the magazines, I could see his face.
		And I saw him mouth:

	Richard mouths the words, "Help Us."

	While Pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding
	from his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls
	out a gun from it.

	Seth releases his brother.

				SETH
		Start the car.

				RICHARD
		You believe me don't cha?

				SETH
		Shut up and start the car.

	Richard walks away from Seth and crosses the counter...

	...when Pete SPRINGS up, gun in hand, and SHOOTS Richard in
	the hand.

	Richard FALLS to his knees, howling.

	Both Pete and Seth SPRAY the store with gunfire.

	Seth DIVES down an aisle. He reloads.

	Pete DUCKS behind the counter. He reloads.

	Richard has crawled to safety behind an aisle.

	The two girls have run out screaming.


				SETH
			(yelling)
		Richie? You okay?

				RICHARD
			(yelling)
		I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot!
		I told you that bastard said, "Help
		us!"

				PETE
			(yelling)
		I never said help us!

				SETH
			(yelling)
		Well that don't matter now, 'cause
		you got about two fuckin' seconds
		to live! Richie!

				RICHARD
			(yelling)
		Yeah?

				SETH
			(yelling)
		When I count three, shoot out the
		bottles behind him!

				RICHARD
		Gotcha!

				SETH
		One... Two... Three.


	The two brothers start FIRING toward the counter.

	They HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete.

	Pete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol
	RAIN down on him.

	Seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf.

	Richard keeps FIRING.

	Seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on
	fire with his Zippo, then tosses it.

	The flaming roll of paper towels FLIES through the air.

	The fireball lands behind the counter.

	The entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Pete
	screams from behind the counter.

	Seth smiles to himself and stands.

	Richard shakes his head in amusement and stands.

	Pete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES
	still holding his weapon and FIRING.

	Seth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's.

	Pete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess
	Pastry display.

	Seth and Richard rise from the rubble.

				SETH
		What did I tell you? What did I tell
		you? Buy the road map and leave.

				RICHARD
		What am I supposed to do, Seth?
		He recognized us.

				SETH
		He didn't recognize shit.

	Both Seth and Richard stand on opposite sides of the car.

				RICHARD
		Seth, I'm telling you, the way he
		looked at us -- you especially --
		I knew he knew.


	They both climb in the car, Seth behind the wheel. Seth

	his hand, pops them in his mouth, and washes it back with a
	slug of Jack Daniel's from a pint bottle.

	Richard looks at Seth through the hole in his hand. Like a

		238 MILES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER


	INT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

	Emma and Pete's PATRONS are made up of regulars, truckers,
	cowboys and road-weary travelers. The CAMERA DOLLIES through
	the maze of tables, patrons, and waitresses.

	It stops when it gets to a table occupied by the FULLER
	FAMILY. The Fullers definitely fall into the road-weary
	category. The members of the unit consist of the father,
	JACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edges,
	and his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who
	possesses what can only be described as an apple pie
	sensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl,
	complete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's
	Vietnamese adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired kid
	who always wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy metal
	garage band he plays guitar for, "Precinct 13." The three
	of them are wolfing down a late lunch.

				JACOB
		We got about two more hours of day
		light left. That'll get us into
		El Paso, which is right next to the
		border. We'll stop at a motel --

				SCOTT
		Stop? We're not going to actually
		stop at a motel, are we?

	Scott and Kate speak together, obviously repeating something
	that Jacob has said about three hundred times.

				SCOTT AND KATE
		We've got a Winnebago. We don't need
		those over priced roach havens. We're
		self contained.

				JACOB
		Okay, Okay, maybe I was a little
		overzealous, but give me a break, I
		just bought it.

	Scott and Kate continue the impersonation.

				SCOTT
		Why, just look at all this. You got
		your kitchen --

				KATE
		-- you got your microwave --

				SCOTT
		-- you got your sink --

				KATE
		-- you got your shower --

				SCOTT
		-- see this, television!

				KATE
		Feel this, real wood paneling. That's
		real wood, too, not that fake stuff.

				JACOB
		Unless you two wiseacres wanna be
		introduced to the joys of hitchhiking,
		what say we drop this?

				SCOTT
			(to Kate)
		The truth hurts.

				KATE
			(to Scott)
		It's the bitterest of pills.

				JACOB
		You two ought to start a stand-up
		act, because you're just wasting your
		humor on me.

				KATE
		Ain't it the truth.

				SCOTT
		Why do you want to stop?

				JACOB
		I'm exhausted.

				SCOTT
		Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us
		into Mexico.

	Jacob gives Scott a look that says, "You aren't touching my
	new motor home."

				JACOB
		I just bet you would. Don't even thin
		about it. Besides, I want to have one
		night's sleep in an
		honest-to-goodness bed. The beds in
		the home are okay, but they're not
		like a real bed.

				KATE
		Hey, if we go to a motel, we can
		swim.

				SCOTT
		I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to
		the bathroom.

	Scott gets up from the table and walks out back to the
	restroom.

	Jacob and Kate are left alone. There's an awkward moment of
	silence before...

				KATE
		Dad, when I called the machine to
		check our messages there was one from
		Bethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he
		wouldn't permanently replace you until
		we came back. He said when we come
		home, if you still feel the same
		way --

				JACOB
		That's very nice of Ted, but I'll
		call him tomorrow and tell him not
		to bother waiting.

				KATE
		I didn't want to talk about this in
		front of Scott because he gets upset.
		But you don't believe in God
		anymore?

				JACOB
		Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I
		know this is hard on you kids. After
		Jenny's death, this is probably the
		last thing you need. But I can't do
		it any longer. My congregation needs
		spiritual leadership. Well, they can't
		get that from me anymore. My faith is
		gone. To answer your question, yes,
		I do believe in Jesus. But do I love
		them? No. After Jenny died, I just
		thought, what's the point?

				KATE
			(pushing him)
		It's just, all our lives you've been
		a pastor. For twenty years you've
		preached trust in the lord. And then
		one day you wake up and say fuck him?

				JACOB
		I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not
		connected anymore.

				KATE
		That happens, you'll get it back.

				JACOB
		Kate, give your old man a little
		credit. Every person who chooses the
		service of God as their life's work
		has something in common. I don't care
		if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun,
		a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many,
		many times during your life you'll
		look at your reflection in the mirror
		and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've
		all done it. I'm not going through a
		lapse. What I've experienced is closer
		to awakening. I'm not trying to shake
		your faith. I've just decided not to
		devote my life to God anymore.

				KATE
		What do you think Mom would say?

				JACOB
		Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

				SETH
		Don't say a word.

				SETH
		Let me help you.

	He helps him get his jacket off.

				SETH
		How's it feel?

				RICHARD
		How ya think, it hurts like a

	Richie goes over to the bed and lies down on it. Seth takes
	the pillow and stacks them for Richie to prop his back up
	against.

				SETH
		I got both rooms on either side of us,

				HOSTAGE
		About seven.

				SETH
		Good. I'm going towards the border to

				RICHARD
		Hey, when you talk to him, see if you
		can arrange a better deal than thirty
		percent.

				SETH
		That's their standard deal, brother.
		They ain't about to change it for us.

				RICHARD
		Did you even to try to negotiate?

				SETH
		These guys ain't spic fire cracker

		know the meaning of the word "barter".
		You wanna stay in El Ray? You give
		them thirty percent of your loot. It's

		percent.

				RICHARD
		All I'm saying --

				SETH
		-- This conversation is over.

	Richie shrugs and turns back to TV, Seth turns to the
	hostage, grabs a chair and slides it up in front of her.

				SETH
		Now, we need to have a talk. What's
		your name?

				HOSTAGE
		Gloria.

	He shakes her hand.

				SETH
		Hello, Gloria, I'm Seth and that's my
		brother Richie. Let's cut to the
		chase. I'm gonna ask you a question
		and all I want is a yes or no answer.
		Do you want to live through this?

				GLORIA
		Yes.

				SETH
		Good. Then let me explain the house

		along like a house on fire. Rule number
		one: No noise, no question. You make a
		noise...
			(he holds up his .45)
		...Mr. 45 makes a noise. You ask a
		question, Mr. 45 answers it. Now are
		you absolutely, positively clear about
		rule number one?

				GLORIA
		Yes.

				SETH
		Rule number two: You do what we say,
		when we say it. If you don't, see rule
		number one.

	Seth takes the .45, places the barrel next to the woman's
	cheek. She squirms and shuts her eyes. He pulls back the
	hammer.

				SETH
		Rule number three: Don't you ever try
		and fuckin' run on us. 'Cause I got
		five little friends, and they all run
		faster 'n you can. Got it?

	She nods her head yes.

	He takes the gun away and replaces the hammer.

				SETH
		Open your eyes.

	She does.

				SETH
		Gloria, you hang in there, follow the
		rules, and don't fuck with us, you'll
		get out of this alive. I give you my

	She nods her head yes.

	Seth rises.

				SETH
		I'll be back in a bit.

	Richard looks to the TV, then looks to Gloria sitting
	across the room in the chair.


				RICHARD
		Wanna come up here on the bed and
		watch TV with me?


	You can tell she doesn't want to.

	He pats the empty space next to him.

		Don't worry, we'll get across. But
		when we do, where do we go?
			(pause)
		Can we make it as close to the border

		The quicker we're in your protection,

		Okay, where?

				STANLEY CHASE
		For the time being we are very

		enforcement and the Texas Rangers
		have all joined forces in forming a
		dragnet to snare Seth and Richard
		Gecko.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Agent Chase, does it appear that they
		are heading for Mexico.

				STANLEY CHASE
		Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already
		alerted the Mexican authorities. They
		intend to cooperate every way possible
		in bringing these fugitives to
		justice.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Are you optimistic about the safety of
		the hostage they took in Abilene,
		Gloria Hill?

				STANLEY CHASE
		We've received no news one way or the
		other. We can only hope for the best.

				KELLY HOUGE
		What about the report from an
		eyewitness at the liquor store who
		said one of the brothers was shot?

				STANLEY CHASE
		This can't be confirmed at this time,
		but we do believe it to be true. We
		have reason to believe it was the
		youngest brother Richard, and he was
		shot in the vicinity of his neck and
		shoulders by the store's clerk.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Is it safe to assume that because the
		death count involved and the loss of
		life of law enforcement officers, that
		the Bureau, the Rangers and the police
		force are taking this manhunt
		personally?

				STANLEY CHASE
		I would say that's a very safe
		assumption.

		the fuck ya been?

				SETH
		Sight seein'.

				RICHARD
		What'd ya see?

				SETH
		Cops.

				RICHARD
		Didya look at the border?

	Seth dumps the burgers on the bed. Both men pop open beers
	and Richard goes to town on a hamburger. Seth flips off
	the TV

				SETH
		Yeah, I saw the border. Through
		binoculars from on top of a high
		building. That's about as close as I
		risked getting. What's the TV say?

				RICHARD
		They're going to apprehend us in
		forty-eight hours.

	Seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		I gotta figure a way to get across
		that goddamn border. Longer we fuck
		around El Paso our lives ain't worth
		a shit.

				RICHARD
		Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig
		in and wait for things to cool down.

				SETH
		Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin'
		worse before it gets any fuckin'
		better. We showed our ass in Texas. We
		killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They
		ain't gonna stop lookin' till they
		find us, and when they find us,
		they're gonna kill us. Texans take it
		very personal when ya kill their law
		enforcement officers. The El Paso
		police have already started a motel
		and hotel search for us.

				RICHARD
		How do you know?

				SETH
		I heard it on the radio. We gotta get
		our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos
		is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a
		rendezvous on the other side, then
		Carlos and his boys will escort us to
		El Ray and --

	Seth stops talking and looks around.

				SETH
		Where's the woman?

				RICHARD
		What?

	Seth's out of his chair.

				SETH
		What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin'
		woman, the hostage. Where the fuck
		is she, Richard!?

				RICHARD
		She's in the other room.

				SETH
		What the fuck is she doin' there?!

	He goes to the door of the adjoining room.

				RICHARD
		Seth, before you open the door, let
		me explain what happened.

	Seth stops and looks at his brother. He knows what he means.
	He can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling.
	Then he BURSTS open the door.

	The dead, naked body of Gloria Hill lies on the bed. It's
	obvious Richard raped her and killed her.

	Seth covers his eyes with his hands. He slowly enters the
	room with the dead body.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you?

	Richard rises from the bed.

				RICHARD
		Now, Seth, before you flip out, let me
		just explain what happened.

	Seth slowly turns to his brother, then walks toward him.

	Richard backs up.

				SETH
		Yeah, explain it to me. I need an
		explanation. What's the matter with
		you?

				RICHARD
			(low and calm)
		There's nothing wrong with me,
		brother. That woman tried to escape
		and I did what I had to do.

				SETH
		No.
			(pause)
		That woman wouldn't of said shit if
		she had a mouthful.

				RICHARD
		Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
		wrong, wrong! Once you left, she
		became a whole different person.

				SETH
			(slowly approaching)
		Is it me? Is it my fault?

				RICHARD
		It's not your fault, it's her fault!

	Seth grabs Richard and THROWS him in the corner of the room,
	holding tightly to his wrist.

				SETH
		Is this my fault? Do you think this
		is what I am?

				RICHARD
		What?

				SETH
		This is not me! I am a professional
		fucking thief. I steal money. You try
		to stop me, god help you. But I don't
		kill people I don't have to, and I
		don't rape women. What you doin' ain't
		how it's done. Do you understand?

				RICHARD
		Seth, if you were me --

				SETH
		Just say yes! Nothing else, just say
		yes.

				RICHARD
		Yes.

				SETH
		Yes, Seth, I understand.

				RICHARD
		Yes, Seth, I understand.

	Seth hugs his little brother. Tight.

				SETH
			(whispers in Richie's ear)
		We get into Mexico, it's gonna be
		sweet Rosemary, hundred-proof liquor,
		and rice and beans. None of this
		shit's gonna matter.


	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

	Scott and Kate are in the front seat of their parked motor
	home. The motor home's parked in front of the Dew Drop
	Inn's front office. We see Jacob inside getting a room from
	the Old-Timer.

				KATE
		I can't believe he's stopping here.
		This place looks totally cruddy.

	Jacob walks out of the office. Kate yells from the motor
	home.

				KATE
		Dad, why are we stopping here?

	He opens the meter home door and climbs in.

				JACOB
		There's nothing wrong with this
		place.

				KATE
		It's a flop house.

				JACOB
		It's not a flop house. It's basic
		and simple. That doesn't make it a
		flop house.

				KATE
		If it doesn't have a pool, we're
		looking for a new place.

	Starting the huge car and slowly maneuvering it through the
	courtyard.

				JACOB
		It has a bed. That's all I care about.

				KATE
		Other places have beds, they also have
		cable TV, a gym, room service...


	EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

	Seth walks out of room #9 with a beer in his hand. He's
	thinking about how he's going to get over the border
	tonight. Lost in thought, he steps out in the path of the
	Fuller's motor home.

	Jacob slams on the brakes. Seth jumps back, startled. Both
	Kate and Scott are TOSSED out of their seats onto the floor.
	THUD... THUD...

				KATE
		Owww, my head.

	Jacob (pissed) honks his horn at Seth and yells out the
	window.

				JACOB
		Watch where you're going!

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD

	Seth just stands right in their way without moving, gazing
	up at the giant motor home.

	JACOB BEHIND THE WHEEL

	Kate and Scott join him up front looking at this weirdo.

				SCOTT
		What's this guy's problem?

				JACOB
		I have no idea.

	Seth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to
	move. Not threatening, just looking at them.

	HONK!

				JACOB
		Anytime, man.

	The horn snaps Seth back to this world. A smile breaks out
	on the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one
	side to let them pass.

	Pass they do!

				KATE
		Creepy guy.

	SETH

	The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's
	just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed
	unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the
	border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into
	room #9.


	INT. FULLERS' MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

	The Fullers are in room #12. It's identical to the one that
	the Gecko boys are in, except that the paintings above the
	beds are different. Jacob has fallen asleep in his clothes
	on the bed.

	Scott sits in a chair, headphones on, playing an unplugged
	electric guitar. Kate is nowhere in sight.

	KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK... on the door. Scott doesn't hear
	shit but his music. Jacob stirs a bit, but doesn't wake up.
	POUND... POUND... POUND... on the door. Jacob SPRINGS UP.
	He looks over at Scott, who, lost in guitar heaven, is
	oblivious of the knocker, then to the door.

				JACOB
			(yelling)
		What?

	From the other side of the door comes a friendly voice.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		I'm your neighbor in room 9, I hate to
		disturb you, but I'd like to ask a favor.

	Jacob swings his feet to the floor, stands up and walks to
	the door. As he passes Scott, he says, in his direction --

				JACOB
		I hope none of this is disturbing you.

	Scott can't hear him, but when he sees his dad look at him,
	he smiles.

	Jacob opens the door and sees...

	... Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the
	nicest guy in the entire world.

				RICHARD
		Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name is
		Don Cornelius. No, not the Don
		Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my
		lady friend need some ice and we don't
		seem to have an ice bucket. Could we
		possibly borrow yours? I'll bring it
		right back.

				JACOB
			(still partially asleep)
		Sure.

	We follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel
	ice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a
	couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks.

	He sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door
	closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him.

				JACOB
		What is this?

	Seth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground.

				SETH
		It's called a punch.

	Scott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him
	and instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's
	mouth.

				RICHARD
		Sit down.

	Scott lowers himself back down onto his seat.

				RICHARD
		Good boy.

	Jacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from
	his lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him.

				SETH
			(to Jacob)
		What's your name?

				JACOB
		Jacob.

				SETH
		Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass
		down on the bed. Make a wrong move and
		I'll shoot you in the face.

	Jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed.

				SETH
			(to Richard)
		Okay, move the Jap over there.

	Keeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise...

				RICHARD
		Upsy daisy.

	...guiding him over to the bed by his father.

	Richard removes the gun from Scott's mouth and stands next
	to his brother, looking down at their two hostages.

				SETH
			(to his hostages)
		What's the story with you two? You a
		couple of fags?

				JACOB
		He's my son.

				SETH
		How does that happen? You don't look
		Japanese.

				JACOB
		Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.

				SETH
		Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.

				JACOB
		What's this about, money?

				SETH
		It's about money, all right, but not
		yours. You see, me and my brother here
		are in a little hot water and we need
		your assistance.

	The door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad
	Kate walks in.

	The brothers spin their guns in her direction.

	Kate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet
	and move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun
	ready to spit.

				SETH
			(to Scott and Jacob)
		Stop!

	Jacob and Scott freeze.

	Richard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and
	positioning himself behind the terrified Kate.

				KATE
		What's going on?

				RICHARD
		We're having a wet bikini contest,
		and you just won.

				JACOB
			(to Kate)
		It's okay, honey. Everything's going
		to be all right.

				SETH
		Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't
		do nothin' stupid.
			(he turns to Jacob and Scott,
			 who are still standing)
		You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!

	They slowly sit.

	Richard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate.

	Both Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Both
	for their own reasons.

				SETH
			(to Jacob)
		Where are the keys to the motor home?

				JACOB
		On the dresser.

				SETH
		Richie, take the keys. Start that big
		bastard up, and drive it up front.

	Richard doesn't move from his position behind Kate. Kate
	feels his eyes on her. She slowly turns and looks at him.

	He looks in her face.

	CLOSE-UP KATE
		
	She smiles at him.

				KATE
		Richie, will you do me a favor and eat
		my pussy?

	CLOSE-UP RICHARD
		
				RICHARD
		Sure.


				SETH (O.S.)
		Richard!

	Richard's eyes go to Seth.

	Everybody is where they were. Kate never turned around.

				SETH
		Not when you get around to it, now.

	Without saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the
	room.

				SETH
			(pointing at Kate)
		You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and
		put on some clothes.

	She grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the
	bathroom.

	Seth GRABS her wrist.

				SETH
		You got three minutes. One second
		longer, I shoot your father in the
		face. Do you understand what I just
		said?

				KATE
		Yes.

				SETH
		Do you believe me?

				KATE
		Yes.

				SETH
		You damn well better. Go.

	She goes into the bathroom.

				JACOB
		Look, if you want the motor home, just
		take it and get out.

	Seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male
	hostages.

				SETH
		Sorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that
		easy.

	We hear the motor home "HONK" twice outside.

				SETH
		Get ready to move out, we're all going
		on a little ride.

	Jacob shakes his head "no."

				JACOB
		Not a chance.

				SETH
		Come again?

				JACOB
		If you're taking people, take me. But
		my kids aren't going anywhere with
		you.

				SETH
		Sorry, I need everybody.

				JACOB
		My children are not going with you,
		and that's that.

				SETH
			(angry)
		That's not fuckin' that...
			(holds up his gun)
		this is fuckin' this.
			(he calms down and looks
			 at Scott)
		Go sit over there.

	Scott gets up and walks to the other side of the room,
	leaving the two men alone. Seth speaks in a quiet,
	conversational tone.

				SETH
		I ain't got time to fuck around with
		you, so I'll make this simple. Take
		your kids and get in the car, or I'll
		execute all three of you right now.
			(he cocks the gun and puts
			 it right in Jacob's face)
		What's it gonna be, yes or no answer?

	Jacob looks at him.

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Good.
			(to Scott)
		Your old man's all right, he just
		saved your life.

	Seth BANGS on the bathroom door.

				SETH
		Times up, Princess.

	The bathroom door opens. Kate stands there, wearing a
	T-shirt, jeans and bare feet.

				SETH
		Okay, ramblers, let's get to rambling.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	The motor home with the powder-keg interior drives through
	the Lone Star night.


	INT. MOTOR HOME NIGHT

	Richard's in the back bed area with a gun trained on Kate
	and Scott. The two scared siblings hold hands.

				KATE
		Excuse me.

	Richard zeros in on her.

				RICHARD
		What?

				KATE
		Where are you taking us?

				RICHARD
		Mexico.

				KATE
		What's in Mexico?

				RICHARD
		Mexicans.

	He doesn't smile.

	In the front part of the motor home, Jacob sits behind the
	wheel, driving into the night. Seth sits in the passenger
	seat, going through Jacob's wallet and talking to him
	calmly.

				SETH
			(reading his driver's license)
		Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical,
		ain't it? What am I askin' for, of
		course it is.
			(motioning behind him)
		What are their names?

				JACOB
		Scott and Kate.

	Seth repeats the names as he thumbs through the wallet.

				SETH
		Scott and Kate... Kate and Scott...
		Scott Fuller... Kate Fuller...

	Seth comes to a snapshot of Jacob and his wife.

				SETH
		Who's this?

				JACOB
		My wife.

				SETH
		Where is the little lady?

				JACOB
		In heaven.

				SETH
		She's dead?

				JACOB
		Yes, she is.

				SETH
		How'd she die?

				JACOB
		Auto wreck.

				SETH
		Come on, gimme some more details.
		How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk
		kill her?

				JACOB
		No. It was a rainy night, the brakes
		on the car weren't great. She had to
		stop suddenly. She slid on the road,
		she crashed, she died.

				SETH
		Died instantly?

				JACOB
		Not quite. She was trapped in the
		wreck for about six hours before she
		passed on.

				SETH
		Whewww! Those acts of God really stick
		it in and break it off, don't they?

				JACOB
		Yes, they do.

	Seth looks back at the wallet. He sees Jacob's minister's
	license.

				SETH
		Is this real?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		I've seen one of these before. A
		friend of mine had himself declared
		a minister of his own religion. Away
		to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're
		doing, or are you the real McCoy?

				JACOB
		Real McCoy.

				SETH
		You're a preacher?

				JACOB
		I was a minister.

				SETH
		Was? As in not anymore?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Why'd ya quit?

				JACOB
		I think I've gotten about as up close
		and personal with you as I'm gonna
		get. Now if you need me like I think
		you need me, you're not gonna kill me
		'cause I won't answer your stupid,
		prying questions. So, with all due
		respect, mind your own business.

				SETH
		I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't
		be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this
		friendly. But you're right, enough
		with the getting to know you shit.
		Now, there's two ways we can play this
		hand. One way is me and you go round
		an' round all fuckin' night. The other
		way, is we reach some sort of an
		understanding. Now, if we go down that
		first path at the end of the day, I'll
		win. But we go down the second, we'll
		both win. Now, I don't give a rat's
		ass about you or your fuckin' family.
		Y'all can live forever or die this
		second and I don't care which. The
		only things I do care about are me
		that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and
		our money. And right now I need to get
		those three things into Mexico. Now,
		stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it
		you don't give a shit about seeing me
		and my brother receiving justice, or
		the bank getting its money back. Right
		now all you care about is the safety
		of your daughter, your son and
		possibly yourself. Am I correct?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		I thought so. You help us get across
		the border without incident, stay with
		us the rest of the night without
		trying anything funny, and in the
		morning we'll let you and your family
		go. That way everybody gets what they
		want. You and your kids get out of
		this alive and we get into Mexico.
		Everybody's happy.

				JACOB
		How do I know you'll keep your word?

				SETH
		Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with
		this shit.

				JACOB
		You want me to sit here and be
		passive. The only way being passive in
		this situation makes sense is if I
		believe you'll let us go. I'm not
		there yet. You have to convince me
		you're telling the truth.

				SETH
		Look, dickhead, the only thing you
		need to be convinced about is that
		you're stuck in a situation with a
		coupla real mean motor scooters. I
		don't wanna hafta worry about you all
		fuckin' night. And I don't think you
		wanna be worrying about my brother's
		intentions toward your daughter all
		night. You notice the way he looked
		at her, didn't ya?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Didn't like it, did ya?

				JACOB
		No, I didn't.

				SETH
		Didn't think so. So, as I was saying,
		I'm willing to make a deal. You
		behave, get us into Mexico, and don't
		try to escape. I'll keep my brother
		off your daughter and let you all
		loose in the morning.

				JACOB
		You won't let him touch her?

				SETH
		I can handle Richie, don't worry.

	The two men look at each other for some measure of trust.
	Seth sticks out his hand.

				SETH
		I give you my word.

	Seth can't help but think about the last time he gave his
	word.

				SETH
			(hand sticks out)
		My words, my law. Better you not take
		it, and that's just where we are,
		then take it and not mean it.

	Jacob takes his hand, but looks right into Seth.

				JACOB
		If he touches her, I'll kill him. I
		don't give a fuck how many guns you
		have, nothing will stop me from
		killing him.

				SETH
		Fair enough. You break your word, I'll
		kill all of you.
			(calling to the back)
		Kate, honey!

				KATE
		Yeah.

				SETH
		You must have a bible in here, don't
		cha?

				KATE
		Yeah, we got a bible.

				SETH
		Get it and bring it up here, will
		ya, please?

	Kate goes into a drawer, pulls out a bible and brings it up
	front.

				SETH
		Hold it right there, sweetie pie.
			(to Jacob)
		Put your hand on it.

	Jacob does.

				SETH
		Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't
		try to escape and you'll get us across
		the border.

				JACOB
		I swear to God I won't try to escape
		and I'll do my best to get you into
		Mexico.

				SETH
		You best better get it done, Pops.

	Seth places his hand on the Bible.

				SETH
		I swear to God I'll let you loose in the
		morning. And your daughter will be safe. And I
		also swear if you do anything to fuck me up,
		I'll slit all your throats.

	Richard turns to Kate.

				RICHARD

		We'll talk later.

	Kate still hasn't a clue what he means.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. THE MEXICAN BORDER - NIGHT

	Automobiles are lined up, waiting one by one to go into
	Mexico. Cop cars with their red and blue lights flashing
	are all over the place. Border Patrol men and Police are
	stopping all cars. Pulling up to the end of the line is the
	Fuller's mobile home.


	INT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

	Jacob at the wheel, Seth in the passenger seat. Seth jumps
	up and goes into action.

				SETH
		Okay everybody, it's show time.
		Richie, take Kate in the bathroom.

	Richard grabs the terrified Kate and drags her in the bathroom,

				SETH
		Scott, you come up front with your
		daddy.

	Scott does. Seth, keeping low, gets behind Jacob.

				JACOB
		I'm telling you, don't hurt her.

				SETH
		As long as you're cool, she'll be
		cool. What're ya gonna say?

				JACOB
		I don't have the slightest idea.

				SETH
		Well, you just keep thinkin' of that
		gun next to Kate's temple.

	Seth disappears into the bathroom with Kate and Richard,
	closing the door behind him.

	Father and son are alone for the first time since this whole
	thing began.

				SCOTT
		What are you gonna do?

				JACOB
		I'm gonna try and get us across the
		border.

				SCOTT
		No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that
		they're back there.

	Jacob is surprised to hear Scott say this.


	INT. BATHROOM - MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

	The bathroom, which consists of a shower, a toilet and a
	small sink, is a tight fit with three people in it.

	Richard has his back against the wall, with his arm around
	Kate, holding her in front of him. One hand is over her
	mouth, the other holds a .45 against her head.

	Kate's eyes are wide with fear.

	Seth stands, .45 in hand, ready to fire if the wrong person
	should open the door.

	Everybody talks low and quiet.

				RICHARD
		This isn't gonna work.

				SETH
		Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,

				RICHARD
		I just want to go on record as saying
		this is a bad idea.

				SETH
		Duly noted. Now, shut up.

	Everyone's quiet for a second, till Richard breaks it.

				RICHARD
			(to himself)
		They're gonna search the van.

				SETH
			(offhand)
		As long as you don't act like a
		fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.

				RICHARD
		What does that mean?

				SETH
			(distracted)
		What?

	Richard lets Kate go, she quickly moves to the side.

				RICHARD
		You just called me a fuckin' nut.

				SETH
		No, I didn't.

				RICHARD
		Yes, you did. You said as long as I
		don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying
		that I've been acting like a fuckin'
		nut.

				SETH
		Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay
		cool.

				RICHARD
		You meant that, but you meant the
		other, too.

	Kate can't believe what she's watching. Neither can Seth.

				SETH
			(serious as a heart attack)
		This ain't the time, Richard.

				RICHARD
			(his voice rising)
		Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a
		fuckin' nut, and where I come from,
		that stops the train on its tracks.

				SETH
			(real quiet and violent)
		Keep your voice down.

				RICHARD
			(quiet back)
		Or what?

	BACK TO JACOB AND SCOTT		

				JACOB
		Have you forgotten about your sister?

				SCOTT
		They're gonna kill us. They get us
		across the border, they're gonna take
		us out in the desert and shoot us.

				JACOB
		If they get over the border, they're
		gonna let us go.

				SCOTT
		Dad, I watch those reality shows.
		They never let anybody go. Any cop
		will tell you, in a situation like
		this, you get a chance, you go for it.
		This is our chance.

				JACOB
		What about Kate?

				SCOTT
		They're gonna kill her anyway. At
		least now with all these cops we've
		got a fighting chance.

				JACOB
		Son, I have this situation under
		control. I know exactly what I'm
		doing. You're going to have to trust
		me on this.

				SCOTT
		If trusting you means trusting those
		fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If
		you don't tell the cops, I will.


	Jacob grabs Scott by the front of his shirt, and yanks him
	to him.

				JACOB
		Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna
		do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear
		me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm
		running this show, I make the
		decisions.

				SCOTT
		He's running the show.

				JACOB
		I'm running the show. I make the
		plays, and you back the plays I
		make. Stop thinking with your fucking
		balls. Kate in a room with a couple of
		desperate men with nothing to fucking
		lose ain't the time to "go for it."
		I need your cover. Cover my ass.

	There's a HONK behind them.

	They both look out the window. It's their turn with the
	BORDER PATROL GUARDS. JACOB takes the wheel and drives up.

	A stern BORDER GUARD approaches JACOB'S window.

				BORDER GUARD
		How many with you?

				JACOB
		Just my son and I.

				BORDER GUARD
		What is your purpose in Mexico?

				JACOB
		Vacation. I'm taking him to see his
		first bullfight.

	BACK TO BATHROOM

				RICHARD
		I'm curious. What was the nuttiest
		thing I did?

				SETH
		This ain't the time.

				RICHARD
		Oh, I know, was it possibly when your
		ass was rotting in jail and I broke it
		out? Yeah, you're right, that was
		pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention
		stupid. But you know what? I can fix
		that right now.

	SETH HAULS off and PUNCHES Richard smack in the head.
	Richard HITS the floor, Guard, Jacob, and Scott hear
	Richard fall in the bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD
		What was that?

				JACOB
		Oh, that's just my daughter in the
		bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD
		You said it was just you and your son.

				JACOB
		I meant me, my son and my daughter.

	CLOSE-UP BORDER GUARD

				BORDER GUARD
		Open the door. I'm coming aboard.

	BACK TO BATHROOM

	CLOSE-UP KATE

	We can only see Kate's face. It's scared. We hear rustling
	around the bathroom, but we don't know what it is.

	Then it's quiet. Then we hear talking outside the door, but
	we can't make it out. Then we hear a knock.

				KATE
		I'm in the bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD (O.S.)
		It's the Border Patrol. Open up.

				KATE
		It's open.

	We hear the door open and see the light change on Kate's
	face. She's looking up.

	BORDER GUARD in the doorway looking in.

	HE SEES: Kate by herself, pants around her ankles, sitting
	on the toilet.

				KATE
		Do you mind? Shut the fucking door.

				BORDER GUARD
		Excuse me.

	He closes the door. Kate lets out a breath. We wait a beat,
	Seth pulls back the curtain in the shower, we see Richie on
	the floor of the shower knocked out.

	Seth and Kate meet eyes.

	He gives her the O.K. signal.

								  CUT TO:

	BACK WINDOW MOTOR HOME

	We see through the back window of the motor home, the border
	getting smaller as we drive away from it.

	Scott knocks on the bathroom door.

				SCOTT
		It's clear.

	Seth BURSTS out of the bathroom.

				SETH
		Goddamn, that was. intense!

	Seth goes to the back window. He sees the border getting
	farther and farther away. No cars following.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		We did it.
			(pause)
		We're in Mexico.

	Seth throws his head back and SCREAMS for joy.

	Kate, emerging from the bathroom, reacts to Seth's scream,
	along with Scott.

	Seth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of
	the van.

	Everybody else is still tense as shit. But Seth lets go of
	all his tension, and becomes a new man before our eyes. He
	turns to Kate.

				SETH
			(loud and happy)
		Come here, Kate!

	Kate, nervous, takes a step back.

	He charges for her. GRABS her, hugs her around her waist,
	and spins her around. When he lets her go, she stumbles
	dizzily onto the bed.

				SETH
			(to Kate)
		You were magnificent! You told him to
		shut the fucking door. I'm hiding in
		the shower, and I'm thinking to
		myself, "Did I just fuckin' hear what
		I just fuckin' heard? And what does he
		do -- he shuts the fucking door!

	Kate kind of half smiles.

				SETH
		If I was a bit younger, baby, I'd
		fuckin' marry you!

	Seth goes up front and slaps Jacob on the back.

				SETH
		I gotta hand it to ya, Pops, you
		raised a fuckin' woman.

	Jacob doesn't share Seth's enthusiasm, but he is relieved.

				JACOB
		We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico.
		Now it's time for your part, letting
		us go.

				SETH
		Pops, when you're right, you're right,
		and you are right.

				KATE
			(suddenly brightens)
		You're gonna let us go?

				SETH
		In the morning, darlin', in the
		morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are
		F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys
		through hell, and I know I've been one
		rough pecker, but from here on end you
		guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help
		me pick Richie up, and lay him down.
		Jacob, keep going on this road till
		you get to a sign that says, "Digayo."
		When you get to Digayo, turn this big
		bastard left, go on down for a few
		miles, then you see a bar called "The
		Titty Twister." From what I hear, you
		can't miss it.

				JACOB
		Then?

				SETH
		Then stop, 'cause that's where we're
		going.

	He slaps him once again on the back, and leaves to attend
	to Richard.

								  CUT TO:

	CLOSE-UP RICHARD without glasses. Unconscious, Seth slaps
	his face.

				SETH (O.S.)
		 C'mon, kid, wake up. Don't make a
		 career out of it.

	Richard starts coming to and opens his eyes. Seth sits at the
	foot of the bed.

				SETH
		You okay?

				RICHARD
			(disoriented)
		Yeah, I think so. What happened?

				SETH
		I don't know, you just passed out.

				RICHARD
		I did?

				SETH
		Yeah, we were just standing there. You
		said something about your shoulder
		hurting, then you just hit the ground
		like a sack of potatoes.

				RICHARD
		Really?

				SETH
		Yeah, when you fell your head smacked
		the toilet hard. It scared the shit
		outta me. Sure you're okay?

				RICHARD
		Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little
		fucked up.

				SETH
		Well, let me tell ya something, gonna
		clear your head right up. We are
		officially Mexicans.

				RICHARD
		What?

				SETH
		We are...
			(singing)
		"South of the border down Mexico way."

				RICHARD
		We are?

				SETH
		Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous
		right now. We get there, we pound
		booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts
		us to El Ray. And then me and you,
		brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya
		like them apples?

	Slowly shaking the cobwebs out of his head.

				RICHARD
		Far out.
			(pause)
		Where are my glasses?

				SETH
		They broke when you fell.

				RICHARD
		Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!

				SETH
		Don't worry about it, we'll get you
		some glasses.

				RICHARD
		What dya mean, don't worry about it.
		Of course I'm gonna worry about it,
		I can't fuckin' see.

				SETH
		When we get to El Ray, I'll take care
		of it.

				RICHARD
		Yeah, like a Mexican
		hole-in-the-wall's gonna have my
		fuckin' prescription.

				SETH
		It's not a big deal, unless you make
		it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy,
		Richie, stop bringing me down with
		bullshit.

	Jacob calls to the back.

				JACOB
		Guys! We're here.

								  CUT TO:

	A neon sign that flashes:

		THE TITTY TWISTER
		 Hiker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn

	Underneath the joint's proud name on the sign, and
	on top of "Biker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn" is a
	well-endowed woman, whose breast is being twisted
	by a neon hand.


	EXT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT
	The neon sign sits on top of the rudest, sleaziest, most
	crab-infested, strip joint, honky-tonk whorehouse in all of
	Mexico.

	The Titty Twister is located out in the middle of
	nowheres ville. It sits by itself with nothing around it for
	miles. A plethora of choppers and eighteen wheelers are
	parked out in front. The walls almost pulsate from the LOUD,
	RAUNCHY MUSIC within the structure. Signs cover the walls
	outside reading things like: 

	"NUDE DANCING", "WHORES", "BEER", "AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD",
	"BIKERS AND TRUCKERS ONLY", "OPEN DUSK TILL DAWN",
	"THURSDAY COCKFIGHT NIGHT", "WEDNESDAY DOGFIGHT NIGHT",
	"DONKEY SHOW MONDAYS", "EVERY FRIDAY BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT TO
	THE DEATH, FEATURING THE LOVELY SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM",
	"ATHENA AND DANNY THE WONDER PONY", and "THE SLEAZY TITTY
	TWISTER DANCERS."

	In the parking lot, a BIKER and a TRUCK DRIVER beat the shit
	out of each other, one with a pipe, the other with a hammer.
	A SECOND BIKER fucks a Titty Twister WHORE against the wall.
	A greasy man, known as CHET PUSSY, stands in the parking
	lot, soliciting customers through a Mr. Microphone.

				CHET
		Pussy, pussy, pussy! All pussy must
		go. At the Titty Twister we're
		slashing pussy in half! This is a
		pussy blow out! Make us an offer on our
		vast selection of pussy! We got white
		pussy, black pussy, Spanish pussy,
		yellow pussy, hot pussy, cold pussy,
		wet pussy, tight pussy, big pussy,
		bloody pussy, fat pussy, hairy pussy,
		smelly pussy, velvet pussy, silk
		pussy, Naugahyde pussy, snappin'
		pussy, horse pussy, dog pussy, mule
		pussy, fake pussy! If we don't have
		it, you don't want it!

	The Fullers' recreational vehicle pulls into the parking
	lot and stops.


	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

	What's left of the Fuller family and the Gecko family look
	out the windshield onto the sight that is the Titty Twister.

				SETH
			(to the group)
		Okay, troops, this is the homestretch.
		Here's the deal; this place closes at
		dawn. Carlos is gonna meet us here
		sometime before dawn. Which by my
		guesstimate is somewhere between three
		or four hours from now. So we're gonna
		go in there, take a seat, have a drink
		-- have a bunch of drinks, and wait
		for Carlos. That could be an hour,
		that could be three hours, I don't
		know which. But when he gets here,
		me and Richie are going to leave
		with him. After we split, you guys
		are officially out of this stewpot.
		Let me just say I'm real happy about
		where we're at. We got a real nice, "I
		don't fuck with you -- you don't fuck
		with me" attitude going on. Now, if
		everybody just keeps playin' it cool
		-- and I'm talking to you, too, Richie
		-- everybody's gonna get what they
		want. Comprende, amigos?

	Everybody nods and mutters in agreement.

				SETH
		Okay hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
		I'm buyin'.


	EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
	The camper door FLIES OPEN and the two brothers and the
	Fuller family step out into the night.

	They look across the parking lot at the Titty Twister.
	It literally looks in some ways like the entrance to hell.

				JACOB
		Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

				SETH
		Shit, I been to bars make this place
		look like a fuckin' 4-H club.

				RICHARD
		I gotta say I'm with Jacob on this. I
		been to some fucked up places in my
		time, but that place is fucked up.

	Seth can't believe it.

				SETH
			(in a baby talk voice)
		Aww-w, whatsa matter, is the little
		baby too afraid to go into the big
		scary bar?

	The two brothers square off, not like strangers fighting,
	but like brothers fight. They talk real quiet, but real
	personal.

				RICHARD
		That's what you think?

				SETH
		That's how you're lookin', Richie.

				RICHARD
		I'm lookin' scared?

				SETH
		That's what you look like.

				RICHARD
		You know what you look like?

				SETH
		No, Richie, what do I look like?

				RICHARD
		You're lookin' green.

	That's not what Seth expected to hear.

				SETH
		How?

				RICHARD
		Where are you right now?

				SETH
		What do you mean?

				RICHARD
		Where are you?

				SETH
		I'm here with you.

				RICHARD
		No, you're not. You're sippin'
		margaritas in El Ray. But we're
		not in El Ray. We're here --
		getting ready to go in there.
		You're so pleased with yourself
		about getting into Mexico, you
		think the job's down. It ain't.
		Get back on the clock. That's a
		fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around
		there for a coupla hours, in all
		likelihood, we'll get fucked with.
		So get your shit together, brother.

				SETH
		My shit is together.

				RICHARD
		It don't look together.

				SETH
		Well, it is. Just because I'm happy
		doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're
		just not used to seein' me happy,
		'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin'
		years since I been happy. But my shit
		is forever together.

	Richard believes Seth's response.

				RICHARD
		Okay, just checkin'.

	They walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into
	the microphone.

				CHET
			(yelling into the microphone)
		Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.
		Buy any piece of pussy a tour regular
		price, you get another piece of pussy,
		of equal or lesser value, for a penny.
		Now try and beat pussy for a penny!
		If you can find cheaper pussy
		anywhere, fuck it!

	Chet notices our heroes, especially young Kate.

				CHET
			(in microphone, towards Kate)
		What's this? A new flavor approaching.
		Apple Pie Pussy.

				SETH
		Step aside, asshole.

	Chet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST.

				CHET
		Not so fast, Slick.

	Seth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till
	the BONE SNAPS in two.

	Chet lets out a SCREAM.

	Seth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's
	NOSE.

	Chet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth.

	Seth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that
	SNAPS Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK.

	After HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight
	to Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER.

	Chet is OUT.

	The whole altercation took two seconds.

	Everyone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at
	everyone.

				SETH
		Now, is my shit together, or is my
		shit together?

	Richard and Seth laugh with each other.

				RICHARD
			(slappin' Seth five)
		Your shit is forever together!

	They head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second,
	and gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks,


	INT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT

	If the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world
	from the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, "You
	ain't seen nothin' yet." This is the kind of place where
	they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood
	and the beer at closing.

	In the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers,
	while a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played
	at ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage
	BAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of
	bikers and truckers.

	One of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his
	name is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in
	the saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is
	ATHENA, his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the
	crowd.

	Bikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out
	here about one every ten minutes. The customers may start 'em,
	but the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em.

	Seth, Richard, Jacob, Scott and Kate walk through the door.
	They each individually take in the sights and the smells.
	Seth is the first to say something.

				SETH
		Now this is my kinda place! I could
		become a regular.

	The man behind the bar is RAZOR CHARLIE. He eyes the group
	as they approach.

	Their difference from the usual road waif nomads who
	populate the Twister disturbs him. He exchanges a knowing
	look across the room with Big Emilio, as the group bellies
	up to the bar.

				SETH
		Whiskey!

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(in English)
		You can't come in here.

				SETH
		What dya mean?

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		This is a private club. You're not
		welcome.

				SETH
		Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough
		to drink here?

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		This bar is for bikers and truckers
		only.
			(points his finger to Seth)
		You, get out!

	Big Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places 
	HIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seth's shoulder.

				BIG EMILIO
			(to Seth in Spanish)
		Walk, Pendaho.

	Seth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder.

				SETH
			(low)
		Take your hand off me.

				BIG EMILIO
			(Spanish)
		I'm going to count to three.

				SETH
		No, I'm going to count to three.

				BIG EMILIO
		Uno...

				SETH
		Two..

	Jacob jumps in the middle.

				JACOB
		Now wait a minute, there's no reason
		to get ugly. There's just a
		misunderstanding going on here. You
		said this bar is for truckers and
		bikers, Well, I'm a truck driver.

	Everybody looks at Jacob.

	As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet.

				JACOB
		If you look outside your door, parked
		in your parking lot, you'll see a big
		ass recreational vehicle. That's mine.
		In order to drive that legally, you
		need a class two driver's license.
		That is the same license that the
		DMV requires truck drivers to carry
		in order to drive a truck.
			(he takes the license out
			 of his wallet and lays it
			 on the bar)
		That is me, and this is my class two
		license. This is a truck driver's bar,
		I am a truck driver, and these are
		my friends.

	Everybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech.

	Razor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at
	everyone in the party and smiles.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(to Jacob)
		Welcome to the Titty Twister. What
		can I get you?

	Seth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio's paw.

				SETH
		Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.

	Razor Charlie's eyes go to Seth. Even though he has a big
	smile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill Seth.
	But instead he just says,

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		Coming right up.

	Razor Charlie goes for the bottle. Big Emilio gives the
	party one last look and walks away. Richard gives Jacob a
	buddy punch on the shoulder.

				RICHARD
		Good job, Pops.

	Seth's still frying an egg on his head.

				SETH
		That's just fuckin' typical. Biggest
		number one problem with Mexico, it's
		not service oriented. I was feelin'
		so good, and those fuckin' spies
		brought me down.

	Richard puts his arm around Seth.

				RICHARD
		Fuck 'em, shake it off.

	Razor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. Seth looks
	at the guy, still pissed.

				SETH
		You serve food, Jose?

	Razor Charlie knows Seth's taunting him with a racial slur,
	but he just smiles and says,

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		Best in Mexico.

				SETH
		I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a
		table, send over a waitress to take
		our order.

	Seth walks away, and the group follows him.

	We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor
	Charlie's head.

	The five of them move across the floor to a table. As they
	walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments
	from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter.

	The dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested,
	wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him.

	Richard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.

				RICHARD
		Anytime you want a lap dance with that
		broad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo.

	He gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the
	surroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange
	words about the party in Spanish.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(in Spanish)
		They're not the normal road trash we
		normally feed on. But it'll be okay.
		No one knows they're here.

	The five of them find a table and sit down.

	Seth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey
	bottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass.

				SETH
		Who else?

				JACOB
		Pass.

				SETH
			(picking a fight)
		Why not, against your religion?

				JACOB
			(won't be baited)
		No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking
		now.

				SETH
		Suit yourself, more for me.
			(to Scott)
		Scotty?

	Scott shakes his head no.

				SETH
			(to Kate)
		How 'bout you?
			(pointing at Scott and Kate)
		are safer in here with us than
		wandering around a Mexican border town
		all night long. Just don't do nothin'
		stupid and we'll all get along fine.
			(to Scott)
		Scotty, you sure you don't want a
		drink?

				SCOTT
		Okay, I'll have one.

				JACOB
		No you won't.

	Seth pours Scott a shot.

				SETH
		Sorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I
		don't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms
		up, boy.

	Scott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an
	on-drinker's tremor.

	Seth turns to Kate.

				SETH
		How about you, cutie pie? Ready for
		round two?

				KATE
		Okay.

	Seth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and
	knocks it back.

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you
		just created a monster.

	Jacob turns to Seth and asks quietly.

				JACOB
		Why are you so agitated?

				SETH
		I'm still stewing about that ape
		laying hands on me. And that fuckin'
		bartender sticks a weed up my ass,
		too.

				JACOB
		He backed down.

				SETH
		He's smilin' at us. But behind his
		smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack."
		I hear that loud and clear.

				JACOB
		What are you going to do?

				SETH
			(picking up the whiskey bottle)
		I'm gonna just sit here and drain
		this bottle. And when I've drunk the
		last drop, if I still feel then, the
		way I feel now, I'm gonna take this
		bottle and break it over his melon
		head.

				JACOB
		Before we stepped in here, you told
		all of us to be cool. That means you,
		too.

				SETH
			(tossing it off)
		I never said do what I do, I said do
		what I say.

				JACOB
		Are you so much a fucking loser, you
		can't tell when you've won?

	Richard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can
	believe what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays
	down his drinking glass.

				SETH
		What did you call me?

				JACOB
		Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I
		asked a question. Would you like me to
		ask it again? Very well. Are you such
		a loser you can't tell when you've
		won?
			(pause)
		The entire state of Texas, along with
		the FBI, is looking for you. Did they
		find you? No. They couldn't. They had
		every entrance to the border covered.
		There's no way you could get across.
		Did you? Yes, you did. You've won,
		Seth, enjoy it.

	Seth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle.

				SETH
		Jacob, I want you to have a drink with
		me. I insist.

	Jacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze
	in Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses.

				SETH
		To your family.

				JACOB
		To yours.

	They both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down.

				JACOB
		Now, is your shit together?

				SETH
		Forever together.

	Seth turns to Scott.

				SETH
		In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take
		it that's yours.

				SCOTT
		Yeah, it's mine.

				SETH
		Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.

								  CUT TO:

	Seth sitting at the table, playing guitar, singing Mexican
	songs. Some bikers, truckers, and whores have gathered
	around their table. Everyone's groovin'. Seth finishes the
	song. Everybody applauds.

	Razor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone
	that he uses to announce dancers.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(announcer voice in Spanish)
		And now for your viewing pleasure. The
		Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome
		of Evil. The most sinister woman to
		dance on the face of the earth. Lowly
		dogs, get on your knees, bow your
		heads and worship at the feet of
		SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM!

	The lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening
	notes of the Coaster's "Down in Mexico" fills the room.

	The crowd hushes up.

	And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.

	This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that
	Stendhal described in "As the Promise of Happiness," but
	the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.

	She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the
	stage, but like she owned the world.

	And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the
	world is proud to be her possession.

	All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the
	Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially
	Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and
	accompanies from the table with the guitar.

	When the music builds to its explosive section.

	Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the
	room.

	She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with
	the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up
	looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie
	and points at Seth's table, describing what happened.

	As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up
	from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.

	Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.

	Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard.
	She STANDS OVER him.

	While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky
	bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.

	She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her
	toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.

				SANTANICO
			(to Richard in Spanish)
		Drink up.

	Richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The
	CROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she
	surveys.

	Jacob and Scott are embarrassed.

	Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power
	this woman has over a man she's deathly feared.

	Seth laughs out loud a Mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keeping
	the beat with his guitar.

	Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions
	over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what
	Seth and company did to Chet.

	Richard continues to suck her toes.

	The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's
	mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks
	down at the seated Richard.

	She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His
	mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE
	OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey
	from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd
	applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob
	and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds,
	none louder than Seth.

				SETH
		Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what
		I call a fuckin' show!

	One of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe,
	which she puts on.

	Richard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.

				SETH
			(snapping his fingers)
		Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask
		your new friend to join us?

				RICHARD
		Yeah.

				SETH
		Well, then ask her, dumb ass.

				RICHARD
			(looking up at Santanico)
		Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to
		join us?

				SANTANICO
			(to Richard)
		Muy bien, gracias.

	Santanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.

				SETH
		Richie, you lucky bastard!
			(to Santanico)
		Now, little lady, you could of just as
		easily done that to me. Who a Nelly!
		You got my dick harder 'n Chinese
		arithmetic.

	The table laughs.

				SETH
		Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red
		Riding Hood is walking through the
		forest and she comes across Little Bo
		Peep, and Little Bo Peep says:
		"Little Red Riding Hood, are you
		crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf
		is walking these woods and if he finds
		you he's gonna pull down your dress
		and squeeze your titties?" Then Little
		Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt
		and taps a .357 Magnum she has
		holstered on her thigh and says: "No
		he won't."

	As Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big
	Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.

				JACOB
			(to himself)
		Oh, shit.
			(to Seth)
		Seth --

	Seth waves him away.

				SETH
		Not now. So finally she comes across
		the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad
		Wolf's laughing and says: "Little Red
		Riding Hood, you know better than to
		be walking around these woods alone.
		You know I'm just gonna have to pull
		down your dress and squeeze your
		titties." Then Little Red Riding Hood
		whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks
		it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and
		says: "No you won't. You're gonna eat
		me, just like the story says."

	Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard,
	Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say
	anything --

	The Titty Twister trio stand over the table.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(to Chet in Spanish)
		Which one?

				CHET
			(pointing at Seth)
		This piece of shit broke my finger
		and my nose...
			(pointing at Richard)
		then this fag kicked me in the ribs
		while I was down.

	That's all Big Emilio has to hear.

				BIG EMILIO
			(to The Gecko Brothers)
		Up!

				RICHARD
		Fuck off, ape man!

	Big Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by
	the shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from
	his wounded shoulder.

	Santanico steps back from the table.

	Seth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into
	Big Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor.
	Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake
	and SLASHES Seth across the face.

	Seth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to
	his laid open cheek.

	Richard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound,
	brings up his .45 and starts BLASTING.

	Razor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly
	before he hits the floor.

	Jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay
	out of gunfire.

	The bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what
	they were doing.

	The music continues to play, though the dancers stop
	dancing.

	Santanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells
	something.

	Her NOSTRILS FLARE.

	Richard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief
	and puts it to his face.

				RICHARD
		How are you?

				SETH
		Scarred for life, that's how I am!

	Seth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.

				SETH
		You thought it was pretty funny,
		didn't you?

	Both brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right...
	left... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards
	the crowd.

				SETH
		Everybody be cool, or you'll be just
		as dead as these fucks!

	SLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face.

	SLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor.

	The CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the
	waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.

	SLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls
	to the floor, splattering.

	WE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills
	her nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face
	could easily be read as intense sexual desire.

	CLOSE-UP KATE ON FLOOR

	Looks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's
	transformation.

	Her NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodent's. The whites
	of her eyes turn YELLOW. The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from
	her mouth. Kate yells from the floor.

				KATE
			(yelling)
		Richie, look out!

	Before Richie can turn around.

	SANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and
	SINKS her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER.

	Richard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM.

	Seth turns to his brother's cry.

	He sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached to
	a cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs buried
	deep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming
	about, trying to knock her off.

	Richard screams to Seth:

				RICHARD
		Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!

	Seth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He
	can't get a clear shot.

	Jacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing.

	Richard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico
	rides him down to the floor.

	Seth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the
	vamp in the head, blowing her off his brother.

	Richard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about
	half way before he stops, saying:

				RICHARD
			(with his dying breath)
		Fucking Bitch!

	He tumbles over, a corpse.

				SETH
		Richie.

	Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet
	Pussy pop open. The "dead" men sit up with evil grins on
	their faces.

	The patrons scream.

	A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock
	with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar
	and yells:

				WHORE
		Dinner is served!

	The bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching
	the impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers
	and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have
	turned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping
	VAMPIRES.

	The vamps attack.

	What follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been
	sitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven
	necks.

	Naked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other.
	Truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size.
	The patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the
	monsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades,
	anything.

	Jacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar.
	They hide and watch.

	Seth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand,
	too freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands
	motionless, watching what he can't believe.

	Behind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard,
	eyes POP OPEN.

	She RISES in her snake/dance way.

	Seth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised.

				SANTANICO
		Let's see if you taste as good as your
		brother.

	She approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM...
	CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her
	hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.

	Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the
	JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the
	FLOOR and INTO the WALL.

	A bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the
	side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a
	pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps.

	Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a
	switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the
	bar to the other.

	The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE,
	goes head to head with a stripper.

	The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has
	close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the
	vamp bitch blow for blow.

	Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head
	and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her
	on the wooden leg.

	FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie
	appears, straight razor in hand.

	Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor
	Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool
	cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie
	UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half.
	Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of
	the cue in Razor Charlie's heart.

	Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the
	vampire's death scream.

	Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He
	tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his
	chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but
	the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block
	placed on his chest.

				SANTANICO
		I'm not gonna drain you completely.
		You're gonna turn for me, You'll be
		my slave. You'll live for me. You'll
		eat bugs because I order it. Because
		I don't think you're worthy of human
		blood, you'll feed on the blood of
		stray dogs. You'll be my foot stool.
		And at my command, you'll lick the dog
		shit from my boot heel. Since you'll
		be my dog, your new name will be
		"Spot". Welcome to slavery.

	SLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing
		 end over end.

	CLOSE-UP SANTANICO

	looking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when
	the bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING.

	We see that Jacob behind the bar threw it.

	Santanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is
	momentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth.

	Seth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.

	Santanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes
	the liquor-soaked robe ignite.

	Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.

	Big Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry.

				BIG EMILIO
		Noooooo!

	He turns his hateful gaze on the two humans.

	Seth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they
	see him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to
	Jacob.

				SETH
		We may be in trouble.

	Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla
	walks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting
	vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp
	out Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack
	him, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed
	aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort.

	Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off
	Seth and Jacob.

	Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a
	weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.

	Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their
	wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him
	look like a huge walking shark.

	Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey, you, monkey man!

	Big Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room.

				SEX MACHINE
		Anything you gotta say to them, say
		to me first.

	Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He
	effortlessly knocks them away.

	They both hit the ground.

	Sex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to "come
	ahead."

	Big Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway
	locomotive.

	Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two
	huge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the
	Gargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one
	buckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio,
	who HITS the floor.

	Once on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp,
	BEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The
	vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the
	savage beating.

				SEX MACHINE
		That's enough.

	Jacob and Seth stop.

	Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the
	end tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into
	big vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and
	dies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead
	vamp.

	Chet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He
	breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from
	around his mouth.

	Kate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears
	over the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to
	protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his
	trouble. Chet dives at Kate.

				CHET
		You know what everybody says about me?
		I suck!

	Chet goes to bite Kate, grabbing at her t-shirt, and sees
	her crucifix. HE recoils backwards. Scott grabs hold of
	his head from behind. Kate jumps up from the floor, rips
	off her cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard, opening
	his mouth. She SHOVES the cross inside. Chet's eyes roll
	up back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.

	GULP.

	Chet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard
	moving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his
	mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. He
	jumps up from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain.
	He jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, screaming
	all the while.

	Kate and Scott watch him from the bar, mischievous grins on
	their faces.

	Chet is on his knees, arms stretched out, yelling at the top
	of his lungs like a vamp King Lear.

				CHET
		I-AM-IN-AGONNNYYYY!

	Chet breaks off a chair leg, muttering to himself.

				CHET
		Stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the
		pain, stop the pain, stop the pain...

	He plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the
	vampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being
	staked, Chet lets out a sigh of relief.

	By this time there are not too many people left. Most of the
	vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the
	customers have been butchered or drained.

	All that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers
	and two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his
	kids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who
	are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding
	wooden stakes.

	The four human men group together. The four female vampires
	charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood.
	Seth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and
	slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four
	staked bodies hit the floor.

	Kate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's
	side.

	They all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has
	taken place. The floor is littered with dead bodies.

				FROST
		Ain't they supposed to burn up or
		something?

	At that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating
	everyone's face. The sound of quick burning flames fills
	the air. Everybody shields their eyes from the intense
	light, which lasts only a split second.

	It vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All
	that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies
	once lay.

	They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN
	for the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's
	useless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging.

	Except for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over
	to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it.

	He takes his dead hand.

				SETH
		Richie, I'm sorry I fucked things up.
		You'd really like it in El Ray. We'd
		find peace there. I love you little
		brother, I'll miss ya bad.

	Seth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD 'S EYES
	POP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise.

				RICHARD
		I'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I
		love you, too.

	Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him
	down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away.
	He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down
	to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big
	bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him
	from Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have
	surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his
	head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a
	wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to
	where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the
	wood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth
	whips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.

				SETH
		Touch my brother with that stake,
		biker, and vampires won't need to
		suck your blood, they'll be able to
		lick it up off the floor.

				SEX MACHINE
		He ain't your brother no more.

				SETH
		That's a matter of opinion, and I
		don't give a fuck about your's.

	Jacob, Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to
	the ground.

				JACOB
		Don't be an idiot, he'll kill us all!

	Seth aims his gun at the group.

				SETH
		Shut up!

	Richard's giggling.

				RICHARD
		Yeah, shut up.

	Seth, still holding the outstretched gun, takes the stake
	out of Sex Machine's hand. Seth lowers the .45.

				SETH
		Hold him down.

	The smile evaporates from Richard's face.

				SETH
		Richie, here's the peace in death I
		could never give you in life.

	Seth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of
	his .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's
	heart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the
	body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo.
	Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar.
	He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate,
	of all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at
	the bar.

				KATE
		Are you okay?

				SETH
		Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The
		world's my oyster, except for the
		fact that I just rammed a wooden
		stake in my brother's heart because
		he turned into a vampire, even
		though I don't believe in vampires.
		Aside from that unfortunate business,
		everything's hunky-dory.

				KATE
		I'm really sorry.

				SETH
		Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half
		a chance you'd feed us to them!

				JACOB
		Then why didn't I?

	Jacob walks over to Seth.

				JACOB
		I saved your life. I didn't have to,
		but I did. And I'm sorry you lost your
		brother. I'm sorry he's dead. I'm
		sorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're
		gonna get out of this we need each
		other. And we need you sober and
		thinking, not drunk and...

	As Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has
	grown LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to
	identify it.

				JACOB
		What the hell is that?

				FROST
		At first I just thought it was birds.

				SEX MACHINE
		No, it's more of a gnawing sound.
		Birds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats
		gnaw.

	Seth puts the bottle in his hand down.

				SETH
		It's bats.


	EXT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

	The outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with
	hats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get
	inside.


	INT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

	Everybody listens to the bats SCRATCHING and clawing all
	along the walls, the roof and at the front door. Everyone's
	scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to
	do next. The door begins to crack and splinter, little
	claws poke their way through.

				JACOB
		Give me a hand!

	Jacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area
	the bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other
	items to help secure and barricade the door.

	As the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and
	the windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops
	open his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious
	activity. Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new
	friend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's
	putting a board into place. He springs to his feet and
	POUNCES on her, just as Sex Machine turns from across the
	room in her direction.

				SEX MACHINE
		Watch out, girly!

	The biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a
	scream. The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but
	she's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The
	others hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine,
	Big Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue.
	As the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out
	of Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the
	vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her
	and spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and
	SWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking
	the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the
	vamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one
	of the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's
	heart. He dies and bursts into flames.

	At that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting
	position. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the
	ground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.

				SEX MACHINE
			(mumbling to himself)
		Goddamn fuckin' vampires.

	The biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine, Vampire
	Hunter. He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their
	feet. Both SPEW green blood, scream, die and burst into
	flames. The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap,
	SMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for
	a loop.

	As CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS
	on his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a
	stack of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate
	by the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is
	lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine
	raises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the
	vamp's black heart. Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames,
	which hits the whiskey, starting a giant fire.

				SEX MACHINE
		Fire!

	Frost and Jacob stop barricading and run to the fire.

				FROST
			(to Sex Machine)
		We'll put this out. You stake the rest
		of these fuckers.

				SEX MACHINE
		Way ahead of ya.
			(to Kate)
		What's your name, girly?

				KATE
		Kate, what's yours?

				SEX MACHINE
		Sex Machine. Pleased to meet'cha.
		Kate, let's stake these blood-sucker
		fuckers.

	Kate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to
	work STAKING the dead bodies.

	Jacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and
	whatever else is at hand.

	A hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered
	over. Little claws scrape their way through. Scott stands
	in front of the window.

				SCOTT
			(yelling)
		We got a problem!

	Seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott's
	direction. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS
	a little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which is
	SQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its
	body through the newly formed hole.

	Seth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45,
	point-blank range at the head of the bat/rat.

	The bat/rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and YANKS
	his head back through the hole.

	Seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment,
	when...

	WHAM !

	The bat/rat BURSTS through the hole, like shot out of a
	cannon, HITTING Seth in the gut and sending him FLYING,
	LANDING HARD on his back.

	Once Seth hits the ground, the bat-thing (which has the body
	of a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity-split
	RUNS UP Seth's body to his juggler. Seth's hand GRABS the
	bat's neck, and tries to PUSH it away. But the bat-thing has
	its CLAWS DUG in Seth's clothes. The bat-thing is just
	inches from Seth's face. Its mouth is SNAPPING.

				SETH
		Get this bastard off of me!

	Frost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and
	GRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth.

	Sex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their
	preventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a
	dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The
	body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood
	squirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake
	down in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo.
	Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of
	his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him
	get bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy.

	Frost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in
	front of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a
	while, then...

	BASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some
	fight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head
	against the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the
	bat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a
	cup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's
	heart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of
	FLAMES, followed by a pile of goo.

	Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered
	window with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with
	the bat-thing.

	Jacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together,
	exhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue
	to try and claw their way in.

				JACOB
		Is everybody okay?

	Everyone mutters "yeah."

				JACOB
		Okay, does anybody here know what's
		going on?

				SETH
		Yeah, I know what's going on. We got
		a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside
		trying to get inside and suck our
		fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and
		simple. And I don't wanna hear any
		bullshit about "I don't believe in
		vampires" because I don't fuckin'
		believe in vampires either. But I do
		believe in my own two fuckin' eyes,
		and with my two eyes I saw fuckin'
		vampires! Now, does everybody agree
		we're dealin' with vampires.

	Everybody agrees.

				SETH
		You too, preacher?

				JACOB
		I'm like you. I don't believe in
		vampires, but I believe in what I saw.

				SETH
		Good for you. Now, since we all
		believe we're dealing with vampires,
		what do we know about vampires?
		Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a
		cross?

				JACOB
		In the Winnebago.

				SETH
		In other words, no.

				SCOTT
		What are you talking about? We got
		crosses all over the place. All you
		gotta do is put two sticks together
		and you got a cross.

				SEX MACHINE
		He's right. Peter Cushing does that
		all the time.

				SETH
		I don't know about that. In order for
		it to have any power, I think it's
		gotta be an official crucifix.

				JACOB
		What's an official cross? Some piece
		of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that
		official? If a cross works against
		vampires, it's not the cross itself,
		it's what the cross represents. The
		cross is a symbol of holiness.

				SETH
		Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses
		covered, moving right along, what
		else?

				FROST
		Wooden stakes in the heart been
		workin' pretty good so far.

				SEX MACHINE
		Garlic, holy water, sunlight... I
		forget, does silver do anything to a
		vampire?

				SCOTT
		That's werewolves.

				SEX MACHINE
		I know silver bullets are werewolves.
		But I'm pretty sure silver has some
		sort of effect on vampires.

				KATE
		Does anybody have any silver?

				ALL
		No.

				KATE
		Then who cares?

				SCOTT
		When's sunrise?

	Jacob looks at his watch.

				JACOB
		About two hours from now.

				KATE
		So all we have to do is get by for a
		few more hours and then we can walk
		right out the front door.

				SEX MACHINE
		Yeah, that's true, but I doubt our
		barricades, that door, those plastered
		windows and these walls will last two
		more hours with those bat fucks
		fuckin' with 'em.

				JACOB
		Has anybody here read a real book
		about vampires, or are we just
		remembering what a movie said? I mean
		a real book.

				SEX MACHINE
		You mean like a Time-Life book?

	Everybody laughs.

				FROST
			(in a cowboy voice)
		John Wesley Hardin, so mean he once
		shot a man for snorin'.

				JACOB
		I take it the answer's no. Okay then,
		what do we know about these vampires?

				SETH
		Aside from they're thirsty.

				FROST
		Well, one thing, they might got super
		human strength, but you can hurt 'em.

				JACOB
		Yeah, that bottle upside the head of
		Santanico didn't kill her, but it
		didn't feel too good either.

				SEX MACHINE
		Another thing, you try and ram a
		broken chair leg in a human, you
		better be one strong son-of-a-bitch.
		The human body is one rough-tough
		machine. But these vamps got soft
		bodies. The texture of their skin is
		softer, mushier. You can push shit
		right through 'em. Conceivably, if
		you hit one hard enough, you could
		take their fuckin' head off.

				SCOTT
		You could take their head off.

				SETH
		Actually, our best weapon against
		these satanic cocksuckers is this man.
			(he points at Jacob)
		He's a preacher.

	Frost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob.

				SETH
		As far as God's concerned, we might
		just as well be a piece of fuckin'
		shit. But he's one of the boys. Only
		one problem, his faith ain't what it
		used to be.

	Jacob PUNCHES Seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor.
	Jacob stands over him.

				JACOB
		I've had enough of your taunts.

	Seth looks up from the floor.

				SETH
		I'm not taunting you. We need you. A
		faithless preacher doesn't mean shit
		to us. But a man who's a servant of
		God can grab a cross, shove it in
		these monsters' asses. A servant of
		God can bless the tap water and turn
		it into a weapon.

	Seth rises.

				SETH
		I know why you lost your faith. How
		could true holiness exist if your wife
		can be taken away from you and your
		children? Now, I always said God can
		kiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I changed
		my lifetime tune about thirty minutes
		ago' cause I know, without a doubt,
		what's out there trying to get in
		here is pure evil straight from hell.
		And if there is a hell, and those
		monsters are from it, there's got to
		be a heaven. Now which are you, a
		faithless preacher or a mean,
		mother fuckin' servant of God?

	Jacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob
	sticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.

				JACOB
		I'm a mean, mother fucking servant of
		God.

	The laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only
	sound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing.
	It immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit
	they're in.

				KATE
		I don't know if I can take two hours
		of that noise.

				FROST
		You can. You'll take it 'cause ya got
		no choice. How'd ya like twenty four
		hours of it, lying in a muddy ditch
		with only the rotting corpses of your
		friends to keep you company?

				JACOB
		What are you talking about?

				FROST
		Back in '72 I was in Nam, trapped
		behind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole
		with my entire squad dead. They
		thought they killed everybody, and
		except for me, they were right. But it
		wasn't for lack of trying. A grenade
		blew up right next to me, that's why
		I'm so pretty.

	They thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all
	the bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing
	possum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me,
	listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after
	hour...

	As Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and
	the camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He
	can't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he
	doesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE
	say:

				MALE VOICE (V.O.)
		Thirst.

	"Who the fuck was that?" he thinks to himself. He turns
	around: nobody's there. No one else in the group seems to
	hear it, A FEMALE VOICE seductively says:

				FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
		Thirst.

	We hear Sex Machine's thought in a voice answer.

				SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
		Stop fucking saying that!

				TWO MALE VOICES (V.O.)
		Thirst!

				SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
		That bite weren't nothin'. It just
		hurt like a son-of-a-bitch, that's
		all. It barely punched the skin.

	Sex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The
	biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing
	all the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are
	many voices, male, female, children saying:

				VOICES (V.O.)
		Thirst... Thirst... Thirst...

	Sex Machine begins looking at the other members of the group
	in a thirsty way. He stares at each of their necks, closer
	and closer until he can see the veins on Frost's neck
	actually pulsating, throbbing, beckoning to him. Sex Machine
	has turned into a vampire.

	The sound comes back as Frost finishes his story.

				FROST
		...and then when I came back to my
		senses, I realized I had killed the
		entire V.C. squadron single handedly.
		My bayonet had blood and chunks of
		yellow flesh on it like some cannibal
		shish kabob. And to this day I don't
		have the slightest idea how I --

	Sex Machine lets out a hideous cry.

				SEX MACHINE
		THIRST!

	Frost SCREAMS as Sex Machine grabs hold of him and BITES
	into his neck.

	The group tries to PULL the TWO men apart.

	Jacob gets his arm around Sex Machine's neck and tries
	pulling.

	Sex Machine takes his teeth out of the biker's neck and
	SINKS them in Jacob's arm.

	Jacob SCREAMS and lets go.

	Seth, Kate and Scott react to Jacob being bit.

	Sex Machine GRABS Jacob and TOSSES him effortlessly over the
	bar, CRASHING into a shelf full of liquor bottles.

	Frost HOPS around the room, mad as a hornet, holding his
	bleeding neck.

				FROST
		I been bit! He fuckin' bit me!

	Sex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face, dropping him like a
	sack of potatoes.

	He smacks the shit out of Kate. She goes FLYING into a
	table.

	Sex Machine turns, seeing Frost breaking off a big table
	leg. Frost looks at the big vamp.

				FROST
			(to Sex Machine)
		You're dead, mother fucker! You're
		gonna bite me! You just turned me
		into a vampire, asshole!

				SEX MACHINE
		What are you gonna do about it?

	Frost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off,
	straight at Sex Machine.

	Sex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and
	pulls it back, so he can really haul off.

	Frost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets
	loose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the
	floor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face
	COLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so
	hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him
	through the air.

	Seth sees where Frost is heading and says:

				SETH
		Oh shit!

	Jacob sees.

				JACOB
		Good lord!

	Frost, in mid-air, HITS the barricaded, plastered overwindow
	and CRASHES through it.

	Sex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of
	bat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the
	hand and runs for the backroom.

	Behind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the
	ground.

	Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott,
	who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the
	back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An
	ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the
	door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard
	as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams,
	howls and snaps in fury.

	Seth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his
	.45 in its big mouth.

				SETH
		You wanna suck something, suck on
		this!

	He FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over
	the wall.

	Kate yells:

				KATE
		We have to go back for Daddy!

				SETH
		Daddy's dead.

				KATE
		Noooo!

	She spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door
	and help her father. Scott grabs her and pushes her up
	against the wall.

				SCOTT
		He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was
		too far away. If flinging that door
		and filling this room with those
		bat-things would save him, I'd fling
		it. The only thing it'll do is turn us
		into one of them.

				SETH
		He needs our help!

				SCOTT
		He's beyond our help. You saw him get
		bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it.
		You can't help him. I've got no one
		left to lose but you. I can't be alone
		again. We're sticking together.

	Just then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room.


	INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT

	Jacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting
	appropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at
	bay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of his
	restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is making
	his way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot of
	the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures.

	The creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of
	holiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad,
	whirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above and
	in front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of
	god. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire
	stake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bible
	in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone.
	As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost
	lying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a
	candy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even this
	repugnant sight trip him up.

	Jacob has backed himself up by the door.

				JACOB
		Open the door.

	The door FLIES open. Jacob jumps inside. The door SLAMS
	shut.

	Jacob hugs daughter and son. As he hugs them, we see his
	bloody arm.

	When he releases them, they can't help but notice.

				SETH
		Did he...?

				JACOB
		Yep.

	Seth explodes, knocking over boxes, busting chairs, tipping
	over tables and cussing a blue streak.

				SETH
		Fuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin'
		vampires! Mother fuckin' vampires!
		Goddamn mother fuckin' vampires!

	Seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the
	creatures on the other side.

				SETH
		You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm
		gonna fuckin' kill every last one of
		you godless pieces of shit!

				JACOB
			(to Seth)
		You bet your sweet ass you are, and
		I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't
		got much time.

	Kate is crying, she knows what's happened to her father.

				KATE
		You're gonna be okay, aren't you,
		daddy?

				JACOB
		No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect,
		I'm already dead.

	Scott and Kate, crying, grab their father and hold on for
	dear life. Jacob wants to cry, but if he breaks down, the
	kids will never have the courage for what they must do.

				JACOB
			(to his children)
		Children, listen to me. I love you two
		more than anybody. And I just want you 
		to know you've made me proud all your
		lives. But never more so than tonight.
		And I wish we could sit here and cry
		till I pass on, but we can't. Because
		I'm not going to pass on. I'm going to
		turn into a monster. And when I do,
		I'm going to be dangerous. But before
		that happens, just know I love you.
			(to Seth and the kids)
		Now, I'd say in the next twenty or
		thirty minutes our friends outside
		will bust in this door. And I'll
		probably turn into a vampire within
		the hour. Now, you have two choices.
		You can wait for me to turn, then deal
		with me, then wait for them to burst
		inside here and the three of you will
		deal with them. Or, we can kick open
		that door and the four of us can hit
		'em with everything we have, and carve
		a path right through 'em to front
		entrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em,
		we gotta go at 'em now. I confused
		them, I scared them, I took them off
		guard. But they're going to get
		unconfused, they're going to get
		unscared, they're going to get
		together and they're going to hit that
		door like a ton of bricks. And when
		that moment arrives, we gotta be
		ready.

	Jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled
	with boxes and crates.

				JACOB
		What's this stuff?

				SETH
		My guess is that this little dive's
		been feeding on nomad road waifs like
		bikers and truckers for a longtime.
		This is probably some of the
		shipments they stole off the trucks.

				JACOB
		Well, I say lets tear this place apart
		for weapons. So when they burst
		through that door, we'll make 'em wish
		they never did.

				SETH
		I don't give a shit about living or
		dying anymore. I just want to send as
		many of these devils back to hell as
		I can.

				JACOB
		Amen.

	MONTAGE

	The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A
	lot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee,
	teddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what the
	doctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield
	a shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy stores
	are a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of
	balloons. And captured en route to a hardware store are
	shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers.

	Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes.

	Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the
	backroom sink.

	Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet
	in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo.

	Vampires all start converging on the back room door,
	getting their courage back.

	Kate makes water balloons.

	Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth
	attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer.

	Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons,
	turning it into holy water.

	Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come.
	The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes,
	begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side.
	The room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching,
	pounding, squeaking and screaming.

	Finally they're ready.

	Jacob turns to his kids.

				JACOB
		Before we go any further, I need you
		three to promise me something. I'll
		fight with you to the bitter end,
		but when I turn into one of them, I
		won't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a
		lap dog of Satan. I want you three to
		promise you'll take me down, no
		different from the rest.

	The kids can't say the words.

				SETH
		I promise.

				JACOB
		Kate, Scott?

				KATE
		I promise.

				JACOB
		Scott?

				SCOTT
		Yeah, I promise.

	Jacob doesn't believe them.

				JACOB
		Why don't I believe you?
			(he picks up the .45)
		I'm gonna ask you two again, then I
		want you to swear to God that you'll
		kill me. If you don't, I'm gonna
		just kill myself right now. Now,
		since you need me I think you better
		swear. Kate, do you swear to God
		that when I turn into one of the
		undead, you'll kill me?

	Kate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his
	temple.

				JACOB
		Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm
		only gonna count to five. One...two...
		three... four...

				KATE
		Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!

				JACOB
		Not good enough, swear to God.

				KATE
		I swear to God, our father, that when
		you change into one of the undead, I
		will kill you.

				JACOB
		Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even
		less time, so I'm only giving you the
		count of three. One...

				SCOTT
		You don't believe in suicide.

				JACOB
		It's not suicide if you're already
		dead. Two...

				SCOTT
		Okay, I'll kill you when you change,
		I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.

				JACOB
		Thank you, son.

				SETH
		Okay, vampire killers, let's kill some
		fuckin' vampires.


	INT. BARROOM - NIGHT

	The vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKING
	down the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst through
	the door.

	Waiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns
	and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like
	grenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden
	stakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holding
	the jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room
	into the bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside.

	What we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la "The Wild
	Bunch." A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps just
	watch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then,
	like the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by
	starting up the jackhammer.

				SETH
		Kill 'em all!

	Jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react.

	The kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire
	flesh.

	The pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk
	forward.

	They are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards
	the door.

	Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds
	in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in
	green vamp blood.

	Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand
	and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the
	other.

	Flame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit.

	Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and
	toss them into the crowd.

	They burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming
	in pain.

	From its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and
	HURLS toward the group.

	Jacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES.

	The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.

	Seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming
	the hammer stake into vampire chests.

	The front door is barricaded again by a big table and other
	junk.

				SCOTT
			(yelling)
		Why did they block the door again?

				JACOB
			(yelling)
		To keep the daylight out! This is
		where they sleep! Get to the door!

	Seth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a
	half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from
	above in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The
	Sex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth
	off the ground.

	Seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room,
	he CRASHES into a table.

	The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer
	sticking out of his chest, dead.

	Kate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She
	screams:

				KATE
		Seth!

	Seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires
	on all sides. With no weapons, he puts up on dukes.

				SETH
		Okay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite
		and feel all right!

	Kate clusters with her father and Scott.

				KATE
			(yelling)
		I'm going for 'em!

				JACOB
		No!

				KATE
		Everybody goes home!

	Kate turns into a squirt gun firing, water-balloon throwing,
	one-woman army, as she breaks from her father and heads in
	Seth's direction.

				KATE
			(screaming)
		Die, monster, die! Die, monster, die!

	Kate mows down the group by Seth, they lie on the floor,
	burning in agony. Kate takes Seth's hand and gives him a
	couple of water balloons and a stake.

				KATE
			(to Seth)
		Watch my back!

				SETH
		Anytime.

	Cutting through vampires, the two make their way across the
	bar.

	Jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in
	fiery death.

	Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons.

	As Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He
	can't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts
	to hear the words: "Thirst, thirst, thirst." He notices the
	vampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit
	happy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow.
	His eyes are yellow.

	Scott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster.

	Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and
	sinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody
	murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood.

	Scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and
	SMASHES it against Jacob's head.

	The holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go
	of Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor.

	Scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it
	up to fire.

	A totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares
	with the boy he once called his son.

	Scott's eyes turn to steel.

				SCOTT
		I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's
		name.

	He FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead,
	creating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire
	head bursts into flames, then explodes.

	From across the room, Fate sees her daddy ignite. She
	cries out. In the thick of the battle, Seth yells:

				SETH
		Fight now, cry later.

	Kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face
	with a holy water balloon, which melts his head.

	A bat-thing lands on the back of Scott's neck. He screams as
	it bites into him. He drops the .45.

	Kate sees Scott get bit.

				KATE
		Oh my god.

	Another bat-thing lands on Scott's arm and takes a bite.
	Scott screams.

				KATE
		You bastards!

	She goes to spray them when her Uzi runs out of water.

	Now seven bat-things are on Scott biting and sucking blood.
	Scott is in agony.

				SCOTT
		Kill me, Kate! 

	Kate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming
	up by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three
	times.

	One... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then
	all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott.

	The remaining vamps approach.

	All the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy
	balloon.

				SETH
		How many bullets left, kid?

				KATE
		Not many.

				SETH
		Well, when you run out of weapons,
		just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em
		sing for their supper.

	The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat
	things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth
	throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two
	bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor.

	The two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before
	them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands
	holding the .45, arm outstretched.

				KATE
			(to Seth)
		Should I use the last bullets on us?

				SETH
		You use 'em on the first couple of
		these parasites that try to bite you.

	The vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights
	on the face of an approaching vampire.

	Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first
	vampire's head that gets in swinging distance.

	Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot
	through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched
	vamps scream like they've never screamed before.

				SETH
		Shoot more holes!

	Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall
	behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and
	Seth with a safe, lighted area.

	The .45's empty.

	The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being
	able to get at them.

	The two survivors hold hands, when...

	All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on
	from the outside.

	The vamps look towards it in horror.

	From the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a
	Spanish accent.

				VOICE (O.S.)
			(in Spanish)
		I'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in
		there?

				SETH
			(yelling)
		Carlos!
			(in Spanish)
		Help us, bash the door. Bash the door
		in!

				CARLOS (O.S.)
			(in Spanish)
		Danny, Manny, knock down the door.
		Hurry, hurry!

	The vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly
	around the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto
	each other.

	The front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from
	the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the
	door.

	The table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward.

	The door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps
	are instantly fried, bursting into flames.

	The Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and
	MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves
	in fright.

	Vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight
	hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending
	hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room.
	Vamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps
	combust in fiery explosions.

	The Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control.

	Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through the
	door into the parking lot.


	EXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING

	Carlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk
	them away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by
	Carlos's Mercedes.

				CARLOS
			(to Seth)
		What the fuck was going on in there?

	Seth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his
	breath. Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in the
	kisser. Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth.

				CARLOS
			(in Spanish)
		Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?

				SETH
		Why the fuck, outta all the god
		forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you
		have us rendezvous at that place?

				CARLOS
		I don't know, one place's as good as
		another.

				SETH
		Have you ever been there before?

				CARLOS
		No, but I passed by it a couple of
		times. It's out in the middle of
		nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place,
		so there wouldn't be a lot of police.
		And it's open from dusk till dawn.
		You said meet you in the morning.

				SETH
		Well, because you picked that place
		out of a hat, my brother's dead now.
		And this girl's family's dead.

	Carlos stands up again.

				CARLOS
		I'm sorry to hear that. What were
		they, psychos?

				SETH
		Did they look like psychos? They
		were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't
		explode when sunlight hits 'em, I
		don't care how crazy they are.

	Danny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing
	themselves again.

				CARLOS
		Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up
		to you?

				SETH
		You can't, but fifteen percent instead
		of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a
		good start.

				CARLOS
		Twenty-eight.

				SETH
		Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's
		dead and he's not coming back, and
		it's all your fault. Twenty.


	They look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.

				SETH AND CARLOS
			(in Spanish)
		Twenty-five.

	Seth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over
	to a red 1990 Porsche 911.


				CARLOS
		You like the car?

				SETH
		I said new, this is an '90.

				CARLOS
		It's hardly been used at all. I got it
		from a drug dealer who only drove it 5
		times in as many years. Swear to God.
		That's like new.

				SETH
		So do I just follow you?

				CARLOS
		Yeah, follow us.


				SETH
		So let's do it.

				CARLOS
			(to Danny and Manny)
		Vamanos!

	Carlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes.

	Seth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate.

	Kate stands alone.

	The whole desert seems between them.

	So much to say ... but no words.

				SETH
		I'm sorry.

				KATE
		Me too.

	Long pause.

				SETH
		See ya.

				KATE
		Later.

	Seth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate
	says behind him:

				KATE (O.S.)
		Seth.

	Seth turns around.

				KATE
		You want some company?

	Seth smiles.

				SETH
		Kate honey, I may be a bastard. But
		I'm not a fuckin' bastard.

	He blows her a kiss across the desert.

	She blows one back.

	Seth's in his car and GONE.

	Kate turns around, faces endless desert before her, and
	begins her long walk home.

							 FADE IN

	INT. BARGE - DAY

	Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps 
	down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern, 
	oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel 
	and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side.

	INT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light 
	on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She 
	kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking 
	in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.

	EXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a 
	rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean 
	by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. 
	It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which 
	means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north-
	west.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way 
	forward.

	EXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel 
	smoke rising from its massive turbine vents.

	Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and 
	professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific 
	Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her 
	true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts 
	and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be 
	considered pretty.

	She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches 
	to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto 
	the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the 
	bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing 
	that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward 
	the tug at the other end.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY

	DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's 
	name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge 
	(37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy 
	coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate 
	Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's 
	first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering 
	red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the 
	north.

	They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable 
	occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a 
	passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern 
	where the cable winds into a tow anchor.

				EPPS
		It's a slow leak.

	She unclips and drops to the deck.

				GREER
		What's slow?

				EPPS
		Maybe twenty gallons an hour.

				DODGE
		Where from?

				EPPS
		Amidships starboard at the beam.  
		Just under the waterline. I don't 
		think it's a problem.

				GREER
		Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think 
		it's a problem.

				DODGE
		I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar 
	and GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master, 
	pilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and 
	most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that 
	every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to 
	bet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE.

				GREER (V.O. RADIO)
		Greer to Murphy.

				MURPHY
			(lifting the radio)
		Go.

	Murphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up 
	at him from the stern.

				GREER
		The number nine on the starboard 
		side's half flooded. Epps says it's 
		a slow leak just under the waterline, 
		about twenty gallons an hour. They 
		must've pumped it before we left 
		Sitka.

				MURPHY
		Of course they did.

				GREER
		Let the buyer beware.

				MURPHY
		What do you say, Dodge?

				DODGE (V.O. RADIO)
			(taking the radio)
		If it started out at twenty an hour 
		the piece of shit'd be at the bottom 
		of the Gulf by now. Whether it'll 
		make St. Lawrence is anybody's guess.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY

	HIGH AND WIDE as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against 
	the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND - DAY

	The shores of St. Lawrence Island open into a small port 
	town of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior 
	approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one 
	side as it moves into the harbor.

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - LATER - DAY

	A smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the 
	listing barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie 
	her up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the 
	turbines.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat 
	Russian man, Vasili (60) and a MECHANIC in grease-covered 
	orange coveralls approach from the dock.

				VASILI
		I thought you say Tuesday.

				MURPHY
		Better late than never.

				VASILI
			(seeing the listing 
			barge)
		What's this?

				MURPHY
		You got a leak in the number nine 
		compartment.

				VASILI
		No, no. You got leak.

				MURPHY
		You pump it out and re-seam the hull, 
		she'll be good as new.

				VASILI
		That cost me twenty grand at least.

				MURPHY
		Fifteen, at the most.

				VASILI
		Twenty. You knock off twenty and 
		then we see. After my guy looks at 
		it.

	INT. VASILI'S OFFICE - DAY

	In a prefab office with a view of the shipyard, Vasili cuts 
	a check as Murphy and Greer look on. He tears it out of the 
	book, handing it across the desk to Murphy, who inspects it.

				MURPHY
		You're kidding, right?

				VASILI
		You want fair pay, make hamburger 
		for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to 
		sign.

	Vasili pushes a transfer register toward him. Murphy signs.

	EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY

	Greer and Murphy walk back toward the dock.

				GREER
		Not bad for dragging a leaky tub 
		half way to Russia.

				MURPHY
		He'll sell the scrap for three times 
		what he paid.

				GREER
		I must be in the wrong business.

				MURPHY
		You got that right.

				GREER
			(imitating Vasili)
		Better than "making hamburger for 
		Mickey D."

	INT. BAR - NIGHT

	A typical port town bar. Except this one is on an island in 
	the middle of the Bering Sea. Epps lines up a shot at the 
	pool table as a couple of SEAMEN check out her ass and a 
	tattoo of Wiley Coyote poking out of her pants. Greer reads 
	a paper near-by.

	Murphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a beer 
	and a cigarette. Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodge's 
	name on it. Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack 
	of hundreds.

				DODGE
		Much obliged, skipper.

	INT. BAR - LATER - NIGHT

	The place is a little more crowded now as Epps pushes her 
	way through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth. 
	She buys two beers and pays the BARTENDER from her envelope 
	of cash. She takes the beers back to the far wall where a 
	young off-duty COASTGUARDSMAN stands. He takes one, they 
	laugh.

	AT A TABLE

	Beers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them, 
	Dodge, Greer and Murphy look on at Epps across the room, who 
	is showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her neck.

				GREER
		Looks like Epps' gonna get some 
		tonight.

				DODGE
		With that coxswain dickhead.

				MURPHY
		You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?

				DODGE
		Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps?  
		Gimme a break.

	Greer and Murphy trade looks as Dodge raises his beer.

				DODGE
		What a laugh.

	A MINOR COMMOTION can be heard as they sit there.

				WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
		I'll show you, bitch!

	They look over to see the coastguardsman's GIRLFRIEND, late 
	20s, hefty in a red miniskirt and big hair.

				GIRLFRIEND
		You want to mess with me, I'll kick 
		your bitch ass, girl.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps coolly puts out her cigarette as a circle has gathered 
	around her and the girlfriend, anxious to see a girl fight.

				EPPS
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about. I just bought this guy a beer.

				GIRLFRIEND
		This "guy" is my man, honey.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Darlene --

				GIRLFRIEND
		You, shut up.

				EPPS
			(starting off)
		Listen, I don't want any trouble, 
		okay -- ?

				GIRLFRIEND
			(stopping Epps)
		Uh-uh. No. We're gonna fix this right 
		now.

				MURPHY
			(stepping up)
		What seems to be the trouble, ladies?

				RIVETER
		Whyn't you mind your own business, 
		chief.

	Murphy turns to see a shipyard RIVETER, a big man holding a 
	beer, still wearing his welding leathers. Murphy turns back 
	to Epps and the Girlfriend.

				MURPHY
		As I said, what seems to be the 
		trouble?

				RIVETER
		Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you 
		got your hearing aid turned down?

				MURPHY
		I heard you. But I'm choosing to 
		ignore you. Epps, let's go.

	Epps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking 
	Murphy by the collar.

				RIVETER
		These ladies was having themselves a 
		discussion and you're interrupting 
		it.

				MURPHY
		You got about two seconds to get 
		your paws off me, Tarzan.

				RIVETER
		Or what?

	Or WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks 
	in two over the Riveter's head.

	Dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half 
	he still holds, shaking his head.

	The Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs 
	buckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds 
	some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own.

				MURPHY
		Epps?

	He looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here. She 
	grabs her coat.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Wait.

	Epps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his 
	girlfriend.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Darlene. It's over.

	He gives her the ring from his finger. Murphy rolls his eyes 
	as the others look on.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		I don't love you anymore.

	Darlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her 
	on the back.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
			(to Epps)
		Come on, Candy. Let's get out of 
		here.

	The Coastguardsman takes her by the hand. Epps looks to Murphy 
	and the others as he leads her out.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps 
	approaches on the dock. She jumps down onto the deck, a spring 
	in her step and a song in her heart.

				EPPS
		Morning everybody.

				GREER
		Show your tatoos to that coxswain 
		last night, did you Epps?

				EPPS
		Showed him a hell of a lot more than 
		that.

				GREER
		I bet you did.

				MURPHY
		Candy?

				EPPS
		It's my pen name.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY

	Murphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from 
	the dock as Greer studies the dawn sky.

				GREER
		Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

				MURPHY
		Red sky in morning, sailor take 
		warning.

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the tug turns into the harbor channel, the sun rising 
	under a cloud bank of brilliant red and orange.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge and Epps play cards at the galley table.

				DODGE
		Fuck it.

	He puts down his hand. Epps takes another drag from her 
	cigarette, collecting her winnings.

				EPPS
		One more?

				DODGE
		Why not.

	She gathers the cards, shuffles.

				DODGE
		What is your first name?

				EPPS
		What?

				DODGE
		It just occurred to me I don't know 
		your first name. All this time and I 
		don't know it.

	She deals the cards in silence.

				EPPS
			(finally)
		Maureen.

				DODGE
		What?

				EPPS
		Maureen.

				DODGE
		Maureen?

	She looks on at him as he holds there, takes his cards.

				EPPS
		What's yours?

	Dodge takes a drag from his cigarette, thinking about it.

				DODGE
		Roger.

				EPPS
		Roger?

				DODGE
		Yeah.

	She wants to laugh, but only studies her cards.

				DODGE
		You think that's funny

				EPPS
			(lying)
		No.

	She takes a hit from her cigarette as she plays her hand.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - BERING SEA - NIGHT

	THE SONG "SOS" BY ABBA BLASTS as the tug plows westward 
	through a steady chop and a mild swell.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. Greer has the CD player cranked 
	as he mans the helm in the glow of the pilothouse. He checks 
	the radar, holds there a beat. He turns the MUSIC DOWN and 
	picks up a walkie-talkie.

				GREER
			(into walkie)
		Greer to Murphy.

	Greer studies the radar display as he waits.

				MURPHY (V.O. RADIO)
		Yeah.

				GREER
		There's a large vessel out about ten 
		miles to the north-west.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy sits at his desk over the ship's log, holding his 
	radio.

				GREER
		I been watching it for close to an 
		hour and it hasn't moved. I can't 
		raise it on the radio either. Makes 
		me think it might be in trouble.

				MURPHY
		Alright. I'll be right up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the sweep-refresh reveals a bright 
	point of light in the middle of nowhere.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Merchant vessel at position one seven 
		four one five west, five seven seven 
		five north.

	Murphy holds the radio mic as Greer looks on, Epps and Dodge 
	standing back.

				MURPHY
		This is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey 
		alpha sierra bravo four zero niner 
		two. Over.

	Only the quiet hiss of white noise comes back from the radio 
	speaker as the bright point flashes on the radar screen.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Merchant vessel at one seven four 
		one five west, five seven seven five 
		north, this is tugboat Arctic Warrior 
		whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero 
		niner two. Over.

	Again, only white noise comes back as the point flashes on 
	the screen.

				MURPHY
		Too deep to anchor out there.

				GREER
		Looks like it's adrift.

				EPPS
		Could be a fishing boat.

				GREER
		Too big. More like a freighter.

				MURPHY
		What the hell would a freighter be 
		doing up here? It's way out of the 
		lanes. There's not a port for 800 
		miles.

				DODGE
		Smugglers maybe.

				GREER
		Smuggling what? Tundra grass?

	A beat as Murphy holds there. He raises the radio mic.

				MURPHY
		Merchant vessel at position one seven 
		four one five west, five seven seven 
		five north, this is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior. Do you copy? Over.

	Again, only the quiet hiss of static comes back.

				GREER
		Call the Coastguard?

				MURPHY
		Steer to one eight five. Let's check 
		her out.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - NIGHT

	The Arctic Warrior cuts a foamy break in the ink black water.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the phantom point flashes closer.

	Murphy looks on as Greer pilots, Dodge and Epps watching.

				MURPHY
		Alright. Back it off.

	Greer throttles back and the boat slows.

				MURPHY
		Hit the lights.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The halogen flood lights flare to life, brilliantly 
	illuminating the water in front of the boat.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The four of them look intently into the darkness beyond the 
	light. Murphy reaches for the spot control, sweeping a broad 
	beam of light with a joy stick.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	As the tug moves along, servo motors sweep the searchlight 
	over the bow of the boat and into the darkness.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	They peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves, 
	when a shadow looms into view.

				MURPHY
		Whoa, whoa.

	Greer throttles down all the way and they drift, as the shadow 
	looms bigger before them in the light from the boat.

	As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting 
	bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness 
	above them. Murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of 
	what appears to be a large, darkened ship. As they come 
	around, the name "CHIMERA" can be seen above the anchor 
	alleys.

				MURPHY
		"Chimera."

	Murphy reaches for the mic, hits the LOUD HAILER.

				MURPHY
		Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The tug is dwarfed by the massive rusting hulk of the Chimera 
	rising above it.

				MURPHY (O.S. LOUD HAILER)
		This is civilian tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior. Is there anyone aboard?

	The quiet rumble of the tug's turbines is the only sound.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy raises the mic again.

				MURPHY
		Chimera, I am hove to at your port 
		bow. Is there anyone aboard?

	They wait, looking on at the silent, darkened ship under the 
	glare of their lights.

				MURPHY
		Epps, come with me. You guys sit 
		tight.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps and Murphy, in heavy parkas, climb a hydraulic deck 
	crane up to the Chimera as Dodge man's the controls against 
	the movement of the water.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer holds the tug steady as Epps and Murphy can be seen 
	making their way up under the floodlights.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck. Epps 
	jumps down behind him. Murphy throws his light up on the 
	superstructure. All remnants of paint have been rusted over, 
	lending a still darker ominousness to it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps move cautiously along, shining their lights 
	as they go. Despite the omnipresent corrosion, everything 
	seems to be in order. The decks are clear and there is no 
	apparent damage. They come to a hatchway. Epps shines her 
	light down the darkened passage. Murphy moves in.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps move down the passageway. Even the walls in 
	here are rusted. They come to a flight of stairs.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer and Dodge wait. Greer reaches for his radio.

				GREER
			(into radio)
		Talk to me, skipper.

	After a moment, Murphy comes back on the radio.

				MURPHY
		We're in a stairwell just under the 
		main superstructure.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps climb the darkened stairway.

				MURPHY
		This is definitely an old boat, maybe 
		sixty years old. She hasn't been in 
		service for at least twenty years. 
		Probably a lot longer.

	They top the stairs and walk into a wider passageway which 
	takes them into an open area. Their lights shine around them, 
	revealing sinks and counters and racks of old kitchen 
	equipment, a few pots still hanging.

	They move through the galley and into another, narrower, 
	passageway.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer and Dodge look on.

				MURPHY
		It's funny.

				GREER
		How's that?

				MURPHY
		Besides a little rust, everything's 
		pretty well-preserved.

	Greer and Dodge look at each other.

				MURPHY
		How she got out here is one hell of 
		a good question.
			(a long beat, then)
		Jesus.

	Dodge and Greer hold there, waiting. Only silence from the 
	other end.

				GREER
		What is it?

	No answer.

				GREER
		Murphy.

	No answer.

				GREER
		Murphy, goddamit.

				MURPHY
			(finally)
		Sorry.

	Another beat in silence.

				GREER
		What is it?

	INT. CHIMERA - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps stand at the top of a stairway, looking over 
	an immense ballroom. Murphy raises his radio.

				MURPHY
		It's a passenger ship. It's a damn 
		passenger ship.

	Though it is dark, there is enough light to see its ornate 
	opulence, tables and chairs in place near a large dance floor 
	and orchestra well, and a magnificent crystal chandelier 
	hanging over it all.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Epps and Murphy climb down the deck crane as Greer and Dodge 
	meet them at the bottom.

				MURPHY
			(jumping down)
		There's nobody on that boat.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge, Epps, Greer and Murphy sit around the galley table.

				DODGE
		Probably slipped her moorings, got 
		tangled up in a current.

				EPPS
		Out here? What, so a seven hundred 
		foot passenger liner drifted out of 
		Spokane harbor and nobody managed to 
		bump into her until now?

				DODGE
		Somebody's probably looking for her 
		as we speak.

				MURPHY
		Whatever the reason, she's adrift 
		and abandoned. We've got every right 
		to salvage her.

				GREER
		You mean tow her back? That's a thirty 
		thousand ton ship you're talking 
		about.

				MURPHY
		We've done it before.

				DODGE
		Yeah, from one side of the harbor to 
		the other. But we got half the Bering 
		Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to 
		drag her over.

				MURPHY
		You have any idea how much a ship 
		like that could be worth in salvage? 
		The fittings alone could go for a 
		few million.

				DODGE
		If you get it back in one piece.

				MURPHY
		It's a risk I'm willing to take.

				GREER
		All we got to do is hit some rough 
		weather and you can forget about it.

				MURPHY
		So we cut her loose and wait it out. 
		A little weather couldn't be anything 
		she hasn't seen before.

				DODGE
		It's a bloody navigation hazard.  
		One boat can't control a ship that 
		size.

				MURPHY
		The damn thing's been floating around 
		for God knows how long and it hasn't 
		hit anything yet. So we take it easy. 
		A little of the old push pull.

	A long beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Listen. Forget this job's just a pay 
		check for a minute. You know I've 
		been good to you. But I'm prepared 
		to offer you something better now.
			(a beat)
		If we do this right, it's worth a 
		lot of money. A lot of money.

	They hold there looking on at him, waiting.

				EPPS
		Go on.

				MURPHY
		Salvage fees on a vessel like this 
		could come in around four million 
		bucks. At least. Who knows, could be 
		more. Could be a lot more.
			(a beat)
		What I'm proposing is... we split it 
		four ways.

	A beat. Dodge looks to Epps and Greer.

				MURPHY
		Think about it. A million bucks a 
		piece.
			(a beat)
		You want to spend the rest of your 
		days drag-assing tank barges on the 
		gulf coast, fine. Otherwise, let's 
		get to work.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the Chimera. Greer 
	operates the deck crane, one of Dodge's mammoth cables 
	dangling from it down to the winch on the stern.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the 
	starboard anchor alley in the bow of the Chimera. Dodge pokes 
	his face out from the other side.

				DODGE
		Ready?

				EPPS
		Bring it on, dude.

	Dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with 
	a smaller pilot cable, which Epps takes and threads through 
	the loop at the end of the tow cable. She places the end of 
	the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten 
	it down, with the effect of joining the two cables.

				EPPS
		OK.

	Dodge disappears, pulling up the slack from the pilot cable 
	through the anchor alleys.

				DODGE (O.S.)
			(finally)
		Hit it!

	Epps reaches over and unhinges the crane hook and the tow 
	cable explosively drops, banging loudly against the Chimera's 
	hull with a shower of black rust.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge cranks a portable pulley winch on the deck, the pilot 
	cable slowly pulling the tow cable up through the anchor 
	alley.

	It is heavy and the winch shows the strain as Dodge cranks 
	it. He continues, when something gives in the winch mechanism 
	and the whole thing slides forward on the pilot cable, 
	entangling Dodge's leg and dragging him on his ass along the 
	deck.

	The tow cable creates a spray of rust and smoke as it spills 
	out of the anchor alley before Epps.

	Dodge slides toward the anchor alley like a piece of meat 
	toward a sausage grinder, when the winch slams into it and 
	stops dead, the cable continuing on with a loud shriek 
	dangerously close to his face, until...

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The last of the cable explosively whips out of the anchor 
	alley in front of Epps and splashes in the water below. A 
	beat as she holds there.

		Dodge? You alright?

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge lies tangled in the winch.

		Yes!

	Two tow cables extend from the Chimera's anchor alleys down 
	into the water and come up again from the water to the tow 
	anchor on the tug's stern.

	walkie.

				DODGE
		Alright, skipper, real easy.

		More.

	The tug slows still more.

				MURPHY
		With a little extra fuel, weather

		she been since.

				EPPS
		She was sailing up north, right?

				MURPHY
		Her destination was Halifax, yeah.

				EPPS
		Well, suppose she got a little further 
		north than she should have.  Got 
		stuck in the ice. The passengers and 
		crew evacuated. She froze into the 
		ice pack, which moved further north, 
		where it froze in solid. They write 
		it off. Fifty years later, the whole 
		global warming thing happens. The 
		ice melts, she gets loose and floats 
		around til somebody runs into her.

	Murphy nods, considering it.

				MURPHY
		As reasonable an explanation as any, 
		I guess.

	Epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it.

				MURPHY
		Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?

				EPPS
		Nope.

				MURPHY
		She was a two-masted brig boat sailing 
		out of New York in 1872.  One day 
		she was sighted off the coast of 
		Portugal by a merchant vessel, the 
		Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei 
		Gratia got closer, they discovered 
		that no one was at the helm of the 
		Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found 
		her completely deserted. The captain, 
		his wife, their daughter, and the 
		entire crew, all gone. The last entry 
		in their log made no mention of any 
		trouble. The table was even set for 
		dinner. And in the nine days after 
		the last entry, she sailed 700 miles 
		without anyone aboard.

				EPPS
		So what did happen?

				MURPHY
		Nobody knows. There've been a lot of 
		theories, of course. But we'll never 
		really know for sure.

				EPPS
		You think she's sailing without a 
		crew?

	Murphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow.

				MURPHY
		I think we'd be surprised where a 
		drifting ship might wind up with a 
		little wind and the right current.

				EPPS
		You're more practical than 
		superstitious.

				MURPHY
		Only way to be.

	Epps nods, takes another sip of coffee, looking on at the 
	rusting hull of the Chimera stretching off in the light.

		North Island, please repeat? Over.

				COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
		Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel 
		Chimera was lost at sea day two month

	Another beat as Murphy holds there, as the others look on.

				MURPHY
		North Island, have you got any 
		additional information? Over.

				COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
		Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The 
		vessel Chimera was registered to The 
		Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.  Nova 
		Scotia. Date of commission day nine 
		month seven year one nine three two. 
		Over.

	A long beat as the static of the open channel comes back.

		Roger, North Island. I am tied to 
		the passenger vessel Chimera. And 
		she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat. 
		Over.

				COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
		Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again,

				COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
		Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is 
		United States Coast Guard North Island 
		Station. Over and out.

	A beat as they hold there, thinking about it.

				MURPHY
		Obviously it's some kind of screw 
		up. The shipping records aren't a 
		hundred percent accurate.

				DODGE
		Man, it gives me the creeps. We got 
		no business towing a ship that size 
		anyway. I say we fix the turbines 
		and hit the highway.

				GREER
		Are you crazy? Do you realize we got 
		ourselves a ship? We own a ship, 
		Dodge.

				DODGE
		Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have 
		been lost at sea fifty years ago. 
		You don't think that's just a little 
		freaky?

				EPPS
		If this thing turns out to be a ship 
		everybody thought sank a long time 
		ago, we just hit the jackpot.

				DODGE
		Yeah, well how the hell you get 
		something like that wrong? That's a 
		damn big boat. It's either sunk or 
		it ain't.

				MURPHY
		We all want to get outa here, Dodge. 
		Especially me. With that boat in 
		tow. You got three days.  Make the 
		most of it.

	A beat as Dodge looks back, then out at the Chimera.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	A pencil point on a map follows across Saudi Arabia, coming 
	to the Persian Gulf and tracing the coast of the Arab Emirates 
	to Dubayy.

	Murphy sits at his desk over the map. His pencil point follows 
	the Persian Gulf from Dubayy, through the straight of Hormuz 
	into the Gulf of Oman. Murphy marks an "X" there. A beat as 
	he looks on at it.

	He opens a large envelope he found aboard the Chimera. He 
	empties it on the desk. He looks through it, docking receipts 
	from various ports of call, bills of lading, etc. He looks 
	over the passenger manifest.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTERS QUARTERS - DAY

	Murphy wakes. He lies on his bunk, having fallen asleep last 
	night in his clothes, still holding the envelope and some of 
	the papers inside.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge disassembles the turbine fans on deck as Greer reads 
	in the shade of the deck house. Dodge's hand slips and he 
	skins his knuckles.

				DODGE
		Fucker!

				GREER
		Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a 
		piece of metal.

				DODGE
			(inspecting his skinned 
			knuckles)
		Damn mind of it's own.

				GREER
			(seeing Murphy)
		Morning, skipper.

	Murphy has stepped out into the sunlight.

				MURPHY
		Morning.

				GREER
		You're up late.

				MURPHY
		Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. 
		Where's Epps?

				DODGE
		Went aboard.

				MURPHY
		She take a radio?

				GREER
		Yeah.

	Murphy nods. A beat.

	INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - DAY

	Epps steps from a passageway into a large public room. Tables 
	and chairs are scattered haphazardly, light falling in from 
	windows along the wall where tattered curtains hang. She 
	walks on.

	A pair of empty glasses sit on a table, an empty sherry 
	decanter beside them. An ashtray sits beside that. Epps stops, 
	reaching down. She pulls back a half-smoked cigarette, 
	lipstick smudging the end, yellowing and fragile from time.  
	And, as she stands there, we see a FIGURE, IN MURKY 
	SILHOUETTE, MOVE PAST THE DOORWAY IN THE BACKGROUND. In an 
	instant it is there and gone.

	She puts down the cigarette, having sensed a presence. She 
	turns to the doorway across the room, but there is nothing 
	to be seen now.

	INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares 
	into the middle distance. It lies on a love seat as Epps 
	steps up. She lifts it. Several other toys lie scattered 
	about as she studies it, when the sound of a TICKING CLOCK 
	CAN BE HEARD.

	A beat as Epps holds there. She turns, trying to locate the 
	sound. From across the room, Epps stands, listening. As the 
	TICKING CLOCK sounds from here. She turns, putting down the 
	doll, holding a beat. She approaches, crossing the room, 
	coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see 
	is an ancient grandfather clock.

	All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face, 
	but from inside it emits a weak though steady TICKING.

	Epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the 
	TICKING CEASES. A beat as she holds there, as the clock faces 
	her, now silent.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps shines her light in the darkness as she comes to a door 
	where daylight falls from a small port. She looks through 
	it.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps stands in a white tiled room. Light falls from port 
	holes high in the wall. Running its length is a small swimming 
	pool, it's rusted fixtures and stained surface creating 
	bizarre patterns.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to a row of changing stalls. Old clothing hangs 
	there, unused for fifty years. A pair of woman's shoes lie 
	on the floor.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - LATER - DAY

	Epps moves along, passing through a doorway into

	INT. CHIMERA - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps enters another room scattered with old exercise equipment 
	circa 1950, a wooden rowing machine, barbells and a medicine 
	ball.

	She steps up to the wall, where pictures hang. The Chimera 
	can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm 
	sea.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - LATER - DAY

	Epps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to 
	see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive 
	diesel burner. She passes through into another compartment 
	where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to 
	the ceiling.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - PASSAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over 
	her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing 
	passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into 
	the depths of the ship.

	Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment, 
	apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on 
	loading palettes.

	In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps 
	comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to 
	reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat 
	of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly 
	preserved.

	Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more 
	wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps' 
	eye.

	A heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges, 
	as though blown back from some terrific explosive force.

	Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her 
	light inside.

	A clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the 
	shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She 
	swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object 
	between broken wood slats.

	Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The 
	yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away 
	some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram 
	ingot of gold.

	She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the 
	years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack 
	of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides 
	away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to 
	see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high 
	and five feet across.

	A beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in 
	gold.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY

	The debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x 
	4' stack of gold ingots.

				DODGE (O.S.)
		What the fuck we gonna do with it?

	Greer, Murphy, Epps, and Dodge all look on.

				GREER
		What the fuck you think we gonna do 
		with it? It's ours, baby. It's all 
		ours.

	Murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it.

				GREER
		How much you figure that's worth, 
		skipper?

				MURPHY
			(still looking it 
			over)
		Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty 
		million.

				GREER
		Ho, baby!

				EPPS
		That's a lot of money for somebody 
		to just let float away.

	Murphy looks up at her from the gold.

				MURPHY
		Yes, it is.

	A beat as they all hold there.

				MURPHY
		It's a hell of a lot of money.

				DODGE
		What, you think there's something 
		funny about it?

				MURPHY
		A ship with fifty million dollars in 
		gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems 
		to care enough to come looking for 
		it?

				GREER
		If they thought it was lost at sea, 
		they probably just wrote it off.

				MURPHY
		Not for fifty million. An ocean liner 
		maybe. But fifty million in gold, 
		they come looking for.

				EPPS
		Maybe they didn't want it back.  
		Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.

				MURPHY
		Maybe. But there's always somebody 
		whose interest's at stake.

				GREER
		All I gotta say is it looks like 
		that somebody's us right now.

	Greer cackles as he high fives Dodge.

				EPPS
		And it looks like somebody got here 
		before us too.

	The steel hatch is twisted, as from a great hand ripping it 
	back from the wall.

				DODGE
			(inspecting it)
		Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell 
		you that. Torn parts rusted bad as 
		the rest of the boat.

				MURPHY
		Then it happened before they scuttled 
		her.

				EPPS
		You mean, before she sank.

				GREER
		Cargo like this could make a crew 
		think twice.

				MURPHY
		That it could.

	A beat, as they all look on at the gold.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	After dinner, Murphy, Greer, Dodge and Epps sit around the 
	galley table.

				GREER
		Then why didn't they take it.

				EPPS
		Probably didn't have time.

				DODGE
		Or somebody stopped them.

				MURPHY
		Either way, they must've had a pretty 
		good reason.

				GREER
		Must be a damn good reason to jump 
		ship and leave fifty million dollars 
		aboard.

	A beat as they consider it.

				DODGE
		So what're we gonna do. That's the 
		big question, right?

				MURPHY
		A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's 
		as valid as a claim to the vessel 
		itself. It's ours.

				DODGE
		Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy 
		stinking rich.

				MURPHY
		It looks like it.

	A beat as they let this sink in.

				GREER
		So what? We gonna unload the gold 
		and get a move on?

				MURPHY
		We leave it where it is. Stick to 
		the plan.

				DODGE
		You gotta be kidding? What the hell 
		we need that tub for, we got fifty 
		million bucks?

				MURPHY
		So we get a little more for the boat. 
		Besides, the gold'll be safer where 
		it is.

				GREER
		Yeah, but we still gotta haul that 
		big piece of shit all the way back 
		to Sitka.

				MURPHY
		It's worth the effort. Believe me.  
		Besides we're gonna need her to prove 
		the salvage.

				EPPS
		Why not call for help?

				MURPHY
		For now the best thing we can do is 
		to keep quiet about this.

				DODGE
		Last thing we want is extra partners.

				EPPS
		Or uninvited guests.

				GREER
		I heard that.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.

				DODGE
		Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

				MURPHY
		The sooner we get under way, the 
		sooner we are to spending what's 
		ours.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge, wearing a welding mask and gloves, braises an aluminum 
	fitting over one of the open turbines.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY

	Epps finishes stacking the gold ingots in a cleared space 
	beyond the twisted hatch.

				GREER
		Two hundred twenty. Two twenty one.
			(as Epps stacks the 
			last one)
		Two twenty two.

	Greer makes a note.

				GREER
		Two hundred twenty two kilograms of 
		solid gold.

				EPPS
		That's what I call a payday.

				GREER
		Hell yeah.

	They slap hands.

	INT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Murphy moves down the darkened passage, coming to a door 
	marked "CAPTAIN." The door is ajar. He pushes it open.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in 
	dark wood. A large desk occupies a corner of the room by the 
	windows. Though dirty and worn with time, everything is 
	ordered and in its place.

	Murphy comes to the desk. He sits down in the chair behind 
	it. The surface is clear and uncluttered. He pulls out the 
	drawer to reveal pens, writing paper, a ruler, compass and 
	protractor amidst other sundry items.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 
	DAY

	Murphy steps in. The room is undisturbed, light falling in 
	on the taught green bedspread through dirty, tattered 
	curtains.  A robe hangs on the back of a chair. A pair of 
	slippers lie beneath it.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 
	DAY

	Murphy stands in the bathroom. The tile has yellowed with 
	time, but everything is exactly as it was left. Even the 
	shaving kit is neatly arrayed on the sink as Murphy looks on 
	at it. He looks up, seeing himself in the mirror, when an 
	EXPLOSION SOUNDS.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy comes to the railing, looking out over the bow of the 
	ship to see black smoke rising from where the Arctic Warrior 
	is tied.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer and Epps run to the side to see billowing smoke rising 
	from the Arctic Warrior as Murphy climbs down the crane to 
	the deck.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy jumps down to the deck. Flames belch from an open 
	hatch as Murphy grabs a fire extinguisher from a deck locker, 
	coming to the engine room door.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and 
	black smoke. He finds Dodge spraying at it with an 
	extinguisher of his own.

	The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well, 
	the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays a 
	cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment.

	Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and 
	hands singed.

	An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl through 
	the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in 
	fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire.

				DODGE
			(over the roar)
		Murphy!

	Murphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire, as Dodge 
	turns a cloud of halon on him, putting it out.

				DODGE
		Propane tanks're gonna go!

	Murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to 
	the most intense part of the flames. He turns the extinguisher 
	into them, holding it there.

	The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning 
	his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet again 
	as clouds of halon rise up.

	Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Dodge 
	fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the 
	wall again.

	Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine 
	well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the 
	deck, and finally out.

	They stand there in the sudden silence, the air heavy with 
	smoke. A fine layer of halon powder lies over everything, 
	but the fire is out.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Dodge smokes a cigarette, now starting to feel his burned 
	leg, which is oozing as Murphy and Greer look on.

				DODGE
		One minute I'm minding my own 
		business, the next thing I know the 
		whole place is burning up.
			(taking a drag)
		An oxygen tank must've blown on the 
		welder. Started an oil fire.

				GREER
		Looks like it took out the backup 
		genny too.

				MURPHY
		Terrific.

	Epps arrives with a first aid kit.

				MURPHY
		How's that leg?

	Epps cuts back the burned pant leg to see the burn.

				DODGE
		Seen better -- Ow!

	Epps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide.

				EPPS
		This's gonna hurt a little.

				DODGE
		Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!

	Epps keeps cleaning as Dodge bears it.

				GREER
		What now?

				MURPHY
		We could call for help.

				GREER
		And get a bunch of fools sniffin' 
		around here?

				EPPS
		What other choices have we got?

				DODGE
		I tell you one thing, we're not gonna 
		be towing no ship now.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	the stark light of a gas lantern.

				GREER
		Fifty million four ways. That's twelve

				MURPHY
		Not much at all, I guess. Retire.  
		Live out my golden years and all

		I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger.  
		Spend my time hauling rich Seattle

		Guess I'll just keep working.

				DODGE
		What're you crazy?

				EPPS
		I like my job.

				MURPHY
		Greer?

				GREER
		Moving to Sweden.

				DODGE
		What's so great about Sweden?

				GREER
		It's a beautiful country. Very clean. 
		Very civilized. And cold.

				EPPS
		That's a good thing?

				GREER
		Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder 
		the better.

				DODGE
		Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish 
		girls you only gonna dream about.

				GREER
		We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.

				MURPHY
		Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be 
		doing if we don't get this boat 
		running.

				DODGE
		Yeah, yeah.

	A STRANGE SOUND BEGINS. IT IS LIKE A DISTANT SHRIEKING, AS 
	OF METAL AGAINST METAL, BUT ALMOST HUMAN, DISTANTLY ECHOING.

				GREER
		What the hell is that?

	The SHRIEKING CONTINUES, ECHOING EERILY AS IF FROM THE SEA.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer emerge on deck.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING IS LOUDER HERE, BUT SEEMS TO BE 
	EMANATING FROM DEEP IN THE SHIP as they stand facing it on 
	the bow.

				EPPS
		It's coming from inside.

	They hold there listening as the SHRIEKING CONTINUES.

				DODGE
		Sounds like the hull.

				MURPHY
		Warm water current maybe, making the 
		metal expand.

				GREER
		That shit is seriously bizarre.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING ECHO continues as they hold there.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	The engine room is black with soot, the turbines covered in 
	halon powder. Dodge stands there looking at it. He sighs.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

	Greer goes through shelves of supplies, finding a stack of 
	sterno cans and warming candles. He throws them into a wooden 
	crate of other supplies he's gathered.

	INT. CHIMERA - FIRST CLASS STATEROOM - DAY

	Epps slowly pushes open the door. She holds a sack with a 
	few items she's managed to scavenge. Light falls from 
	curtained windows onto the room. A divan sits against the 
	wall. A table stands in the middle of the room, a moth-eaten 
	velvet table cloth sitting under a brass lamp on top. Two 
	twin beds stand on either side. They are covered in dust and 
	are moth-eaten, unmade, as if the occupants had just gotten 
	up, fifty years ago.

	In one corner is an armoire. Epps steps up to it, pulling 
	back the door to reveal a rack of woman's clothing hanging 
	there undisturbed.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair, over 
	which is draped a woman's robe. Epps lifts it, the material 
	crumbling in her hands.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A drawer comes back to reveal a number of personal affects, 
	a man's billfold, cuff links, tarnished silver cigarette 
	holder and case, coins, black horn-rimmed glasses, pocket 
	watch and fob, and a room key.

	Epps pulls back the billfold. She opens it. Inside she finds 
	a Canadian passport a picture of a dark-haired man with a 
	mustache and black horn-rimmed glasses, circa 1950. In the 
	folds she finds three hundred Canadian dollars. An insert 
	holds pictures, of a suburban home, children, and a woman, 
	presumably his wife.

	INT. CHIMERA - "A" DECK PASSAGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps steps from the room. She turns to close the door, but 
	stops, holding there, strongly sensing something.

	THE CAMERA SLOWLY COMES AROUND TO HER OTHER SIDE, revealing 
	the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway 
	creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame 
	one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in 
	the foggy light from a porthole, a MAN in dark clothing.

	Epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses, 
	the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her. A 
	beat as they hold there. The man only stares back at her, 
	then turns to walk away.

				EPPS
		Hey!

	Epps moves off as the man walks around the corner.

				EPPS
		Hey, wait a minute! Hey!

	MOVING WITH Epps as she breaks into a run, going down the 
	passageway. She comes to the corner, rounding it out onto 
	another passageway. The man is nowhere to be seen.

	Epps moves quickly down the passageway, coming to the next 
	corner, rounding it out to see only another long passageway.  
	She turns back, running right into Murphy.

				MURPHY
		Take it easy, you'll live longer.

				EPPS
		Did you see him?

				MURPHY
		Who?

				EPPS
		The guy. He just came this way.

				MURPHY
		What guy?

				EPPS
		There's somebody else on this boat.

				MURPHY
		What? What the hell're you talking 
		about.

				EPPS
		I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some 
		guy.

				MURPHY
		Are you sure?

				EPPS
		Of course I'm sure. I saw him.

				MURPHY
		You sure it wasn't me?

				EPPS
		It wasn't you. It was somebody else. 
		There's somebody else aboard.

	A beat as Murphy looks back at her.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	Greer, Dodge, Murphy, and Epps stand around by lantern light.

				DODGE
		Light in those passages ain't so

				EPPS
		I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I 
		don't know who it was. But I saw 
		somebody.

				GREER
		What'd he look like?

				EPPS
		Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get 
		a good look. He was far away. But I 
		saw him. I saw him as sure as you're 
		standing there.

				DODGE
		Where's his boat, then? Where's his 
		crew? He ain't gonna be out here by 
		himself, that's for damn sure.

				GREER
		She's so big somebody could come 
		alongside her on the other side and 
		we'd never know it.

				EPPS
		Maybe that is his boat.

				DODGE
		Gimme a break.

	A beat as they sit in silence.

				MURPHY
		If somebody's aboard her already, 
		she ain't ours. She's theirs.

				DODGE
		Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam 
		for fifty years. We found her. She's 
		ours.

				MURPHY
		Not in the eyes of the law.

				EPPS
		So, we find this guy and make a deal 
		with him.

				MURPHY
		We don't exactly have the best 
		bargaining position.

				DODGE
		I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a 
		professional salvage crew going about 
		our business. What's some yahoo doing 
		way out here by himself anyway?

				MURPHY
		And what do you propose? That we 
		knock this guy off?

				DODGE
		Why not? Why the fuck not?

	A beat as Murphy, Greer and Epps exchange looks.

				DODGE
		Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. 
		We gonna let this guy just take it 
		from us? One guy?

				EPPS
		So we kill him?

				DODGE
		I'm saying we gotta do whatever we 
		gotta do to preserve our interest.

				GREER
		I don't know.

				MURPHY
		Let's just take it easy here, alright? 
		Nobody's gonna kill anybody.

				GREER
		Supposing he wants to get bad with 
		us?

				DODGE
		One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.

				EPPS
		Maybe he isn't alone.

	They consider this a moment.

				GREER
		I say we off-load some of that gold 
		now.

				MURPHY
		Would you hold on just a minute here, 
		please? Look, there's no reason to 
		panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. 
		It's a big boat.  Chances're real 
		good he doesn't even know about the 
		gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be 
		the wiser.
			(a beat)
		The gold stays where it is til we're 
		ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a 
		hell of a lot safer there than here.

				DODGE
		What if that fucker finds it before 
		we're ready to go?

				MURPHY
		We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight 
		off. Low man first.

				EPPS
		Guess that'd be me. Again.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't 
		care if you don't sleep for a week.  
		The sooner you're done, the sooner 
		we can get out of here. How's the 
		food situation?

				GREER
		Pretty low all around.

				MURPHY
		We'll have to take it easy then. I 
		don't think we'll find much aboard 
		the ship, but it's probably worth 
		looking around.

				EPPS
		Say we run into this guy again.

	A beat as they consider this.

				MURPHY
		If he's reasonable, maybe we can 
		make some kind of deal. If not.  
		We'll have to re-consider our options.

				DODGE
		Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit 
		up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WARD LOCKER - NIGHT

	Epps is dressed in her cold weather gear as she opens a 
	locker, revealing a flare gun and a shotgun. Epps pulls back 
	the shotgun and a box of shells.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - NIGHT

	Murphy and Dodge look on as Epps loads the last of several 
	shotgun shells into the pump action short barrel 12-gauge.  
	She expertly shuttles a round into the chamber with one hand.  
	Dodge takes a hit from his cigarette as Greer crosses from 
	the deck house.

				DODGE
		Pretty handy with that scatter gun, 
		Epps. You raised on a farm?

				EPPS
			(setting the safety)
		Seen a lota movies.

				MURPHY
		No cowboy shit up there, understand?

				EPPS
		No cowboy shit. Right.

	Greer extends a thermos to Epps.

				GREER
		Coffee.

				EPPS
			(pocketing it in her 
			coat)
		You're a pal.

	She checks the squelch on her radio, pockets it too.

				MURPHY
		Got your light?

				EPPS
		Yup.

				DODGE
		Smokes?

				EPPS
		Oh yeah.

	Her bravado does little to hide her apprehension as she slings 
	the shotgun on her back.

				EPPS
		See you boys later.
			(to Greer)
		Don't be late, I need my beauty rest.

	She looks up, climbs onto the crane and up toward the darkened 
	ship above them.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	A flashlight beam cuts through the darkness as Epps 
	approaches. If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is 
	terrifying now. She comes to a ladder and climbs down.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps shines her light as she passes through, coming to the 
	cargo hold. She crosses in the darkness, her light catching 
	the tarnished glint of the gold. She comes up to it, stopping 
	there, looking on at it, a perfectly symmetrical fortune.

	She looks around for a place to sit. She drags a palette to 
	the bulkhead, settling in to face the rest of the compartment. 
	She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos 
	to pour herself a cup of coffee.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps has dozed off when a CLATTERING ECHOES DISTANTLY 
	somewhere in the ship. Epps wakes. It is silent, as she holds 
	there, not sure she heard anything, when a DISTANT BOOMING 
	SOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening.

	As Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly 
	somewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps moves along in the darkness when the DISTANT BOOMING 
	CAN BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN. She stops, holding there, in the 
	silence.

	INT. CHIMERA - SHAFT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive 
	propeller shaft hangs suspended above her. Epps moves along.  
	Finally she comes out into...

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She 
	continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing 
	into the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS.

	She turns, shinning her light back from where she came.  
	Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe 
	her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again 
	echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through 
	the line of burners. Nothing moves.

	Epps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive 
	watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding 
	herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks. 
	THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.

	She moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding 
	her light out before her. She comes to the end of the 
	compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still 
	closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting 
	machinery and a stack of oil drums.

	She approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the 
	BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here.

	She tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady 
	as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is 
	metallic and staccato.

	She stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums 
	have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs 
	her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at 
	the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way 
	through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that 
	betrays a throughway to the outside.

	The BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of 
	oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to 
	fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to 
	push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER.  
	She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off 
	the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic 
	flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large 
	albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top 
	of the ship and freedom.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

	She settles back, exhausted.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

				EPPS
			(taking her radio)
		Epps.

				MURPHY
		You just shoot at something?

				EPPS
		Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid 
		bird.

	She wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment, 
	when she smells something really awful.

	She steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the 
	toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam 
	of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light 
	on the form to see that it is a human torso.  A large gash 
	runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by 
	scavenging birds.

	She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on 
	something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in 
	front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with 
	wide, unseeing eyes.

	It takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines 
	her light back to the headless torso.

	She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent 
	steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried 
	blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind 
	her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her.

	She spins around to see another body above her. Except this 
	one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam 
	pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum 
	to mouth.

	One of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below 
	it.  A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another 
	bent pipe.

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

	A lantern illuminates the impaled bodies and their various 
	rotting parts.

				GREER (O.S.)
		Ho-ly shit.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Couldn't have happened much more 
		than a month ago.

	Greer, Dodge, and Epps look on as Murphy kneels over the 
	remains of the headless torso.

				MURPHY
		Bodies're too fresh.

				DODGE
		Fresh ain't the first word that comes 
		to mind.

	Murphy checks the pockets, finding a wallet. He looks through 
	it.

				MURPHY
		Greek citizen. Merchant navy.
			(standing)
		Obviously we aren't the first to 
		come across this ship. They probably 
		stumbled across it just like we did.

				GREER
		And look what happened.

				DODGE
		Damn barbaric is what it is.

				MURPHY
		Could be meant as a warning.

				GREER
		Stay away. Or else.

				EPPS
		Because of the gold.

				MURPHY
		That'd be my guess.

				DODGE
		So whoever did this might still be 
		around.

				GREER
		Maybe Epps's mystery man had something 
		to do with it.

				MURPHY
		Maybe.

	A beat as they consider the implications of this.

				EPPS
		So, what? We report this? Call the 
		Coastguard?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				DODGE
		Let's not be too hasty.

				GREER
		Yeah. Hell, what difference does it 
		make if we report it now or later?  
		We call this in now, gonna be 
		Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all 
		over the place.

	A beat as nobody's too sure about this.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, if this isn't incentive enough 
		to fix that boat, I don't know what 
		is.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge fires up a compressor, which feebly comes to life, 
	turning over the turbine, then sputtering out in a cloud of 
	smoke.

				DODGE
		All the seals and gaskets're shot.  
		Anything that was rubber burned up.

	Murphy stands at the doorway, looking on.

				MURPHY
		Can't you use something else?

				DODGE
		I might be able to find something on 
		the ship. But it's gonna take time.

				MURPHY
		Do what you need to do. Just do it 
		fast.

				DODGE
		Right.

	INT. CHIMERA - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

	Epps sleeps in her bunk.

	INT. CHIMERA - BETWEEN DECKS - DAY

	Dodge and Greer climb down in the darkness.

				DODGE
		I need lag bolts, especially one 
		inch standard. And sheet metal.  
		Preferably steel, about a sixteenth 
		of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll 
		do.

				GREER
		I ain't no mechanic, just so you 
		know.

				DODGE
		You find anything that even looks 
		like a compressor. I don't care what, 
		grab it.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stands in the cramped room, full of radios and 
	communications equipment. He looks through the shelves and 
	cabinets, when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book.  
	He pulls it back, opening it to see that it is a radio call 
	log. He takes a seat, paging through it.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - WITH GREER - LATER - DAY

	Greer works to disassemble a compressor mechanism. He has 
	difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench, when 
	he slips.

				GREER
		Dammit!

	A beat as he inspects his hand. In the silence A DISTANT 
	SHRIEK SOUNDS, maybe metal against metal or maybe human, 
	somewhere in the ship. He holds there, listening.

				GREER
		Dodge?

	He moves on, shinning his light as he goes.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer moves along in the darkness when he hears THE SHRIEKING 
	AGAIN coming from somewhere in the ship.

				GREER
		Dodge!

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer walks up a stairway, stepping into a darkened 
	passageway. The SHRIEKING SOUNDS, THIS TIME CLOSER, as it 
	echoes through the ship. He stops, holding there to listen.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer comes out onto another deck, stopping there. He looks 
	down the passageway a beat, then moves on. He passes through 
	a hatchway in a bulkhead when A MUSIC BOX CAN BE DISTANTLY 
	HEARD. He stops. The song is "DAISY" ("Daisy, Daisy, give me 
	your answer do. I'm half crazy, oh for the love of you.").

	He holds there, listening intently. A door stands open at 
	the other end of the passage. The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. He 
	moves forward, walking toward the end of the passage, and 
	the light falling from the open door.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy pages forward to the last page of the radio call log 
	book.

	On the page his finger runs down the columns of entries, 
	coming to "TRANSMISSION 1 Feb 53 21:34 hrs GMT. Engine trouble 
	notification made to passing vessel 'St. Charles.'"

	His finger moves down to the next entry, coming to: 
	"TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 09:52 hrs GMT. Dead in Water.  
	Notification made to passing vessel 'Normandy.'"

	His finger continues: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 14:07 hrs GMT.  
	Captain relieved of command. Notification made to passing 
	vessel 'China Sea.'"

				MURPHY
		Captain relieved of command.

	He holds there a moment, moving his finger down to the final 
	entry, reading: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 21:24 hrs GMT. General 
	SOS."

	He turns the page to see only the words "GOD SAVE US" scrawled 
	in faded red ink. A beat as he holds there, when a CHANNEL 
	OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST ON MURPHY'S RADIO. He looks to it, 
	but there is no response from the other end. Another SHORT 
	BURST AND THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. This time it remains open, 
	but no one says anything on the other end, UNTIL THE CHANNEL 
	CLOSES AGAIN.

	Murphy takes the radio.

				MURPHY
		This is Murphy. Anybody trying to 
		call me? Over.

	He waits as no response comes, then THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN.  
	Only silence from the other end as someone seems to be there, 
	but is not saying anything. Murphy presses the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Greer? Dodge?

	Again, there is no response, until the CHANNEL OPENS. Murphy 
	holds there as he is answered by silence, WHEN A GRAVELLY, 
	STRANGELY DISTORTED MALE VOICE COMES BACK ON THE RADIO:

				VOICE (V.O. RADIO)
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know, but won't say so."

	Murphy is momentarily stunned. He hits the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS. Only silence comes back, as if 
	someone were there but not speaking.

				MURPHY
		Who is this!!

	The CAMERA PUSHES IN AS MURPHY LISTENS.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	The CHANNEL CLOSES as the CAMERA STOPS CLOSE ON MURPHY.  
	Murphy squeezes the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Greer! Dodge!

	Only silence comes back from the radio when A MAN'S BLOOD 
	CURDLING SCREAM sounds from somewhere in the ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy moves quickly down the passageway when his radio 
	sounds.

				DODGE
		Dodge to Murphy.

				MURPHY
			(taking radio)
		Murphy.

				DODGE
		You better get down here quick, 
		skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.

				MURPHY
		What is it?

				DODGE
		I think you better see this for 
		yourself.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy comes down the stairs and into the passageway we saw 
	Greer in earlier. At the end, the light from the cabin falls 
	from the open door as he approaches.

	AT CABIN 400

	As Murphy comes to the door to see Dodge standing in the 
	middle of the cabin.

				DODGE
		I found him like this.

	Greer is lying supine on the floor. His legs are rigid and 
	his trunk is extended. His arms are flexed and twisted so 
	that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists 
	quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other.

	Murphy kneels beside him. Greer's eyelids are half closed, 
	his eyes rolled up into his head. His jaw is clenched, face 
	contorted in a bizarre grimace. And he speaks, uttering 
	nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in 
	tongues.

				GREER

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

	AN EYE - EXTREMELY CLOSE

	As a light shines in it, the pupil is fixed and dilated.

				EPPS (O.S.)
		Hard to say.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Greer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing 
	as Epps shines a flashlight into his eye, Dodge and Murphy 
	looking on. She turns it off, standing upright.

				EPPS
		I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a 
		coma.

				DODGE
		A what?

				EPPS
		I don't know what else you'd call 
		it. He's breathing on his own, but 
		his pupils are completely blown out. 
		He's totally unresponsive to pain.
			(a beat)
		What happened up there?

				DODGE
		I heard a scream. When I got there I 
		found him on the floor. He was having 
		some kind of seizure. I didn't see 
		anybody else.

				MURPHY
		He must've seen something.

	A beat as they consider this.

				EPPS
		Other than the obvious, there's 
		nothing wrong with him that I can 
		see, not on the outside.

				DODGE
		Then what the hell happened to him?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Just before I heard him yell there 
		was somebody on the radio.

				EPPS
		Greer?

				MURPHY
		I don't know. No. Not Greer.  
		Somebody.

	Another long beat as they think about this.

				MURPHY
		It was a man's voice. Repeating some 
		sort of children's rhyme. I don't 
		know, it didn't make any sense. You 
		didn't hear it?

				DODGE
		Not me.

	Another beat as this sinks in.

				EPPS
			(looking to Greer)
		He needs a doctor.

				MURPHY
		I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many 
		signal flares you can scrounge up.
			(to Epps, meaning 
			Dodge)
		Keep an eye on him.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as 
	he holds the radio mic.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, United 
		States Coastguard, United States 
		Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo 
		four zero niner two. Over.

	No response.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, United 
		States Coastguard, United States 
		Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo 
		four zero niner two. Over.

	Again, no response. He holds there, then finally:

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. To any vessel. 
		This is Arctic Warrior.  Arctic 
		Warrior. Arctic Warrior.  Whiskey 
		alpha sierra bravo four zero niner

		afloat and drifting.  Require 
		immediate medical assistance for one 
		person, possibly comatose. I am a

		passenger liner Chimera. I repeat, 
		Chimera. Over.

	Only the desolate WHITE NOISE OF EMPTY AIR COMES BACK.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Greer lies unconscious as Epps looks on at him. The door 
	comes open and Murphy steps in.

				MURPHY
		How's he doing?

				EPPS
		Same. Any luck?

				MURPHY
		No. I'll try again later.

	A beat as they look on at Greer.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps sit at the galley table. Epps reads the log 
	book Murphy found in the radio room.

				EPPS
			(reading it)
		They're dead in the water that 
		morning. Four hours later the 
		captain's relieved of his command.  
		And that evening they issue a general 
		SOS.

				MURPHY
		Possibly false. Hence the IMA record 
		of being lost at sea. I don't think 
		mutiny's out of the question here.

				DODGE
			(taking a seat)
		On a passenger ship in 1953?

				MURPHY
		If they knew what they were carrying.

				EPPS
		You're saying they mutinied for the 
		gold?

				MURPHY
		If they were close enough to shore, 
		they probably figured they could get 
		away in the lifeboats.

				EPPS
		Only something must've gone wrong.

				DODGE
		Yeah, way wrong.

	A beat as they consider it.

				DODGE
		So. I got a question. Just from a, 
		you know, purely technical standpoint. 
		We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard 
		shows up. What exactly is the plan?

				MURPHY
		How do you mean?

				DODGE
		Well, they're gonna be asking a lot 
		of questions. About us. About those 
		bodies. About the gold. Seems like 
		we oughta be prepared is all.

				MURPHY
		I guess the best strategy's just to 
		tell them the truth.

				DODGE
		Yeah, well. The truth is one thing.  
		When there's more than a few hundred 
		million dollars involved, that's a 
		whole new deal.

				MURPHY
		What do you propose?

				DODGE
		For starters, getting that gold off 
		the ship. What they don't know about 
		isn't gonna bother them.

	A beat as Murphy holds there.

				MURPHY
		There's no way we're gonna hide a 
		few thousand pounds of gold from the 
		Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be 
		safer where it is.

				DODGE
		With all due respect, skipper.
			(a beat)
		Part of that up there's mine. I'd 
		kinda like to have a little say in 
		what happens to it.

	A beat as Murphy looks on.

				MURPHY
		Tell you what, Dodge. Once we get 
		back to shore, you can do whatever 
		you want with your share. But until 
		then, the gold stays right where it 
		is.

	Dodge holds there. He looks to Epps a beat, takes a drink of 
	coffee.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	The sun comes up over a spectacular cloud bank as the Arctic 
	Warrior drifts alongside the Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy crosses to the deck house, climbs the stairs.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy opens the door, stopping dead in his tracks. A beat.  
	He steps forward, crossing to the corner.

	The radio set lies before him, dented in and completely 
	demolished, as if someone had taken a bat to it.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from 
	behind and shoved into the wall. Murphy holds him fast.

				MURPHY
		Just what the hell do you think you're 
		doing?!

				DODGE
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about?

				MURPHY
		I think you know.

				DODGE
		Maybe you can tell me then.

	Murphy shoves him hard into the wall.

				MURPHY
		The radio!

				DODGE
			(not having a clue)
		The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip.

				DODGE
		Take it easy, willya? What about the 
		radio?!

				MURPHY
		You smashed it!

				DODGE
		What?!

				MURPHY
		Don't lie to me!

				DODGE
		What the fuck -- ?

				MURPHY
		You didn't want us calling anybody.  
		Too liable to ruin your big payday.

				DODGE
		I didn't touch the fucking radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip still more.

				DODGE
		I didn't touch the fucking radio!
			(a beat)
		Ever occur to you there's somebody 
		else on that boat, skipper?

				MURPHY
		Conveniently enough for you.

				DODGE
		Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?

	Murphy holds there a beat longer. He shoves Dodge back letting 
	him go.

				DODGE
		Jesus.

	Dodge checks his throat as Murphy looks on.

				EPPS (O.S.)
		Murphy.

	They turn to see Epps in the hatchway.

				EPPS
		It's Greer.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a 
	jug of water as Murphy and the others step in. He turns to 
	see them.

				GREER
		Never been more thirsty in my life.

				MURPHY
		Drink up then.

	Greer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a 
	seat, looking on at him.

				MURPHY
		How're you feeling?

				GREER
		Lost my sea legs.

				EPPS
		Any dizziness?

				GREER
		No.

				EPPS
		Headache, nausea, lights?

				GREER
		Lights?

				EPPS
		Sudden flashes of light.

				GREER
		I feel fine.

				DODGE
		What day is it?

				GREER
		I don't know. Tuesday?

				DODGE
		Wrong. It's Friday.

				EPPS
		Try Wednesday.

				DODGE
		Right. Wednesday.

	A beat as they all hold there. Greer takes a seat.

				GREER
		What happened?

				MURPHY
		You don't remember?

				GREER
		Last thing I remember I was aboard 
		the Chimera. Down somewhere in there 
		scavenging around.

				MURPHY
		You've been out for about a day.

				GREER
		Say what?

				MURPHY
		Dodge found you out cold in one of 
		the cabins.

	Greer only holds there.

				GREER
		Oh, man.

				MURPHY
		We heard you scream. Any idea what 
		you might've seen?

				GREER
		I wish I could tell you. I'd be real 
		interested to know myself.

	Another beat as they hold there, as Greer takes another drink 
	of water.

				MURPHY
		The ah... the radio's out.

				EPPS
		What?

				MURPHY
		Somebody took it out of commission 
		last night.

	A beat as they all hold there.

				MURPHY
		Smashed it up pretty bad.

				EPPS
		But, who -- ?

				DODGE
		The skipper seems to think I did it. 
		That I'm more interested in that 
		gold than my own safety or the safety 
		of my fellow shipmates.

	A beat as they hold there, as Murphy looks back.

				EPPS
		Did you?

				DODGE
		Hell no. You think I'm crazy?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Regardless of how it happened, there 
		isn't much of a chance to fix it. 
		The odds of another vessel in range 
		of the walkie-talkies are almost 
		astronomical. So, as of today, we're 
		pretty much on our own out here.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - DAY

	Epps and Murphy, carrying the shotgun, make their way in the 
	ship.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FIRST MATE'S QUARTERS - DAY

	Greer stops before a mirror to see himself. He finds an 
	aspirin bottle, goes to open it. And as he does so, he sees 
	that his hand is shaking uncontrollably.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge works over the turbine. He stops, holding there. He 
	looks on at the plugs and wires and hoses. A beat.

	He begins pulling out the hoses and wires, grabbing at them, 
	yanking them loose, breaking them off.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - DAY

	The chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty 
	assortment of tubes and condensers. Murphy looks on at it.

	WITH EPPS

	A tattered, bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten 
	corner. Epps picks it up. The cover has been ripped off and 
	the pages are torn. But, as she looks through it, she sees 
	that it is the ship's log.

				EPPS
		Murphy.

	Murphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the 
	very end. The last pages have been ripped out.

				EPPS
		Looks like part of the general log.

	Epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out.

				EPPS
		"The crew have gone mad with greed 
		and fight among themselves like wild 
		dogs over fresh kill."

				MURPHY
		February first.

				EPPS
		The same day she supposedly went 
		down.

				MURPHY
		Must not've been the captain's entry. 
		He was probably out of the picture 
		by then.

	Epps continues to read.

				EPPS
		"Their lacking diligence has 
		undoubtedly caused the collision.  
		Distress calls have been made."

				MURPHY
		Collision? With what?

				EPPS
		The page's missing. Then their SOS 
		was real.

				MURPHY
		But where's the damage?

				EPPS
		Maybe the other ship took the worst 
		of it.

				MURPHY
		If it was a ship she hit.

	A beat as they hold there, when his radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.

				DODGE
		Dodge to Murphy!

	Murphy reaches down for his radio.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Yeah.

				DODGE
		You better get down here right now!  
		We're taking water! Big time!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy and Epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is 
	starting to list to one side. He crosses to the deck house 
	and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly 
	filling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a 
	pump hose over the DIN OF THE PUMPS.

				MURPHY
		What the hell happened!

				DODGE
		Turbine chamber on number two must've 
		blown! Took out part of the hull!

				GREER
		We're not gonna be able to pump it!

				MURPHY
		Alright. Everybody grab your gear!  
		This' is where we get off!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	The tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash 
	with seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their 
	gear to the crane.

	Water is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the 
	towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs 
	precariously at the bow of the Chimera.

	Murphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse.

				MURPHY
		Dodge!

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to 
	one side. Dodge wades through toward the door.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind, 
	then Murphy.

	Dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug, 
	which now lists at a near 45 degree angle.

	WITH DODGE

	Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He 
	goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the 
	starboard rail.

	He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker 
	opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to 
	pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up 
	and edges his way toward the bow.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the 
	skewed deck crane.

	WITH DODGE

	The tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane, 
	the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera.

	Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it 
	sinks lower and lower.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	They look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug 
	pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship.

	Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing.

	WITH DODGE

	As Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the 
	other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water.

	Above, Greer casts a line. It falls near, but out of reach 
	as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and 
	fro.  Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming 
	close but not close enough.

	The swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and 
	Dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line, 
	coaxing it into his grasp. He pulls it back and hangs on, as 
	the crane sways back with the foundering boat.

	The crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space 
	by the line from the bow of the Chimera.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	Murphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water 
	and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves.

	Dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls 
	still further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea, 
	slipping lower and lower.

	WITH DODGE

	As he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail 
	well on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of 
	Dodge's hand.

	A SCREECHING SOUNDS and they turn to see the twin tow cables 
	coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the 
	Chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight.

	With a CONCUSSIVE STRIKE, one cable is freed, snapping against 
	the Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string.  It 
	starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the 
	cable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air.

	Dodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short.

	A LOUD HISSING SOUNDS and Dodge turns to see misty air 
	escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water 
	forces it out of the tug below decks.

	The tow cable LOUDLY SCRAPES THE HULL in a shower of rust, 
	as Dodge struggles to pull himself up.

	Murphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their 
	hands barely reaching.

	The tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to 
	scrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull 
	like a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with 
	everything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand.

	Murphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other 
	hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a 
	SICKENING GRINDING SOUND OF HEAVY STEEL AGAINST STEEL.

	Dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface, 
	slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation 
	of misty air. The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it 
	slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally 
	disappearing altogether into the depths.

	A long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence, phantom 
	bubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	A boot punches through a rotten wood hull.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		That just about says it all.

	Greer stands at the bow of a lifeboat suspended from halyards 
	above the deck.

				GREER
		Rotten stem to stern. Guess you 
		couldn't expect much else.

	Greer jumps down as Murphy, Dodge, and Epps look on.

				GREER
		We ain't exactly in what you'd call 
		your high traffic neighborhood either.

				MURPHY
		The coast guard has our last position. 
		They'll send somebody out soon enough. 
		A ship this size you can't exactly 
		miss.

				EPPS
		It's a good bet they'll be asking a 
		lot of questions when they get here 
		too.

				MURPHY
		Let 'em ask. This ship's legally 
		ours now.

				DODGE
		When they find out what it's carrying, 
		they may not be so interested in 
		what's legal.

				GREER
		Maybe you shoulda thought a that 
		before you scuttled our boat.

	Dodge turns to see Greer. A beat.

				DODGE
		The turbine blew.

				GREER
		Lemme see, was that before or after 
		the oil fire?

	A beat. Dodge takes a swing at Greer.

				MURPHY
			(grabbing Dodge)
		Easy, easy.

	Murphy holds on to Dodge as he will have none of it.

				GREER
		Gettin' a little hot under the collar, 
		I'd say.

				MURPHY
		Shut up.

				GREER
		Must be a little too the truth, eh 
		Dodge?

	Dodge jumps forward again, but Murphy hangs on.

				MURPHY
		I said, shut the hell up.

	Murphy shoves Dodge back.

				MURPHY
		Both of you. I don't want to hear it 
		again.

	A beat as Greer and Murphy hold there.

				MURPHY
		So just stow it. You understand?
			(a beat)
		We don't need this right now.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	A fire burns in an oil drum as Epps, Murphy, Dodge and Greer 
	sit around it in silence.

	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	Epps steps in. She shines her light on the room. It is exactly 
	as it was left. She crosses to the bed, shining her light 
	under it. She sits down, trying it.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

	Dodge moves in the darkness, coming to the corner where the 
	stacked gold ingots rest. He looks on at them.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		You shouldn't be down here alone.

	Dodge turns to see Murphy standing there.

				DODGE
		Just wanted to check on our little 
		baby.

	A beat as they look on at the gold.

				DODGE
		That oughta buy a man pretty much 
		anything he wants.

				MURPHY
		If money can buy what he wants.

				DODGE
		I don't figure there's much I want 
		money can't buy.

				MURPHY
		Then you're a lucky man.

	Murphy tosses the shotgun to Dodge, who catches it.

				MURPHY
		We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. 
		You're up first.

				DODGE
		Right.

	Murphy holds there a beat longer, then turns to go, as Dodge 
	looks after him.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	A grey chop gently rocks the Chimera, smoke rising from the 
	top deck.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	Greer and Dodge tend the flames of three fire barrels, adding 
	broken up furniture to create heavy signal smoke.

	INT. CHIMERA - PANTRY - DAY

	Murphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case, 
	scavenging for food.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

	Epps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large, 
	open galley, when a MOVEMENT CAN BE HEARD SOMEWHERE BEYOND 
	THE ENTRY separating the galley from the outer passageway.

				EPPS
		Murphy?

	No one answers. She looks off across the stillness of the 
	galley. Nothing.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps steps into the passageway. Directly across is the entry 
	to the swimming pool. She walks on.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

	Epps steps in. Light falls in from the dirty port holes at 
	the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls.  
	She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a 
	GIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool.

	Epps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is 
	porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her 
	clothing hanging loosely from a frail body.

				GIRL
		You must leave.

	A beat as Epps stands there.

				EPPS
			(finally)
		Who are you?

	From this distance and in the light it is hard to fully 
	discern the girl's features.

				GIRL
		There's great evil here, more than 
		you can know. Leave now or you may 
		never leave.

				EPPS
		But --

	A HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look.  
	When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND 
	ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is 
	now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the 
	depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising 
	up from the bottom.

	She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the 
	top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when 
	the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching 
	the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red 
	glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles.

	As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow 
	spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear 
	that the water is not water at all but blood.

	And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is 
	illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up.  
	Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It 
	is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The 
	bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams.

	Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same 
	point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then 
	another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately 
	to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.

				EPPS
		My God....

	Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the 
	blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far 
	apart.

	She struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the 
	surface.

	The others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches 
	out, near tears, helpless to do anything.

				EPPS
		No!!

	Everything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there.

	The blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to 
	its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking 
	on in disbelief.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		You okay?

	Epps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door.

				EPPS
		Yeah.
			(looking back to the 
			pool)
		Yeah, fine.

	A beat as she holds there, looking on at the pool.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREWARD DECK - NIGHT

	Greer, Murphy, Dodge, and Epps sit on deck around the fire.

				DODGE
		You'd think on a ship this size 
		there'd be something left to eat.

				GREER
		After fifty years there ain't nothin' 
		left but shoe leather.

				MURPHY
		Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find 
		some line and tackle. Use some of 
		those bodies below decks for bait.

				DODGE
		There's a charming thought.

				GREER
		We can always start shooting birds.

	Epps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette.

				DODGE
		What say, Epps? You up for some 
		roasted albatross?

				EPPS
			(snuffing it out)
		Why not?

	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	The SOUND OF SOMEONE BREATHING HARD CAN BE HEARD in the dark 
	room. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE ROOM, we see that 
	it is Greer, lying on the bed. His body is tense and his 
	arms arch rigidly toward his chest. His jaw is clenched and 
	he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something 
	between a night terror and a seizure.

	INT. CHIMERA - WHEELHOUSE - DAY

	Sheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of 
	morning. Murphy stands on the bridge, looking off at it coming 
	down when Greer steps in.

				GREER
		Looks like we're in a strong current.
			(closing the door)
		Must be making almost five knots 
		full on ass backwards.

	Greer crosses to the window, stepping up.

				GREER
		Nasty little swell outa the north 
		west too.

	Murphy nods as he looks out.

				MURPHY
		Let's just hope somebody sees us 
		first out here.

	INT. CHIMERA - PURSERS OFFICE - DAY

	A file drawer comes open, revealing ticket receipts.

	Epps looks on at it. The receipts are labeled "FULL FARE 
	PASSAGES" and are divided by first, second, and third class.  
	She goes through them, coming to a section that says 
	"ACCOMPANIED CHILDREN."

	She pulls out the folder, laying it on the counter, opening 
	it. The first page is a receipt for a single passage to 
	Halifax for a Tatterly, Stephen age: 14. She pulls it back 
	to reveal another, Wilson, Harold age: 4. Another, Vitti, 
	Angela age: 17.

	She pages through the stack, looking at the ages: 3, 15, 6, 
	11, 1, until coming across a 9. She looks to the name, Klein, 
	David, a boy. She continues paging through the receipts coming 
	to another 9. She stops, looking to the name, Nichols, 
	Katherine age: 16. A girl. She looks to the cabin assignment: 
	"400." She notes that it is the same cabin where Greer was 
	found, when a REVERBERANT CONCUSSION SOUNDS THROUGH THE SHIP.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge runs to the side to see a 15 feet wide by 40 feet tall 
	steel and concrete mid-ocean buoy bounce off the transom as 
	the ship drifts into it.

	WITH GREER AND MURPHY

	They come to the side at the wheelhouse, seeing the bright 
	orange letters "NOAA" emblazoned on the buoy's float pod as 
	the ship drifts by.

				MURPHY
		It's a Noaa buoy.

				GREER
		A what?

				MURPHY
		Government weather. It's got a 
		transmitter aboard.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as Greer, 
	Epps, and Murphy look on at the approaching buoy.

				MURPHY
		Let's go, let's go, let's go.

	Dodge finishes as Epps ties the other end off to a cleat.

	ON THE BUOY

	As it drifts along the side of the Chimera. Murphy drops the 
	line down, the buoy bouncing on the swell.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook 
	it on its wind gauge.

	ON THE BUOY

	The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy corrects.

				EPPS
		Higher. You're gonna miss it.

	Murphy holds the loop steady.

	ON THE BUOY

	The loop is too low. It's going to miss the mark as the buoy 
	drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes 
	down.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy yanks on the line.

	ON THE BUOY

	And the loop catches on the wind gauge.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time, 
	the line snapping hard against the rail. Below, the buoy 
	heels over as it's pulled.

	ON THE BUOY

	It drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging 
	the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with 
	a huge BOOMING CLANG.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing 
	bowing a little with the weight as they look on.

				GREER
		We're still drifting.

				MURPHY
		The mooring hasn't come taught.

				EPPS
		It's not gonna hold us.

				MURPHY
		Doesn't matter.

	ON THE BUOY

	As the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side 
	of the ship. The water returns, lifting it high.

	The ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its 
	mooring comes taught. The line rises with it and soon the 
	buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own 
	mooring.

	ON THE BUOY

	The buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it, 
	and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the 
	creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable.

				DODGE
		No fucking way.

	ON THE BUOY

	The gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free, 
	sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain 
	of spray, whipping wildly from side to side.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising 
	on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera.

				MURPHY
		Damn it.

	They look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the 
	ship drifts away.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Murphy stands watch by the fire as Epps joins him.

				EPPS
		Hey.

				MURPHY
		Hey.

				EPPS
		Couldn't sleep.

				MURPHY
		Wish I could say the same.

	They watch the fire in silence for a moment.

				EPPS
		What do you think happened on this 
		boat?

				MURPHY
		I guess that's the sixty four thousand 
		dollar question, isn't it?

				EPPS
		The what?

				MURPHY
		Never mind. Before your time.
			(a beat)
		I think at least some of the crew 
		went a little nuts. The usual stuff 
		that happens when people stumble on 
		a fortune. Equal parts greed and 
		paranoia, usually resulting in 
		homicide. What happened after that 
		is anybody's guess. But, judging by 
		our Greek friends down below, it 
		doesn't look like the last time.

				EPPS
		Are we smart enough to avoid that?

				MURPHY
		I don't know, are we?

	A beat as she looks back at him. She looks back to the fire, 
	watching it.

				EPPS
		When you found me yesterday, at the 
		pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.

				MURPHY
		Not our mystery guest again.

				EPPS
		No. Someone else. A girl.
			(hesitating, a beat)
		I'm not sure she was... real.

	She looks up to Murphy.

				MURPHY
		Not real?

	A beat as she only looks back.

				MURPHY
		What, like some kind of ghost?

				EPPS
		I don't know what else you'd call 
		her. One second she was there, the 
		next she was gone.

	Another beat as he looks on at her.

				EPPS
		And I had a kind of hallucination.
			(a beat)
		There were others. I saw them in the 
		pool. Drowning.

	A beat as Murphy looks back, as she sees him.

				EPPS
		Maybe hallucination is the wrong 
		word. It was more than that. As though 
		they were showing me.

				MURPHY
		Showing you what?

				EPPS
		What happened.

				MURPHY
		Maybe it was one of them did the 
		handy work on those Greeks.

				EPPS
		No. I think they are, were, just 
		passengers. Innocent victims.

				MURPHY
		Victims of what?

				EPPS
		Something bad happened here, Murphy.

				MURPHY
		That much I think we've already 
		established.

				EPPS
		More than just a mutiny. More than 
		just the gold.

	A beat as he holds there.

				EPPS
		She said the ship was evil. That we 
		had to leave right away. That if we 
		didn't, we might never leave.

				MURPHY
		What's that supposed to mean?

				EPPS
		I don't know.

	A beat as she looks back.

				MURPHY
		Why you? How come the rest of us 
		haven't seen these people?

				EPPS
		Just lucky I guess.

	Another beat as he holds on her.

				MURPHY
		Well. Getting off this ship's exactly 
		what we're trying to do.  Short of 
		that, I don't know what else to tell 
		you.

	She only looks back at him, then into the fire.

				MURPHY
		Do me a favor and wake up Dodge.  
		He's next on.

	She starts to get up.

				MURPHY
		And Epps?

	She stands, looking back at him.

				MURPHY
		You can tell the others about this.  
		But, for my money, I think it's best 
		you keep it to yourself.

	She holds there a beat longer, then turns, walking off.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to the 2nd officer's door, knocks.

				EPPS
		Dodge.
			(no answer, knocking 
			again)
		Dodge.

				DODGE (O.S.)
			(finally, from inside)
		What?

				EPPS
		Get up.

				DODGE (O.S.)
		Yeah, yeah.

	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT

	Epps sits down on the bed. She lies back, not sleepy. A beat 
	as she holds there in the darkness.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Murphy still sits by the fire as Dodge groggily approaches 
	from the officers quarters, carrying a blanket and a jug of 
	water.

				MURPHY
		You're late.

				DODGE
		Sorry.

				MURPHY
			(handing him the 
			shotgun)
		Don't fall asleep.

				DODGE
			(laying out his blanket)
		Right.

	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	Greer lies asleep on the bed. But his sleep is fitful, 
	increasingly agitated, tormented. It is as if he tries to 
	speak, but cannot. As THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN, his words 
	are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical 
	language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Dodge dozes, cradling the shotgun in his arms, when MUSIC 
	CAN BE HEARD VERY DISTANTLY. Dodge wakes. It is "Daisy" 
	playing on a music box somewhere in the ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge moves along as the MUSIC BOX DISTANTLY CONTINUES.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another 
	passageway.

	He approaches from the other end. He passes the open doors 
	of stateroom after stateroom. The MUSIC BOX IS CLOSER HERE. 
	It stops.

	He holds there in the darkness. He turns, shining his light 
	back down the passageway. A beat. It is silent, when the 
	CHANNEL OF HIS RADIO OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST.

	He raises his radio. But no one says anything, the CHANNEL 
	REMAINING OPEN, a discernible presence on the other end.

				DODGE
		Dodge.

	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the other 
	end of the passageway.

	BACK TO SCENE

	He gets no response, then presses the talk button.

				DODGE
		This is Dodge. Over.

	He is answered by silence, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, WHEN 
	THE GRAVELLY DISTORTED VOICE THAT MURPHY HEARD COMES BACK ON 
	THE RADIO:

				VOICE
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	Dodge hits the talk button.

				DODGE
		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS, but only silence comes back.

				DODGE
		Identify yourself, motherfucker!

	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the far 
	end of the passageway.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Only silence returns on the radio as Dodge holds there, then:

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN ON DODGE as he listens.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy --
		.

	Dodge senses something behind him. He turns, and before he 
	can draw a breath to shout, SOMETHING HEAVY SLAMS INTO HIM 
	IN THE DARKNESS, his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle 
	of light.

	ON SHOTGUN

	As the shotgun clatters to the deck, the muzzle resting in 
	frame as the radio falls a few feet away. A beat. The shotgun 
	muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing 
	pulls it away.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	A grey overcast stretches to the horizon.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - DAY

	Murphy comes out onto the deck. Dodge is nowhere to be seen.

				MURPHY
		Dodge?

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY STORAGE COMPARTMENT - DAY

	Epps shines her light on something.

				EPPS
		Check it out.

	Greer raises his light to reveal rows of canned goods. They 
	are industrial sized cans, from the 1950s. Greer takes one.

				GREER
		I don't even want to know what that's 
		gonna taste like now.

				EPPS
		Better than starving to death.

	Epps' radio CRACKLES AWAKE.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

				EPPS
			(raising the radio)
		Epps, over.

				MURPHY
		Either of you seen Dodge?

	She looks to Greer who shakes his head.

				EPPS
		Nope.

				MURPHY
		He's not on deck and I can't raise 
		him on the radio.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - LATER - DAY

	Dodge's stuff is laid out under the shelter of a vent duct 
	as Greer, Epps, and Murphy stand over it. A blanket, a pillow 
	and a plastic jug of water are all that remain.

				MURPHY
		He took the shotgun and a light.

				GREER
		Must've heard something below deck 
		and went down to check it out.

	A beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Alright. We stay together. Nobody 
		goes any further than earshot.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - DAY

	Greer and Epps move along as Murphy raises his radio.

				MURPHY
			(into radio)
		Murphy to Dodge. Murphy to Dodge.  
		Over.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge's radio lies in the detritus of the ship as Murphy's 
	voice can be heard on it.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Dodge. Do you copy? Over.

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINEERING - LATER - DAY

	Epps moves cautiously along in the darkness.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Epps? You there?

				EPPS
		Right here.

	WITH MURPHY

	As he moves along as well, eyes open.

				MURPHY
		Greer?

	WITH GREER

	As Greer moves along too.

				GREER
		Yeah, yeah.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

	Epps jumps down, shining her light over machinery and across 
	bulkheads when a WHISPERING CAN BE HEARD somewhere. She holds 
	there, listening. It is echoey, distant.

				EPPS
		Murphy?

	No response as Epps holds there. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN, 
	far off, unintelligible. It stops.

	She moves on, shinning her light.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves along in the darkness, holding the flashlight 
	before her, when the WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN.

	Epps stops, holding there in the silence. She reaches for 
	her radio. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN. Epps turns to pinpoint 
	it, coming from somewhere in the cavernous space.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps passes under a catwalk. She moves on, passing a row of 
	standpipes. Epps stops, listening. Somewhere, the WHISPERING 
	CAN BE HEARD, then stops.

	It is absolutely silent. In the darkness behind her, the 
	GIRL (KATIE) PULLS BACK INTO THE SHADOWS.

	Epps holds there a beat, then turns, running into Greer with 
	a start.

				GREER
		Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

	She holds there a beat, looking around.

				GREER
		You okay?

				EPPS
		Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard 
		something is all.

				GREER
		What?

				EPPS
		Nothing. Let's get outa here.

	They start to leave, when Epps notices something. She stops.

	Beyond the standpipes, a faint glow can be seen in the 
	darkness. Epps steps forward, crossing to it. Greer follows.

	MOVING WITH EPPS

	As Epps approaches, Greer behind her. The light is dim and 
	low to the deck. She stops.

	WITH THE LIGHT

	As Epps starts toward it again. She and Greer come up to it, 
	stopping there. She kneels, the dim glow shining on her. She 
	reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still 
	on.

	She turns it off, standing. She shines her light into the 
	darkness and starts off, Greer following.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go, 
	when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight.

	It is Dodge's radio. They stop over it. Epps picks it up, 
	inspecting it. She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot 
	appears on Epps' cheek. It begins to run, a crimson tear.

	She raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to 
	see that it is blood.

	She looks to Greer. They both look up to see, hanging 
	suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them 
	from the darkness.

	He has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high 
	pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging 
	limp beside it.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

	Greer and Murphy lower Dodge's body on a rope as Epps guides 
	it to the deck. They stand looking on at it a moment.

				GREER
		Can't find the shotgun.

				MURPHY
		So whoever did this now has our 
		shotgun.

				GREER
		Doesn't look like it much matters.

				EPPS
		What do we do with him?

				MURPHY
		Leave him till we can get some help.
			(a beat)
		From now on, nobody comes down here.

				GREER
		What about the gold?

				MURPHY
		Leave it.

				GREER
		Now hold up just a minute. Let's be 
		reasonable here.

				MURPHY
		You think whoever did this is 
		reasonable?

				GREER
		All I'm saying is that gold's worth 
		a lot more to us now than it ever 
		was.

				EPPS
		I can't believe you. Dodge's dead 
		and all you can think about is cashing 
		in your share.

				GREER
		I didn't sign up to go home empty 
		handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll 
		over for the freaky motherfucker did 
		this.

				MURPHY
		Nobody's going anywhere with that 
		gold now. Anybody tries to board, 
		we'll know about it.
			(a beat)
		You can do what you want, Greer.  
		But neither of us is gonna risk saving 
		your ass down here if it comes to 
		that.

				GREER
		Fine with me.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. She 
	moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where 
	Greer was found, room 400.

	She holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating. 
	She opens it.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though 
	spacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting 
	room in the front, is a bedroom.

	Epps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall.

	A large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the 
	foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the 
	process of being unpacked.

	From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other 
	contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear.

	Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on 
	an Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a 
	few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one 
	of the books, opening it.

	Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs 
	to:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols."

	A page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a 
	children's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of 
	a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle 
	doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I 
	know, but won't say so.'" She puts it down. A tin penny 
	whistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it.

	She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos 
	of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the 
	mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older 
	girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool, 
	KATIE. Epps holds on this picture, when A MUSIC BOX SOUNDS.  
	She looks up to the dressing table. On it a music box slowly 
	plays "Daisy."

	AT THE TABLE

	Epps crosses to it, looking on at the music box as it slowly 
	winds down, then finally stops. A beat. She picks it up, 
	looking at it, when she looks up to see Greer standing there.  
	A beat.

	The dirty white light falling into the room through the 
	windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot 
	see. His expression is empty, hollow.

				EPPS
		Greer?

	He does not hear her as he stands there. She approaches, 
	stepping up.

				EPPS
		You okay?

	Another beat, as he looks off, into the light, when he slowly 
	turns to see her.

	A long beat as she looks back. He holds there, the same empty 
	look about him, when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes 
	hard.

	She is stunned, breathless, but raises her hands to grip his 
	wrists, fighting him.

				EPPS
		Greer!

	His grip tightens. He is much stronger and her efforts make 
	little difference.

				EPPS
		Let go!

	She hangs on, starting to choke. She drops one hand, searching 
	with it.

				GREER
		Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska 
		getofedobrodijotosiantosg.

	He speaks nonsense, his face distorted in an ugly grimace, 
	eyes bulging as Epps fumbles over the table, a tray of glass 
	and silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still 
	choking her.

	He backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe 
	the rest of the way.

	Her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a 
	basket, some books. It comes to a brass desk lamp. It falls, 
	a little out of reach.

	She is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles 
	her.

	Her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it.

	She raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting 
	with Greer's head.

	He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks 
	in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger 
	marks.  She fumbles her radio up.

				EPPS
			(into radio)
		Murphy! I'm on C deck, cabin 400!  
		Get down here now!!

	Blood is running down his face as Greer comes for her again.  
	She throws down the radio.

	A bed stands between them. She feints right, then left. He's 
	dazed and has blood in his eyes. She manages to slip by, but 
	he dives, taking her down.

	He drags her back along the floor, spinning her around. He 
	raises a fist to ram into her face when WHAM!

	Epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch 
	and he comes up SCREAMING. He grabs her face, striking her 
	with his other hand.

	She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the 
	head. He swings yet again and connects, knocking her across 
	the floor.

	She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and 
	bleeding.

	He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his 
	waist to do God knows what.

	Epps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that 
	she has unhinged her gill knife.

	As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife 
	with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through 
	his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS.

	After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody, 
	wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy appears 
	in the doorway.

	Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from 
	behind at full speed, knocking him down.

	Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to her 
	feet. She staggers to them and raises the flashlight over 
	Greer, bringing it down on his head.

	CUT TO BLACK

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps and Murphy carry Greer's unconscious body.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

	Greer tumbles down a sand bank in an empty aquarium. He stops 
	at the bottom, now starting to come to.

	OUTSIDE

	Murphy slams the door shut as Epps looks on. She puts a steel 
	pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

	Greer sits in the tank, visible through a large piece of 
	armored aquarium glass, amidst the fake coral. He sits in 
	the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as 
	he speaks in his nonsensical language.

				MURPHY (V.O.)
		Must've been him all along.

	Murphy and Epps look on from the outside in the promenade.

				MURPHY
		Smashed the radio. Scuttled the boat. 
		Killed Dodge. Would've killed you. 
		He's off his nut, no doubt there.

	They watch him in silence a moment as Greer mutters and bobs.

				MURPHY
		What do you think?

				EPPS
		Could be a stroke. Who knows?
			(a beat)
		The general log said the crew were 
		fighting among themselves. "Like 
		wild dogs."

				MURPHY
		Over the gold.

				EPPS
		Maybe it was more than that.

	Greer gets up, comes to the window, looking out at them. He 
	presses his face to the glass.

				EPPS
		They went crazy.

				MURPHY
		Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not 
		like him.

	A beat as Epps looks off. In the window Greer drags his 
	hideously distorted face over the glass, the blood from his 
	wounds smearing in broad red streaks.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	A partial hull of a rotting life boat falls into frame. Epps 
	and Murphy stand over it.

				MURPHY
		We lash a few of these together it 
		might get us far enough into the 
		shipping lanes to be rescued.

	A beat as they look on at the rotting hull.

				MURPHY
		Hard to say which is worse, staying 
		here or taking our chances in open 
		water.

				EPPS
		If the weather holds it might not be 
		so bad.

				MURPHY
		It's not the weather I'm worried 
		about. The wrong current could drag 
		us as far as the Aleutians before we 
		come across another boat.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	Epps and Murphy work to lash parts of the rotting boats into 
	a single usable raft.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - DAY

	Greer lies asleep on the sand bottom of the tank, the white 
	light from the skylight falling on him from above.

	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE AREA - DAY

	Epps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces, making 
	her way into the darkness, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.  
	The channel remains silent a moment, then closes. She stops, 
	raises the radio.

				EPPS
			(holding down talk 
			button)
		Murphy?

	She waits, holding there as only silence comes back.

				EPPS
		Murphy, this is Epps. Do you copy?

	Again, only silence comes back until, after a moment, the 
	channel opens again. No one speaks, though there is a palpable 
	presence on the other end.

				EPPS
			(raising the radio)
		Who is this?

	The channel opens again, only silence returning. The sound 
	of the MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD, "DAISY" COMING BACK OVER THE 
	RADIO.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps walks along in the darkness AS THE MUSIC BOX CONTINUES 
	TO PLAY OVER THE RADIO. She comes to the end of the corridor, 
	stopping there.

	At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.

	The MUSIC FROM THE RADIO STOPS, leaving in its absence the 
	MUSIC AS IT CAN BE HEARD COMING FROM THE ROOM AT THE END OF 
	THE CORRIDOR.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps approaches the other end, from where the MUSIC EMANATES, 
	coming to a stop at room 400. A beat as she holds there.

	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps steps in as THE MUSIC BOX PLAYS IN THE OTHER ROOM.

	The sitting room is dark as she holds there. After a moment, 
	she continues on, coming to the bedroom.

	Epps steps in. Across the room the MUSIC BOX IS PLAYING.

	She crosses, coming to it as it continues, when her radio 
	CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then:

				VOICE
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	She holds there a beat, then crosses to the table to find 
	the book of nursery rhymes. She opens it to the nursery rhyme 
	"The Rooster and the Crow," seeing the same words on the 
	page, when the radio CRACKLES AGAIN.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	On the table is the penny whistle she saw earlier. She takes 
	it, holding on it a moment. She raises it and THE CAMERA 
	SLOWLY PUSHES IN as she puts it to her lips and lightly blows 
	a C-SHARP WHICH BECOMES A C-SHARP FROM A PENNY WHISTLE across 
	the room.

				MOTHER
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	On the other side of the room, the younger girl from the 
	photo plays the penny whistle. She is sitting on the floor 
	with the MOTHER who reads from the book we saw earlier.

				MOTHER
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so." Cassandra, 
		if you insist on playing that while 
		I read I'll just stop right now.

				THE GIRL
		Sorry.

	The room is warm with light, restored to its original 
	condition some fifty years ago as Epps stands there, unseen, 
	no longer holding the whistle.

	A man, the FATHER from the photos, steps from the bathroom 
	wearing a new coat.

				FATHER
		What do you think?

				MOTHER
		He certainly did shorten it, didn't 
		he?

				FATHER
		I thought this was all the rage.

				KATIE
		Maybe last year.

	Katie joins them from the outer room.

				FATHER
		What about this year?

				KATIE
		It's not your color anyway.

				GIRL
		I like it, daddy.

				FATHER
		Well thank you!

				GIRL
		Daddy, how much longer before we 
		start moving again?

				FATHER
		They're working on the engines, honey. 
		As soon as they fix them we'll be on 
		our way.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps steps from room 400 into the passageway. It is lit with 
	sconces running its length and the elegant furnishings and 
	objets d'art stretching to the far end are all in their 
	original condition. DISTANT MUSIC FROM THE BALLROOM CAN BE 
	HEARD as Epps stands there. She moves along.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks in the passageway. Doors are open and she looks 
	in to see people doing various things, some packing and 
	putting their things in order.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks down the passage, rounding the corner to see three 
	STEWARDS fighting with a fourth MAN in a tuxedo. They lift 
	him up and carry him off down the stairs as he shouts and 
	protests. She moves on, through a pair of double doors, into

	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves through the now lighted storage area off the 
	galley. A group of CREWMEN stand around at the other end 
	and, as Epps nears, she sees that four figures can be seen 
	among them. They are four men, OFFICERS, swaying gently from 
	the ship's movement as they hang from ropes around their 
	neck, dead. Epps keeps moving, through doors at the other 
	end.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	A commotion can be heard at the other end of the passageway 
	as Epps keeps moving. A WOMAN SCREAMS, and is cut off when a 
	door slams shut.

	The DISTANT MUSIC HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH INDISCERNIBLE 
	SHOUTING, as of someone commandeering the microphone somewhere

	As she walks, she passes an open door where several CREWMEN 
	fight over a steamer trunk, which breaks open, scattering 
	the contents.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks along, coming to another door where a dead man 
	and woman are laying in the middle of the room as a STEWARD 
	takes money from a wallet. The steward looks up, reaches 
	over and slams the door shut. She continues on.

	Another door stands open as she comes to it, back at room 
	400. She stops. A REPETITIVE SOUND CAN BE HEARD, coming from 
	inside.

	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps steps in as the SOUND CONTINUES. She crosses the sitting 
	room, coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several 
	MUTINEERS, some in stewards attire, others wearing ships 
	officers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners.

	The repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs. And, from 
	between the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of 
	the bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them, 
	the bed rocking, the others looking on.

	Epps turns to see the father. He is on his knees, hands tied 
	behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of 
	the bed.

	EPPS LOOKS DOWN TO SEE

	EPPS' POV

	a geometric pattern of a lotus on the Persian carpet at her 
	feet. When she looks up again she sees what the father sees.

	The mutineer finishes, climbing off the woman. Another of 
	the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all, 
	but Katie.

	The mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near-by as one of 
	the other mutineers steps up to Epps.

				MUTINEER
		You like that, daddy? I'll show you 
		something else now.

	The mutineer steps back to the bed. He sits Katie down so 
	that she faces us on the end of the bed. He raises an axe 
	over her, bringing it down as the world becomes a whirling 
	blur --

				EPPS (V.O.)
		NO!!!!

	BACK TO SCENE

	The CAMERA STOPS ON KATIE standing on the other side of the 
	room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned 
	state.

				KATIE
		It isn't real.

	Epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where 
	she stands.

				KATIE
		Many bad things have happened here.  
		But you mustn't allow the evil inside. 
		I tell you this because you can see 
		me. The others can't. But you must 
		leave. You must leave.

	A LOUD GUNSHOT SOUNDS SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. When Epps turns 
	back Katie is gone.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, raising her radio.

				MURPHY
		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK.

				EPPS
		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK as she rounds the corner out 
	onto the promenade. At the other end, the aquarium can be 
	seen.

	As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is 
	nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken 
	out.

	A GREAT BOOMING SHUDDER rocks the ship. A LOUD SCREECHING OF 
	METAL follows it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged 
	mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across.

	The ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands, a 
	mine field for a drifting ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up, 
	almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas 
	duffle.

				EPPS
		What happened?

				MURPHY
		We hit land.

				EPPS
		What?

				MURPHY
		We're in an island chain. It's only 
		a matter of time before we hit another 
		one.

				EPPS
		Greer's gone. He broke out of the 
		tank.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps and Murphy move quickly along, when another HUGE BOOMING 
	shudders the ship and the SHRIEKING OF METAL follows.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as 
	it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull 
	precariously.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As 
	they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the 
	passage some distance down.

	AT THE OTHER END

	Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face 
	down in the passage.

	They step up. Epps kneels as Murphy looks on. She rolls the 
	body over. It is Greer, dead.

				EPPS
		He's been shot.

	Murphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes.

				MURPHY
		Let's get the hell out of here.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy and Epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As Epps and Murphy come out, moving toward the make-do raft.

				MURPHY
		It should be enough to get us to one 
		of those islands. Gimme a hand, 
		wouldya?

	She joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to 
	the rail.

				MURPHY
		Prop it here. We need to pull these 
		braces off. There's a hammer on the 
		stand. There.

	Epps crosses back to the stands.

	AT THE STANDS

	Epps kneels. No hammer. She pulls back Murphy's canvas duffle, 
	folding back the flap to reveal a shotgun, the shotgun Dodge 
	had when he died.

	A beat as she holds there, when Murphy's hand grabs it.

				MURPHY
		I'll take that.

	A beat as she looks to Murphy.

				EPPS
		It was you.

	He only looks back at her as she stands there.

				EPPS
		You killed them.

				MURPHY
		It was only a matter of time before 
		somebody killed somebody.
			(a beat)
		You saw it coming as well as I did.  
		Dodge had his plans, starting with 
		scuttling the boat. And Greer too, 
		except he went nuts. Couldn't take 
		it, I guess. Could've happened in 
		the middle of downtown Anchorage.  
		But did it make him any less 
		dangerous? I don't think so.

				EPPS
		So you killed them?

				MURPHY
		The way I figure it, it was them or 
		me. I thought putting Dodge up on 
		that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a 
		little time. Made it look like whoever 
		killed those Greeks was still around. 
		But it's just us on this ship. Us 
		and your... spirit friends.

				EPPS
		And now you're gonna kill me, is 
		that it?

				MURPHY
		I didn't want it to turn out this 
		way.

				EPPS
		Murphy, don't you see what's 
		happening?

				MURPHY
		I think I see it pretty well.

				EPPS
		It's the ship. The ship's making you 
		think this way.

				MURPHY
		I know a little bit about human nature 
		and what I've seen only confirms 
		that.

				EPPS
		It's a trap. There was no way we 
		were gonna get away with that gold.  
		Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. 
		This ship sucks people in and it 
		never lets them out.

				MURPHY
		I think maybe you been on this boat 
		a little too long, with all that 
		supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's 
		nothing supernatural about greed.  
		And that's what it comes down to, 
		pure and simple.

				EPPS
		I don't give a damn about the gold.

				MURPHY
		I wish I could believe that. Either 
		way, you know what I've done. I've 
		got no choice.

	He raises the shotgun.

				MURPHY
		I'm sorry.

	He prepares to fire, when a CONCUSSION ROCKS THE SHIP. Epps 
	ducks and Murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the 
	vent behind her. A SCREECHING OF METAL DEEP IN THE SHIP SOUNDS 
	as she gets up, diving for cover as Murphy shuttles the gun 
	again.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps scrambles behind a deck vent.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship has bounced off yet another small island, the jagged 
	rocks loudly scrapping the hull with a deafening shriek.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy crosses toward the deck vent.

				MURPHY
		There's no reason to make this any 
		more difficult than it has to be.

	WITH EPPS

	As Epps holds there she sees the vent opening. She pulls 
	herself up and climbs inside.

	INT. CHIMERA - AIR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps climbs down the air shaft where a giant fan spans its 
	width. She squeezes through the fan blades and drops down 
	where several vent ducts lead in different directions below 
	it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy comes to the vent duct where Epps went down.

	INT. CHIMERA - AIR DUCT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps crawls through. She comes to a vent that leads out to a 
	passageway.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy runs quickly down the stairway, shotgun at the ready.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The CLANG FROM THE VENT SOUNDS HERE and Murphy stops.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps extends her feet and climbs down into the passage.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy rounds the corner, moving on the same deck.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when 
	something can be heard ahead of her. She stops.

	FOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back 
	into the shadows, holding there.

	The footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the 
	other end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP.

	Epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at 
	the other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch 
	slowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN 
	THE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving 
	toward it.

	As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, 
	swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.

	A CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps 
	into view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot 
	ricochets off the metal around her.

	She scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again. She swings 
	down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.

	AT THE BOTTOM

	Epps gets up, runs.

	WITH MURPHY

	Murphy climbs down a ladder to the lower decks.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy follows, when A RUMBLING SOUND CAN BE HEARD.

	INT. CHIMERA  - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking 
	on at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS 
	IN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the 
	ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below, 
	as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom.

	She steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it 
	becomes absolutely deafening.

	The ship begins to shudder. The steel bulkheads visibly move 
	and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back 
	and forth.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy slows and finally stops.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING 
	GROWS STILL LOUDER.

	Epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away, 
	when the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing 
	out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate 
	of the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH 
	WITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER.

	Epps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through 
	the Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a 
	HORRENDOUS TUMULT OF NOISE AND STEAM AND SPARKS.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The Chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious 
	rock promontory of a small island.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The giant claw begins to pull back, as the ship drifts off, 
	water pouring in behind it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship is drifting free of the island with the current, a 
	huge gash rising on its port side.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A massive torrent sweeps over Epps as seawater pours in 
	through the breach.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stops where he is to see water rushing in at the end 
	of the passage. He begins backing away.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps is forced under as the water in the hull is already 
	half way up the side, the ship listing WITH A GREAT GROANING 
	EXERTION.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy moves down the passageway, coming to the cargo 
	compartment.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps comes up for air. A clatter of all manner of debris, 
	tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead 
	as the ship eases over. A boiler breaks loose of its stays.

	Epps looks up to see it coming right for her. She ducks under 
	the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she 
	was.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps is forced down by the boiler, trapped between it and 
	the bulkhead.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The gold slides off the palette, crashing into the far wall.  
	Murphy hurries to it, collecting ingots and putting them in 
	his pockets.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps struggles under the water to free herself, but she is 
	trapped, the heavy boiler and its broken stays caging her.

	ABOVE THE WATER

	The level of the water has now almost completely reached the 
	deck above, filling the ship almost entirely below decks.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The water is threateningly high as Murphy pockets one last 
	ingot and makes his way for the exit.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck.  
	She swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at 
	the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the 
	murky water.

	Several more forms appear. They are human, suspended in the 
	water. As Epps looks, the several forms have become many.  
	They are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before.

	As they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges.  
	It is Katie.

	She reaches toward Epps, as if beckoning her to take her 
	hand from the other side. Epps raises her hand, taking it.

	The girl leads Epps down into the murky darkness where she 
	finds a way out. She takes her back further, coming to the 
	breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water.

	Katie stops at the breach. Epps turns to her. She only looks 
	back at Epps. Epps turns away, swimming upward toward the 
	light of the surface.

	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps breaks through, gasping for air. She looks to see the 
	Chimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully 
	awash.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy staggers through the flooded passage.

	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The Chimera is getting lower in the water, the bow submerged 
	and the stern beginning to rise.

	Epps sees another small island some distance off. She begins 
	swimming toward it.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water runs down the stairway as Murphy struggles toward the 
	top.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps swims as the ship sinks in the distance.

	INT. CHIMERA - PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A river of water rushes through as Murphy crosses with 
	difficulty.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps reaches the jagged rock of the island. She pulls herself 
	up.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water rushes in as Murphy wades out onto the Chimera's top 
	deck. He is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under 
	as he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft 
	portion rising above him as the bow sinks.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

	Epps collapses on the rocks.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the ship moves lower, Murphy pushes off. He bobs under 
	momentarily, then comes back up with difficulty. The forward 
	smoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the 
	current from the rushing water pulling him toward it.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

	Epps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that 
	pulls at Murphy. Murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he 
	is pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the 
	smokestack's opening.

	The ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of 
	the stack. He frantically grabs for something to hold on to, 
	without success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke 
	stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing 
	water.

	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

	Epps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on 
	at the Chimera, her stern rising high above water as she 
	goes down, when the RUMBLE OF ENGINES CAN BE HEARD.

	She turns to see a Coastguard plane sweeping low over the 
	Chimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts 
	and waves her arms.

	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

	The Coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time 
	dropping a survival pack.

	The Chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical 
	now, slipping further and further under.

	Epps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down.

	EXT. OCEAN - WITH CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The afterdeck of the Chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the 
	CAMERA PUSHING IN TO "CHIMERA" as the name comes to the water, 
	then slips slowly beneath the surface. And THE CAMERA FOLLOWS, 
	MOVING INTO THE WATER to reveal that, beneath the surface, 
	there is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the 
	ocean.

	FADE TO BLACK

			 THE END

							 FADE IN

	INT. BARGE - DAY

	Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps 
	down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern, 
	oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel 
	and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side.

	INT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light 
	on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She 
	kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking 
	in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.

	EXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a 
	rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean 
	by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. 
	It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which 
	means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north-
	west.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way 
	forward.

	EXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel 
	smoke rising from its massive turbine vents.

	Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and 
	professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific 
	Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her 
	true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts 
	and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be 
	considered pretty.

	She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches 
	to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto 
	the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the 
	bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing 
	that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward 
	the tug at the other end.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY

	DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's 
	name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge 
	(37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy 
	coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate 
	Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's 
	first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering 
	red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the 
	north.

	They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable 
	occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a 
	passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern 
	where the cable winds into a tow anchor.

				EPPS
		It's a slow leak.

	She unclips and drops to the deck.

				GREER
		What's slow?

				EPPS
		Maybe twenty gallons an hour.

				DODGE
		Where from?

				EPPS
		Amidships starboard at the beam.  
		Just under the waterline. I don't 
		think it's a problem.

				GREER
		Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think 
		it's a problem.

				DODGE
		I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar 
	and GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master, 
	pilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and 
	most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that 
	every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to 
	bet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE.

				GREER (V.O. RADIO)
		Greer to Murphy.

				MURPHY
			(lifting the radio)
		Go.

	Murphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up 
	at him from the stern.

				GREER
		The number nine on the starboard 
		side's half flooded. Epps says it's 
		a slow leak just under the waterline, 
		about twenty gallons an hour. They 
		must've pumped it before we left 
		Sitka.

				MURPHY
		Of course they did.

				GREER
		Let the buyer beware.

				MURPHY
		What do you say, Dodge?

				DODGE (V.O. RADIO)
			(taking the radio)
		If it started out at twenty an hour 
		the piece of shit'd be at the bottom 
		of the Gulf by now. Whether it'll 
		make St. Lawrence is anybody's guess.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY

	HIGH AND WIDE as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against 
	the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND - DAY

	The shores of St. Lawrence Island open into a small port 
	town of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior 
	approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one 
	side as it moves into the harbor.

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - LATER - DAY

	A smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the 
	listing barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie 
	her up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the 
	turbines.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat 
	Russian man, Vasili (60) and a MECHANIC in grease-covered 
	orange coveralls approach from the dock.

				VASILI
		I thought you say Tuesday.

				MURPHY
		Better late than never.

				VASILI
			(seeing the listing 
			barge)
		What's this?

				MURPHY
		You got a leak in the number nine 
		compartment.

				VASILI
		No, no. You got leak.

				MURPHY
		You pump it out and re-seam the hull, 
		she'll be good as new.

				VASILI
		That cost me twenty grand at least.

				MURPHY
		Fifteen, at the most.

				VASILI
		Twenty. You knock off twenty and 
		then we see. After my guy looks at 
		it.

	INT. VASILI'S OFFICE - DAY

	In a prefab office with a view of the shipyard, Vasili cuts 
	a check as Murphy and Greer look on. He tears it out of the 
	book, handing it across the desk to Murphy, who inspects it.

				MURPHY
		You're kidding, right?

				VASILI
		You want fair pay, make hamburger 
		for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to 
		sign.

	Vasili pushes a transfer register toward him. Murphy signs.

	EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY

	Greer and Murphy walk back toward the dock.

				GREER
		Not bad for dragging a leaky tub 
		half way to Russia.

				MURPHY
		He'll sell the scrap for three times 
		what he paid.

				GREER
		I must be in the wrong business.

				MURPHY
		You got that right.

				GREER
			(imitating Vasili)
		Better than "making hamburger for 
		Mickey D."

	INT. BAR - NIGHT

	A typical port town bar. Except this one is on an island in 
	the middle of the Bering Sea. Epps lines up a shot at the 
	pool table as a couple of SEAMEN check out her ass and a 
	tattoo of Wiley Coyote poking out of her pants. Greer reads 
	a paper near-by.

	Murphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a beer 
	and a cigarette. Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodge's 
	name on it. Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack 
	of hundreds.

				DODGE
		Much obliged, skipper.

	INT. BAR - LATER - NIGHT

	The place is a little more crowded now as Epps pushes her 
	way through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth. 
	She buys two beers and pays the BARTENDER from her envelope 
	of cash. She takes the beers back to the far wall where a 
	young off-duty COASTGUARDSMAN stands. He takes one, they 
	laugh.

	AT A TABLE

	Beers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them, 
	Dodge, Greer and Murphy look on at Epps across the room, who 
	is showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her neck.

				GREER
		Looks like Epps' gonna get some 
		tonight.

				DODGE
		With that coxswain dickhead.

				MURPHY
		You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?

				DODGE
		Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps?  
		Gimme a break.

	Greer and Murphy trade looks as Dodge raises his beer.

				DODGE
		What a laugh.

	A MINOR COMMOTION can be heard as they sit there.

				WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
		I'll show you, bitch!

	They look over to see the coastguardsman's GIRLFRIEND, late 
	20s, hefty in a red miniskirt and big hair.

				GIRLFRIEND
		You want to mess with me, I'll kick 
		your bitch ass, girl.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps coolly puts out her cigarette as a circle has gathered 
	around her and the girlfriend, anxious to see a girl fight.

				EPPS
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about. I just bought this guy a beer.

				GIRLFRIEND
		This "guy" is my man, honey.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Darlene --

				GIRLFRIEND
		You, shut up.

				EPPS
			(starting off)
		Listen, I don't want any trouble, 
		okay -- ?

				GIRLFRIEND
			(stopping Epps)
		Uh-uh. No. We're gonna fix this right 
		now.

				MURPHY
			(stepping up)
		What seems to be the trouble, ladies?

				RIVETER
		Whyn't you mind your own business, 
		chief.

	Murphy turns to see a shipyard RIVETER, a big man holding a 
	beer, still wearing his welding leathers. Murphy turns back 
	to Epps and the Girlfriend.

				MURPHY
		As I said, what seems to be the 
		trouble?

				RIVETER
		Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you 
		got your hearing aid turned down?

				MURPHY
		I heard you. But I'm choosing to 
		ignore you. Epps, let's go.

	Epps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking 
	Murphy by the collar.

				RIVETER
		These ladies was having themselves a 
		discussion and you're interrupting 
		it.

				MURPHY
		You got about two seconds to get 
		your paws off me, Tarzan.

				RIVETER
		Or what?

	Or WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks 
	in two over the Riveter's head.

	Dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half 
	he still holds, shaking his head.

	The Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs 
	buckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds 
	some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own.

				MURPHY
		Epps?

	He looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here. She 
	grabs her coat.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Wait.

	Epps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his 
	girlfriend.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Darlene. It's over.

	He gives her the ring from his finger. Murphy rolls his eyes 
	as the others look on.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		I don't love you anymore.

	Darlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her 
	on the back.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
			(to Epps)
		Come on, Candy. Let's get out of 
		here.

	The Coastguardsman takes her by the hand. Epps looks to Murphy 
	and the others as he leads her out.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps 
	approaches on the dock. She jumps down onto the deck, a spring 
	in her step and a song in her heart.

				EPPS
		Morning everybody.

				GREER
		Show your tatoos to that coxswain 
		last night, did you Epps?

				EPPS
		Showed him a hell of a lot more than 
		that.

				GREER
		I bet you did.

		Candy?

				EPPS
		It's my pen name.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY

	Murphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from 
	the dock as Greer studies the dawn sky.

	Dodge and Epps play cards at the galley table.

				DODGE
		Fuck it.

	He puts down his hand. Epps takes another drag from her 
	cigarette, collecting her winnings.

				EPPS
		One more?

				DODGE
		Why not.

	She gathers the cards, shuffles.

				DODGE
		What is your first name?

				EPPS
		What?

				DODGE
		It just occurred to me I don't know 
		your first name. All this time and I 
		don't know it.

	She deals the cards in silence.

				EPPS

		Maureen.

				DODGE
		What?

				EPPS
		Maureen.

				DODGE
		Maureen?

	She looks on at him as he holds there, takes his cards.

				EPPS
		What's yours?

	Dodge takes a drag from his cigarette, thinking about it.

				DODGE
		Roger.

				EPPS
		Roger?

				DODGE
		Yeah.

	She wants to laugh, but only studies her cards.

				DODGE
		You think that's funny

				EPPS

		No.

	She takes a hit from her cigarette as she plays her hand.

	THE SONG "SOS" BY ABBA BLASTS as the tug plows westward 
	through a steady chop and a mild swell.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. Greer has the CD player cranked 
	as he mans the helm in the glow of the pilothouse. He checks 
	the radar, holds there a beat. He turns the MUSIC DOWN and 
	picks up a walkie-talkie.

				GREER
			(into walkie)
		Greer to Murphy.

	Greer studies the radar display as he waits.

				MURPHY (V.O. RADIO)
		Yeah.

				GREER
		There's a large vessel out about ten 
		miles to the north-west.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy sits at his desk over the ship's log, holding his 
	radio.

				GREER
		I been watching it for close to an

		Alright. I'll be right up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy holds the radio mic as Greer looks on, Epps and Dodge 
	standing back.

				MURPHY
		This is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey

				MURPHY
		Too deep to anchor out there.

				GREER
		Looks like it's adrift.

				EPPS
		Could be a fishing boat.

				GREER
		Too big. More like a freighter.

				MURPHY
		What the hell would a freighter be 
		doing up here? It's way out of the

				DODGE
		Smugglers maybe.

		Smuggling what? Tundra grass?

	A beat as Murphy holds there. He raises the radio mic.

				MURPHY

	CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the phantom point flashes closer.

	Murphy looks on as Greer pilots, Dodge and Epps watching.

				MURPHY
		Alright. Back it off.

	Greer throttles back and the boat slows.

				MURPHY
		Hit the lights.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The halogen flood lights flare to life, brilliantly 
	illuminating the water in front of the boat.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The four of them look intently into the darkness beyond the 
	light. Murphy reaches for the spot control, sweeping a broad 
	beam of light with a joy stick.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	As the tug moves along, servo motors sweep the searchlight 
	over the bow of the boat and into the darkness.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	They peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves, 
	when a shadow looms into view.

				MURPHY
		Whoa, whoa.

	Greer throttles down all the way and they drift, as the shadow 
	looms bigger before them in the light from the boat.

	As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting 
	bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness 
	above them. Murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of 
	what appears to be a large, darkened ship. As they come 
	around, the name "CHIMERA" can be seen above the anchor 
	alleys.

				MURPHY
		"Chimera."

	Murphy reaches for the mic, hits the LOUD HAILER.

				MURPHY
		Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The tug is dwarfed by the massive rusting hulk of the Chimera 
	rising above it.

				MURPHY (O.S. LOUD HAILER)
		This is civilian tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior. Is there anyone aboard?

	The quiet rumble of the tug's turbines is the only sound.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy raises the mic again.

				MURPHY
		Chimera, I am hove to at your port 
		bow. Is there anyone aboard?

	They wait, looking on at the silent, darkened ship under the 
	glare of their lights.

				MURPHY
		Epps, come with me. You guys sit 
		tight.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps and Murphy, in heavy parkas, climb a hydraulic deck 
	crane up to the Chimera as Dodge man's the controls against 
	the movement of the water.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer holds the tug steady as Epps and Murphy can be seen 
	making their way up under the floodlights.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck. Epps 
	jumps down behind him. Murphy throws his light up on the 
	superstructure. All remnants of paint have been rusted over, 
	lending a still darker ominousness to it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps move cautiously along, shining their lights 
	as they go. Despite the omnipresent corrosion, everything 
	seems to be in order. The decks are clear and there is no 
	apparent damage. They come to a hatchway. Epps shines her 
	light down the darkened passage. Murphy moves in.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps move down the passageway. Even the walls in 
	here are rusted. They come to a flight of stairs.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer and Dodge wait. Greer reaches for his radio.

				GREER
			(into radio)
		Talk to me, skipper.

	After a moment, Murphy comes back on the radio.

				MURPHY
		We're in a stairwell just under the 
		main superstructure.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps climb the darkened stairway.

				MURPHY
		This is definitely an old boat, maybe 
		sixty years old. She hasn't been in 
		service for at least twenty years. 
		Probably a lot longer.

	They top the stairs and walk into a wider passageway which 
	takes them into an open area. Their lights shine around them, 
	revealing sinks and counters and racks of old kitchen 
	equipment, a few pots still hanging.

	They move through the galley and into another, narrower, 
	passageway.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer and Dodge look on.

				MURPHY
		It's funny.

				GREER
		How's that?

				MURPHY
		Besides a little rust, everything's 
		pretty well-preserved.

	Greer and Dodge look at each other.

				MURPHY
		How she got out here is one hell of 
		a good question.
			(a long beat, then)
		Jesus.

	Dodge and Greer hold there, waiting. Only silence from the 
	other end.

		What is it?

	No answer.

		Murphy.

	No answer.

		What is it?

	INT. CHIMERA - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps stand at the top of a stairway, looking over 
	an immense ballroom. Murphy raises his radio.

				MURPHY
		It's a passenger ship. It's a damn 
		passenger ship.

	Though it is dark, there is enough light to see its ornate 
	opulence, tables and chairs in place near a large dance floor 
	and orchestra well, and a magnificent crystal chandelier 
	hanging over it all.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Epps and Murphy climb down the deck crane as Greer and Dodge 
	meet them at the bottom.

				MURPHY
			(jumping down)
		There's nobody on that boat.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge, Epps, Greer and Murphy sit around the galley table.

				DODGE
		Probably slipped her moorings, got 
		tangled up in a current.

				EPPS
		Out here? What, so a seven hundred 
		foot passenger liner drifted out of 
		Spokane harbor and nobody managed to 
		bump into her until now?

				DODGE
		Somebody's probably looking for her 
		as we speak.

				MURPHY
		Whatever the reason, she's adrift 
		and abandoned. We've got every right 
		to salvage her.

				GREER
		You mean tow her back? That's a thirty 
		thousand ton ship you're talking 
		about.

				MURPHY
		We've done it before.

				DODGE
		Yeah, from one side of the harbor to 
		the other. But we got half the Bering 
		Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to 
		drag her over.

				MURPHY
		You have any idea how much a ship 
		like that could be worth in salvage? 
		The fittings alone could go for a 
		few million.

				DODGE
		If you get it back in one piece.

				MURPHY
		It's a risk I'm willing to take.

				GREER
		All we got to do is hit some rough 
		weather and you can forget about it.

				MURPHY
		So we cut her loose and wait it out. 
		A little weather couldn't be anything 
		she hasn't seen before.

				DODGE
		It's a bloody navigation hazard.  
		One boat can't control a ship that 
		size.

				MURPHY
		The damn thing's been floating around 
		for God knows how long and it hasn't 
		hit anything yet. So we take it easy. 
		A little of the old push pull.

	A long beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Listen. Forget this job's just a pay 
		check for a minute. You know I've 
		been good to you. But I'm prepared 
		to offer you something better now.
			(a beat)
		If we do this right, it's worth a 
		lot of money. A lot of money.

	They hold there looking on at him, waiting.

				EPPS
		Go on.

				MURPHY
		Salvage fees on a vessel like this 
		could come in around four million 
		bucks. At least. Who knows, could be 
		more. Could be a lot more.
			(a beat)
		What I'm proposing is... we split it 
		four ways.

	A beat. Dodge looks to Epps and Greer.

				MURPHY
		Think about it. A million bucks a 
		piece.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the Chimera. Greer 
	operates the deck crane, one of Dodge's mammoth cables 
	dangling from it down to the winch on the stern.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the 
	starboard anchor alley in the bow of the Chimera. Dodge pokes 
	his face out from the other side.

				DODGE
		Ready?

				EPPS
		Bring it on, dude.

	Dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with 
	a smaller pilot cable, which Epps takes and threads through 
	the loop at the end of the tow cable. She places the end of 
	the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten 
	it down, with the effect of joining the two cables.

				EPPS
		OK.

	Dodge disappears, pulling up the slack from the pilot cable 
	through the anchor alleys.

				DODGE (O.S.)

		Hit it!

	Epps reaches over and unhinges the crane hook and the tow 
	cable explosively drops, banging loudly against the Chimera's 
	hull with a shower of black rust.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge cranks a portable pulley winch on the deck, the pilot 
	cable slowly pulling the tow cable up through the anchor 
	alley.

	It is heavy and the winch shows the strain as Dodge cranks 
	it. He continues, when something gives in the winch mechanism 
	and the whole thing slides forward on the pilot cable, 
	entangling Dodge's leg and dragging him on his ass along the 
	deck.

	The boat goes dead in the water, thick black smoke billowing 
	from the turbine vents.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	as the bow slows in the water, the tow cables coming slack.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge pulls open the door. The place is thick with smoke as 
	he makes his way to the turbine gauges, Epps and Murphy 
	behind. Dodge opens the number one turbine cover, looks 
	inside.

				DODGE
		Mother fucker!

				MURPHY
		What is it?

				DODGE
		Threw a turbine blade.

	Dodge looks over the smoking turbine, pulls back an aluminum 
	intake blade, hot to the touch.

				DODGE
		Son of a bitch!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Greer, Dodge, Epps, and Murphy confer on the deck.

				DODGE
		The number one turbine's pretty well 
		trashed. Number two runs, but it's 
		way underpowered.

				MURPHY
		How long to fix?

				DODGE
		Hard to say. I gotta get in there 
		and have a look. At least a couple 
		days. Depending.

				GREER
		You think the extra strain caused 
		it?

				DODGE
		Nah. Everything was cool. It's just 
		one of those things.

	The Arctic Warrior floats tied to the side of the Chimera.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge has both turbines opened up as he works.

	INT. CHIMERA - MEZZANINE DECK - DAY

	Lights shine on what was once an elegant interior promenade.  
	Murphy and Greer stand looking on at it.

				MURPHY
		Some classy tub in it's day, huh?

				GREER
		Yeah.

				EPPS (O.S.)
		Check this out.

	AT THE PURSERS DESK

	Epps looks through a file cabinet behind a heavy wood counter 
	as Greer and Murphy approach.

				EPPS
		Everything's still here. Ticket 
		records, receipts, books of account.

	Greer picks one up.

				GREER
		One first class passage. Elizabeth 
		James. Dubayy to Halifax. January

		Chimera. Flag ship of the Dobbins 
		Kirk Line. Nova Scotia.

	INT. CHIMERA - "B" DECK - DAY

	Murphy, Epps, and Greer top a staircase out onto a long, 
	darkened corridor. They move down. Some of the doors are 
	open, faint light from port holes showing small cabins with 
	beds, desks, a few chairs.

	INT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - FORWARD PASSAGE - DAY

	Murphy, Epps, and Greer come to a hatchway marked "BRIDGE."

	INT. CHIMERA - BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	The forward windows show the expanse of the ocean before 
	them and the rusting foredeck about 150 feet below. Light 
	from the windows illuminates the bridge as Murphy, Greer and 
	Epps look around. Despite a little corrosion and a layer of 
	dirt, everything seems in its place.

				MURPHY
			(looking through 
			scattered charts and 
			papers)
		I'd sure like to get my hands on the 
		general log.

	Epps steps up to the wall, where several framed photos hang.

				GREER
		That must be the old man right there.

	The uniformed man in the photo is a gaunt, stern-looking man 
	from another century, with dark, hollow eyes.

				EPPS
		Looks like one hell of a stick up 
		his ass.

				GREER
		He'd let you off at the nearest port, 
		that's for sure.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - NIGHT

	A dimming purple horizon is giving way to night as the tug 
	floats under the bow of the Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT

	Dodge works up to his elbows in turbine 1 as Greer monitors 
	a pressure gauge.

				DODGE
		How about now?

				GREER
		Sixty pounds.

				DODGE
		What? You sure?

				GREER
		That's what it says.

				DODGE
			(geting up to have a 
			look)
		Lemme see.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	Through the pilothouse windows, the hull of the Chimera 
	disappears into the darkness beyond the tug's work lights.  
	Murphy sits at the chart table as Epps steps in.

				EPPS
		Coffee?

				MURPHY
			(sitting up)
		Yeah. Thanks.

	She brings him his cup, seeing the documents he brought back 
	from the Chimera.

				EPPS
			(taking a seat)
		What'd you find up there?

				MURPHY
		Some charts. A crew manifest.
			(looking them over)
		Looks like her last voyage was January 
		1953. The question is where the hell's 
		she been since.

				EPPS
		She was sailing up north, right?

				MURPHY
		Her destination was Halifax, yeah.

				EPPS
		Well, suppose she got a little further 
		north than she should have.  Got 
		stuck in the ice. The passengers and 
		crew evacuated. She froze into the 
		ice pack, which moved further north, 
		where it froze in solid. They write 
		it off. Fifty years later, the whole 
		global warming thing happens. The 
		ice melts, she gets loose and floats 
		around til somebody runs into her.

	Murphy nods, considering it.

				MURPHY
		As reasonable an explanation as any, 
		I guess.

	Epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it.

				MURPHY
		Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?

				EPPS
		Nope.

				MURPHY
		She was a two-masted brig boat sailing 
		out of New York in 1872.  One day 
		she was sighted off the coast of 
		Portugal by a merchant vessel, the 
		Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei 
		Gratia got closer, they discovered 
		that no one was at the helm of the 
		Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found 
		her completely deserted. The captain, 
		his wife, their daughter, and the 
		entire crew, all gone. The last entry 
		in their log made no mention of any 
		trouble. The table was even set for 
		dinner. And in the nine days after 
		the last entry, she sailed 700 miles 
		without anyone aboard.

				EPPS
		So what did happen?

				MURPHY
		Nobody knows. There've been a lot of 
		theories, of course. But we'll never 
		really know for sure.

				EPPS
		You think she's sailing without a 
		crew?

	Murphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow.

				MURPHY
		I think we'd be surprised where a 
		drifting ship might wind up with a 
		little wind and the right current.

				EPPS
		You're more practical than 
		superstitious.

				MURPHY
		Only way to be.

	Epps nods, takes another sip of coffee, looking on at the 
	rusting hull of the Chimera stretching off in the light.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Greer operates the crane arm as Dodge directs him. The crane 
	hoists out one of the massive turbine fans onto the deck.  
	Dodge gives him the thumbs up as it comes down easily.

				MURPHY
		What's this?

				DODGE
		Turbine rotor's shot.

				MURPHY
		I thought you said it was just a 
		blade.

				DODGE
		Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace 
		the whole deal.

				MURPHY
		How much longer's that gonna take?

				DODGE
		Like I always say --

				MURPHY
		I know I know, two ways to do anything --

				DODGE
		The right way and the wrong way.

				MURPHY
		But how long?

				DODGE
		Hard to say.

				MURPHY
		We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A 
		storm blows up and we're history.

				DODGE
		I'm telling you, you don't want to 
		be running that fan like it is.

				MURPHY
		What about running number two by 
		itself?

				DODGE
		It's a full 2500 horses down. We 
		couldn't drag that boat down hill on 
		ice with it.

				MURPHY
		How long, then?

				DODGE
		I gotta pull the blades and re-seat 
		everything in a new rotor -- .

				MURPHY
		How long?

				DODGE
		Three, four days.

				MURPHY
		Goddamit, Dodge.

				DODGE
		What do you want me to tell you, 
		that we can throw this sucker back 
		in and start pulling her like nothing 
		happened? Can't do it, skipper.

	A beat as Murphy stands there, knowing he's right.

		Obviously it's some kind of screw 
		up. The shipping records aren't a 
		hundred percent accurate.

				DODGE
		Man, it gives me the creeps. We got 
		no business towing a ship that size 
		anyway. I say we fix the turbines 
		and hit the highway.

				GREER
		Are you crazy? Do you realize we got

		Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have

	to Dubayy.

	Murphy sits at his desk over the map. His pencil point follows 
	the Persian Gulf from Dubayy, through the straight of Hormuz 
	into the Gulf of Oman. Murphy marks an "X" there. A beat as 
	he looks on at it.

	He opens a large envelope he found aboard the Chimera. He 
	empties it on the desk. He looks through it, docking receipts 
	from various ports of call, bills of lading, etc. He looks 
	over the passenger manifest.

	INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - DAY

	Epps steps from a passageway into a large public room. Tables 
	and chairs are scattered haphazardly, light falling in from 
	windows along the wall where tattered curtains hang. She 
	walks on.

	A pair of empty glasses sit on a table, an empty sherry 
	decanter beside them. An ashtray sits beside that. Epps stops, 
	reaching down. She pulls back a half-smoked cigarette, 
	lipstick smudging the end, yellowing and fragile from time.  
	And, as she stands there, we see a FIGURE, IN MURKY 
	SILHOUETTE, MOVE PAST THE DOORWAY IN THE BACKGROUND. In an 
	instant it is there and gone.

	She puts down the cigarette, having sensed a presence. She 
	turns to the doorway across the room, but there is nothing 
	to be seen now.

	INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares 
	into the middle distance. It lies on a love seat as Epps 
	steps up. She lifts it. Several other toys lie scattered 
	about as she studies it, when the sound of a TICKING CLOCK 
	CAN BE HEARD.

	A beat as Epps holds there. She turns, trying to locate the 
	sound. From across the room, Epps stands, listening. As the 
	TICKING CLOCK sounds from here. She turns, putting down the 
	doll, holding a beat. She approaches, crossing the room, 
	coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see 
	is an ancient grandfather clock.

	All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face, 
	but from inside it emits a weak though steady TICKING.

	Epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the 
	TICKING CEASES. A beat as she holds there, as the clock faces 
	her, now silent.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps shines her light in the darkness as she comes to a door 
	where daylight falls from a small port. She looks through 
	it.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps stands in a white tiled room. Light falls from port 
	holes high in the wall. Running its length is a small swimming 
	pool, it's rusted fixtures and stained surface creating 
	bizarre patterns.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to a row of changing stalls. Old clothing hangs 
	there, unused for fifty years. A pair of woman's shoes lie 
	on the floor.

	Epps moves along, passing through a doorway into

	INT. CHIMERA - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps enters another room scattered with old exercise equipment 
	circa 1950, a wooden rowing machine, barbells and a medicine 
	ball.

	She steps up to the wall, where pictures hang. The Chimera 
	can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm 
	sea.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - LATER - DAY

	Epps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to 
	see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive 
	diesel burner. She passes through into another compartment 
	where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to 
	the ceiling.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - PASSAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over 
	her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing 
	passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into 
	the depths of the ship.

	Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment, 
	apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on 
	loading palettes.

	In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps 
	comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to 
	reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat 
	of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly 
	preserved.

	Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more 
	wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps' 
	eye.

	A heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges, 
	as though blown back from some terrific explosive force.

	Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her 
	light inside.

	A clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the 
	shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She 
	swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object 
	between broken wood slats.

	Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The 
	yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away 
	some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram 
	ingot of gold.

	She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the 
	years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack 
	of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides 
	away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to 
	see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high 
	and five feet across.

	A beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in 
	gold.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY

	The debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x 
	4' stack of gold ingots.

				DODGE (O.S.)
		What the fuck we gonna do with it?

	Greer, Murphy, Epps, and Dodge all look on.

				GREER
		What the fuck you think we gonna do 
		with it? It's ours, baby. It's all 
		ours.

	Murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it.

				GREER
		How much you figure that's worth, 
		skipper?

				MURPHY
			(still looking it 
			over)
		Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty 
		million.

				GREER
		Ho, baby!

				EPPS
		That's a lot of money for somebody 
		to just let float away.

	Murphy looks up at her from the gold.

				MURPHY
		Yes, it is.

	A beat as they all hold there.

				MURPHY
		It's a hell of a lot of money.

				DODGE
		What, you think there's something 
		funny about it?

				MURPHY
		A ship with fifty million dollars in 
		gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems 
		to care enough to come looking for 
		it?

				GREER
		If they thought it was lost at sea, 
		they probably just wrote it off.

				MURPHY
		Not for fifty million. An ocean liner 
		maybe. But fifty million in gold, 
		they come looking for.

				EPPS
		Maybe they didn't want it back.  
		Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.

				MURPHY
		Maybe. But there's always somebody 
		whose interest's at stake.

				GREER
		All I gotta say is it looks like 
		that somebody's us right now.

	Greer cackles as he high fives Dodge.

				EPPS
		And it looks like somebody got here 
		before us too.

	The steel hatch is twisted, as from a great hand ripping it 
	back from the wall.

				DODGE
			(inspecting it)
		Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell 
		you that. Torn parts rusted bad as 
		the rest of the boat.

				MURPHY
		Then it happened before they scuttled 
		her.

				EPPS
		You mean, before she sank.

				GREER
		Cargo like this could make a crew 
		think twice.

				MURPHY
		That it could.

	A beat, as they all look on at the gold.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	After dinner, Murphy, Greer, Dodge and Epps sit around the 
	galley table.

				GREER
		Then why didn't they take it.

				EPPS
		Probably didn't have time.

				DODGE
		Or somebody stopped them.

				MURPHY
		Either way, they must've had a pretty 
		good reason.

				GREER
		Must be a damn good reason to jump 
		ship and leave fifty million dollars 
		aboard.

	A beat as they consider it.

				DODGE
		So what're we gonna do. That's the 
		big question, right?

				MURPHY
		A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's 
		as valid as a claim to the vessel 
		itself. It's ours.

				DODGE
		Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy 
		stinking rich.

				MURPHY
		It looks like it.

	A beat as they let this sink in.

				GREER
		So what? We gonna unload the gold 
		and get a move on?

				MURPHY
		We leave it where it is. Stick to 
		the plan.

				DODGE
		You gotta be kidding? What the hell 
		we need that tub for, we got fifty 
		million bucks?

				MURPHY
		So we get a little more for the boat. 
		Besides, the gold'll be safer where 
		it is.

				GREER
		Yeah, but we still gotta haul that 
		big piece of shit all the way back 
		to Sitka.

				MURPHY
		It's worth the effort. Believe me.  
		Besides we're gonna need her to prove 
		the salvage.

				EPPS
		Why not call for help?

				MURPHY
		For now the best thing we can do is 
		to keep quiet about this.

				DODGE
		Last thing we want is extra partners.

				EPPS
		Or uninvited guests.

				GREER
		I heard that.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.

				DODGE
		Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

				MURPHY
		The sooner we get under way, the 
		sooner we are to spending what's 
		ours.

		Two twenty two.

	Greer makes a note.

		Hell yeah.

	They slap hands.

	INT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Murphy moves down the darkened passage, coming to a door 
	marked "CAPTAIN." The door is ajar. He pushes it open.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in 
	dark wood. A large desk occupies a corner of the room by the 
	windows. Though dirty and worn with time, everything is 
	ordered and in its place.

	Murphy comes to the desk. He sits down in the chair behind 
	it. The surface is clear and uncluttered. He pulls out the 
	drawer to reveal pens, writing paper, a ruler, compass and 
	protractor amidst other sundry items.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER -

	slippers lie beneath it.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER -

	Murphy stands in the bathroom. The tile has yellowed with 
	time, but everything is exactly as it was left. Even the 
	shaving kit is neatly arrayed on the sink as Murphy looks on 
	at it. He looks up, seeing himself in the mirror, when an 
	EXPLOSION SOUNDS.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy comes to the railing, looking out over the bow of the 
	ship to see black smoke rising from where the Arctic Warrior 
	is tied.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer and Epps run to the side to see billowing smoke rising 
	from the Arctic Warrior as Murphy climbs down the crane to 
	the deck.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy jumps down to the deck. Flames belch from an open 
	hatch as Murphy grabs a fire extinguisher from a deck locker, 
	coming to the engine room door.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and 
	black smoke. He finds Dodge spraying at it with an 
	extinguisher of his own.

	The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well, 
	the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays a 
	cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment.

	Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and 
	hands singed.

	An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl through 
	the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in 
	fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire.

				DODGE
			(over the roar)
		Murphy!

	Murphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire, as Dodge 
	turns a cloud of halon on him, putting it out.

				DODGE
		Propane tanks're gonna go!

	Murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to 
	the most intense part of the flames. He turns the extinguisher 
	into them, holding it there.

	The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning 
	his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet again 
	as clouds of halon rise up.

	Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Dodge 
	fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the 
	wall again.

	Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine 
	well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the 
	deck, and finally out.

	They stand there in the sudden silence, the air heavy with 
	smoke. A fine layer of halon powder lies over everything, 
	but the fire is out.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Dodge smokes a cigarette, now starting to feel his burned 
	leg, which is oozing as Murphy and Greer look on.

				DODGE
		One minute I'm minding my own 
		business, the next thing I know the 
		whole place is burning up.
			(taking a drag)
		An oxygen tank must've blown on the 
		welder. Started an oil fire.

				GREER
		Looks like it took out the backup 
		genny too.

				MURPHY
		Terrific.

	Epps arrives with a first aid kit.

				MURPHY
		How's that leg?

	Epps cuts back the burned pant leg to see the burn.

				DODGE
		Seen better -- Ow!

	Epps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide.

				EPPS
		This's gonna hurt a little.

				DODGE
		Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!

	Epps keeps cleaning as Dodge bears it.

				GREER
		What now?

				MURPHY
		We could call for help.

				GREER
		And get a bunch of fools sniffin' 
		around here?

				EPPS
		What other choices have we got?

				DODGE
		I tell you one thing, we're not gonna 
		be towing no ship now.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as 
	he holds the radio mic.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, this is 
		tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha 
		sierra bravo four zero niner two. 
		Radio check. Over.

	A moment, then:

				COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
		Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic 
		Warrior. This is United States 
		Coastguard Station North Island. 
		Your radio check is affirmative. 
		Over.

				MURPHY
		Roger that, North Island. Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo 
		four zero niner two. Over and out.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge pours out a few cans of cold chili into a bowl and 
	takes it to the table where Epps, Greer, and Murphy sit under 
	the stark light of a gas lantern.

				GREER
		Fifty million four ways. That's twelve 
		million and change a piece.  What 
		you gonna do with your share, skipper?

				MURPHY
		Not much at all, I guess. Retire.  
		Live out my golden years and all 
		that.

				DODGE
		I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger.  
		Spend my time hauling rich Seattle 
		business men through the Puget.

				MURPHY
		How about you Epps?

				EPPS
		Guess I'll just keep working.

				DODGE
		What're you crazy?

				EPPS
		I like my job.

				MURPHY
		Greer?

				GREER
		Moving to Sweden.

				DODGE
		What's so great about Sweden?

				GREER
		It's a beautiful country. Very clean. 
		Very civilized. And cold.

				EPPS
		That's a good thing?

				GREER
		Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder 
		the better.

				DODGE
		Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish 
		girls you only gonna dream about.

				GREER
		We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.

				MURPHY
		Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be 
		doing if we don't get this boat 
		running.

				DODGE
		Yeah, yeah.

	A STRANGE SOUND BEGINS. IT IS LIKE A DISTANT SHRIEKING, AS 
	OF METAL AGAINST METAL, BUT ALMOST HUMAN, DISTANTLY ECHOING.

				GREER
		What the hell is that?

	The SHRIEKING CONTINUES, ECHOING EERILY AS IF FROM THE SEA.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer emerge on deck.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING IS LOUDER HERE, BUT SEEMS TO BE 
	EMANATING FROM DEEP IN THE SHIP as they stand facing it on 
	the bow.

				EPPS
		It's coming from inside.

	They hold there listening as the SHRIEKING CONTINUES.

				DODGE
		Sounds like the hull.

				MURPHY
		Warm water current maybe, making the 
		metal expand.

				GREER
		That shit is seriously bizarre.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING ECHO continues as they hold there.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	The engine room is black with soot, the turbines covered in 
	halon powder. Dodge stands there looking at it. He sighs.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

	Greer goes through shelves of supplies, finding a stack of 
	sterno cans and warming candles. He throws them into a wooden 
	crate of other supplies he's gathered.

	INT. CHIMERA - FIRST CLASS STATEROOM - DAY

	Epps slowly pushes open the door. She holds a sack with a 
	few items she's managed to scavenge. Light falls from 
	curtained windows onto the room. A divan sits against the 
	wall. A table stands in the middle of the room, a moth-eaten 
	velvet table cloth sitting under a brass lamp on top. Two 
	twin beds stand on either side. They are covered in dust and 
	are moth-eaten, unmade, as if the occupants had just gotten 
	up, fifty years ago.

	In one corner is an armoire. Epps steps up to it, pulling 
	back the door to reveal a rack of woman's clothing hanging 
	there undisturbed.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair, over 
	which is draped a woman's robe. Epps lifts it, the material 
	crumbling in her hands.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A drawer comes back to reveal a number of personal affects, 
	a man's billfold, cuff links, tarnished silver cigarette 
	holder and case, coins, black horn-rimmed glasses, pocket 
	watch and fob, and a room key.

	Epps pulls back the billfold. She opens it. Inside she finds 
	a Canadian passport a picture of a dark-haired man with a 
	mustache and black horn-rimmed glasses, circa 1950. In the 
	folds she finds three hundred Canadian dollars. An insert 
	holds pictures, of a suburban home, children, and a woman, 
	presumably his wife.

	INT. CHIMERA - "A" DECK PASSAGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps steps from the room. She turns to close the door, but 
	stops, holding there, strongly sensing something.

	THE CAMERA SLOWLY COMES AROUND TO HER OTHER SIDE, revealing 
	the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway 
	creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame 
	one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in 
	the foggy light from a porthole, a MAN in dark clothing.

	Epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses, 
	the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her. A 
	beat as they hold there. The man only stares back at her, 
	then turns to walk away.

				EPPS
		Hey!

	Epps moves off as the man walks around the corner.

				EPPS
		Hey, wait a minute! Hey!

	MOVING WITH Epps as she breaks into a run, going down the 
	passageway. She comes to the corner, rounding it out onto 
	another passageway. The man is nowhere to be seen.

	Epps moves quickly down the passageway, coming to the next 
	corner, rounding it out to see only another long passageway.  
	She turns back, running right into Murphy.

				MURPHY
		Take it easy, you'll live longer.

				EPPS
		Did you see him?

				MURPHY
		Who?

				EPPS
		The guy. He just came this way.

				MURPHY
		What guy?

				EPPS
		There's somebody else on this boat.

				MURPHY
		What? What the hell're you talking 
		about.

				EPPS
		I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some 
		guy.

				MURPHY
		Are you sure?

				EPPS
		Of course I'm sure. I saw him.

				MURPHY
		You sure it wasn't me?

				EPPS
		It wasn't you. It was somebody else. 
		There's somebody else aboard.

	A beat as Murphy looks back at her.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	Greer, Dodge, Murphy, and Epps stand around by lantern light.

				DODGE
		Light in those passages ain't so 
		good.

				EPPS
		I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I 
		don't know who it was. But I saw 
		somebody.

				GREER
		What'd he look like?

				EPPS
		Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get 
		a good look. He was far away. But I 
		saw him. I saw him as sure as you're 
		standing there.

				DODGE
		Where's his boat, then? Where's his 
		crew? He ain't gonna be out here by 
		himself, that's for damn sure.

				GREER
		She's so big somebody could come 
		alongside her on the other side and 
		we'd never know it.

				EPPS
		Maybe that is his boat.

				DODGE
		Gimme a break.

	A beat as they sit in silence.

				MURPHY
		If somebody's aboard her already, 
		she ain't ours. She's theirs.

				DODGE
		Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam 
		for fifty years. We found her. She's 
		ours.

				MURPHY
		Not in the eyes of the law.

				EPPS
		So, we find this guy and make a deal 
		with him.

				MURPHY
		We don't exactly have the best 
		bargaining position.

				DODGE
		I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a 
		professional salvage crew going about 
		our business. What's some yahoo doing 
		way out here by himself anyway?

				MURPHY
		And what do you propose? That we 
		knock this guy off?

				DODGE
		Why not? Why the fuck not?

	A beat as Murphy, Greer and Epps exchange looks.

				DODGE
		Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. 
		We gonna let this guy just take it 
		from us? One guy?

				EPPS
		So we kill him?

				DODGE
		I'm saying we gotta do whatever we 
		gotta do to preserve our interest.

				GREER
		I don't know.

				MURPHY
		Let's just take it easy here, alright? 
		Nobody's gonna kill anybody.

				GREER
		Supposing he wants to get bad with 
		us?

				DODGE
		One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.

				EPPS
		Maybe he isn't alone.

	They consider this a moment.

				GREER
		I say we off-load some of that gold 
		now.

				MURPHY
		Would you hold on just a minute here, 
		please? Look, there's no reason to 
		panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. 
		It's a big boat.  Chances're real 
		good he doesn't even know about the 
		gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be 
		the wiser.
			(a beat)
		The gold stays where it is til we're 
		ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a 
		hell of a lot safer there than here.

				DODGE
		What if that fucker finds it before 
		we're ready to go?

				MURPHY
		We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight 
		off. Low man first.

				EPPS
		Guess that'd be me. Again.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't 
		care if you don't sleep for a week.  
		The sooner you're done, the sooner 
		we can get out of here. How's the 
		food situation?

				GREER
		Pretty low all around.

				MURPHY
		We'll have to take it easy then. I 
		don't think we'll find much aboard 
		the ship, but it's probably worth 
		looking around.

				EPPS
		Say we run into this guy again.

	A beat as they consider this.

				MURPHY
		If he's reasonable, maybe we can 
		make some kind of deal. If not.  
		We'll have to re-consider our options.

				DODGE
		Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit 
		up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WARD LOCKER - NIGHT

	Epps is dressed in her cold weather gear as she opens a 
	locker, revealing a flare gun and a shotgun. Epps pulls back 
	the shotgun and a box of shells.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - NIGHT

	Murphy and Dodge look on as Epps loads the last of several 
	shotgun shells into the pump action short barrel 12-gauge.  
	She expertly shuttles a round into the chamber with one hand.  
	Dodge takes a hit from his cigarette as Greer crosses from 
	the deck house.

				DODGE
		Pretty handy with that scatter gun, 
		Epps. You raised on a farm?

				EPPS
			(setting the safety)
		Seen a lota movies.

				MURPHY
		No cowboy shit up there, understand?

				EPPS
		No cowboy shit. Right.

	Greer extends a thermos to Epps.

				GREER
		Coffee.

				EPPS
			(pocketing it in her 
			coat)
		You're a pal.

	She checks the squelch on her radio, pockets it too.

				MURPHY
		Got your light?

				EPPS
		Yup.

				DODGE
		Smokes?

				EPPS
		Oh yeah.

	Her bravado does little to hide her apprehension as she slings 
	the shotgun on her back.

				EPPS
		See you boys later.
			(to Greer)
		Don't be late, I need my beauty rest.

	She looks up, climbs onto the crane and up toward the darkened 
	ship above them.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	A flashlight beam cuts through the darkness as Epps 
	approaches. If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is 
	terrifying now. She comes to a ladder and climbs down.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps shines her light as she passes through, coming to the 
	cargo hold. She crosses in the darkness, her light catching 
	the tarnished glint of the gold. She comes up to it, stopping 
	there, looking on at it, a perfectly symmetrical fortune.

	She looks around for a place to sit. She drags a palette to 
	the bulkhead, settling in to face the rest of the compartment. 
	She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos 
	to pour herself a cup of coffee.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps has dozed off when a CLATTERING ECHOES DISTANTLY 
	somewhere in the ship. Epps wakes. It is silent, as she holds 
	there, not sure she heard anything, when a DISTANT BOOMING 
	SOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening.

	As Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly 
	somewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps moves along in the darkness when the DISTANT BOOMING 
	CAN BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN. She stops, holding there, in the 
	silence.

	INT. CHIMERA - SHAFT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive 
	propeller shaft hangs suspended above her. Epps moves along.  
	Finally she comes out into...

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She 
	continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing 
	into the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS.

	She turns, shinning her light back from where she came.  
	Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe 
	her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again 
	echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through 
	the line of burners. Nothing moves.

	Epps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive 
	watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding 
	herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks. 
	THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.

	She moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding 
	her light out before her. She comes to the end of the 
	compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still 
	closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting 
	machinery and a stack of oil drums.

	She approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the 
	BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here.

	She tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady 
	as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is 
	metallic and staccato.

	She stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums 
	have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs 
	her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at 
	the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way 
	through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that 
	betrays a throughway to the outside.

	The BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of 
	oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to 
	fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to 
	push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER.  
	She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off 
	the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic 
	flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large 
	albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top 
	of the ship and freedom.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

	She settles back, exhausted.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

				EPPS
			(taking her radio)
		Epps.

				MURPHY
		You just shoot at something?

				EPPS
		Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid 
		bird.

	She wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment, 
	when she smells something really awful.

	She steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the 
	toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam 
	of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light 
	on the form to see that it is a human torso.  A large gash 
	runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by 
	scavenging birds.

	She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on 
	something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in 
	front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with 
	wide, unseeing eyes.

	It takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines 
	her light back to the headless torso.

	She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent 
	steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried 
	blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind 
	her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her.

	She spins around to see another body above her. Except this 
	one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam 
	pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum 
	to mouth.

	One of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below 
	it.  A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another 
	bent pipe.

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

	A lantern illuminates the impaled bodies and their various 
	rotting parts.

				GREER (O.S.)
		Ho-ly shit.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Couldn't have happened much more 
		than a month ago.

	Greer, Dodge, and Epps look on as Murphy kneels over the 
	remains of the headless torso.

				MURPHY
		Bodies're too fresh.

				DODGE
		Fresh ain't the first word that comes 
		to mind.

	Murphy checks the pockets, finding a wallet. He looks through 
	it.

				MURPHY
		Greek citizen. Merchant navy.
			(standing)
		Obviously we aren't the first to 
		come across this ship. They probably 
		stumbled across it just like we did.

				GREER
		And look what happened.

				DODGE
		Damn barbaric is what it is.

				MURPHY
		Could be meant as a warning.

				GREER
		Stay away. Or else.

				EPPS
		Because of the gold.

				MURPHY
		That'd be my guess.

				DODGE
		So whoever did this might still be 
		around.

				GREER
		Maybe Epps's mystery man had something 
		to do with it.

				MURPHY
		Maybe.

	A beat as they consider the implications of this.

				EPPS
		So, what? We report this? Call the 
		Coastguard?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				DODGE
		Let's not be too hasty.

				GREER
		Yeah. Hell, what difference does it 
		make if we report it now or later?  
		We call this in now, gonna be 
		Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all 
		over the place.

	A beat as nobody's too sure about this.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, if this isn't incentive enough 
		to fix that boat, I don't know what 
		is.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge fires up a compressor, which feebly comes to life, 
	turning over the turbine, then sputtering out in a cloud of 
	smoke.

				DODGE
		All the seals and gaskets're shot.  
		Anything that was rubber burned up.

	Murphy stands at the doorway, looking on.

				MURPHY
		Can't you use something else?

				DODGE
		I might be able to find something on 
		the ship. But it's gonna take time.

				MURPHY
		Do what you need to do. Just do it 
		fast.

				DODGE
		Right.

	INT. CHIMERA - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

	Epps sleeps in her bunk.

	INT. CHIMERA - BETWEEN DECKS - DAY

	Dodge and Greer climb down in the darkness.

				DODGE
		I need lag bolts, especially one 
		inch standard. And sheet metal.  
		Preferably steel, about a sixteenth 
		of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll 
		do.

				GREER
		I ain't no mechanic, just so you 
		know.

				DODGE
		You find anything that even looks 
		like a compressor. I don't care what, 
		grab it.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stands in the cramped room, full of radios and 
	communications equipment. He looks through the shelves and 
	cabinets, when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book.  
	He pulls it back, opening it to see that it is a radio call 
	log. He takes a seat, paging through it.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - WITH GREER - LATER - DAY

	Greer works to disassemble a compressor mechanism. He has 
	difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench, when 
	he slips.

				GREER
		Dammit!

	A beat as he inspects his hand. In the silence A DISTANT 
	SHRIEK SOUNDS, maybe metal against metal or maybe human, 
	somewhere in the ship. He holds there, listening.

				GREER
		Dodge?

	He moves on, shinning his light as he goes.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer moves along in the darkness when he hears THE SHRIEKING 
	AGAIN coming from somewhere in the ship.

				GREER
		Dodge!

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer walks up a stairway, stepping into a darkened 
	passageway. The SHRIEKING SOUNDS, THIS TIME CLOSER, as it 
	echoes through the ship. He stops, holding there to listen.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer comes out onto another deck, stopping there. He looks 
	down the passageway a beat, then moves on. He passes through 
	a hatchway in a bulkhead when A MUSIC BOX CAN BE DISTANTLY 
	HEARD. He stops. The song is "DAISY" ("Daisy, Daisy, give me 
	your answer do. I'm half crazy, oh for the love of you.").

	He holds there, listening intently. A door stands open at 
	the other end of the passage. The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. He 
	moves forward, walking toward the end of the passage, and 
	the light falling from the open door.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy pages forward to the last page of the radio call log 
	book.

	On the page his finger runs down the columns of entries, 
	coming to "TRANSMISSION 1 Feb 53 21:34 hrs GMT. Engine trouble 
	notification made to passing vessel 'St. Charles.'"

	His finger moves down to the next entry, coming to: 
	"TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 09:52 hrs GMT. Dead in Water.  
	Notification made to passing vessel 'Normandy.'"

	His finger continues: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 14:07 hrs GMT.  
	Captain relieved of command. Notification made to passing 
	vessel 'China Sea.'"

				MURPHY
		Captain relieved of command.

	He holds there a moment, moving his finger down to the final 
	entry, reading: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 21:24 hrs GMT. General 
	SOS."

	He turns the page to see only the words "GOD SAVE US" scrawled 
	in faded red ink. A beat as he holds there, when a CHANNEL 
	OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST ON MURPHY'S RADIO. He looks to it, 
	but there is no response from the other end. Another SHORT 
	BURST AND THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. This time it remains open, 
	but no one says anything on the other end, UNTIL THE CHANNEL 
	CLOSES AGAIN.

	Murphy takes the radio.

				MURPHY
		This is Murphy. Anybody trying to 
		call me? Over.

	He waits as no response comes, then THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN.  
	Only silence from the other end as someone seems to be there, 
	but is not saying anything. Murphy presses the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Greer? Dodge?

	Again, there is no response, until the CHANNEL OPENS. Murphy 
	holds there as he is answered by silence, WHEN A GRAVELLY, 
	STRANGELY DISTORTED MALE VOICE COMES BACK ON THE RADIO:

				VOICE (V.O. RADIO)
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know, but won't say so."

	Murphy is momentarily stunned. He hits the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS. Only silence comes back, as if 
	someone were there but not speaking.

				MURPHY
		Who is this!!

	The CAMERA PUSHES IN AS MURPHY LISTENS.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	The CHANNEL CLOSES as the CAMERA STOPS CLOSE ON MURPHY.  
	Murphy squeezes the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Greer! Dodge!

	Only silence comes back from the radio when A MAN'S BLOOD 
	CURDLING SCREAM sounds from somewhere in the ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy moves quickly down the passageway when his radio 
	sounds.

				DODGE
		Dodge to Murphy.

				MURPHY
			(taking radio)
		Murphy.

				DODGE
		You better get down here quick, 
		skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.

				MURPHY
		What is it?

				DODGE
		I think you better see this for 
		yourself.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy comes down the stairs and into the passageway we saw 
	Greer in earlier. At the end, the light from the cabin falls 
	from the open door as he approaches.

	AT CABIN 400

	As Murphy comes to the door to see Dodge standing in the 
	middle of the cabin.

				DODGE
		I found him like this.

	Greer is lying supine on the floor. His legs are rigid and 
	his trunk is extended. His arms are flexed and twisted so 
	that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists 
	quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other.

	Murphy kneels beside him. Greer's eyelids are half closed, 
	his eyes rolled up into his head. His jaw is clenched, face 
	contorted in a bizarre grimace. And he speaks, uttering 
	nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in 
	tongues.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

	AN EYE - EXTREMELY CLOSE

	As a light shines in it, the pupil is fixed and dilated.

				EPPS (O.S.)
		Hard to say.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Greer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing 
	as Epps shines a flashlight into his eye, Dodge and Murphy 
	looking on. She turns it off, standing upright.

				EPPS
		I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a 
		coma.

				DODGE
		A what?

				EPPS
		I don't know what else you'd call 
		it. He's breathing on his own, but 
		his pupils are completely blown out. 
		He's totally unresponsive to pain.
			(a beat)
		What happened up there?

				DODGE
		I heard a scream. When I got there I 
		found him on the floor. He was having 
		some kind of seizure. I didn't see 
		anybody else.

				MURPHY
		He must've seen something.

	A beat as they consider this.

				EPPS
		Other than the obvious, there's 
		nothing wrong with him that I can 
		see, not on the outside.

				DODGE
		Then what the hell happened to him?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Just before I heard him yell there 
		was somebody on the radio.

				EPPS
		Greer?

				MURPHY
		I don't know. No. Not Greer.  
		Somebody.

	Another long beat as they think about this.

				MURPHY
		It was a man's voice. Repeating some 
		sort of children's rhyme. I don't 
		know, it didn't make any sense. You 
		didn't hear it?

				DODGE
		Not me.

	Another beat as this sinks in.

				EPPS
			(looking to Greer)
		He needs a doctor.

				MURPHY
		I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many 
		signal flares you can scrounge up.
			(to Epps, meaning 
			Dodge)
		Keep an eye on him.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as 
	he holds the radio mic.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, United 
		States Coastguard, United States 
		Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo 
		four zero niner two. Over.

	No response.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, United 
		States Coastguard, United States 
		Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo 
		four zero niner two. Over.

	Again, no response. He holds there, then finally:

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. To any vessel. 
		This is Arctic Warrior.  Arctic 
		Warrior. Arctic Warrior.  Whiskey 
		alpha sierra bravo four zero niner 
		two. Last known position one seven 
		four west, five seven north. I am 
		afloat and drifting.  Require 
		immediate medical assistance for one 
		person, possibly comatose. I am a 
		one hundred twenty foot civilian 
		tug, hove to at port bow of disabled 
		passenger liner Chimera. I repeat, 
		Chimera. Over.

	Only the desolate WHITE NOISE OF EMPTY AIR COMES BACK.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Greer lies unconscious as Epps looks on at him. The door 
	comes open and Murphy steps in.

				MURPHY
		How's he doing?

				EPPS
		Same. Any luck?

				MURPHY
		No. I'll try again later.

	A beat as they look on at Greer.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps sit at the galley table. Epps reads the log 
	book Murphy found in the radio room.

				EPPS
			(reading it)
		They're dead in the water that 
		morning. Four hours later the 
		captain's relieved of his command.  
		And that evening they issue a general 
		SOS.

				MURPHY
		Possibly false. Hence the IMA record 
		of being lost at sea. I don't think 
		mutiny's out of the question here.

				DODGE
			(taking a seat)
		On a passenger ship in 1953?

				MURPHY
		If they knew what they were carrying.

				EPPS
		You're saying they mutinied for the 
		gold?

				MURPHY
		If they were close enough to shore, 
		they probably figured they could get 
		away in the lifeboats.

				EPPS
		Only something must've gone wrong.

				DODGE
		Yeah, way wrong.

	A beat as they consider it.

				DODGE
		So. I got a question. Just from a, 
		you know, purely technical standpoint. 
		We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard 
		shows up. What exactly is the plan?

				MURPHY
		How do you mean?

				DODGE
		Well, they're gonna be asking a lot 
		of questions. About us. About those 
		bodies. About the gold. Seems like 
		we oughta be prepared is all.

				MURPHY
		I guess the best strategy's just to 
		tell them the truth.

				DODGE
		Yeah, well. The truth is one thing.  
		When there's more than a few hundred 
		million dollars involved, that's a 
		whole new deal.

				MURPHY
		What do you propose?

				DODGE
		For starters, getting that gold off 
		the ship. What they don't know about 
		isn't gonna bother them.

	A beat as Murphy holds there.

				MURPHY
		There's no way we're gonna hide a 
		few thousand pounds of gold from the 
		Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be 
		safer where it is.

				DODGE
		With all due respect, skipper.
			(a beat)
		Part of that up there's mine. I'd 
		kinda like to have a little say in 
		what happens to it.

	A beat as Murphy looks on.

				MURPHY
		Tell you what, Dodge. Once we get 
		back to shore, you can do whatever 
		you want with your share. But until 
		then, the gold stays right where it 
		is.

	Dodge holds there. He looks to Epps a beat, takes a drink of 
	coffee.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	The sun comes up over a spectacular cloud bank as the Arctic 
	Warrior drifts alongside the Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy crosses to the deck house, climbs the stairs.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy opens the door, stopping dead in his tracks. A beat.  
	He steps forward, crossing to the corner.

	The radio set lies before him, dented in and completely 
	demolished, as if someone had taken a bat to it.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from 
	behind and shoved into the wall. Murphy holds him fast.

				MURPHY
		Just what the hell do you think you're 
		doing?!

				DODGE
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about?

				MURPHY
		I think you know.

				DODGE
		Maybe you can tell me then.

	Murphy shoves him hard into the wall.

				MURPHY
		The radio!

				DODGE
			(not having a clue)
		The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip.

				DODGE
		Take it easy, willya? What about the 
		radio?!

				MURPHY
		You smashed it!

				DODGE
		What?!

				MURPHY
		Don't lie to me!

				DODGE
		What the fuck -- ?

				MURPHY
		You didn't want us calling anybody.  
		Too liable to ruin your big payday.

				DODGE
		I didn't touch the fucking radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip still more.

				DODGE
		I didn't touch the fucking radio!
			(a beat)
		Ever occur to you there's somebody 
		else on that boat, skipper?

				MURPHY
		Conveniently enough for you.

				DODGE
		Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?

	Murphy holds there a beat longer. He shoves Dodge back letting 
	him go.

				DODGE
		Jesus.

	Dodge checks his throat as Murphy looks on.

				EPPS (O.S.)
		Murphy.

	They turn to see Epps in the hatchway.

				EPPS
		It's Greer.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a 
	jug of water as Murphy and the others step in. He turns to 
	see them.

				GREER
		Never been more thirsty in my life.

				MURPHY
		Drink up then.

	Greer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a 
	seat, looking on at him.

				MURPHY
		How're you feeling?

				GREER
		Lost my sea legs.

				EPPS
		Any dizziness?

				GREER
		No.

				EPPS
		Headache, nausea, lights?

				GREER
		Lights?

				EPPS
		Sudden flashes of light.

				GREER
		I feel fine.

				DODGE
		What day is it?

				GREER
		I don't know. Tuesday?

				DODGE
		Wrong. It's Friday.

				EPPS
		Try Wednesday.

				DODGE
		Right. Wednesday.

	A beat as they all hold there. Greer takes a seat.

				GREER
		What happened?

				MURPHY
		You don't remember?

				GREER
		Last thing I remember I was aboard 
		the Chimera. Down somewhere in there 
		scavenging around.

				MURPHY
		You've been out for about a day.

				GREER
		Say what?

				MURPHY
		Dodge found you out cold in one of 
		the cabins.

	Greer only holds there.

				GREER
		Oh, man.

				MURPHY
		We heard you scream. Any idea what 
		you might've seen?

				GREER
		I wish I could tell you. I'd be real 
		interested to know myself.

	Another beat as they hold there, as Greer takes another drink 
	of water.

				MURPHY
		The ah... the radio's out.

				EPPS
		What?

				MURPHY
		Somebody took it out of commission 
		last night.

	A beat as they all hold there.

				MURPHY
		Smashed it up pretty bad.

				EPPS
		But, who -- ?

				DODGE
		The skipper seems to think I did it. 
		That I'm more interested in that 
		gold than my own safety or the safety 
		of my fellow shipmates.

	A beat as they hold there, as Murphy looks back.

				EPPS
		Did you?

				DODGE
		Hell no. You think I'm crazy?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Regardless of how it happened, there 
		isn't much of a chance to fix it. 
		The odds of another vessel in range 
		of the walkie-talkies are almost 
		astronomical. So, as of today, we're 
		pretty much on our own out here.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - DAY

	Epps and Murphy, carrying the shotgun, make their way in the 
	ship.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FIRST MATE'S QUARTERS - DAY

	Greer stops before a mirror to see himself. He finds an 
	aspirin bottle, goes to open it. And as he does so, he sees 
	that his hand is shaking uncontrollably.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge works over the turbine. He stops, holding there. He 
	looks on at the plugs and wires and hoses. A beat.

	He begins pulling out the hoses and wires, grabbing at them, 
	yanking them loose, breaking them off.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - DAY

	The chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty 
	assortment of tubes and condensers. Murphy looks on at it.

	WITH EPPS

	A tattered, bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten 
	corner. Epps picks it up. The cover has been ripped off and 
	the pages are torn. But, as she looks through it, she sees 
	that it is the ship's log.

				EPPS
		Murphy.

	Murphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the 
	very end. The last pages have been ripped out.

				EPPS
		Looks like part of the general log.

	Epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out.

				EPPS
		"The crew have gone mad with greed 
		and fight among themselves like wild 
		dogs over fresh kill."

				MURPHY
		February first.

				EPPS
		The same day she supposedly went 
		down.

				MURPHY
		Must not've been the captain's entry. 
		He was probably out of the picture 
		by then.

	Epps continues to read.

				EPPS
		"Their lacking diligence has 
		undoubtedly caused the collision.  
		Distress calls have been made."

				MURPHY
		Collision? With what?

				EPPS
		The page's missing. Then their SOS 
		was real.

				MURPHY
		But where's the damage?

				EPPS
		Maybe the other ship took the worst 
		of it.

				MURPHY
		If it was a ship she hit.

	A beat as they hold there, when his radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.

				DODGE
		Dodge to Murphy!

	Murphy reaches down for his radio.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Yeah.

				DODGE
		You better get down here right now!  
		We're taking water! Big time!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy and Epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is 
	starting to list to one side. He crosses to the deck house 
	and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly 
	filling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a 
	pump hose over the DIN OF THE PUMPS.

				MURPHY
		What the hell happened!

				DODGE
		Turbine chamber on number two must've 
		blown! Took out part of the hull!

				GREER
		We're not gonna be able to pump it!

				MURPHY
		Alright. Everybody grab your gear!  
		This' is where we get off!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	The tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash 
	with seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their 
	gear to the crane.

	Water is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the 
	towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs 
	precariously at the bow of the Chimera.

	Murphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse.

				MURPHY
		Dodge!

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to 
	one side. Dodge wades through toward the door.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind, 
	then Murphy.

	Dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug, 
	which now lists at a near 45 degree angle.

	WITH DODGE

	Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He 
	goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the 
	starboard rail.

	He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker 
	opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to 
	pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up 
	and edges his way toward the bow.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the 
	skewed deck crane.

	WITH DODGE

	The tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane, 
	the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera.

	Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it 
	sinks lower and lower.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	They look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug 
	pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship.

	Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing.

	WITH DODGE

	As Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the 
	other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water.

	Above, Greer casts a line. It falls near, but out of reach 
	as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and 
	fro.  Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming 
	close but not close enough.

	The swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and 
	Dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line, 
	coaxing it into his grasp. He pulls it back and hangs on, as 
	the crane sways back with the foundering boat.

	The crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space 
	by the line from the bow of the Chimera.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	Murphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water 
	and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves.

	Dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls 
	still further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea, 
	slipping lower and lower.

	WITH DODGE

	As he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail 
	well on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of 
	Dodge's hand.

	A SCREECHING SOUNDS and they turn to see the twin tow cables 
	coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the 
	Chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight.

	With a CONCUSSIVE STRIKE, one cable is freed, snapping against 
	the Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string.  It 
	starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the 
	cable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air.

	Dodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short.

	A LOUD HISSING SOUNDS and Dodge turns to see misty air 
	escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water 
	forces it out of the tug below decks.

	The tow cable LOUDLY SCRAPES THE HULL in a shower of rust, 
	as Dodge struggles to pull himself up.

	Murphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their 
	hands barely reaching.

	The tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to 
	scrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull 
	like a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with 
	everything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand.

	Murphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other 
	hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a 
	SICKENING GRINDING SOUND OF HEAVY STEEL AGAINST STEEL.

	Dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface, 
	slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation 
	of misty air. The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it 
	slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally 
	disappearing altogether into the depths.

	A long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence, phantom 
	bubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	A boot punches through a rotten wood hull.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		That just about says it all.

	Greer stands at the bow of a lifeboat suspended from halyards 
	above the deck.

				GREER
		Rotten stem to stern. Guess you 
		couldn't expect much else.

	Greer jumps down as Murphy, Dodge, and Epps look on.

				GREER
		We ain't exactly in what you'd call 
		your high traffic neighborhood either.

				MURPHY
		The coast guard has our last position. 
		They'll send somebody out soon enough. 
		A ship this size you can't exactly 
		miss.

				EPPS
		It's a good bet they'll be asking a 
		lot of questions when they get here 
		too.

				MURPHY
		Let 'em ask. This ship's legally 
		ours now.

				DODGE
		When they find out what it's carrying, 
		they may not be so interested in 
		what's legal.

				GREER
		Maybe you shoulda thought a that 
		before you scuttled our boat.

	Dodge turns to see Greer. A beat.

				DODGE
		The turbine blew.

				GREER
		Lemme see, was that before or after 
		the oil fire?

	A beat. Dodge takes a swing at Greer.

				MURPHY
			(grabbing Dodge)
		Easy, easy.

	Murphy holds on to Dodge as he will have none of it.

				GREER
		Gettin' a little hot under the collar, 
		I'd say.

				MURPHY
		Shut up.

				GREER
		Must be a little too the truth, eh 
		Dodge?

	Dodge jumps forward again, but Murphy hangs on.

				MURPHY
		I said, shut the hell up.

	Murphy shoves Dodge back.

				MURPHY
		Both of you. I don't want to hear it 
		again.

	A beat as Greer and Murphy hold there.

				MURPHY
		So just stow it. You understand?
			(a beat)
		We don't need this right now.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	A fire burns in an oil drum as Epps, Murphy, Dodge and Greer 
	sit around it in silence.

	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	Epps steps in. She shines her light on the room. It is exactly 
	as it was left. She crosses to the bed, shining her light 
	under it. She sits down, trying it.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

	Dodge moves in the darkness, coming to the corner where the 
	stacked gold ingots rest. He looks on at them.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		You shouldn't be down here alone.

	Dodge turns to see Murphy standing there.

				DODGE
		Just wanted to check on our little 
		baby.

	A beat as they look on at the gold.

				DODGE
		That oughta buy a man pretty much 
		anything he wants.

				MURPHY
		If money can buy what he wants.

				DODGE
		I don't figure there's much I want 
		money can't buy.

				MURPHY
		Then you're a lucky man.

	Murphy tosses the shotgun to Dodge, who catches it.

				MURPHY
		We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. 
		You're up first.

				DODGE
		Right.

	Murphy holds there a beat longer, then turns to go, as Dodge 
	looks after him.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	A grey chop gently rocks the Chimera, smoke rising from the 
	top deck.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	Greer and Dodge tend the flames of three fire barrels, adding 
	broken up furniture to create heavy signal smoke.

	INT. CHIMERA - PANTRY - DAY

	Murphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case, 
	scavenging for food.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

	Epps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large, 
	open galley, when a MOVEMENT CAN BE HEARD SOMEWHERE BEYOND 
	THE ENTRY separating the galley from the outer passageway.

				EPPS
		Murphy?

	No one answers. She looks off across the stillness of the 
	galley. Nothing.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps steps into the passageway. Directly across is the entry 
	to the swimming pool. She walks on.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

	Epps steps in. Light falls in from the dirty port holes at 
	the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls.  
	She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a 
	GIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool.

	Epps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is 
	porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her 
	clothing hanging loosely from a frail body.

				GIRL
		You must leave.

	A beat as Epps stands there.

				EPPS
			(finally)
		Who are you?

	From this distance and in the light it is hard to fully 
	discern the girl's features.

				GIRL
		There's great evil here, more than 
		you can know. Leave now or you may 
		never leave.

				EPPS
		But --

	A HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look.  
	When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND 
	ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is 
	now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the 
	depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising 
	up from the bottom.

	She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the 
	top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when 
	the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching 
	the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red 
	glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles.

	As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow 
	spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear 
	that the water is not water at all but blood.

	And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is 
	illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up.  
	Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It 
	is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The 
	bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams.

	Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same 
	point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then 
	another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately 
	to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.

				EPPS
		My God....

	Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the 
	blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far 
	apart.

	She struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the 
	surface.

	The others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches 
	out, near tears, helpless to do anything.

				EPPS
		No!!

	Everything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there.

	The blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to 
	its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking 
	on in disbelief.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		You okay?

	Epps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door.

				EPPS
		Yeah.
			(looking back to the 
			pool)
		Yeah, fine.

	A beat as she holds there, looking on at the pool.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREWARD DECK - NIGHT

	Greer, Murphy, Dodge, and Epps sit on deck around the fire.

				DODGE
		You'd think on a ship this size 
		there'd be something left to eat.

				GREER
		After fifty years there ain't nothin' 
		left but shoe leather.

				MURPHY
		Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find 
		some line and tackle. Use some of 
		those bodies below decks for bait.

				DODGE
		There's a charming thought.

				GREER
		We can always start shooting birds.

	Epps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette.

				DODGE
		What say, Epps? You up for some 
		roasted albatross?

				EPPS
			(snuffing it out)
		Why not?

	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	The SOUND OF SOMEONE BREATHING HARD CAN BE HEARD in the dark 
	room. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE ROOM, we see that 
	it is Greer, lying on the bed. His body is tense and his 
	arms arch rigidly toward his chest. His jaw is clenched and 
	he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something 
	between a night terror and a seizure.

	INT. CHIMERA - WHEELHOUSE - DAY

	Sheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of 
	morning. Murphy stands on the bridge, looking off at it coming 
	down when Greer steps in.

				GREER
		Looks like we're in a strong current.
			(closing the door)
		Must be making almost five knots 
		full on ass backwards.

	Greer crosses to the window, stepping up.

				GREER
		Nasty little swell outa the north 
		west too.

	Murphy nods as he looks out.

				MURPHY
		Let's just hope somebody sees us 
		first out here.

	INT. CHIMERA - PURSERS OFFICE - DAY

	A file drawer comes open, revealing ticket receipts.

	Epps looks on at it. The receipts are labeled "FULL FARE 
	PASSAGES" and are divided by first, second, and third class.  
	She goes through them, coming to a section that says 
	"ACCOMPANIED CHILDREN."

	She pulls out the folder, laying it on the counter, opening 
	it. The first page is a receipt for a single passage to 
	Halifax for a Tatterly, Stephen age: 14. She pulls it back 
	to reveal another, Wilson, Harold age: 4. Another, Vitti, 
	Angela age: 17.

	She pages through the stack, looking at the ages: 3, 15, 6, 
	11, 1, until coming across a 9. She looks to the name, Klein, 
	David, a boy. She continues paging through the receipts coming 
	to another 9. She stops, looking to the name, Nichols, 
	Katherine age: 16. A girl. She looks to the cabin assignment: 
	"400." She notes that it is the same cabin where Greer was 
	found, when a REVERBERANT CONCUSSION SOUNDS THROUGH THE SHIP.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge runs to the side to see a 15 feet wide by 40 feet tall 
	steel and concrete mid-ocean buoy bounce off the transom as 
	the ship drifts into it.

	WITH GREER AND MURPHY

	They come to the side at the wheelhouse, seeing the bright 
	orange letters "NOAA" emblazoned on the buoy's float pod as 
	the ship drifts by.

				MURPHY
		It's a Noaa buoy.

				GREER
		A what?

				MURPHY
		Government weather. It's got a 
		transmitter aboard.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as Greer, 
	Epps, and Murphy look on at the approaching buoy.

				MURPHY
		Let's go, let's go, let's go.

	Dodge finishes as Epps ties the other end off to a cleat.

	ON THE BUOY

	As it drifts along the side of the Chimera. Murphy drops the 
	line down, the buoy bouncing on the swell.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook 
	it on its wind gauge.

	ON THE BUOY

	The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy corrects.

				EPPS
		Higher. You're gonna miss it.

	Murphy holds the loop steady.

	ON THE BUOY

	The loop is too low. It's going to miss the mark as the buoy 
	drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes 
	down.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy yanks on the line.

	ON THE BUOY

	And the loop catches on the wind gauge.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time, 
	the line snapping hard against the rail. Below, the buoy 
	heels over as it's pulled.

	ON THE BUOY

	It drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging 
	the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with 
	a huge BOOMING CLANG.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing 
	bowing a little with the weight as they look on.

				GREER
		We're still drifting.

				MURPHY
		The mooring hasn't come taught.

				EPPS
		It's not gonna hold us.

				MURPHY
		Doesn't matter.

	ON THE BUOY

	As the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side 
	of the ship. The water returns, lifting it high.

	The ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its 
	mooring comes taught. The line rises with it and soon the 
	buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own 
	mooring.

	ON THE BUOY

	The buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it, 
	and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the 
	creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable.

				DODGE
		No fucking way.

	ON THE BUOY

	The gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free, 
	sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain 
	of spray, whipping wildly from side to side.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising 
	on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera.

				MURPHY
		Damn it.

	They look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the 
	ship drifts away.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Murphy stands watch by the fire as Epps joins him.

				EPPS
		Hey.

				MURPHY
		Hey.

				EPPS
		Couldn't sleep.

				MURPHY
		Wish I could say the same.

	They watch the fire in silence for a moment.

				EPPS
		What do you think happened on this 
		boat?

				MURPHY
		I guess that's the sixty four thousand 
		dollar question, isn't it?

				EPPS
		The what?

				MURPHY
		Never mind. Before your time.
			(a beat)
		I think at least some of the crew 
		went a little nuts. The usual stuff 
		that happens when people stumble on 
		a fortune. Equal parts greed and 
		paranoia, usually resulting in 
		homicide. What happened after that 
		is anybody's guess. But, judging by 
		our Greek friends down below, it 
		doesn't look like the last time.

				EPPS
		Are we smart enough to avoid that?

				MURPHY
		I don't know, are we?

	A beat as she looks back at him. She looks back to the fire, 
	watching it.

				EPPS
		When you found me yesterday, at the 
		pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.

				MURPHY
		Not our mystery guest again.

				EPPS
		No. Someone else. A girl.
			(hesitating, a beat)
		I'm not sure she was... real.

	She looks up to Murphy.

				MURPHY
		Not real?

	A beat as she only looks back.

				MURPHY
		What, like some kind of ghost?

				EPPS
		I don't know what else you'd call 
		her. One second she was there, the 
		next she was gone.

	Another beat as he looks on at her.

				EPPS
		And I had a kind of hallucination.
			(a beat)
		There were others. I saw them in the 
		pool. Drowning.

	A beat as Murphy looks back, as she sees him.

				EPPS
		Maybe hallucination is the wrong 
		word. It was more than that. As though 
		they were showing me.

				MURPHY
		Showing you what?

				EPPS
		What happened.

				MURPHY
		Maybe it was one of them did the 
		handy work on those Greeks.

				EPPS
		No. I think they are, were, just 
		passengers. Innocent victims.

				MURPHY
		Victims of what?

				EPPS
		Something bad happened here, Murphy.

				MURPHY
		That much I think we've already 
		established.

				EPPS
		More than just a mutiny. More than 
		just the gold.

	A beat as he holds there.

				EPPS
		She said the ship was evil. That we 
		had to leave right away. That if we 
		didn't, we might never leave.

				MURPHY
		What's that supposed to mean?

				EPPS
		I don't know.

	A beat as she looks back.

				MURPHY
		Why you? How come the rest of us 
		haven't seen these people?

				EPPS
		Just lucky I guess.

	Another beat as he holds on her.

				MURPHY
		Well. Getting off this ship's exactly 
		what we're trying to do.  Short of 
		that, I don't know what else to tell 
		you.

	She only looks back at him, then into the fire.

				MURPHY
		Do me a favor and wake up Dodge.  
		He's next on.

	She starts to get up.

				MURPHY
		And Epps?

	She stands, looking back at him.

				MURPHY
		You can tell the others about this.  
		But, for my money, I think it's best 
		you keep it to yourself.

	She holds there a beat longer, then turns, walking off.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to the 2nd officer's door, knocks.

				EPPS
		Dodge.
			(no answer, knocking 
			again)
		Dodge.

				DODGE (O.S.)
			(finally, from inside)
		What?

				EPPS
		Get up.

				DODGE (O.S.)
		Yeah, yeah.

	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT

	Epps sits down on the bed. She lies back, not sleepy. A beat 
	as she holds there in the darkness.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Murphy still sits by the fire as Dodge groggily approaches 
	from the officers quarters, carrying a blanket and a jug of 
	water.

				MURPHY
		You're late.

				DODGE
		Sorry.

				MURPHY
			(handing him the 
			shotgun)
		Don't fall asleep.

				DODGE
			(laying out his blanket)
		Right.

	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	Greer lies asleep on the bed. But his sleep is fitful, 
	increasingly agitated, tormented. It is as if he tries to 
	speak, but cannot. As THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN, his words 
	are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical 
	language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Dodge dozes, cradling the shotgun in his arms, when MUSIC 
	CAN BE HEARD VERY DISTANTLY. Dodge wakes. It is "Daisy" 
	playing on a music box somewhere in the ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge moves along as the MUSIC BOX DISTANTLY CONTINUES.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another 
	passageway.

	He approaches from the other end. He passes the open doors 
	of stateroom after stateroom. The MUSIC BOX IS CLOSER HERE. 
	It stops.

	He holds there in the darkness. He turns, shining his light 
	back down the passageway. A beat. It is silent, when the 
	CHANNEL OF HIS RADIO OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST.

	He raises his radio. But no one says anything, the CHANNEL 
	REMAINING OPEN, a discernible presence on the other end.

				DODGE
		Dodge.

	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the other 
	end of the passageway.

	BACK TO SCENE

	He gets no response, then presses the talk button.

				DODGE
		This is Dodge. Over.

	He is answered by silence, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, WHEN 
	THE GRAVELLY DISTORTED VOICE THAT MURPHY HEARD COMES BACK ON 
	THE RADIO:

				VOICE
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	Dodge hits the talk button.

				DODGE
		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS, but only silence comes back.

				DODGE
		Identify yourself, motherfucker!

	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the far 
	end of the passageway.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Only silence returns on the radio as Dodge holds there, then:

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN ON DODGE as he listens.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy --
		.

	Dodge senses something behind him. He turns, and before he 
	can draw a breath to shout, SOMETHING HEAVY SLAMS INTO HIM 
	IN THE DARKNESS, his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle 
	of light.

	ON SHOTGUN

	As the shotgun clatters to the deck, the muzzle resting in 
	frame as the radio falls a few feet away. A beat. The shotgun 
	muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing 
	pulls it away.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	A grey overcast stretches to the horizon.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - DAY

	Murphy comes out onto the deck. Dodge is nowhere to be seen.

				MURPHY
		Dodge?

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY STORAGE COMPARTMENT - DAY

	Epps shines her light on something.

				EPPS
		Check it out.

	Greer raises his light to reveal rows of canned goods. They 
	are industrial sized cans, from the 1950s. Greer takes one.

				GREER
		I don't even want to know what that's 
		gonna taste like now.

				EPPS
		Better than starving to death.

	Epps' radio CRACKLES AWAKE.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

				EPPS
			(raising the radio)
		Epps, over.

				MURPHY
		Either of you seen Dodge?

	She looks to Greer who shakes his head.

				EPPS
		Nope.

				MURPHY
		He's not on deck and I can't raise 
		him on the radio.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - LATER - DAY

	Dodge's stuff is laid out under the shelter of a vent duct 
	as Greer, Epps, and Murphy stand over it. A blanket, a pillow 
	and a plastic jug of water are all that remain.

				MURPHY
		He took the shotgun and a light.

				GREER
		Must've heard something below deck 
		and went down to check it out.

	A beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Alright. We stay together. Nobody 
		goes any further than earshot.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - DAY

	Greer and Epps move along as Murphy raises his radio.

				MURPHY
			(into radio)
		Murphy to Dodge. Murphy to Dodge.  
		Over.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge's radio lies in the detritus of the ship as Murphy's 
	voice can be heard on it.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Dodge. Do you copy? Over.

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINEERING - LATER - DAY

	Epps moves cautiously along in the darkness.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Epps? You there?

				EPPS
		Right here.

	WITH MURPHY

	As he moves along as well, eyes open.

				MURPHY
		Greer?

	WITH GREER

	As Greer moves along too.

				GREER
		Yeah, yeah.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

	Epps jumps down, shining her light over machinery and across 
	bulkheads when a WHISPERING CAN BE HEARD somewhere. She holds 
	there, listening. It is echoey, distant.

				EPPS
		Murphy?

	No response as Epps holds there. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN, 
	far off, unintelligible. It stops.

	She moves on, shinning her light.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves along in the darkness, holding the flashlight 
	before her, when the WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN.

	Epps stops, holding there in the silence. She reaches for 
	her radio. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN. Epps turns to pinpoint 
	it, coming from somewhere in the cavernous space.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps passes under a catwalk. She moves on, passing a row of 
	standpipes. Epps stops, listening. Somewhere, the WHISPERING 
	CAN BE HEARD, then stops.

	It is absolutely silent. In the darkness behind her, the 
	GIRL (KATIE) PULLS BACK INTO THE SHADOWS.

	Epps holds there a beat, then turns, running into Greer with 
	a start.

				GREER
		Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

	She holds there a beat, looking around.

				GREER
		You okay?

				EPPS
		Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard 
		something is all.

				GREER
		What?

				EPPS
		Nothing. Let's get outa here.

	They start to leave, when Epps notices something. She stops.

	Beyond the standpipes, a faint glow can be seen in the 
	darkness. Epps steps forward, crossing to it. Greer follows.

	MOVING WITH EPPS

	As Epps approaches, Greer behind her. The light is dim and 
	low to the deck. She stops.

	WITH THE LIGHT

	As Epps starts toward it again. She and Greer come up to it, 
	stopping there. She kneels, the dim glow shining on her. She 
	reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still 
	on.

	She turns it off, standing. She shines her light into the 
	darkness and starts off, Greer following.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go, 
	when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight.

	It is Dodge's radio. They stop over it. Epps picks it up, 
	inspecting it. She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot 
	appears on Epps' cheek. It begins to run, a crimson tear.

	She raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to 
	see that it is blood.

	She looks to Greer. They both look up to see, hanging 
	suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them 
	from the darkness.

	He has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high 
	pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging 
	limp beside it.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

	Greer and Murphy lower Dodge's body on a rope as Epps guides 
	it to the deck. They stand looking on at it a moment.

				GREER
		Can't find the shotgun.

				MURPHY
		So whoever did this now has our 
		shotgun.

				GREER
		Doesn't look like it much matters.

				EPPS
		What do we do with him?

				MURPHY
		Leave him till we can get some help.
			(a beat)
		From now on, nobody comes down here.

				GREER
		What about the gold?

				MURPHY
		Leave it.

				GREER
		Now hold up just a minute. Let's be 
		reasonable here.

				MURPHY
		You think whoever did this is 
		reasonable?

				GREER
		All I'm saying is that gold's worth 
		a lot more to us now than it ever 
		was.

				EPPS
		I can't believe you. Dodge's dead 
		and all you can think about is cashing 
		in your share.

				GREER
		I didn't sign up to go home empty 
		handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll 
		over for the freaky motherfucker did 
		this.

				MURPHY
		Nobody's going anywhere with that 
		gold now. Anybody tries to board, 
		we'll know about it.
			(a beat)
		You can do what you want, Greer.  
		But neither of us is gonna risk saving 
		your ass down here if it comes to 
		that.

				GREER
		Fine with me.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. She 
	moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where 
	Greer was found, room 400.

	She holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating. 
	She opens it.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though 
	spacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting 
	room in the front, is a bedroom.

	Epps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall.

	A large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the 
	foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the 
	process of being unpacked.

	From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other 
	contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear.

	Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on 
	an Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a 
	few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one 
	of the books, opening it.

	Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs 
	to:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols."

	A page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a 
	children's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of 
	a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle 
	doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I 
	know, but won't say so.'" She puts it down. A tin penny 
	whistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it.

	She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos 
	of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the 
	mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older 
	girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool, 
	KATIE. Epps holds on this picture, when A MUSIC BOX SOUNDS.  
	She looks up to the dressing table. On it a music box slowly 
	plays "Daisy."

	AT THE TABLE

	Epps crosses to it, looking on at the music box as it slowly 
	winds down, then finally stops. A beat. She picks it up, 
	looking at it, when she looks up to see Greer standing there.  
	A beat.

	The dirty white light falling into the room through the 
	windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot 
	see. His expression is empty, hollow.

				EPPS
		Greer?

	He does not hear her as he stands there. She approaches, 
	stepping up.

				EPPS
		You okay?

	Another beat, as he looks off, into the light, when he slowly 
	turns to see her.

	A long beat as she looks back. He holds there, the same empty 
	look about him, when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes 
	hard.

	She is stunned, breathless, but raises her hands to grip his 
	wrists, fighting him.

				EPPS
		Greer!

	His grip tightens. He is much stronger and her efforts make 
	little difference.

				EPPS
		Let go!

	She hangs on, starting to choke. She drops one hand, searching 
	with it.

				GREER
		Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska 
		getofedobrodijotosiantosg.

	He speaks nonsense, his face distorted in an ugly grimace, 
	eyes bulging as Epps fumbles over the table, a tray of glass 
	and silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still 
	choking her.

	He backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe 
	the rest of the way.

	Her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a 
	basket, some books. It comes to a brass desk lamp. It falls, 
	a little out of reach.

	She is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles 
	her.

	Her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it.

	She raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting 
	with Greer's head.

	He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks 
	in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger 
	marks.  She fumbles her radio up.

				EPPS
			(into radio)
		Murphy! I'm on C deck, cabin 400!  
		Get down here now!!

	Blood is running down his face as Greer comes for her again.  
	She throws down the radio.

	A bed stands between them. She feints right, then left. He's 
	dazed and has blood in his eyes. She manages to slip by, but 
	he dives, taking her down.

	He drags her back along the floor, spinning her around. He 
	raises a fist to ram into her face when WHAM!

	Epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch 
	and he comes up SCREAMING. He grabs her face, striking her 
	with his other hand.

	She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the 
	head. He swings yet again and connects, knocking her across 
	the floor.

	She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and 
	bleeding.

	He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his 
	waist to do God knows what.

	Epps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that 
	she has unhinged her gill knife.

	As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife 
	with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through 
	his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS.

	After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody, 
	wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy appears 
	in the doorway.

	Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from 
	behind at full speed, knocking him down.

	Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to her 
	feet. She staggers to them and raises the flashlight over 
	Greer, bringing it down on his head.

	CUT TO BLACK

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps and Murphy carry Greer's unconscious body.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

	Greer tumbles down a sand bank in an empty aquarium. He stops 
	at the bottom, now starting to come to.

	OUTSIDE

	Murphy slams the door shut as Epps looks on. She puts a steel 
	pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

	Greer sits in the tank, visible through a large piece of 
	armored aquarium glass, amidst the fake coral. He sits in 
	the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as 
	he speaks in his nonsensical language.

				MURPHY (V.O.)
		Must've been him all along.

	Murphy and Epps look on from the outside in the promenade.

				MURPHY
		Smashed the radio. Scuttled the boat. 
		Killed Dodge. Would've killed you. 
		He's off his nut, no doubt there.

	They watch him in silence a moment as Greer mutters and bobs.

				MURPHY
		What do you think?

				EPPS
		Could be a stroke. Who knows?
			(a beat)
		The general log said the crew were 
		fighting among themselves. "Like 
		wild dogs."

				MURPHY
		Over the gold.

				EPPS
		Maybe it was more than that.

	Greer gets up, comes to the window, looking out at them. He 
	presses his face to the glass.

				EPPS
		They went crazy.

				MURPHY
		Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not 
		like him.

	A beat as Epps looks off. In the window Greer drags his 
	hideously distorted face over the glass, the blood from his 
	wounds smearing in broad red streaks.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	A partial hull of a rotting life boat falls into frame. Epps 
	and Murphy stand over it.

				MURPHY
		We lash a few of these together it 
		might get us far enough into the 
		shipping lanes to be rescued.

	A beat as they look on at the rotting hull.

				MURPHY
		Hard to say which is worse, staying 
		here or taking our chances in open 
		water.

				EPPS
		If the weather holds it might not be 
		so bad.

				MURPHY
		It's not the weather I'm worried 
		about. The wrong current could drag 
		us as far as the Aleutians before we 
		come across another boat.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	Epps and Murphy work to lash parts of the rotting boats into 
	a single usable raft.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - DAY

	Greer lies asleep on the sand bottom of the tank, the white 
	light from the skylight falling on him from above.

	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE AREA - DAY

	Epps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces, making 
	her way into the darkness, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.  
	The channel remains silent a moment, then closes. She stops, 
	raises the radio.

				EPPS
			(holding down talk 
			button)
		Murphy?

	She waits, holding there as only silence comes back.

				EPPS
		Murphy, this is Epps. Do you copy?

	Again, only silence comes back until, after a moment, the 
	channel opens again. No one speaks, though there is a palpable 
	presence on the other end.

				EPPS
			(raising the radio)
		Who is this?

	The channel opens again, only silence returning. The sound 
	of the MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD, "DAISY" COMING BACK OVER THE 
	RADIO.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps walks along in the darkness AS THE MUSIC BOX CONTINUES 
	TO PLAY OVER THE RADIO. She comes to the end of the corridor, 
	stopping there.

	At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.

	The MUSIC FROM THE RADIO STOPS, leaving in its absence the 
	MUSIC AS IT CAN BE HEARD COMING FROM THE ROOM AT THE END OF 
	THE CORRIDOR.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps approaches the other end, from where the MUSIC EMANATES, 
	coming to a stop at room 400. A beat as she holds there.

	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps steps in as THE MUSIC BOX PLAYS IN THE OTHER ROOM.

	The sitting room is dark as she holds there. After a moment, 
	she continues on, coming to the bedroom.

	Epps steps in. Across the room the MUSIC BOX IS PLAYING.

	She crosses, coming to it as it continues, when her radio 
	CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then:

				VOICE
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	She holds there a beat, then crosses to the table to find 
	the book of nursery rhymes. She opens it to the nursery rhyme 
	"The Rooster and the Crow," seeing the same words on the 
	page, when the radio CRACKLES AGAIN.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	On the table is the penny whistle she saw earlier. She takes 
	it, holding on it a moment. She raises it and THE CAMERA 
	SLOWLY PUSHES IN as she puts it to her lips and lightly blows 
	a C-SHARP WHICH BECOMES A C-SHARP FROM A PENNY WHISTLE across 
	the room.

				MOTHER
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	On the other side of the room, the younger girl from the 
	photo plays the penny whistle. She is sitting on the floor 
	with the MOTHER who reads from the book we saw earlier.

				MOTHER
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so." Cassandra, 
		if you insist on playing that while 
		I read I'll just stop right now.

				THE GIRL
		Sorry.

	The room is warm with light, restored to its original 
	condition some fifty years ago as Epps stands there, unseen, 
	no longer holding the whistle.

	A man, the FATHER from the photos, steps from the bathroom 
	wearing a new coat.

				FATHER
		What do you think?

				MOTHER
		He certainly did shorten it, didn't 
		he?

				FATHER
		I thought this was all the rage.

				KATIE
		Maybe last year.

	Katie joins them from the outer room.

				FATHER
		What about this year?

				KATIE
		It's not your color anyway.

				GIRL
		I like it, daddy.

				FATHER
		Well thank you!

				GIRL
		Daddy, how much longer before we 
		start moving again?

				FATHER
		They're working on the engines, honey. 
		As soon as they fix them we'll be on 
		our way.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps steps from room 400 into the passageway. It is lit with 
	sconces running its length and the elegant furnishings and 
	objets d'art stretching to the far end are all in their 
	original condition. DISTANT MUSIC FROM THE BALLROOM CAN BE 
	HEARD as Epps stands there. She moves along.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks in the passageway. Doors are open and she looks 
	in to see people doing various things, some packing and 
	putting their things in order.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks down the passage, rounding the corner to see three 
	STEWARDS fighting with a fourth MAN in a tuxedo. They lift 
	him up and carry him off down the stairs as he shouts and 
	protests. She moves on, through a pair of double doors, into

	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves through the now lighted storage area off the 
	galley. A group of CREWMEN stand around at the other end 
	and, as Epps nears, she sees that four figures can be seen 
	among them. They are four men, OFFICERS, swaying gently from 
	the ship's movement as they hang from ropes around their 
	neck, dead. Epps keeps moving, through doors at the other 
	end.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	A commotion can be heard at the other end of the passageway 
	as Epps keeps moving. A WOMAN SCREAMS, and is cut off when a 
	door slams shut.

	The DISTANT MUSIC HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH INDISCERNIBLE 
	SHOUTING, as of someone commandeering the microphone somewhere

	As she walks, she passes an open door where several CREWMEN 
	fight over a steamer trunk, which breaks open, scattering 
	the contents.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks along, coming to another door where a dead man 
	and woman are laying in the middle of the room as a STEWARD 
	takes money from a wallet. The steward looks up, reaches 
	over and slams the door shut. She continues on.

	Another door stands open as she comes to it, back at room 
	400. She stops. A REPETITIVE SOUND CAN BE HEARD, coming from 
	inside.

	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps steps in as the SOUND CONTINUES. She crosses the sitting 
	room, coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several 
	MUTINEERS, some in stewards attire, others wearing ships 
	officers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners.

	The repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs. And, from 
	between the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of 
	the bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them, 
	the bed rocking, the others looking on.

	Epps turns to see the father. He is on his knees, hands tied 
	behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of 
	the bed.

	EPPS LOOKS DOWN TO SEE

	EPPS' POV

	a geometric pattern of a lotus on the Persian carpet at her 
	feet. When she looks up again she sees what the father sees.

	The mutineer finishes, climbing off the woman. Another of 
	the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all, 
	but Katie.

	The mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near-by as one of 
	the other mutineers steps up to Epps.

				MUTINEER
		You like that, daddy? I'll show you 
		something else now.

	The mutineer steps back to the bed. He sits Katie down so 
	that she faces us on the end of the bed. He raises an axe 
	over her, bringing it down as the world becomes a whirling 
	blur --

				EPPS (V.O.)
		NO!!!!

	BACK TO SCENE

	The CAMERA STOPS ON KATIE standing on the other side of the 
	room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned 
	state.

				KATIE
		It isn't real.

	Epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where 
	she stands.

				KATIE
		Many bad things have happened here.  
		But you mustn't allow the evil inside. 
		I tell you this because you can see 
		me. The others can't. But you must 
		leave. You must leave.

	A LOUD GUNSHOT SOUNDS SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. When Epps turns 
	back Katie is gone.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, raising her radio.

				MURPHY
		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK.

				EPPS
		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK as she rounds the corner out 
	onto the promenade. At the other end, the aquarium can be 
	seen.

	As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is 
	nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken 
	out.

	A GREAT BOOMING SHUDDER rocks the ship. A LOUD SCREECHING OF 
	METAL follows it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged 
	mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across.

	The ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands, a 
	mine field for a drifting ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up, 
	almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas 
	duffle.

				EPPS
		What happened?

				MURPHY
		We hit land.

				EPPS
		What?

				MURPHY
		We're in an island chain. It's only 
		a matter of time before we hit another 
		one.

				EPPS
		Greer's gone. He broke out of the 
		tank.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps and Murphy move quickly along, when another HUGE BOOMING 
	shudders the ship and the SHRIEKING OF METAL follows.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as 
	it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull 
	precariously.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As 
	they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the 
	passage some distance down.

	AT THE OTHER END

	Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face 
	down in the passage.

	They step up. Epps kneels as Murphy looks on. She rolls the 
	body over. It is Greer, dead.

				EPPS
		He's been shot.

	Murphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes.

				MURPHY
		Let's get the hell out of here.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy and Epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As Epps and Murphy come out, moving toward the make-do raft.

				MURPHY
		It should be enough to get us to one 
		of those islands. Gimme a hand, 
		wouldya?

	She joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to 
	the rail.

				MURPHY
		Prop it here. We need to pull these 
		braces off. There's a hammer on the 
		stand. There.

	Epps crosses back to the stands.

	AT THE STANDS

	Epps kneels. No hammer. She pulls back Murphy's canvas duffle, 
	folding back the flap to reveal a shotgun, the shotgun Dodge 
	had when he died.

	A beat as she holds there, when Murphy's hand grabs it.

				MURPHY
		I'll take that.

	A beat as she looks to Murphy.

				EPPS
		It was you.

	He only looks back at her as she stands there.

				EPPS
		You killed them.

				MURPHY
		It was only a matter of time before 
		somebody killed somebody.
			(a beat)
		You saw it coming as well as I did.  
		Dodge had his plans, starting with 
		scuttling the boat. And Greer too, 
		except he went nuts. Couldn't take 
		it, I guess. Could've happened in 
		the middle of downtown Anchorage.  
		But did it make him any less 
		dangerous? I don't think so.

				EPPS
		So you killed them?

				MURPHY
		The way I figure it, it was them or 
		me. I thought putting Dodge up on 
		that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a 
		little time. Made it look like whoever 
		killed those Greeks was still around. 
		But it's just us on this ship. Us 
		and your... spirit friends.

				EPPS
		And now you're gonna kill me, is 
		that it?

				MURPHY
		I didn't want it to turn out this 
		way.

				EPPS
		Murphy, don't you see what's 
		happening?

				MURPHY
		I think I see it pretty well.

				EPPS
		It's the ship. The ship's making you 
		think this way.

				MURPHY
		I know a little bit about human nature 
		and what I've seen only confirms 
		that.

				EPPS
		It's a trap. There was no way we 
		were gonna get away with that gold.  
		Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. 
		This ship sucks people in and it 
		never lets them out.

				MURPHY
		I think maybe you been on this boat 
		a little too long, with all that 
		supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's 
		nothing supernatural about greed.  
		And that's what it comes down to, 
		pure and simple.

				EPPS
		I don't give a damn about the gold.

				MURPHY
		I wish I could believe that. Either 
		way, you know what I've done. I've 
		got no choice.

	He raises the shotgun.

				MURPHY
		I'm sorry.

	He prepares to fire, when a CONCUSSION ROCKS THE SHIP. Epps 
	ducks and Murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the 
	vent behind her. A SCREECHING OF METAL DEEP IN THE SHIP SOUNDS 
	as she gets up, diving for cover as Murphy shuttles the gun 
	again.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps scrambles behind a deck vent.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship has bounced off yet another small island, the jagged 
	rocks loudly scrapping the hull with a deafening shriek.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy crosses toward the deck vent.

				MURPHY
		There's no reason to make this any 
		more difficult than it has to be.

	WITH EPPS

	As Epps holds there she sees the vent opening. She pulls 
	herself up and climbs inside.

	INT. CHIMERA - AIR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps climbs down the air shaft where a giant fan spans its 
	width. She squeezes through the fan blades and drops down 
	where several vent ducts lead in different directions below 
	it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy comes to the vent duct where Epps went down.

	INT. CHIMERA - AIR DUCT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps crawls through. She comes to a vent that leads out to a 
	passageway.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy runs quickly down the stairway, shotgun at the ready.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The CLANG FROM THE VENT SOUNDS HERE and Murphy stops.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps extends her feet and climbs down into the passage.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy rounds the corner, moving on the same deck.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when 
	something can be heard ahead of her. She stops.

	FOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back 
	into the shadows, holding there.

	The footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the 
	other end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP.

	Epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at 
	the other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch 
	slowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN 
	THE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving 
	toward it.

	As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, 
	swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.

	A CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps 
	into view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot 
	ricochets off the metal around her.

	She scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again. She swings 
	down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.

	AT THE BOTTOM

	Epps gets up, runs.

	WITH MURPHY

	Murphy climbs down a ladder to the lower decks.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy follows, when A RUMBLING SOUND CAN BE HEARD.

	INT. CHIMERA  - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking 
	on at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS 
	IN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the 
	ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below, 
	as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom.

	She steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it 
	becomes absolutely deafening.

	The ship begins to shudder. The steel bulkheads visibly move 
	and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back 
	and forth.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy slows and finally stops.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING 
	GROWS STILL LOUDER.

	Epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away, 
	when the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing 
	out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate 
	of the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH 
	WITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER.

	Epps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through 
	the Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a 
	HORRENDOUS TUMULT OF NOISE AND STEAM AND SPARKS.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The Chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious 
	rock promontory of a small island.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The giant claw begins to pull back, as the ship drifts off, 
	water pouring in behind it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship is drifting free of the island with the current, a 
	huge gash rising on its port side.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A massive torrent sweeps over Epps as seawater pours in 
	through the breach.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stops where he is to see water rushing in at the end 
	of the passage. He begins backing away.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps is forced under as the water in the hull is already 
	half way up the side, the ship listing WITH A GREAT GROANING 
	EXERTION.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy moves down the passageway, coming to the cargo 
	compartment.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps comes up for air. A clatter of all manner of debris, 
	tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead 
	as the ship eases over. A boiler breaks loose of its stays.

	Epps looks up to see it coming right for her. She ducks under 
	the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she 
	was.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps is forced down by the boiler, trapped between it and 
	the bulkhead.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The gold slides off the palette, crashing into the far wall.  
	Murphy hurries to it, collecting ingots and putting them in 
	his pockets.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps struggles under the water to free herself, but she is 
	trapped, the heavy boiler and its broken stays caging her.

	ABOVE THE WATER

	The level of the water has now almost completely reached the 
	deck above, filling the ship almost entirely below decks.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The water is threateningly high as Murphy pockets one last 
	ingot and makes his way for the exit.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck.  
	She swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at 
	the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the 
	murky water.

	Several more forms appear. They are human, suspended in the 
	water. As Epps looks, the several forms have become many.  
	They are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before.

	As they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges.  
	It is Katie.

	She reaches toward Epps, as if beckoning her to take her 
	hand from the other side. Epps raises her hand, taking it.

	The girl leads Epps down into the murky darkness where she 
	finds a way out. She takes her back further, coming to the 
	breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water.

	Katie stops at the breach. Epps turns to her. She only looks 
	back at Epps. Epps turns away, swimming upward toward the 
	light of the surface.

	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps breaks through, gasping for air. She looks to see the 
	Chimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully 
	awash.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy staggers through the flooded passage.

	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The Chimera is getting lower in the water, the bow submerged 
	and the stern beginning to rise.

	Epps sees another small island some distance off. She begins 
	swimming toward it.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water runs down the stairway as Murphy struggles toward the 
	top.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps swims as the ship sinks in the distance.

	INT. CHIMERA - PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A river of water rushes through as Murphy crosses with 
	difficulty.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps reaches the jagged rock of the island. She pulls herself 
	up.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water rushes in as Murphy wades out onto the Chimera's top 
	deck. He is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under 
	as he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft 
	portion rising above him as the bow sinks.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

	Epps collapses on the rocks.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the ship moves lower, Murphy pushes off. He bobs under 
	momentarily, then comes back up with difficulty. The forward 
	smoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the 
	current from the rushing water pulling him toward it.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

	Epps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that 
	pulls at Murphy. Murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he 
	is pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the 
	smokestack's opening.

	The ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of 
	the stack. He frantically grabs for something to hold on to, 
	without success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke 
	stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing 
	water.

	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

	Epps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on 
	at the Chimera, her stern rising high above water as she 
	goes down, when the RUMBLE OF ENGINES CAN BE HEARD.

	She turns to see a Coastguard plane sweeping low over the 
	Chimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts 
	and waves her arms.

	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

	The Coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time 
	dropping a survival pack.

	The Chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical 
	now, slipping further and further under.

	Epps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down.

	EXT. OCEAN - WITH CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The afterdeck of the Chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the 
	CAMERA PUSHING IN TO "CHIMERA" as the name comes to the water, 
	then slips slowly beneath the surface. And THE CAMERA FOLLOWS, 
	MOVING INTO THE WATER to reveal that, beneath the surface, 
	there is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the 
	ocean.

	FADE TO BLACK

          FADE IN

          EXT. FITZGERALD HOME -- NIGHT

          The house is dark. The moon is almost full. A dog barks.
          A melancholy voice, worn for its age, narrates:
          BRIGITTE (V/o)
          Ever try bein' different? An, I
          don't mean jus' thinkin' about
          it, either. Ginger an' me - I
          mean I...
          The house numbers read 669. The 9 slips: the number now
          reads 666.

          BRIGITTE (CON'T/V/O)
          Ginger an' I? Went for different.
          Big time.
          There's a light on in a basement window. We creep up to it,
          crushing the tulip. borders on the way. The window is propped
          open with a sneaker: it looks like somebody's foot is caught
          in it. Music plays inside-

          INT. GIRLS' BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Gyrating in her underwear to bad-girl grunge, BRIGITTE
          FITZGERALD (15) straddles GINGER FITZGERALD (also 15 and in
          underwear) on one of the twin single beds. Both girls have
          cigarettes lolling on their lower lips. Both girls have
          pierced eyebrows, pierced noses and streaked hair. Brigitte
          has blue nail polish on. Ginger has breasts.

          GINGER
          Brigitte. Quit dickin' around.
          Jus' do it.
          Brigitte reluctantly stops her thrashing and douses a cotton
          ball in rubbing alcohol.
          Without looking up from her TANK GIRL comic, Ginger hauls her
          own shirt up to expose her navel.
          Brigitte swabs Ginger's navel with the wet cotton ball. Her
          eyes drift to Ginger's chest, then back to what she's doing.

          

          

          

          

           2

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Ginger's ten months older than
          me. we're seriously tight. Share
          everything. Everything.
          Around them, many candles burn. There's a dead bolt on the
          door. An attached full bath. The floors are thick with
          paranormal books. The walls are covered in images of UFO's
          and horror flicks. A framed photo of Kurt Cobain with
          Courtney Love has a place of honor. There's an old Polaroid
          of the girls at five in Halloween costumes; Lill Red Riding
          Hood and the Big Bad Wolf. Ginger is the wolf.
          Brigitte produces an enormous darning needle. It glints. she
          levels it at Ginger's navel, her hand shaking.

          BR IG ITTE
          Ready?

          GINGER
          (without looking up)
          Uh-huh.

          BRIGITTE
          .I can't.
          Ginger gives Brigitte a look over the top of her comic.
          Brigitte takes a deep breath, and lines the needle up again.
          Brigitte swallows hard and applies pressure. The needle
          pierces Ginger's skin. Her stomach muscles flinch.

          GINGER

          OUCH!

          BRIGITTE
          You said it wouldn't hurt!

          GINGER
          Jus' hurry up!
          The needle has stopped moving half-way through the skin.

          BRIGITTE
          Uh-oh .
          Brigitte wiggles the needle. Blood wells up around it.

          BRIGITTE
          Um. I think it's stuck. Oh man.
          There's blood...
          Ginger lowers her comic. she takes one look at the needle
          half-.in, half-out of her belly button - and cracks up.

          

          

          

          

           3

          BRIGITTE
          snot funny, Ginger!
          Laughing her head off, Ginger gives the needle a good tug
          from her end. The skin tugs with it, resisting.

          BRIGITTE
          Ali, gawd, gross.
          Ginger yanks the needle, hard. This time it moves.

          GINGER
          I got it, I got it.
          Ginger grits her teeth. The needle begins a slow progress.

          GINGER
          It's goin', it's goin'- gimme
          the ring
          Brigitte grabs at a tiny silver ring on the bed spread but
          knocks it to the floor. Brigitte scrambles after it. Ginger
          yanks the needle.

          GINGER
          Bee?! C'mon!
          Brigitte finds the ring and hands it to Ginger. Ginger sets
          the ring on the end of the needle, looping it not-so-neatly
          through.

          BRIGITTE
          Oh, groo-oo-o-ss!
          The bloody needle pops clear. Ginger grinds on the ring to
          close it. Ginger wipes her bloody hands on the bed. Brigitte
          is taking deep, gulping breaths.

          GINGER
          Bee? Feeb. Y'okay?

          BRIGITTE
          Yeah. I think so.

          GINGER

          (TEASING)
          Yeah, I think not.

          BRIGITTE
          If you din't say it hurt, I'd a
          been fine!
          Ginger beams at her new piercing.

          

          

          

          

           4

          GINGER
          Pretty cool, unh?
          The flesh around the navel is hot pink and bruising. Brigitte
          grins too.

          BRIGITTE
          very cool.

          GINGER
          Now I'll do you.
          Brigitte bravely hangs onto to her smile.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          We do everything together. But,
          at fifteen? A chick can change.
          Ya know?
          [3A! You got no idea.

          EXT. THE FTTZGERALD BACKYARD - DAY

          It's a beautiful autumn day in suburbia. Birds sing. The
          terrier next door (NORMAN) barks and barks.
          A pierced navel is stretched taught, filling with blood.
          Ginger's limp body is bent backward over a low fence. Blood
          is flowing from where she's been speared through her chest:
          Ginger's impaled on a white picket.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Don't get me wrong. It's not
          like we were all happy or
          nothin' to begin with.
          Brigitte takes a long, ponderous drag on her cigarette as -
          unmoved - she takes in Ginger's mortal wound. Brigitte eyes
          the identical homes and gardens that stretch on to the
          horizon.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          The suburb of Bailey Downs?
          Basically a well lit black hole.
          The Kingdom of cul du sac.
          That's French for Dead End.
          Brigitte flicks her smoke into a pile of neatly raked leaves.
          It smolders then goes out. She scowls.

          

          

          

          

           5

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          You had a gram of personality
          out here? Life bit the big one.
          A truck with COUNTY REGREENING PROGRAM on its side pulls up a
          few houses over. Brigitte watches a shirtless sun-bronzed
          Adonis - SAM -- climb out of the cab.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Of course I'm generalizing.
          A tarty teenage girl - TRINA - bounds up to Sam and gives him
          a big wet one.

          BRIGITTE (V/0)
          No I'm not.

          GINGER
          The fuck, Bee. Take a picture
          already.
          Brigitte raises a 35mm still camera to her eye and frames her
          sister's corpse in the viewfinder.

          ROLL HEAD CREDIT SEQUENCE:
          snap! A slide of Ginger - dead on a white picket fence -
          smashes on. The HEAD CREDITS are superimposed on each of the
          slide images:
          snap! Ginger sliced up with an electric knife in the kitchen,
          Snap! Ginger drowned in a bubble bath,
          Snap! Ginger hanged by nylons in the laundry room,
          Snap! Ginger mangled under the front tires of a mini van.

          INT. BAILEY HIGH ART ROOM - DAY

          The Fitzgerald sisters stand over a slide projector in art
          class, just finishing the slide show from the credit
          sequence. An empty frame of blinding white light snaps onto
          the collapsible screen at the front of the room.
          The homely ART TEACHER looks very concerned as she hits the
          lights. The other STUDENTS â¢-- all about fifteen, middle-class
          and raging conformists -- sit in stunned silence. As Brigitte
          and Ginger return to their side-by-side seats,

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          We were always considered
          freaks. For as long as I can
          remember, there was Us. And
          there was Them. Like from
          kindergarten.

          ART TEACHER
          Very -um. Class? Comments?
          The students trade constipated looks.

          ART TEACHER
          Brigitte. What does it mean for
          you?
          Brigitte shrugs and squirms.

          GINGER
          Means there's more to life than
          -- well, li.fe.
          The Fitzgeralds look expectantly at row after row of blank
          faces. Brigitte shakes her head.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Attempts at communication wore
          futile.
          JASON McCARDY- a good-looking high school Casanova - looks
          Ginger over appraisingly. Ginger ignores him.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Some of Them did seem to wanna
          reach Ginger?
          Brigitte glances from Ginger's breasts to her own flat chest.
          Brigitte takes a deep breath.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          But nobody wanned to reach me.
          The bell goes.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          (a tad defensive)
          Like I cared.

          

          

          

          

           7

          INT. BAILEY HIGH HALLS - DAY

          TEENS clog the halls. Judging by the herd, Bailey High is not
          big on individual identity, or at least its outward
          expression.
          Ginger and Brigitte slip down the crowded corridors, sticking
          out like sore thumbs. Ginger holds her forehead.

          GINGER
          Gawd, People! They hurt my
          brain!

          BRIGITTE
          They didn't even get it.

          GINGER
          They're retards.

          BRIGITTE
          They're cretins.

          GINGER
          They're bone-heads.

          BRIGITTE
          't'hey' re somnambulists.

          GINGER
          They're leems.

          BRIGITTE
          They're the goddamn walkin'-/
          The girls stop before their locker. A folded up piece of
          loose leaf has been crushed into it, its end sticking out.

          BR I G ITTE

          (UNIMPRESSED)
          Another one?
          Ginger opens the locker. She unfolds the paper. There's a big
          fat joint inside, and a note that says: GINGER, CALL 555-

          4636.
          Ginger pockets the joint, crumples the paper into a ball and
          tosses it at a near-by trash can. She misses.
          The girls head down the hall..

          BRIGITTE
          Somebody leaves you all. these
          jays an, yer not even curious to
          call?

          

          

          

          

           8
          Ginger offers her a sucker and has one herself.

          GINGER
          No pe .
          A FAT JANITOR scoops up the wad of loose leaf with great
          resentment and jams it into the trash.
          Brigitte and Ginger pass a NECKING COUPLE practically dry-
          humping, GIRLS applying make-up to one another, and BOYS
          snapping each other with their sports cups.
          Jason and his fellow jock-pals TIM, FRANK, and JEREMY are
          scoping babes.
          Ginger bends to tie her boot lace and a collective groan
          swells from the guys.

          JASON
          See? She's weird, but hot.

          TIM
          Anybody poled Fitzy yet?
          Brigitte gives them a disgusted look.

          TIM
          Not that one. The cute one.
          Brigitte's face falls. Ginger gives them a Death Stare. The
          boys try flirty smiles.

          GINGER
          (to Brigitte)
          Sad. Must be hard to think with
          yer brains slappin' around yer
          thighs like that all day.
          Brigitte laughs. Ginger pulls her on, past a sign: GYMNASIUM.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          We didn't do guys. Guys were too
          gross. Everyone at Bailey High
          was just too incredibly gross.
          Ginger applies her boot to a swinging door and they enter,

          

          

          

          

           9

          INT. GIRLS' CHANGING ROOM - DAY

          The Fitzgeralds stop dead. They take in a menagerie of 90210-
          wanna-be GIRLS changing for gym class. The background chat is
          all sex and mascara.
          There is only one free spot: next to Trina and her TRINA
          CLONES. The Trinas slide into a-size-too-small shorts while
          parading hefty chests. The Trina acts like she owns the
          goddamn planet.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          The only thing worse than most
          teenage boys are most teenage
          girls. Trinas are the limit.
          Ginger digs at her lower abdomen painfully.

          GINGER
          I feel sick.

          BRIGITTE
          Me too.

          GINGER
          No, J. mean really.
          Gingler opens a locker and tears off her clothes. Other girls
          glance at her navel piercing with disgust..
          Brigitte is very self-conscious: she steps almost inside the
          locker, hiding behind the door while she changes into the
          revolting school gym outfit. She eyes the buxom bubble heads
          with contempt, as

          BRI.GITTE (V/O)
          There was really only one Trina,
          but they were all the same.
          Trina finds the Fitzgeralds' open locker door a nuisance.
          She pushes it out of her way, hard enough to whack Brigitte
          in the head on the other side.

          TRINA

          (FAKELY)
          Ooops. Sorry.
          Ginger gives Trina a very dirty look. Brigitte tries to rub
          her sore head while clutching her uniform to cover her chest.
          Trina and her posse cackle as they prance out, their butt
          cheeks waggling. The sisters continue changing.

          

          

          

          

           1 0

          GINGER
          (to Brigitte)
          Y' okay's

          BRIGITTE
          I HATE her. Like to feed her
          ground glass with tacks for
          desert. Then make her puke it
          back up and swallow it again
          until she's like shredded to a
          bazillion pieces from the inside
          out...
          Ginger grips her sides painfully and bends double.

          BRIGITTE,
          what's the matter?

          GINGER
          I got gas...Maybe I'll try an,
          cut one right in her face out
          there.
          They slap hands, laughing. They look down at their gym
          outfits, which are SO unflattering. Brigitte and Ginger
          exchange identical looks of agony.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH SPORTS FIELD - DAY

          The twenty or so participants in this all-girl gym class
          stand ready at centre field in lacrosse padding and helmets.
          Brigitte and Ginger stand apart from the others, sharing a
          smoke. Brigitte looks scared. Ginger looks ill.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          After two weeks a' high school.,
          ya come to the conclusion it's
          all about agony. Take Phys. Ed,
          sus' practise takin' pain.
          The gym teacher. M7.,. SYKES - an aging former-traffic cop -
          hucks the players sticks with nets on one end. Sykes is given
          to screaming.

          SYKES
          Field lacrosse is no pussy-assed
          tea party, ya get IN there, get
          a LOCK on your target and PUSH
          IT! I want SWEAT I want ACTION!
          The Trinas giggle at Sykes. Ginger bends forward, holding her
          sides.

          MZ.SYKES
          Shake a leg, Fitzgeralds. An,
          butt out, you gotta death wish!?

          GINGER
          Feel really sick, Mz. Sykes.

          MZ. SYRES
          Cigarettes'll do that for you!
          Move!
          Ginger flicks the smoke at Sykes' turned back. It falls
          short, of course.
          The sisters trudge to their places on the field. Ginger is on
          the offensive line. Brigitte is in goal.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Phys. Ed. is not optional at
          Bailey High.
          Sykes blows the whistle. A fast-moving, hard-hitting
          lacrosse scrimmage begins.
          IN RAPID-FIRE MONTAGE: Ginger gets caught in the crunch of
          sticks and bodies, pushed, kicked, and punished by the
          Trinas, who are having 'fun'.
          IN RAPID-FIRE MONTAGE: Brigitte visibly cowers as a tangle of
          marauding, ball-whacking bodies descend on her. She takes a
          number of direct hits from the hard rubber ball.
          on a powerful press for a goal, Trina slams into Brigitte so
          hard Brigitte flies right out of the net area. And skids
          face-first .into a mangled dog's body.
          The whistle blows and play stops. Ginger lopes over,
          breathless, gripping her sore stomach.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I been waiting for this. There'd
          been a lot of dead dogs around
          lately, but this was my personal
          first.
          Brigitte slowly climbs out of the mucky canine remains to her
          knees. She's covered in doggie guts and maggots.

          TRINA
          Oh, HOW GRO-O-O-O-OSS!!

          The class edges toward them, but maintains a horrified
          distance. Even Sykes struggles with a gag reflex on seeing
          Brigitte' s mess.
          Brigitte fingers the dog's remains with a look of
          fascination.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          'Kay, here's the weird thing
          about me. I dig dead stuff. Live
          things make me sick, they're all
          warm and snotty and shitty and
          pissy. And live things jus'
          suffer, which I can't take. But
          a dead thing? S'kinda beautiful,
          'cause a dead thing's really I
          dunno -like, free.

          SYKES
          Don't TOUCH it, Fitzgerald!
          What's WRONG with you two?!
          Get up and hit the SHOWERS!

          TRINAS IN CHORUS
          The cult? Drains the blood out
          and drinks it, ya know! /1 heard

          /Gawd stop, you'll make me PUKE!

          BRIGITTE (V/0)
          Everyone was all like, Oh it's a
          teen cult, or aah, it's some
          looney, the Beast a' Bailey
          Downs. What crap.

          SYKES
          All RIGHT, ladies, settle! This
          is no joke! You have information
          about the dog deaths you do

          WHAT!

          CLASS IN CHORUS

          BRIGITTE
          Teen cult my ass. Look Ginge',
          something went for its throat -
          it's not cut, it's chewed...
          Brigitte looks up in time to see Ginger's eyes roll back in
          her head. Ginger faints. The class inhales as one.

          

          

          

          

           1 3

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger?
          Sykes and the class stampede up. Sykes pushes Brigitte out
          of the way.

          BRIGITTE (V/0)
          Ginger's no pussy. She doesn't
          faint. I might faint. Like, if
          this pooch were only HALF-dead,
          I could faint.
          Brigitte stumbles over the dog carcass. She hugs herself.

          INT. NURSE' S OFFICE -- DAY

          Brigitte sits in her bloodied uniform, chewing her nails.
          NURSE FERRY - a Mrs. Doubtfi.re-type who chirps more than
          speaks - is examining Ginger.

          FERRY
          The fainting' s worrisome
          you don't diet do you dear?

          GINGER
          No.

          FERRY
          Hm. Anemia's very common at your
          age. Eat more red meat, try an
          iron vitamin supplement. If it
          happens again, straight to a
          proper doctor, all righty?
          Brigitte looks relieved.

          FERRY
          Now as for 'the headache, cramps,
          lower back pain .I'm guessing
          your period is due.

          GINGER
          I haven't got a, um, period.

          FERRY
          Never? Flow old are you?

          GINGER
          Fifteen. our mother says we're
          late bloomers.

          

          

          

          

           1 4

          FERRY
          Well judging by your troubles,
          I'd say you can expect to
          blossom any time now!
          Brigitte pulls a face. Ferry produces numerous samples of
          feminine hygiene products and heaps them onto Ginger.

          FERRY
          Are you familiar with all these?
          Ginger shrugs.

          FERRY
          Now what suits one girl might
          not be comfortable for another.
          The proper form of protection is
          a personal choice, and may have
          a lot to do with your menstrual
          flow, which naturally changes
          during the time you'll have your
          little miracle of nature. It
          could start thick and syrupy,
          move to a straight-forward basic
          bright red bleeding and then
          perhaps a deep brownish to
          blackish slime, signaling the
          end of the flow. Twenty-eight
          days later or there abouts,
          it'll start all over again and
          continue every month until
          menopause, in about thirty
          years' time.
          Nurse Ferry produces a pocket calendar with a tampon or pad
          advertisement for every month.

          FERRY (CON'T)
          Here's a little calendar to keep
          track, count from the day it
          starts twenty-eight days.
          That'll be your next time. You
          have any questions, come see me
          again.
          (to Brigitte)
          You too sweetheart, be your turn
          shortly, I expect.
          Brigitte Looks horrified.

          EXT. A SUBURBAN STREET/TRAVELING - DAY


          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Here's a dirty word.
          Inevitability. That fate fully
          intended us to be typical in any
          way, sooner or later, was so
          insulting.
          Ginger and Brigitte trudge homeward looking completely
          depressed. Brigitte flips through the feminine hygiene
          calendar. Ginger watches the pavement beneath her feet.

          BRIGITTE
          (reading a panty-
          liner ad)
          "Some days it's all you need."-?
          What does that mean?

          GINGER
          So you pulled a Quincy on that
          dog, unh?

          BRIGITTE
          Hunh?
          Ginger grabs the calendar and sticks it in her pocket.

          GINGER
          Quincy, that guy with the stiffs
          on cable. Alls I remember is you
          goin', "Teen cult my ass".

          BRIGITTE
          Oh. Right. Well, I dunno.
          Brigitte shrugs. She gives Ginger a funny look.

          GINGER
          Why are you looking at me like
          that? Do I look - different?

          BRIGITTE
          No.

          GINGER
          Can you tell I'm going to-?

          BRIGITTE
          No. .Really.
          Ginger squints at her, unconvinced.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 22, 1996 1 6

          GINGER
          Wham. Total adultness. How can I
          have a miracle of nature an, not
          be old enough to drive! fiurih?
          The fuck.
          Ginger kicks a kiddie toy hard into a yard. Brigitte doesn't
          have an answer to this.

          EXT. FITZGERALD BUNGALOW - DAY

          Their house looks like a set in a home show. The girls take
          it in from the front drive with expressions of complete
          weariness. Next door, Norman the terrier barks at them.

          GINGER
          Hey. If I start simpin' around
          tampon dispensers and moanin'
          over cramps, or even think about
          buying somethin' that says Baby
          Powder Fresh? You'll. shoot me,
          right?
          BR TG.'i"I'L
          of course.
          They exchange grins.

          GINGER
          Out by sixteen

          BRIGITTE
          .or dead in this scene.
          Ginger raises her hand and Brigitte smacks it hard. As they
          mount the drive, Ginger picks up a stone and hucks it at
          Norman, who's still barking. She misses.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          If we failed to get a life by
          Ginger's sixteenth birthday? we
          were s'posed to gas ourselves in
          the garage. For smart girls, we
          could be pretty dumb. we prob'ly
          never woulda done it, but we
          seemed to need a deadline.

          INT. FITZGERALD DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          The Fitzgerald family are having their evening meal. Their
          parents, HENRY (see Men's Section, Seers catalogue) and

          

          

          

          

           1 7
          PAMELA (see Martha Stewart's Idea of Living), are liberal,
          middle class folks in their early forties. Ginger looks
          bored. Brigitte eats like a pig.

          HENRY
          How was school today?

          GINGER
          Fine.

          BRIGITTE (V/U)
          The nicest thing I could say
          about Henry and Pamela was also
          the meanest thing I could say.

          PAMELA
          Didn't you have a presentation?
          How'd it go?

          GINGER
          Fine.
          Pamela and Henry exchange irritatingly patient smiles.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          They were easily satisfied.
          A rogue's gallery on the wall depicts Henry and Pamela's
          transformation over the years from angry young Ban The Bomb-
          types into middle-class mundane.

          PAMELA
          Made an appointment for you
          girls at my gynecologist. Next
          Thursday.
          Henry studies his plate. Ginger almost imperceptibly shakes
          her head at Brigitte. Brigitte nods, understanding.

          GINGER
          why.

          PAMELA
          You know why.

          GINGER
          we're not going to a
          gynecologist.

          PAMELA
          What did I say about that tone
          of voice? .You are going to
          the gynecologist.

          GINGER
          Dad!? She's completely paranoid!

          HENRY
          I'd rather stay out of this.

          GINGER
          She's gonna have some fat jerk
          get his jollies poking his
          fingers up our ./

          HENRY

          (INTERRUPTING)
          I'm actually eating here.

          PAMELA
          Henry, neither one of them has
          had a period yet.

          HENRY
          Ah. Yes. You've said.
          Repeatedly.
          As Pamela says the next line, Ginger mou t:hs it- word for word
          1.a Brigitte.

          PAMELA
          It's very odd that two perfectly
          healthy fifteen year olds are
          not menstruating. Right?
          Briggitte apes Henry's next line back to Ginger.

          HENRY
          Mmmm. steak's really yummy
          tonight. This a new sauce?
          The sisters giggle. Pamela is losing her cool.

          PAMELA
          I started at eleven. The problem
          must be on your side, Henry.

          HENRY
          Pamela? This is not my fault. No
          one's at fault here.

          PAMELA
          when did your sister start?

          

          

          

          

           1 9

          HENRY
          I've told you, I really have no
          idea. Oddly enough, we never
          discussed it. why don't you call
          her and ask her yourself?

          PAMELA
          I can't call her out of the blue
          and ask a thing like that.
          Besides, it's dinner time.
          They'll be eating.

          HENRY
          A--ha!

          PAMELA
          Well I've been checking panties
          for four years now

          GINGER & BRIGITTE/HENRY
          Mo-othe-er!!! /For chrissakes.

          GINGER (CON'T)
          You look at our underwear? Fuck!

          HENRY
          Hey, hey - I don't want to hear
          that word in my house. You will
          do as your mother says and I
          will change the subject. Anybody
          going to tell me what happened
          to my fence?
          From under the table, Henry produces the bloodied, sawed-off
          picket stained bloody from Ginger's impaling.
          Brigitte holds her full mouth open so Ginger can see its
          masticated contents. Ginger cracks up laughing. Henry and
          Pamela sigh.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Norman the terrier barks OFF-SCREEN - constantl
          Brigitte grimaces at the cartoon-style diagrams of How To
          Insert A Tampon. She carefully unwraps one and sets it in a
          glass of water. She times its expansion on her watch.

          BRIGITTE
          Why din't you jus' tell her
          you're going to get it?

          

          

          

          

           20
          Ginger is dissecting the gift joint from their locker. she
          sniffs its contents.

          GINGER
          Can't take her 'attention'. She
          grosses me out. Can't believe
          she's our mother.
          Brigitte puts a fresh tampon up her nose and lifts a Polaroid
          camera at arms' length from her face.

          BRIGITTE
          Yeah, but now we have to see
          this doctor. You can jus' say
          you got it, but I'm screwed.
          FLASH! The Polaroid spits out the front. Brigitte sticks
          another tampon in her free nostril, and one in each ear as,

          GINGER
          Did I get you out of Home Ec?
          Did I get you out of ballet
          classes? So I'll get you out of
          this, right?

          BR IG ITTE
          You better, gawd the idea
          FLASH! Brigitte takes a Polaroid of herself with a tampon
          sticking out of every visible orifice.
          Ginger slides the grass into a pre-rolled fresh casing and
          sticks it in her mouth.

          GINGER
          I said I will, I will. This
          jay's fine. Let us smoke,
          sister.
          Ginger cranks the stereo and throws on a coat. She double-
          takes Brigitte' s tampon face.

          GINGER
          WHAT are you doing?

          BRIGITTE
          (sticking tampons
          under her upper lip)
          Look - a walrus.

          GINGER
          Hardee-har. Har.

          Ginger steps up on the bed and swings the ground-level window
          open.

          EXT A NEIGHBOR'S YARD - NIGHT
          Norman the terrier's incessant barking goes on in the
          distance. The moon is full tonight.
          A plastic child's playhouse sits in their next door
          neighbors' back yard. A cloud of blue smoke emanates from its
          doors and windows. There is an occasional FLASH! from within,
          and the whir of the Polaroid's motor.

          INT. PLAYHOUSE - NIGHT

          In the moonlight, the joint's cherry burns hell-fire red. A
          couple of Polaroid buddy-shots sit at their feet. Brigitte
          tokes and passes the jay to Ginger..

          BRIGITTE
          How'l1 you know when you finally
          get it any ways?

          GINGER
          Prob'ly feel like peein' your

          BRIGITTE
          Disgusting.

          GINGER
          Well I'm not too excited.

          BRIGITTE,

          We're missing Unsolved
          Mysteries.

          GINGER
          Wish I was an unsolved mystery.
          Brigitte reflects on this heavy thought, nodding - stoned.

          Hey. You smell somethin' gross?

          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S YARD - NIGHT

          The girls sniff around the playhouse. Ginger steps on
          something that makes an evil squeeshy sound. She skids and
          ends up on her ass.

          GINGER
          This is so not my day.
          Brigitte helps her to her feet. Ginger shakes what she
          slipped on off her shoe. It's a long, ropy intestine. She
          drags her shoe to get the blood and goo of it.

          GINGER
          Nice. Dog shit.

          BRIGITTE
          (thrilled to
          recognize the smell)
          That isn't shit... it's death.
          A line of blood and gore trails across the grass to a back
          lane. Brigitte follows it. Ginger looks around for something
          on the ground.

          GINGER
          Great. Lost the jay. Great.

          EXT. SERVICE LANE - NIGHT

          Ginger joins Brigitte, who's squatted before another dog's
          body. This one's a fresh kill.

          BRIGITTE
          Ack, it's still warm, gross.
          Brigitte takes its picture FLASH! with the Polaroid, which is
          strung around her neck.

          GINGER
          Why every dog but the mutt next
          door to us?

          BRIGITTE
          Hey, we could take it home. Try
          like, an autopsy. Like, crack
          the case!

          GINGER
          Nah. Let's put ' im in there so
          he won't. Lraumatize the kiddies.

          

          

          

          

           23
          Ginger indicates a construction dumpster on the end of the
          lane. Disappointed, Bee rolls down her sleeves to cover her
          hands. Ginger does the same and they shovel the body onto
          their arms.
          They trot the dog over to the dumpster. Brigitte sulks.

          GINGER
          What.

          BRIGITTE
          We never do what I wanna do.

          GINGER
          Oh, c' mon. Would stink up the
          whole room!
          They hoist the dog up and dump it in the dumpster. It's hind
          end sticks out. Brigitte climbs into the dumpster, dragging
          it all the way in.
          Dusting herself off, Ginger notices some blood on her thigh.

          GINGER
          Nice.
          Ginger wipes at the blood with her hand. More appears. She
          lifts up the hem of her skirt. Her face falls. She looks
          around. She slips her fingers up to her crotch. Her hand
          comes out bloody.

          GINGER
          Bee. I JUST got the curse.
          Brigitte stops rooting garbage over the dog.

          BRIGITTE
          Serious?
          Ginger wiggles her wet fingers at her.

          GINGER
          We gotta go home.

          BRIGITTE
          Eeew, 'kay.
          Brigitte catches her kilt on a nail sticking out of a plank
          in the trash.
          Something is crunching through the leaves toward them. Ginger
          peers out into the darkness.

          

          

          

          

           24

          GINGER
          Hurry upt

          BRIGITTE
          I'm stuck3
          A few homes down, a garage's motion-sensitive security lamp
          trips on. Ginger squints, blinded.

          GINGER
          Bee?:
          Brigitte contorts to deal with the nail. Brigitte tears her
          hem free and jumps down. The light snaps off.

          GINGER
          (indicating the
          opposite direction)
          Let's go this way.
          Brigitte dips a hand back into the dumpster for the plank
          with the nail. Off Ginger's look, Brigitte shrugs.
          They start walking down the lane. The greenery behind them
          starts swelling again. The leaves crunch, faster.
          Brigitte and Ginger look at one another, and walk faster. The
          lane empties behind a deserted strip mall.

          EXT. STRIP MALL LOT - NIGHT

          Whatever is behind them knocks an empty trash can over.
          Brigitte grabs Ginger's arm, scared.

          BRIGITTE
          This is stupid. We're getting
          farther from home.
          Ginger is pissed off now. she turns to confront their
          stalker.

          GINGER
          (to the darkness)
          All right you ass-/
          She's cut cold by a roaring blur of speeding fur and teeth
          and claws: SOMETHING takes Ginger down hard.
          We cannot see it as a whole, we can't make out what it is.
          It's big, heavy, and raging. Immense jaws snap vicious teeth,
          going for Ginger's jugular. Brigitte drops her plank.

          

          

          

          

           25

          GINGER & BRIGITTE

          BRIGITTE/GINGER!!!
          Brigitte grabs and kicks at the creature. Ginger raises her
          arms and covers her head, screeching and kicking. The thing
          grabs Ginger by the scruff and shakes the living daylights
          out of her.

          GINGER

          BEEEEEI HELP MEEE! BEEEEE!!!1!
          Brigitte snatches up the plank with the nails. Brigitte
          brings it down hard on the thing, screaming. She smacks it
          once, twice. The plank pops a shot off the camera: FLASH! A
          horrible set of jaws and one golden eye are caught for a
          split second in the light.
          The third hit evokes a yelp and the thing backs off,
          snarling.. Brigitte quakes with the board raised, ready. The
          thing skitters before her as she screams.
          Ginger scrambles to her foot and grabs Bee with bloodied
          hands.

          GINGER
          Go-go-go-go-go-go!!!!
          Brigitte drops the plank and they run like hell.. for a main
          thorough-way ahead. It pursues them.

          EXT. THE THOROUGH-WAY - NIGHT

          The late-night traffic is light but consistent. The thing is
          still, coming.
          At a dead run Brigitte and Ginger sail between moving cars.
          The thing burns behind them.
          The girls are barely missed by an approaching truck. There is
          a long blast of a horn.
          Then a sickening thud. Brakes squeal incto a stop as a
          horrible dragging/ scrain fills the night air.
          The girls crash to the sidewalk, spilling over top of one
          another. They glance over their shoulders, even as they
          disappear into a new residential stretch.
          The COUNTY REGREENING PROGRAM truck sits at a right angle in
          the road, it's front end smashed.

          

          

          

          

           26
          Sam slowly opens the cab door. He staggers to the bloody
          grill, clearly shaken.
          He looks under the truck, and follows a wet trail of gore
          back behind it to the mangled furry mass about twenty feet
          back. He takes it in, stunned.
          Then Sam vomits.

          INT. GIRLS BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Brigitte scrambles through the window and helps Ginger
          through after her. They're bloody, sweaty and tearful. They
          slump shaking, side by side on Ginger's bed, catching their
          breath.
          Brigitte notices the rivulets of blood trickling down
          Ginger's arms. Ginger's shirt is soaking with growing red
          stains.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger, shit!
          Ginger looks at herself. Ginger starts to cry.

          GINGER
          The fuck was that, Bee?

          INT. ATTACHED BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Brigitte flings open the vanity and collects various first
          aid items: gauze, tape, band-aids, iodine. She snags a
          washcloth and wets it at the tap.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I couldn't remember Ginger
          crying, ever.
          Brigitte flies out to,

          INT. GIRLS BEDROOM - NIGHT

          where Ginger is painfully pealing off her shirt, shaking and
          sobbing.
          Brigitte offers Ginger the wet cloth, but Ginger's helpless.

          

          

          

          

           27

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger, sshhh, don't, 'kay.
          Don't cry.
          Carefully, Brigitte begins to dab at Ginger's arms with it,
          wiping off the blood. Ginger flinches.
          The damage is gradually revealed: massive claw marks, deep
          scratches, and puncture wounds - BITE MARKS. Brigitte's eyes
          fill with tears.

          BRIGITTE
          Okay, this is really bad. You
          need a doctor, Ginge', I can't
          stop all the -/

          GINGER
          No! Not tellin' anybody! Bee?!
          Nobody. Get in shit for bein'
          out, smokin' up - don't tell.

          BRIGITTE
          What if you get, sick? What if
          these bites get infected?

          GINGER
          Bce!

          BRIGITTE
          Fine! I won't tell!
          Brigitte starts tearing off strips of gauze and taping it on
          thick. Oblivious, Ginger fumbles for a smoke. She can't get
          the lighter to work.

          GINGER
          Wanted to kill me! I could tell.

          BRIGITTE
          (giving into tears)
          I know, I know. I was so scared,
          I thought you were -/

          GINGER
          Me too. Don't say it. I know.
          Brigitte lights her smoke for her. Ginger takes a drag and
          passes it back to Brigitte.

          GINGER
          Fuck. You okay?
          Brigitte resumes her first aid.

          

          

          

          

           28

          BR IG ITTE
          Yeah, I'm okay.

          GINGER
          Why!?? Why me?

          BRIGITTE
          It was crazy, it was like rabid
          or somethin' -- Shit, look at the
          size of these bites!

          GINGER
          I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
          Right? It's okay.
          Brigitte doesn't look convinced. Brigitte snaps the port of
          an internal vacuum system open and reaches into the tube.
          She withdraws a sample-size of Jack Daniels.

          BRIGITTE
          Drink this.
          Ginger glugs some down, and passes the last mouthful left to
          Brigit.t.e. Brigitte waves it. away, -,o Ginger finishes it al.l.

          BRIGITTE
          I seen this thing, on bears?
          Said bears'd come after like,
          chicks on the rag. 'Cause of
          the smell.

          GINGER
          Wasn't my fault!

          BRIGITTE
          I didn't say that.../

          GINGER
          Wasn't a f uckin' bear either.
          Whatever it was, it wasn't a
          bear!

          BRIGITTE
          I know, I'm not /

          GINGER
          Do I stink? Can you smell it?

          BR IG ITTE
          No! Geez, I was jus', whatever.
          A heavy silence falls between them. Brigitte keeps working.

          

          

          

          

           29

          GINGER
          Doesn't feel anythin' like
          peeing your pants, by the way.

          BRIGITTE
          It doesn't?

          GINGER
          It's gross though. It's really
          gross. I better, ya know, deal
          with that...

          BRIGITTE
          Yeah, sure.
          Ginger's only half-bandaged up. she staggers to the bathroom
          and shuts the door. Brigitte eyes the Polaroid camera: a
          picture sits ready to be dispensed.
          She pulls it free. We do not see the photo. Brigitte's eyes
          bug out as she examines it.
          The toilet flushes in the bathroom and Brigitte pushes the
          photo under the pillow on her bed. Shaking her head.

          BRIGITTE (V/0)
          It was blurry. It was really
          outta focus, so. Ya couldn't
          TELL it was really anything.
          Ginger emerges pulling uncomfortably at her crotch. she
          climbs painfully onto her bed, and collapses.

          GINGER
          That booze - straight to my
          head, man.

          BRIGITTE
          You really okay?
          Ginger-es eyes are already fluttering shut.

          GINGER
          You saved me. Love you. Bee.
          Brigitte leans in, listening to Ginger breathe.

          BRIGITTE
          Me too, Ginge'.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15. 1996 30

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Brigitte sits straight up in bed, sweating, with eyes wide.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I woke up later, I thought the
          thing was in our room.
          Brigitte peers at Ginger: she's snoring. Brigitte pulls out
          the Polaroid and fires up her lighter to see by. This time we
          see it too. A streak of fur, fangs and a golden glinting eye.

          BRIGITTE (CON'T-V/0)
          Then I remembered Sam the tree
          planter killed it with his
          truck, an' we were okay.
          .But really, Ginger -? well.
          Wasn't.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH GROUNDS - DAY

          It's noon hour. The grounds are full. of teens.
          Brigitte is eating as she ticks off the fourth day in
          Ginger's feminine hygiene calendar. Brigit:Le counts 28 days
          from the first check mark. Her pen hovers over the date:
          Halloween, arid the next full moon. The first day was a full
          moon. Brigitte slowly circles them both.
          Ginger wears long sleeves to hide her bandages, and shades.
          She's looking BOYS up and down as they pass. Ginger's stomach
          is growling. An untouched sandwich sits on her lap.

          BRIGITTE
          Gonna eat that?
          Ginger shakes her head as she picks at her bandages. Brigitte
          helps herself.

          BRIGITTE
          Mmm! Sad, but Pamela's egg salad
          is her best thing. Like that she
          can do.
          (no response)
          Like, when she puts the baby
          onions in?
          (no response)
          And she gobs on it and adds
          those hard little pieces of

          BOOGER
          Ginger pulls at her own crotch.

          

          

          

          

           31

          BRIGITTE
          Hell-o 1?

          GINGER
          Sorry. Pads suck, so ya know.

          BRIGITTE
          Should eat something.

          GINGER
          Thanks Pamela, I'm aware.
          Off Brigitte's insulted look,

          GINGER
          T dunno, I'm all blaaahh, I got
          this, like I can taste what I
          want, but nothin's it. Ya know?
          Brigitte stops in mid-chew.

          BRIGITTE
          A craving?

          GINCER
          Yeah. I crave. Ya know?
          Brigitte chews very slowly as she stares at Ginger. Ginger
          squints at Jason and his pals across the yard.

          GINGER
          McCardy's a stoner right?

          BRIGITTE
          Yeah -?

          GINGER
          C'mon, I wanna feel better.

          BRIGITTE
          You joke.
          Ginger heads off toward the boys - without waiting. Brigitte
          is in mid-,mouthful, and has to scramble to catch up.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH GROUNDS/SCHOOL STEPS - DAY

          Jason and his pals' butcho conversation sputters as Ginger
          strides up like a cat in heat. Brigitte stumbles up behind
          her, keeping her distance.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15, 1998 32

          JASON
          Uh - hi.

          GINGER
          Hey. So. Nice day, blah blah
          blah. Got any smoke?

          JASON
          What?

          GINGER
          Smoke. Grass, weed, dope, green,
          bud, Nancy.

          JASON
          Sh-sure.

          GINGER
          Wanna share?

          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

          Brigitte hesitates before a rusted-out old boogie van, it's
          rear door open and waiting. Blue smoke billows out. of the
          interior. Brigitte looks confused.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I was all like, so who are you,
          an' what have you done with my
          sister, right?
          Brigitte climbs in.

          INT. VAN - DAY

          Ginger, Jason, Tim, Frank and Jeremy sit toking a gagger. The
          guys are giddy with lust. Brigitte is huddled in a corner,
          attempting invisibility.
          Jason hands Ginger the joint, making sure their fingers
          touch.

          JASON
          Hey. I thought your slide show
          in art was cool.

          OTHER GUYS
          Oh yeah/Unh-huh/Very cool.

          GINGER
          Yeah?

          Jason and Ginger exchange a coy smile that makes Brigitte
          toke really hard on her pass.
          Brigitte passes the dube to Tim, who winks at her. Brigitte
          sneers and looks at her watch. She makes a pained face at
          Ginger, but is ignored.

          GINGER
          This home-grown?

          JASON
          Yeah. This guy we know? Learned
          hydrophonics in the pen, man.

          BRIGITTE
          HydroPONics.

          JASON
          Yeah, whatever.
          Brigitte gapes at Ginger, who does not respond. Brigitte
          hides beneath her hair and presses even further into a
          corner. She starts quietly ripping up the corner of the old
          shag rug.
          There is a codified knock on the vain door. Brigitte jumps.

          JASON
          speak of the devil. Enter!
          The back doors open and Sam (the tree planter) stands in
          silhouette, backlit by the day. His battered county truck
          waits behind him. He has a pit bull with him - MORELY.

          BOYS
          Sam the Man! Hey Morely!
          Sam and Morely hop in and close the doors. Brigitte is frozen
          at the sight of Sam up so close.

          TIM
          Whoa dude. What happened to
          your truck?

          SAM
          Shit. Had an accident on the
          403. It was weird it../
          Morely stomps into Brigitte's lap, sniffing her crotch.

          

          

          

          

           34

          SAM
          (to Brigitte)
          Sorry about him, he's an ass
          hole. Morely! My girlfriend's,
          she won't leave him at home
          alone any more. Ya know, dog
          killers. Morely, no! Sit!
          Brigitte's mouth is hanging open. Morely slobbers all over
          her hands.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I know, I look like an asshole.
          Ginger's perma-smug smile fades as she makes eye contact with
          Morely. Morel growls at her. Sam is about to resume his
          accident story when,

          JASON
          Watcha got for us?
          Sam produces several baggies of grass. Morely's hackles rise.
          Brigitte looks from the dog to Ginger, Ginger squirms.

          SAM
          New harvest, see whatcha think.
          (to Morely)
          What's your problem? Never seen
          a pretty girl before?
          Ginger sneers at Morely and Morely bares his teeth.

          JASON/TIM/FRANK
          (digging out cash)
          Thanks, man.
          Morely bursts out barking and charges at Ginger.
          Mayhem as the guys try to contain the dog in the small space.
          Jason uses the opportunity to shield Ginger for a free body
          press. Brigitte gets banged and shoved.
          Ginger kicks and screams at the dog, her boot connects
          squarely with his snout. Morely keels back, and Sam snaps
          him up.

          SAM
          Sorry, he's not really like
          this. I'm really sorry.

          GINGER
          Jus' get'im out!

          

          

          

          

           35

          SAM
          I'm really - well, see you guys.
          And in another flash of daylight, Sam and Morely are gone.
          Brigitte looks longingly at the closed door.
          The stone has set in, and everyone but Brigitte giggles as
          they settle. Brigitte takes in the Lesser Mortals like
          they're lepers.

          JASON
          You okay?

          GINGER
          Yeah. Just hate dogs.
          They give one another this corny smile. Brigitte bugs her
          eyes at Ginger. Ginger rises reluctantly.

          GINGER
          Well. Thanks for the smoke.

          JASON
          Maybe we could --/
          Ginger places a finger to her lips, then makes a finger gun
          and shoots him.

          GINGER
          I'll letcha know.
          Ginger grins ear-to-ear, elbowing Brigitte. Ginger kicks the
          van doors open and saunters out. Brigitte :Follows, trying not
          to laugh.

          INT. SCHOOL CAN - DAY

          Brigitte stands stoned out of her bean in the girls'
          washroom. She imitates Ginger's cavalier farewell from the
          last scene.

          BRIGITTE
          I'll letcha, I'll jus' let-choo
          know. Bud. .So Ginger. Wanna
          tell me about you and like, the
          planet yer currently visiting?
          No answer. Brigitte squints at the tampon dispenser next to
          her. She tries to work it without putting money in. She
          smacks her dry lips. Brigitte bends over the sink and drinks
          from the tap.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15, 1996 36

          GINGER (O/S)
          Bee-?
          Brigitte doesn't hear her over the roar of the tap in her
          face. It shuts off automatically over her gaping mouth.
          Brigitte puts her finger up the spout and almost gets it
          stuck.

          GINGER
          Bee!

          BRIGITTE

          (STARTLED)
          Yeah!

          GINGER
          Com'ere-!
          Brigitte shuffles to the wrong door, opens it and finds it
          empty. She giggles and moves to the next one.

          BRIGITTE
          That smoke fucked me _up._ up.
          Brigitte finds Ginger with her shirt and all, the bandages
          peeled off. she is dabbing at herself with wads of toilet
          paper.
          The scratches and bites are oozing a clear gelatinous goo,
          under which a fine film of dark hairs have sprouted.
          Brigitte steps into the stall agape. The door hits her on the
          way in.

          INT. BATHROOM STALL - DAY

          Ginger and Brigitte stand nose to nose in the stall. Brigitte
          has not fully closed the door. Ginger is just as stoned as
          Brigitte.

          BRIGITTE
          Geez that's not right.

          GINGER
          1 didn't think.

          BRIGITTE
          What's the sticky stuff?

          GINGER
          I dunno.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15, 1996 37
          Brigitte carefully rubs a finger over the fuzzy hair in the
          wounds.

          BRIGITTE
          Oooh. Tickly.

          GINGER
          I got it on my tits too, look.

          BRIGITTE
          Weird. Does it hurt?

          GINGER
          No, it's itchy. I can't have a
          hairy chest Bee, that's fucked.

          BRIGITTE
          Yeah, like forget that tattoo
          you wanned.

          GINGER
          This sucks.

          BRIGITTE
          Quito badly.
          The idiocy of the looks of awe on the other's face makes them
          both crack up.

          GINGER

          (LAUGHING)
          This isn't funny.

          BR I G ITTE

          BRIGITTE
          (snorting too)
          Stop, I'm serious. Think about
          it.
          Ginger stops laughing long enough to let the suggestion
          settle.

          

          

          

          

           38

          GINGER
          That's so stupid!
          They both burst into gales again. There is a sound outside
          the stall, as

          INT. BATHROOM PROPER - DAY

          The Trinas prance in to powder their noses. The Trina grabs
          the first stall door -- Brigitte and Ginger's.
          Brigitte and Ginger stand frozen like the proverbial deer in
          headlights. Trina does not see Ginger's transformation. But
          Ginger Is just doing her top up.

          TRINA
          Eeeew!
          Trina backs away, her hands to her mouth.

          TRINA
          Gawd: They're lesbos!

          CLONES
          Feeeewww!!
          Brigitte smacks her forehead. Ginger steps out and leers at
          Trina, licking her lips in a grotesque mock-lust. The Trinas
          shrink back against the farthest wall.

          GINGER
          Yeah, who's next? I'm still
          sticky!
          Brigitte's jaw drops. Ginger turns to leave and the Trinas,
          start to relax. Ginger whips around again:

          GINGER
          (barking like a dog)
          Rrr-uf, ruf, rr-of-rufrf

          TRINAS

          (SHRIEK)
          Ginger gives the Trinas a good dead-eyed stave, and walks
          out. Brigitte stumbles out after her.

          INT. BIOLOGY LAB - DAY

          Today's assignment is hacking up little pig feti.

          BRIGITTE (O/S)
          'Course Trina din't waste any
          time.
          Trina stares Brigitte down as she folds up a note and passes
          it to a classmate. It is read and passed on by every kid in
          the room during this scene.
          Brigitte holds her scalpel over the over their piggy -
          hesitating. Ginger's attention is riveted on the little
          carcass.

          BRIGITTE
          They're all looking at us.

          GINGER
          So?
          Ginger looks up at Jason, who is reading the note. Jason
          smiles at Ginger and destroys the note. Trina seethes.
          Ginger grabs the knife from Brigitte. she makes a deep
          incision in the pig's belly.

          BRIGITTE
          So! You're growing fur an,
          acting like a nut, is so!
          Ginger spies two girls giggling at her. Using both hands
          Ginger cracks the carcass. wide open like a clam. Ginger digs
          in, gouging out the pig's parts with her bare hands. Ginger
          breaks into a sweat, her breathing gets heavy.
          Brigitte cautiously looks around at their classmates. she
          moves to shield Ginger from prying eyes.

          BRIGITTE
          Um. Ginger-?

          GINGER
          hold on, I'm goi.n' for the
          brain.
          Ginger has begun scraping away at the pig's cranium with her
          finger nails. A sickening creak, snap, and the brain is
          exposed. Ginger - unconsciously - licks her fingers as she
          admires its frontal lobe.

          Brigitte fights a ralph.

          BRIGITTE
          Can't believe you did that!

          GINGER
          Hunh? What?
          Before Brigitte can answer, Ginger lifts the brain out on her
          finger tips, gently pushes Brigitte out of her way and...
          Whap! The brain lands squarely on Trina's head. Trina
          screams.

          GINGER
          Ha-ha! Bull's eye!

          BIO TEACHER
          Ginger Fitzgerald! Hall, NOW!

          GINGER
          What, it slipped!
          As Ginger stomps out with the teacher. Brigitte and Trina
          gape at one another.

          INT. GYNECOLOGIST'S EXAMINING ROOM - DAY


          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          That week, Ginger was all over
          the map. She was the goddamn
          schizo poster girl. She forgot
          the gyno guy. I couldn't believe
          she forgot. She promised.
          Brigitte is dying a thousand deaths on the examining table
          with her feet in stirrups. The GYNECOLOGIST is examining
          her.
          A NURSE stands next to him, smiling benignly as she passes
          him the contraption used to take a pap smear. Brigitte is
          almost in tears.

          CUT TO:
          Same moment in the examination procedure, but now Ginger is
          in the stirrups. And the doctor is shocked at his findings.

          GYNO
          What the -?

          

          

          

          

           41

          INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Brigitte gives Ginger a pout as they both shift uncomfortably
          in their seats.
          The doctor is gulping cups of water from the water cooler,
          his hand shaking. He talks to Pamela like the girls aren't
          even there.

          GYNO
          I've never seen anything like
          it. She's not built like a
          normal girl. I've sent samples
          to the lab. But this is very,
          VERY unusual.
          Brigitte pokes Ginger in the ribs. Ginger doesn't like this,
          and pushes Brigitte so hard she almost falls off her chair.

          PAMELA
          Girls, please.

          INT GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
          The window is open. Norman the terrier yams.
          Ginger is in a tank shirt which reveals her hair growth is
          spreading. Brigitte is sitting at. the desk with a pile of
          monster books.

          GINGER
          What're you, nuts? I got a skin
          thing, whatever.

          BRIGITTE
          If you just gotta skin thing why
          does it get worse everytime yer
          being a bitch? Why's the gyno
          say you're a monster inside?

          GINGER
          He din't say that!

          BR I G ITTE
          Just listen to these symptoms!

          GINGER

           42
          Ginger slams the bathroom door shut. Brigitte consults her
          books, and the feminine hygiene calendar 10 days are
          ticked off. Norman the terrier barks on.

          "The key to his survival is a

          the key to his own demise,

          INT. GIRLS' ATTACHED BATH - MEANWHILE/NIGHT

          Ginger is in the shower. she runs shaking hands over her
          body. Ginger hears Norman's barking as super-amplified.
          Its persistence is making her mental.

          BRIGITTE (V/0 - CON'T)
          ".. .for eventually the blood-
          lust over-takes human reason,
          overtakes oven the instinct for
          self-preservation, and he will
          risk all for the excitement of
          the euphoric high of his
          murders."
          Ginger shaves the delicate area around her ankles. She cuts
          herself and freaks. Ginger snaps the Lady Bic in half and
          throws the pieces hard against the shower wall.

          GINGER
          Fuck fuck fuck FUCK
          There are two other broken razors in the stall, stuffed with
          hairs. Blood mixes with the water and swirls around her
          toes.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

          The doq is still barkin .outside. Brigitte closes her book.

          BRIGITTE (V/0)
          But see all the books and movies
          an' shit said it had to be a
          full moon, that it'd be all at
          once. An, ya know, not one word
          about chick werewolves on the
          rag. Typical.

          

          

          

          

           43
          Ginger flings open the door, tears to the window, hauls
          herself out and is gone. Brigitte is after her in a heart
          beat.

          EXT. YARD NEXT DOOR - NIGHT

          Ginger is over the fence with ease. Norman barks more,
          harder.

          EXT. FITZGERALD YARD - MEANWHILE/NIGHT

          Brigitte can't vault the fence. She clambers up a shared tree
          at the fence line to see.
          Ginger tries to grab the dog but he dances around her,
          barking like crazy. She grabs his snout with her bare hands
          and he bites her hard.

          GINGER
          Sonnovabitch!
          Now livid, Ginger takes up a dead tree branch.
          Up in the tree, Brigitte hides her face in her hands.
          Ginger (:racks the stick over the dog's head. The yelping
          stops but Ginger keeps hitting. Blood splatters over her
          face. And Ginger tastes it.
          Ginger drops her stick. She drags the body into the hedge
          next to the fence.
          Brigitte lowers her hands from her eyes. Ginger is directly
          below her, concealed from the house by the shrubs.
          Ginger falls to her knees before the corpse. She lifts a
          rattling hand to touch him. She lowers her face to the bloody
          mess. She's sweating, vibrating, physically resisting an
          irresistible drive. Ginger's tongue slips between her lips.
          And Ginger licks Morely's body.

          BRIGITTE
          Oh. No. G-ginger -!
          Ginger begins to eat the dead dog. The feed. quickly becomes
          a ravenous frenzy.
          Above her, Brigitte leans over the branch she's barely
          balancing on, hyperventilating.
          Vomit sails down from Brigitte's perch.

          BR IG ITTE
          Shit.
          Brigitte scrambles down the tree and yanks Ginger off the
          dog. Ginger's face is smeared in blood. Ginger's stunned, and
          reels dizzily. They crouch, waiting.
          Their NEIGHBOR opens the screen door, shaking a box of dog
          biscuits.

          NEIGHBOR
          Dore-maan! Tweat-time! Hunh.
          The neighbor steps into the yard. Approaches the hedge.
          Stops right before them - they can see a pair of slippers
          twitching in the grass. Then they disappear, the porch light
          switches off, the screen door shuts.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - LATER SAME NIGHT

          Brigitte sits staring into space. Ginger is showering in the
          attached bath.

          GINGER (O/S)

          (SINGING)
          Ho-ow much is that daw-gy in the
          window... Arf-Arf!

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Ever been too sick to be sick?
          Like the bottom of your stomach
          is wrapped over the top of your
          head?
          There is a knock at the door. Brigitte checks the dead bolt
          is on.

          BR IGITTE
          Yeah?!

          PAMELA (O/S)
          Who's showering so late?

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger!

          PAMELA(O/S)
          Why?

          

          

          

          

           45

          BRIGITTE
          she's dirty?!
          Brigitte throws up her hands: what an idiotic conversation.

          PAMELA (01S)
          Dirty!? How'd she get/

          BR IG ITTE
          I'm tryin' to study, here!

          PAMELA (01S)
          oh, all right then.
          Brigitte slumps against the door. The showers stops.
          Ginger appears in a towel, pink and clean and freshly furry
          in places. She's in a really good mood. She takes one look
          at Brigitte's face of doom and tries to be serious.

          GINGER
          I couldn't help it. Really.
          Guess you were right.
          Ginger finds and lights a smoke.

          GINGER
          You know what's really weird?

          BRIGITTE
          Weirder than KILLING A DOG AND

          EATING IT???!!

          GINGER
          I liked it. I liked it a lot. I
          feel all fucki.n' goofy now.
          Like, I dunno. Like .happy?
          Brigitte shakes her head over and over.

          GINGER
          I feel like I just got off the
          Planet Smasher ride at WarWorid,
          okay? It rules!
          Ginger leaps to the stereo and blasts on some tunes. She
          flails around the room wildly. Ginger grabs Brigitte by the
          arms and makes her dance too. Ginger spins and spins
          Brigitte, who fights it but laughs.

          

          

          

          

           

          46

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          So she'd killed Norman. 1 never
          seen anyone bliss out like that.
          I wanted to be so blissed, jus'
          once.
          There is repeated pounding on their door. Brigitte still
          entangled in Ginger, hits the music off.

          PAMELA (O/S)
          Little late for that, girls.

          GINGER/BRIGITTE
          (Bite me:)/Sorry;
          They stand in each other's arms listening to Pamela mount the
          stairs OFF SCREEN.
          Ginger shoves Brigitte backward onto her bed. Ginger piles
          on top of her, playfully pinning her down.

          GINGER
          I want more.
          Brigitte squirms fitfully.

          BR IG ITTE
          No, it's too gross! You'll get
          caught.

          GINGER
          Not if you help. Bee. I'm
          starving.
          Brigitte looks into her sister's beaming face.

          GINGER
          Jus' keep watch. Look, I'm gonna
          be somethin' totally else. Tell
          me you don't so dig it. Tell me
          you don't wanna see what
          happens.
          Brigitte groans.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Straight up? Crazy's contagious.
          Trust me.

          EXT. VARIOUS STREETS & YARDS - VARIOUS NIGHTS

          Bailey Downs sleeps soundly as the hunt begins. The moon is a
          sliver of its former self.
          Ginger cocks her head at the sound of a dog barking. She
          lifts her nose into the wind and sniffs. Ginger is prowls
          like a wild cat through yards and service lanes, as
          A study in much less stealth, Brigitte stumbles, trips and
          slips after Ginger. Splits her sweats climbing fences. Loses
          a shoe over garage roofs, gets caught in automated lawn
          sprinklers, falls into hidden cellar window troughs, as
          A series of dogs perk their ears and snarl from their dog
          houses, chains, and porch perches...
          Low whistles and smoochy sounds lure the dogs into bushes,
          behind cars, around fences. Strings of dogs' chains strain
          tight, then slacken...
          Ginger - wild-eyed, bloody-mouthed, and euphoric - tosses
          collars at Brigitte. Brigitte misses most of the tosses. She
          picks up the collars and fingers these souvenirs with
          disgust.

          INSERT:

          EXT. A BACK YARD - DAWN

          A LITTLE KID decked out for hockey practice waddles into his
          yard with a full dog food dish. His feet squish along his
          pet's entrails. He finds his dog's body and drops the dish
          with a clatter on the cement patio.

          KID
          M-m-mMOMI?

          CUT BACK TO:
          Days get ticked off on the feminine hygiene calendar...
          BRIGITTE (Vb0)
          We became the Beast of Bailey
          Downs. We got good..
          The moon vanishes, then reappears in as a First Quarter, as
          Brigitte's getting the hang of things, she practices expert
          surveillance from car roofs, throws stones to trip motion-
          sensitive lamps, starts moving like a super spy, taking
          crime-scene style Polaroids of their victims, as

          

          

          

          

           48
          Ginger's kills get quicker, she gets wilder, more daring,
          more ruthless, and...
          Brigitte gets cooler, confident, collected. She's mapping out
          attack routes and leading the frothing Ginger to the big
          scores, like dog kennels...

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          The more we did, the crazier she
          got...

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH SPORTS FIELD - NIGHT

          Under a swelling moon Brigitte and Ginger tear around in the
          dark, screaming and laughing and rough-housing.

          JUMP TO:

          INT GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
          Brigitte shoves a fist-full of collars under their
          mattresses.

          JUMP BACK TO:
          On the field, Ginger climbs up on the goal post and walks
          carefully across the narrow beam.

          JUMP TO:

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          The crazier she got, the more
          she needed me. I liked that
          part.
          In their room, Brigitte helps Ginger shave her back. Ginger
          trims her elongating nails. Brigitte plucks hairs from
          Ginger's palms. Ginger brushes her teeth and a piece of tooth
          comes off - she has a little fang.

          JUMP TO:
          on the field both Brigitte and Ginger hang upside down from
          the goal post by their knees. Brigitte is wearing a dog
          collar as a necklace. They are laughing their heads off and
          trying to pull each other's shirts down to expose each
          other's breasts.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - DAWN

          Ginger holds her mattress up while Brigitte stuffs handfuls
          of the collars underneath. They collapse, exhausted. Ginger
          crawls on her hands and knees to the toilet in the

          INT. ATTACHED BATH - DAWN

          Ginger drinks out of the toilet like a dog.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - MEANWHILE/DAWN

          Ginger burps loudly and crawls back to join her sister, who
          offers her a cigarette.

          Pig.

          GINGER
          You love it.
          Brigitte examines the feminine hygiene calendar. In it, a
          cartoon of a female egg is personified with a heels and
          sunglasses, strutting across the date.

          BRTGITTE
          trey, look yer ovulating.
          Ginger rubs her belly.

          GINGER
          I'm still hungry, Bee.

          BRIGITTE
          How can you - you've done every
          dog we can

          GINGER
          It's not enough. I want
          somethin'... I need more.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH - DAY

          All the kids lounging on the grounds double-take the
          Fitzgerald girls' entrance this morning.
          Ginger is babe-alicious in a hot tiny tee, boots, shades and
          very short shorts. She projects unbearably untouchable.
          Brigitte flanks her without the wardrobe, but the attitude is
          there.

          

          

          

          

          

          GINGER SNAPS -WALTON
          Jason gapes as Ginger heads toward him with an unlit smoke
          between her pointy teeth. She leaves an inch between his
          chest and her breasts.

          GINGER
          Got a light, Jace'?
          Jason and his pals all fumble for lighters and five little
          flames appear before her smoke. She lights her smoke on
          Jason's, and exhaling looks him up and down. The boys flames
          go out, all at once.

          GINGER
          My sister would like one also.
          obediently, they all light up for Brigitte. Brigitte falters
          before the attention. At Ginger's nod, Brigitte lights up
          too.

          TRINA (O1S)
          Slut.
          Ginger turns to see Trina and the Clones sizing her up.

          GINGER
          Excuse me?
          Ginger seems to tower over the Trinas today. Trina can't
          match the menace. Ginger exhales smoke in Trinals face and
          climbs the steps into the school.
          Brigitte double-takes Ginger's back. Ginger's spine is
          protruding sharply through her shirt. Trina leers at
          Brigitte.

          TRINA
          Better watch your back,
          Fitzenstein.
          Brigitte snorts and follows Ginger in.

          BRIGITTE
          (under her breath)
          Like I'm scared.

          INT ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          Ginger chews her nails like a dog does when cleaning them.
          Brigitte and the rest of the class watch an RCMP OFFICER
          holding a reward poster at the front of the room.

          OFFICER
          we need your cooperation. If
          you know anything about the so-
          called Beast of Bailey Downs,
          call in. You can be anonymous.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Ha! As if they weren't already.

          OFFICER (CON'T)
          But your pets aren't safe until
          the perpetrator is caught.
          Ginger sighs loudly and Brigitte prods her.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH SPORTING FIELD - DAY

          The girls' gym class is prepping for lacrosse again. The
          Trinas square off across the half-way mark from Ginger. Mz.
          Sykes blows her whistle. The scrimmage begins.
          Trina whips the Indian rubber ball right into Ginger's face.
          Ginger drops her stick and launches herself at Trina.
          Play stops with the whistle, but Ginger and Trina are just
          going at it. Ginger's winning. Trina bites Ginger's sore arm
          and Ginger rakes her nails over Trina's neck.. Ginger draws
          blood.
          Mz. Sykes breaks it up by dragging Ginger off Trina. Sykes
          tends to Triria, who bawls.
          Ginger wipes her bloody hand over her mouth.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger!
          Ginger's rolling the taste of Trina's blood around in her
          mouth.

          GINGER
          Mmnun .

          BRIGITTE
          You can't do that, That's human
          blood! .Feel anything?
          Brigitte and Ginger stare at one another. Ginger first shakes
          her head., but then nods. Ginger looks around and whispers

          It's sick but - I'm all like
          horny.
          Brigitte makes a sour face.

          SYKES
          Fitzgerald, bench!

          GINGER
          What, she started it!
          Brigitte watches Ginger march to the sidelines, throwing off
          her gear as she goes.

          SYKES
          Pick that stuff up!
          Ginger gives Sykes the finger without looking back. Brigitte
          groans.

          INT. BAILEY HIGH HALLS - DAY

          Brigitte waits outside a door marked GUIDANCE.
          Trina struggles by with the help of her clones. Trina sports
          a big ugly bandage on her neck, knees and an arm in a sling.
          She shoots Brigitte a Death Stare.

          TRINA
          Yer bitch sister's dead, freak.

          BRIGITTE
          (under her breath)
          Fuck off.
          Jason lopes up. He indicates the guidance office door.

          JASON
          Ginger in there again?
          Brigitte ignores him.

          JASON
          Cool. Um. Look, Belinda...

          BRIGITTE
          Brigitte.

          JASON
          Right, right. T'd really like to
          take yer sister out. Think you
          could ask her for me?

          Brigitte' s face clouds.

          JASON
          Hey. I could fix you up too. I
          guess.
          Brigitte seethes.

          JASON
          Fuck. Never mind, I'll ask her
          myself.
          (under his breath)
          Freak.
          Jason takes a post on the opposite Brigitte to wait. Brigitte
          glares at him.

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

          The grossly over-weight guidance councilor, MR. WAYNE, is
          perched on the edge of his fake wood desk, holding their
          death slides (from the credit sequence) up to the fluorescent
          light. His arm pits are stained with sweat.
          Ginger slumps in a chair before him. There is a fish bowl
          full of condoms on his desk. Ginger picks one out, unwrapping
          it, examining it as he talks.

          MR. WAYNE
          Look, you keep getting sent
          here. We might as well be
          friendly.

          GINGER
          I don't do friendly, Mr. Wayne.

          MR. WAYNE
          Hey. I know where you're coming
          from. I was a kid once too.

          GINGER
          Really? So was I. Weird.
          Ginger fakes an eye-lash batting smile. She winds the condom
          over her erect fingers.

          MR. WAYNE
          Okay, you aren't a kid. You're a
          young adult. With some issues.
          Let's explore them.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15, 1996 54
           Ginger rubs the condom's lubricant between her two free
          fingers, intrigued by the texture.

          MR. WAYNE
          Hey. I'm reaching out here.
          Your plays for attention are a
          cry for help, aren't they?

          GINGER
          Uh, no.

          MR. WAYNE
          Is it a problem at home? With
          your parents?

          GINGER
          They think I'm cute.
          Mr. Wayne sighs.

          MR. WAYNE
          Maybe I ought to split you and
          your sister up.

          GTNGER
          Aw, c'mon Mr. Wa-ayne. Divide
          aii' conquer? That's so old.

          MR. WAYNE
          Hey. You're antisocial,
          antagonistic, and now violent.
          The point of high school is you
          learn to develop a place for
          yourselves in society.../

          GINGER
          'Long as you like it.

          MR. WAYNE
          As long as you're at this school
          young lady, I better like it.
          Ginger gives him a cold, dead stare.

          MR. WAYNE
          consider this your final
          warning. I see you outta line
          again, and we're talking
          expulsion. And don't look at me
          like that, missy.

          Ginger slams the Guidance office door on her way out.

          GINGER
          Fuckin' guidance my ass.
          She pounds her fist into a locker and makes a dent. Brigitte
          cringes. Ginger admires the damage.

          JASON
          Holy...
          Ginger notices Jason and visibly brightens.

          GINGER
          Hey.

          JASON
          Hey. whatcha doin' now?

          GINGER
          Nothin' special.

          JASON
          Wanna go for a ride?

          GINGER
          Sure. C'mon Bee.
          Jason and Brigitte's faces darken simultaneously.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger, we should get home.

          GINGER
          No we shouldn't.
          Brigitte drags Ginger aside. Ginger notes Brigitte's hand
          squeezing her arm with a dangerous look.

          BRIGITTE
          Twenty minutes ago you coulda
          killed somebody. Is this really
          a good time to start dating? I
          don't think so.
          Ginger shakes Brigitte's hand off.

          GINGER
          Well, I do.

          

          

          

          

           56

          BRIGITTE
          Why?

          GINGER
          Why?! Look, grow up a little an'
          maybe you'll get it

          BRIGITTE
          What.

          GINGER
          Forget it, I'm goin'. I'll draw
          ya a picture later, 'kay?
          Ginger takes Jason's hand and pulls him off to the exit.
          Jason gives Brigitte SUCH a smug look over his shoulder.
          Brigitte stands alone in the hall, gaping after them.

          EXT BAILEY HIGH - LATE DAY

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          When Henry renovated the
          basement, to build our room? I
          was like ten an, in the way an,
          shit. Well, he rammed iue with
          this beam, right in my stomach.
          Accidentally.
          Brigitte wanders over the emptying school. lot. She looks
          small and alone. She looks disoriented.

          BRIGITTE (CON'T-V/0)
          But all the air came outta my
          lungs at once an, I kept tryin'
          to breathe but I couldn't. I
          forgot all about that. Till like
          right now.
          Brigitte consults the hygiene calendar. Ginger's ending the
          third week of checked-off days. A special note on today's
          date asks DO YOU HAVE PMS?

          EXT. HILL CREST -- DUSK

          Jason's van is parked on a rise that offers an impressive
          overview of Bailey Downs. Crickets sing. The moon is rising.

          

          

          

          

           57

          INT. THE VAN - DUSK

          Ginger and Jason sit in the front seat of his van. They're
          making out. Ginger is enjoying herself. Ginger bites his lip.
          Ginger draws blood.

          JASON
          Ouch! whoa. Can't believe you
          never had a boyfriend...
          Ginger licks his blood from her own lips and freezes dead
          cold. Jason dives back at her for more. Ginger looks both
          aroused and unnerved by her arousal. Ginger's stomach growls.
          Ginger pushes Jason off of her.

          GINGER
          I have to go. It's getting late.

          JASON
          It's only six o'clock.
          Jason presses himself on her again. Ginger shoves him off,
          hard.

          GINGER
          1-have-to-go.

          JASON
          Oh. Now you get all moody on me?

          GINGER
          Hey_ You got no idea.

          EXT. HILLCREST - DUSK

          Ginger slams the van door and rushes away from the van.

          JASON (O/S)
          Chicks, yer all the same!
          Ginger stops in her tracks. She shakes her head and continues
          away.

          JASON (O/S)
          Cock tease!

          EXT. BAILEY STREET - DUSK

          Brigitte shuffles along the curb, the picture of dejection.
          She slows to watch Sam loading some enormous tree branches
          into the back of his truck, packing up for the night: lie has

          

          

          

          

           58
          been cutting back an enormous tree in someone's front yard.
          when Sam glances her way, Brigitte picks up her pace without
          looking back.

          EXT. PARK AREA - NIGHT

          Trina wears a radio headset that pounds post-disco dance mix
          as she jogs. Morely dashes in and out of the surrounding
          greenery. He dashes in once more, and does not reappear.
          Trina looks back expectantly. She runs in place, waiting for
          him. She heads back, looking for him.
          Ginger pops out of the brush before Trina. Gingers face
          smeared with blood from Mo.rely. Ginger grins insanely. Ginger
          wiggles Morely's collar. Trina clicks off her head set.

          GINGER
          Hi!

          INT FITZGERALD BUNGALOW - NIGHT
          Brigitte descends the stairs to her room. Music blasts from
          the basement.

          PAMELA (O/S)
          Brigitte? Tell your sister to
          turn that stereo down!

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT

          Brigitte lets herself in. The music is now deafening. Trina
          is bound in a chair at the end of her bed, screaming her head
          off. Her screams are buried by the music. Brigitte slams and
          locks the door behind her.

          GINGER
          (yelling over noise)
          Stop screaming or I'll rip your
          permed head right off you neck.
          An' ya know what? I can do
          that. Now open wide
          Ginger force-feeds Trina something on a spoon. Trina screams
          with her mouth full, trying to spit it back out. Ginger
          offers Trina a glass of milk.

          GINGER
          Chaser? No?

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS-WALTON/July 15, 1996 59
          Blood trickles out of the corners of Trinas mouth as she
          chews while bawling. Ginger sets the glass of milk on the
          desk.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger WHAT are you doing-!
          Ginger grins and shows Bee a bowl of crushed glass and tacks.

          GINGER
          Jus' like you said, Bee!
          S' perfect!
          Brigitte grabs the bowl away: glass shards and tacks rain
          around them.

          BRIGITTE
          Are you crazy?!

          GINGER
          Hey! I'm Join' this for you!
          As the sisters argue, Trina rocks the chair back and forth,
          trying to free herself.

          BR I G ITTE
          Oh no, no way... No!

          GINGER
          Yer still burnt over Jason!

          BR I G ITTE
          No, Ginger, I'm burnt 'cause you
          don't see like jail in yer
          future! You don't get how hugely
          fucked this is! DO you?
          Trina lurches back hard and rocks forward. Trina struggles to
          get her toes to meet the floor. She lurches back for more
          momentum.

          GINGER
          You sayin' I'm stupid?!

          BRIGITTE
          I'm sayin' she? Will tell on
          you! This is someone who will
          tell!
          Trina throws herself forward again and her toes connect
          firmly with the floor - just as her temple connects with a
          sickening CRACK on the sharp corner of the desk. The milk
          glass dumps on top of her.

          

          

          

          

           60
          Brigitte and Ginger look at her. Trina hangs there in the
          chair at this strange angle for a moment, dripping milk.
          Then Trina and the chair keel to the floor. Trina is still.
          Brigitte turns the music off and creeps up to Trina. Blood
          trickles out of Trina's ear and swirls into the milky glass
          mess at her mouth. Her open eyes stare at nothing. She's
          dead.

          GINGER
          Ha-ha.
          Ginger grabs her own right arm (most damaged by the original
          attack) and shudders with pain.

          GINGER
          Ow. Ow. Owchee-wow-ow.
          Brigitte takes Trina in from head to toe. Brigitte checks
          Trina for a pulse. Brigitte snaps her hand back as though it
          were burned. A tremor wracks Brigitte's body and she
          convulses. Brigitte runs to the bathroom. OFF SCREEN,
          Brigitte throws up.
          Meanwhile Ginger raises her afflicted hand. The hand is
          nowsomething clearly on the way to being a wolfen paw. The
          nails are black, curling claws.
          Oblivious, Brigitte climbs back into bed and covers her face
          with a pillow.

          BRIGITTE
          My life is basically over.

          GINGER
          Bee. ..BEE!
          Awestruck, they both watch as Ginger extends and retracts her:
          new set of claws.
          There is a knock at the door. The girls look at one another
          in mute horror. Ginger addresses the door.

          GINGER
          What!

          PAMELA (O/S)
          Are you two fighting?!

          GINGER
          -- No!

          PAMELA (O/S)
          come on then. Dinner's ready.
          Brigitte and Ginger hop up and down in a brief freak fit.

          GINGER (O/S)
          Coming!

          TNT FITZGERALD DINING ROOM - NIGHT
          Ginger has her new paw curled up in an over-sized sweat
          jacket sleeve. Brigitte stares at the stew before them with
          grave distaste. Pamela has a number of used tissues around
          her - she's been crying.

          HENRY
          The gynecologist called.
          Pamela grasps Ginger's gnarly arm and squeezes it through her
          sleeve. Brigitte and Ginger look at Pamela's hand.

          PAMELA
          There's something wrong, Ginger.
          He wants to do an ultra-sound!

          HENRY
          Pamela, don't scare her. How
          could the cells not be human
          cells? we'll send you to
          somebody else.

          PAMELA
          I'm sure your father's right.
          I'm just upset... How are you
          feeling, do you feel. all right?

          GINGER
          Um. sure. Fine.

          PAMELA
          (lowering her voice)
          No unusual discharge or anything
          like that?
          Henry, Brigitte and Ginger groan.

          PAMELA
          I worry, all right? I've made
          another appointment with a new
          doctor. Early next month was the
          earliest he could see you. okay?

          

          

          

          

           62

          GINGER
          okay.
          They all begin eating in silence. Except Brigitte who gags
          as Henry squirts ketchup all over his stew.

          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S YARD - NIGHT

          Trina's body is wrapped in a bedspread and stuffed in a kid's
          wagon. Brigitte is keeping a look out looking pale and
          sickened.
          Grass and dirt spray out of the playhouse. Ginger is digging
          up the ground inside doggie style. She emerges, shaking the
          turf out of her new paw.
          They struggle to get Trina inside, but she's already too
          stiff to bend up.

          GINGER
          Told you.

          BRIGITTE
          Rigor mortis. Knew we shoulda
          skipped dinner.

          GINGER
          Can we do it my way now?
          Brigitte hesitates, her anxieties rising.

          BR IG ITTE
          So is this it? You doin' people
          now?

          GINGER
          She won't fit unless I

          BR IG ITTE

          BRIGITTE
          But were you gonna?
          There is a long pause. Ginger tries to laugh it off with,

          GINGER
          No. I'm not doing people. No.
          Brigitte takes a deep breath, nodding. She acts belief.

          

          

          

          

           63

          BRIGITTE
          'Kay. .Hurry up.
          Ginger drags a section of the body into the playhouse with
          her. Disgusting gnashing and tearing, bones snapping and
          other sounds of devouring are heard from within.
          Brigitte keeps watch. Tears appear in her eyes.
          The body is dragged another foot into the playhouse. Ginger
          is eating Trina to make her fit in the grave.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Trina was dead. Trina was
          dinner. This was BAD.An'I kept
          wonderin' what Sam was doin'
          right then. I couldn't help it,
          he jus' kept poppin' into my

          CUT TO BLACK.

          INT A FAMILY-SIZE FREEZER - DAWN
          Brigitte lifts the lid of a large freezer. OUR POV IS FROM
          INSIDE THE FREEZER. Its light illuminates the brown paper
          parcels Ginger sets inside, next to the frozen waffles and
          veggies. The parcels are labeled T-bone, T-thigh, T-breast.

          BRIGITTE (V/0)
          What Ginger couldn't finish we
          froze, 'cause the less we left
          for whoever would find Trina,
          the better. Watch a lot of crime
          TV, so.
          Brigitte's sizing Ginger up behind her back.
          Ginger finishes loading the freezer. Brigitte drops the lid.

          CUT TO BLACK.

          INT GIRLS' BEDROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT
          The room is dark. Ginger is asleep.
          Brigitte is in bed with her back turned to Ginger's bed.
          Brigitte has a penlight on a collection of open monster
          books. She is examining a sketch of a plant with yellow
          flowers.

          Brigitte nearly jumps into orbit, slamming her book shut as
          Ginger appears over her shoulder.

          GINGER
          Hm. Big Book of Monsters, hunh.
          Thought they were useless.

          They are. Couldn't sleep. So.
          Rrigitte gives Ginger a nervous smile. Ginger smiles back.
          Her fangs show.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

          Their alarm clock goes off reading 8:00 AM. Ginger's paw
          comes down hard on it, cracking the plastic casing.
          Brigitte is already up. She sweeps up the glass mess from the
          night before.
          Ginger rolls out of bed, steps over Brigitte and stumbles to
          the bathroom. Ginger steps on tacks and doesn't even react.

          GINGER
          Man, I'm not getting enough
          sleep.
          Ginger closes the bathroom door.
          Brigitte leaps to the door, looping one end of a noosed
          extension cord around the handle. The other end is tied to
          the door handle of the bedroom door. Brigitte checks to
          ensure the latter is bolted shut.

          open the door. She can't.

          GINGER(O/S)
          The fuck -? Beef
          Brigitte watches the vibrating length of cord hold the door
          firmly in place. Ginger bangs hard on the door.

          GINGER

          can. I`ll be back before dark.
          Brigitte tears the page with the plant out of her book and
          leaves by the window.

          EXT COUNTY GREENHOUSES - DAY
          Brigitte steps off a county bus at the drive.
          There's a police car parked next to the Sam's truck. She
          looks back to the bus, but the doors swing shut and it pulls
          away.
          Brigitte smoothes her hair, takes a deep breath, and over-

          where she is, I'm very
          concerned. That's it, unless you
          got a warrant.
          She ends up backing into a COP behind some palms.

          BRIGITTE
          Shhh-it! I mean, sorry.

          SAM
          (to cop)
          You can see I got customers, so
          if that's all.

          COP
          Okay. Sure. For now.
          The cop gives Sam a final Dirty Harry squint and leaves.
          Sam collects himself with difficulty. So does Brigitte.

          SAM
          if you skipped school lookin' to
          score, I don't keep nothin' here
          at work, sweetheart.

          BRIGITTE
          I din't. I mean I skipped, but-/

          SAM
          Hey. From Mccardy's van, right?
          You know my girlfriend? Trina
          Sinclair?

          BRIGITTE
          Rinda.

          SAM
          You seen her today?

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS- WAI.TON/July 15, 1996 67

          BRIGITTE
          Not today...

          SAM
          Fuck. She's missing.

          BRIGITTE
          Oh. S-sorry.

          SAM
          Yeah, well. Cops think I know
          where she is. I don't.
           Sam looks Brigitte right in the eye. Brigitte is caught up in
          him for a second.

          SAM
          Sorry, what do you care right?
          What do you need.

          BRIGITTE
          Um. Lookin' for this.
          She holds out the torn page. Sam takes it.

          SAM
          Aconitum lycoctonum? Sorry.
          Brigitte yanks her own hair hard. Sam smiles.

          SAM
          Tryin' to kill somebody?
          (off her look)
          Well, you know it's poisonous,
          right? Wolfs bane? Deadly. Be
          like stocking hemlock an, shit.

          BRIGITTE
          No, I thought it did something
          else. Doesn't matter.

          SAM
          Anyways they're perennials -
          only flowers in spring.
          Brigitte turns to leave, hot with frustration, huinilliation.
          Sam watches her stamp toward the door.

          SAM
          Hey. Ranunculaceae come in about
          a hundred species. I've gotta
          cousin, monkshood. Not so toxic.
          If you're interested.

          

          

          

          

           66
          Brigitte stops and considers him.

          SAM
          Don't know if it'd help.

          INT GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
          They sit together amidst beautiful plants and flowers. Sam.
          picks a tiny purple flower from a bed of young plants and
          hands it to Brigitte.

          SAM
          S'called monkshood 'cause people
          used to think it kept 'em pure
          from dirty thoughts. Seriously.

          BRIGITTE

          (EARNESTLY)
          Make my life easier.
          Sam laughs. Surprised by this, Brigitte smiles and hides
          under her hair.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          This is awful. but the whole time
          I was with him there? I din't
          even think how I'd just put
          pieces of his girlfriend in the
          deep freeze, like, at all.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - DAY

          Ginger pulls with all. her might to get the door open a few
          inches. The door knobs on both doors are straining.
          Something starts to crack.
          With ferocious effort, Ginger contorts herself through two
          inches of space. The cracking is coming from Ginger as she
          squeezes her body bizarre-ly out of joint, as a contortionist
          might.
          Once through, she snaps and clicks her distended bones back
          in place. She gasps for breath. Her face is distorted with
          murderous fury.
          There is a knock on the bedroom door.

          PAMELA (O/S)
          Ginger, feeling any better?
          Ginger climbs noiselessly out of the window.

          

          

          

          

           69
          PAMELA (O/s)
          Ginger? You sleeping?...God, I
          hate this lock, I know it's-
          privacy but what if you were in
          trouble in there for god's sake?

          INT. BAILEY HIGH HALL - DAY

          Brigitte stands at her on locker, tying a rubber band
          around stalks of the monkshood. There is a goofy half-smile
          on her face, and she's humming.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          The book said dry it out before
          using it. I figured I'd keep
          Ginger locked up - feeding her
          Trina - till it was ready.
          she hangs the monkshood upside down in the locker. The
          buzzer goes as she slams the door shut.

          EXT. SERVICE LANE - DAY

          Ginger stalks past the neighbor's yard with the playhouse
          where Trina is buried.

          EXT. PLAYHOUSE YARD - DAY

          A new puppy romps. He sniffs around the edge of the
          playhouse. He smells something. He starts to whine and dig.

          INT. BAILEY HIGH - DAY

          Ginger stomps the deserted halls, with their class schedule
          in hand. Classes are in session. A fat silhouette appears-at
          the end of the corridor.

          WAYNE
          Fitzgerald. Tardy! My office

          NOW!
          Ginger faces him with a dreadful expression.

          

          

          

          

           70

          INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

          Brigitte slumps in her seat doodling. The RCMP officer is
          back, speaking to the class. The poster this time has a class
          photo of Trina.

          OFFICER
          If any of you have seen Trina
          please let us know. She went
          for a run this morning and has
          not returned or contacted her
          family or friends...

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

          Ginger stands imposingly over Mr. Wayne in his chair.

          WAYNE
          Sit down, Ginger.

          GINGER
          I can't stay.

          WAYNF:
          I said, sit.

          GINGER
          An' I said ./

          WAYNE
          (cutting her off)
          You are expelled. This is not
          your personal playground, this
          is a school.

          GINGER
          Oh dear.

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE -- A FEW MINUTES LATER/DAY

          Ginger's good hand lifts the telephone receiver on Mr.
          Wayne's desk. With her wolfen paw she dials. In the
          background we see blood splattered over the walls.

          

          

          

          

           71

          GINGER (O/S)
          (imitating Pamela)
          Hello, main office? This is Mrs.
          Fitzgerald. would you page my
          daughter Brigitte please? I'm
          waiting to meet her in the
          guidance office. Thank you so
          much.

          INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

          Brigitte catches herself writing Sam's name on her binder.
          She scribbles it out, looking very guilty.

          PA SYSTEM (O/S)
          Would Brigitte Fitzgerald please
          report to guidance. Brigitte
          Fitzgerald.
          Brigitte freezes. The cop, the teacher, the whole class look
          at her. Brigitte scoops up her stuff.

          EXT. GUIDANCE OFFICE -- DAY

          Brigitte reaches the door and finds it locked. The door opens
          a crack and Ginger's transformed arm grabs Brig.iLLe, hauling
          her inside. The door slams shut and locks.

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY


          GINGER
          Don't ever fuck with me like
          that again.

          BRIGITTE
          You .got out.
          Brigitte gapes at all the blood. Ginger is very agitated.

          GINGER
          He asked for it. Was gonna expel
          me. So.
          Backing away, Brigitte trips over Mr. Wayne's foot sticking
          out from under the desk.

          GINGER
          What do we do, Bee? What do we
          do?

          

          

          

          

           72
          Brigitte sinks into a chair looking completely traumatized.
          Ginger hops about - charged by the kill.

          GINGER
          C'mon we need a fuckin' plan
          here!
          The school bell goes off. Brigitte snaps out of her daze,
          reaches up and hits the light switch off. They now sit in
          virtual darkness.

          BRIGITTE
          Last bell. wait till everyone
          goes. We'll stuff him someplace.
          Clean this up. I guess.
          The sound of the full halls around them seems very loud now.

          GINGER
          Bee, gotta a smoke?
          Brigitte hands her a smoke.

          GINGER
          Sorry about this.

          BRIGITTE
          Whatever.

          GINGER
          Don't be mad, ' kay?

          BRIGITTE
          I'm not mad.

          INT. BAILEY HIGH HALLS - LATER

          The school is deserted. The lock pops on the Guidance door
          and Brigitte and Ginger peer out. Nobody.

          BRIGITTE
          Stay here. Lock the door. I'll
          knock once.
          Ginger nods. Brigitte slips out and creeps down the corridor.
          Ginger shuts the door. Then Ginger whips it open again.

          BR IG ITTE
          Shut the door, Ginger!

          

          

          

          

           73

          GINGER
          Bee?

          BRIGITTE

          WHATI

          GINGER
          Thanks.
          Brigitte blinks at her, then continues to skulk away. The
          office door shuts and the lock locking reverbs after her.

          INT. ANOTHER HALLWAY - LATE DAY

          Brigitte walks fast, looking for a place for the body.
          She looks inside full garbage cans and sizes them up. Too
          small.
          She looks up at a loose ceiling panel. She jumps a few times
          trying to reach it. Too high. She gets an idea.
          Brigitte jogs past the sign directing us to gym.

          INT. GUIDANCE HALL - MEANWHILE

          A JANITOR pushes his cart toward the guidance office. He
          stops at another door, produces keys, and lets himself in.
          He returns with a trash can and empties into his bin. He
          replaces the can, closes the door and locks it.

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - MEANWHILE

          Ginger, gnaws on Mr. Wayne's arm but really isn't enjoying
          it. She stops in mid-chew and listens. The janitor's
          footsteps approach: his cart wheels squeak

          INT. GUIDANCE HALL - DAY

          The janitor wheels up to the guidance office. He slides this
          key in the lock.

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

          Ginger grips the door knob as best she can with her one good
          hand, her feet braced against the wall on either side.

          

          

          

          

           74
          On the other side, the janitor tugs, and tugs again.
          Ginger's getting madder the more he persists.
          The janitor gives the door one last wrench and it flies open.

          INT. GUIDANCE HALL - DAY

          Brigitte wheels a large cloth cart full of basket balls
          around a corner.
          The janitor crawls toward her, his hands lifted to her for
          help, blood spurting from his slashed throat. He tries to
          cry out, but only makes a gurgling whistle, the air in his
          Qi s passing through blood.
          Ginger walks behind him as he crawls. Ginger applies her boot
          to his ass and makes him slip face first in his own gore.
          Ginger giggles.
          Ginger looks up and sees Brigitte gaping in utter revulsion
          at her. For a split second, Ginger stops cold. Ginger seems
          to falter before her sister's horror.
          Then, without breaking their locked gaze, without even
          seeming conscious she's doing it - Ginger steps on the man's
          fingers and breaks them with a series of snaps.
          Brigitte tries to pry her eyes away, but can't.
          Still staring at Brigitte, Ginger extends her claws. Ginger
          shakes her head, as if to say I can't help it.. .Ginger
          pounces on the man. Brigitte turns her face to the wall.
          The lanitor makes a final horrible noise. The halls fall
          silent.

          MONTAGE: INT. SCHOOL - LATE DAY TO NIGHT

          as Brigitte stuffs Mr. Wayne into the gym basket and covers
          him with balls,
          Ginger runs madly up and down the halls screeching and
          whooping, slamming her monster arm into the lockers bashing
          them in.
          as Brigitte pushes the janitor's body into a ground level air

          VENT
          Ginger breaks the fire extinguisher out of it's case and
          unleashes foam into the halls.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS -WALTON/July 15, 1996 75
          Brigitte mops up the janitor's blood with his own cart stuff.
          The Guidance office is already clean.
          Ginger lifts the fire extinguisher over her head. She starts
          running with it toward through the frosted glass window of
          the main office with a triumphant war whoop.
          Brigitte steps between Ginger and her target.

          GINGER
          Move!

          BRIGITTE
          STOP IT! Just stop. Enough,
          Ginger. Please. Please.
          Ginger throws the canister any way, forcing Brigitte to dive
          out of the way. SMASH! Glass rains down over. Brigitte.
          Brigitte lifts her head in time to see Ginger burn down the
          hall looking for more mischief.
          Brigitte curls into a fetal position, burying her face in her
          lap and rocks herself. Brigitte sobs.
          OFF-SCREEN we hear Ginger cont.inuing her ram a e else where
          in the school. Brigitte wanders up to the janitor's cart,
          looking like a plane crash survivor - dazed and wretched.
          Brigitte picks up a bottle of cleaning fluid. She sniffs it.
          She closes her eyes and tips it back. She washes it around in
          her mouth and lifts her chin to swallow. She spews it into
          the air, the taste making her heave instinctively. she dry
          heaves a couple of times. She throws the bottle at the wall.

          INT. SCHOOL - NIGHT

          Exhausted, Brigitte trails Ginger who is tired too, and
          heading for the exit. They stop dead at the doors.

          EXT. SCHOOL STEPS - NIGHT

          A truck's headlights pin them in full view. Ginger rolls her
          sleeve down over her paw. Brigitte swoons as if she might
          black out on the spot.
          The truck's engine cuts and the doors slowly open.

          JASON
          Well, well well..

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS -WALTON/Jufy 15, 1996 76
          Jason and his pals climb out of the van. They hold beer
          bottles: they have come here to drink.

          JASON
          The fair sisters Fitzgerald.

          GINGER
          Hey. How's it goin'?

          JASON

          Tim cracks the door and takes a look inside.

          TIM
          Holy shit - they trashed the
          place!
          The guys gawk: they are very impressed.

          BOYS

          JASON

          Brigitte glares at Ginger.

          GINGER
          You won't tell.

          JASON
          Oh I might.

          GINGER
          No you won't.

          Brigitte slumps against the wall.

          JASON

          TIM

          JASON
          Jason gets the eager nod from his gang.

          JASON
          Okay, let's go.

          GINGER
          Not now - I'm a mess. We're

          then.

          JASON
          Deal.
          He extends his hand to shake on it. Linger shakes it
          awkwardly with her good hand. Brigitte thumps her head
          against the wall.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Ginger leans on the bathroom door, which is shut.

          GINGER
          C'mon Bee...

          INT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Brigitte is sitting on the closed seat of the toilet trying
          to pull her hair out.

          BRIGITTE
          Shut up, leave me alone!

          GINGER (O/S)
          It's not that big a deal.

          BRIGITTE (O/S)
          How can you say that! Two people
          are dead because of you. Us.

          GINGER
          They pissed me off.
          Brigitte opens the bathroom door.

          BRIGITTE
          Oh. Then they we asking for it?
          What about Jason an' them? Gonna
          kill 'em all when yer done,
          Ginger? 'Cause you have to take
          yer clothes OFF for that shit,
          they wanna SEE yer BODY for that
          shit, you gonna let like five
          guys live to tell how they
          fucked the Beast a' Bailey
          Downs? That could annoy you too!
          Ginger prods a claw into Brigitte's chest, pinning her in
          place.

          GINGER
          Think yer sooo smart? I think
          yer sooo jealous.

          BRIGITTE
          Yeah, I'm jealous yer turning
          into a nympho. I'm so jealous
          yer killing people who did never
          did nothing to you. Yeah Ginger.
          Sure.

          GINGER
          Oh, wow.

          

          

          

          

           79
          Brigitte takes a deep breath, swallows hard.

          BR IG ITTE
          I don't wanna do this any more.
          Ginger's claw pricks Brigitte's skin. Brigitte cringes.
          Blood appears around the claw.

          GINGER
          What.

          BRIGITTE
          I'm sorry, but...!
          Brigitte writhes in pain as Ginger's claw slices in deeper.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger?! This is me.
          Ginger retracts the claw, and Brigitte grabs the wound.

          GINGER

          SO?
          Ginger hurls Brigitte against the wall. Ginger throws herself
          on top of Brigitte. Ginger raises her killing claw to
          Bri g.iLt.e' s neck.

          GINGER
          Who needs you?
          Brigitte is helpless and looks terrified. Ginger's face is
          contorted with intensity, with madness. Ginger's drooling. A
          drip of gob drops onto Brigitte's face.

          BRIGITTE
          (very small,

          PLAINTIVE)
          Ginger...
          Ginger lifts Brigitte by the shirt-front and searches her
          eyes. Ginger drops Brigitte to the floor and grabs her coat.
          Brigitte grabs Ginger's leg.

          BRIGITTE
          Don't, please!
          Brigitte struggles to hang on, to rise from the floor;
          Ginger's really hurt her.

          BRIGITTE
          Maybe we can stop it! Lemme try!
          Ginger kicks free.

          

          

          

          

           80

          GINGER
          An' spoil my fun? I'll skin you
          alive first.
          Brigitte struggles to a point between Ginger and the window.

          BR IG ITTE
          You're fucked without me.
          They'll catch you. Wake up!

          GINGER
          No, you wake up! Nobody'll live
          to catch me. Yer a two-faced
          lil' chicken shit? Your problem,
          Brigitte. I don't need ya. I
          don't WANTCHA! So stay away from
          me or I'll kill you I swear I'll
          have you for breakfast.
          Brigitte backs out of Ginger's way.
          Ginger steps up i.o the window and climbs through.
          Brigitte rubs her throat, trying hard to keep breathing.
          Brigitte dashes to her own bed and drags an Adidas gym bag
          from under it. Brigitte starts grabbing clothes off the
          floor and jamming them into the bag.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I was like, okay. Fuck you too.
          She'd be sorry. And I'd be like,
          I dunno - somewheres' totally
          else goin' not my problem.
          Right.

          EXT SERVICE LANE - NIGHT
          Brigitte trudges up to the bus stop next to the fence of the
          playhouse yard with her full Adidas bag.
          Light streams from inside the yard, multi-coloured, strobing.
          It looks like a UFO has landed on the other side of the
          fence.
          She peers through the slats. She sees the playhouse, lit up
          like a Christmas tree. She sees gloved hands and police
          uniforms. Then sliding past, the long - almost endless -
          shape on a stretcher being drawn out of the playhouse:
          they've found Trina's body.
          The bus appears, approaching from way down the road.

          

          

          

          

           81
          Brigitte looks from it to the crime scene. The crime scene
          photographer's FLASH! pops in Brigitte's face - blinding her
          for a second. Brigitte rubs her eyes. She shakes her head
          hard.
          The bus is indicating, slowing to pull over.
          Brigitte opens her eyes. The bus is almost here. Brigitte
          grips her Adidas bag.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          But you can't break up with
          blood. You can't divorce yer
          sister. You jus' can't.
          The bus passes, obscuring Brigitte from view as its body
          fills frame. when its tail lights pass, Brigitte is far down
          the street, running like a champion in the direction she came
          from.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Brigitte carefully unlocks the bedroom door and slowly opens
          it. The room is dark and just as she left it. Ginger's hed
          has not been slept in, and she is no where to be seen.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I'd get the monkshood from my
          locker at school the next
          morning.
          Brigitte creeps to the bathroom and snaps the light on.
          Empty.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I'd find Ginger, I'd find out if
          the stuff even worked.
          Brigitte locks the window shut. She locks the bedroom door
          and pushes a bureau of drawers in front of it.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I could deal with whatever, as
          long as I tried. If it was the
          last thing she ever saw me do,
          it was gonna be me goin' fer
          somethin' by myself. The real
          Ginger woulda dug that large.
          Brigitte turns on the bedside lamp and fishes a baseball bat
          out of the closet.

          

          

          

          

           82

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I would try to save my sister
          when the sun came up. You know,
          if the sun came up.
          Brigitte climbs into bed, snuggling the bat in with her. She
          lights a smoke. She finds the feminine hygiene calendar on
          the bedside table next to the photo of the girls as kids at
          Halloween, taken many years before.
          The calendar tells us it is about to be Friday. Friday is the
          full moon. Friday is Halloween.

          INT GIRLS' ROOM - DAWN
          The lamp is still on. The ash tray is full of butts. Brigitte
          stirs in her sleep.
          Ginger stands at the end of Brigitte's bed, staring at her.
          Brigitte snaps to, gripping the bat. Ginger snorts, and
          climbs into her own bed.
          Brigitte swings her gaze to the window. It is still shut and
          locked. The bureau is still in front of the door. Brigitte
          holds her hat tightly and watches her sister's back in the
          next bed, terrified.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH - DAY

          Brigitte jogs up to the school. The yard is full of
          students. Teachers are marshaling them into lines and seating
          them on the grass. Brigitte plows through.
          Ginger rides past, piggy-backed by Jason. Ginger completely
          ignores Brigitte. Brigitte looks very worried.

          FEMALE STUDENTS
          Ginger Fitzgerald is such a
          slut./No kidding./The bitch.

          VARIOUS STUDENTS
          You hear about Trina
          Sinclair?/Dug her up in
          somebody's back yard!/oh that's
          so sad!/ Poor Trina, Ga-awd!
          As Brigitte gets closer to the building, she finds police
          cars and cops at the main entrance.

          BRIGITTE
          Shit.
          PRINCIPAL FARDOR is speaking with the RCMP constable who has
          been visiting classes. Fardor holds a hanky over his face.

          FARDOR
          That stench near the staff
          offices, what is that you think?
          Brigitte hedges up the steps toward the door.

          OFFICER
          I couldn't say, sir. Now is
          there anyone you suggest we talk
          to? Anyone with something
          against the school?
          Brigitte slips past the two men.

          FARDOR
          For god's sake look around you.
          I got 350 angry young people
          bored blind.Helluva day for my
           goddamn cleaning staff to be
          late ... . IIEY!
          Brigitte stops at the threshold.

          FARDOR
          The hell you goin'?

          BR IG ITTE
          I left something in my locker.

          FARDOR
          Find your homeroom and wait.
          School's outta bounds until we
          call you in. Get!
          Brigitte backs down the steps, looking like she just took a
          good slap. She turns to confront the mass confusion around
          her.
          Brigitte spots Ginger dancing on the roof of a car in the lot
          now, surrounded by boys. Brigitte spots Sam's truck near-by.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY

          Sam is sit in his truck, slumped over the wheel. He holds an
          almost-gone bottle of rye. Brigitte runs up.

          

          

          

          

           84
          Sam is crying. He doesn't see Brigitte arrive at his window,
          so she turns to tip-toe away. Sam looks up. His eyes tell us
          he's stoned.

          SAM
          Hey. Wolfs bane. Wanna drink?
          Brigitte stops and turns to face him. Sam dries his face on
          his sleeve and pops his passenger door. Brigitte looks around
          and slides in.
          Ginger is watching Brigitte out of the corner of her eye.

          INT. SAM'S TRUCK - DAY


          SAM
          I showed up to see Trina? But
          she's I'm goin' strange in
          the head.
          Brigitte doesn't know what to say, so she offers his a smoke.
          He takes it.

          SAM
          Why? Why would ya do a thing
          like that?
          Brigitte examine his. face for an implication. There isn't
          one.

          SAM
          What's unny is I dumped her
          that night. Feel bad about it
          now. Truth is, she was a pain in
          the ass. I sound like a jerk,
          right.

          BR IGITTE
          No.

          SAM
          Really? Yeah well, while she
          was - disappearin', I'm off have
          a time at the Highway Home with
          my buddy Georgio. Drinkin',
          dealin' - an, now she's
          Sam is over-come again. Brigitte raises a hand to touch him,
          chickens out, and then scores on the second attempt. He
          rolls right into her arms.

          

          

          

          

           85
          For a brief moment, Brigitte has her nose in his hair, her
          cheek on his shoulder, her hands on his back. He's crying,
          and she fights her own tears.

          SAM
          Sorry, this is strange. I don't
          even ...Last time I saw her she
          was so mad at me. An' we did
          have some times, we did. Makes
          me sick what her last thought a'
          me musta been though.
          Their eyes meet, their faces are inches apart. Brigitte
          kisses him, very softly and very quickly and then pulls out.
          Sam looks shocked. Brigitte looks more shocked.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH PARKING LOT - MEANWHILE/DAY

          Ginger stops dancing a second. She is staring at Brigitte
          and Sam in his truck. Her face darkens.

          INT. SAM'S TRUCK - DAY


          BRIGITTE
          I'm really, um.
          Sam leans in and kisses her right back. Better. Longer.

          SAM
          Shit. Sorry. Kinda freaked. You
          know? I shouldn't, well.

          BRIGITTE
          Yeah. Yeah.

          SAM
          But that was really nice.

          BRIGITTE
          Oh. 'Kay. Good.
          They sit staring straight ahead a moment. A cop ahead double-
          takes them, and reaches into his car for the radio mic.

          SAM
          You wanna lil' dube or
          somethin'? Listenin' to me go

          Yes! Dirty thoughts! oh. I been
          drinkin'. Should not drive.
          Right, Brr-igitte?
          Brigitte drags her hands over her face with extreme anxiety.

          Oh, right. OK. Ur.

          SAM
          Ginger's yer sister right?
          Sam grimaces as Brigitte nods.

          Why?

          SAM
          Oh, rumors - say she's doin'

          ho', that kinder thing. Hey.
          Don't worry about it. Nobody
          mentioned you.
          Ginger's most maniacal laugh drifts over to them. Brigitte
          sees her dancing sexily on the roof of a car with a whole
          crowd of leering boys.

          Brigitte slips out of the truck as they stare at one another
          with that look you get when you're scared because you just
          kissed someone you really, really like.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY

          Two more squad cars are gliding up the street toward the
          school.
          .Brigitte makes her way toward Ginger.

          fie was jus' drunk, I'm thinkin'.
          I mean he prob'ly din't mean it.
          Whatever.
          Beyond Sam's truck, behind Brigitte, the two new cruisers
          lurch to a stop. Cops approach Sam's vehicle with extreme
          caution.
          Brigitte arrives at the car with Ginger as,

          GINGER
          All a' you guys?! My house!

          ALL RIGHT, GINGER:::! WHO00-

          HOO!
          The crowd applauds. Brigitte stares at Ginger like she's
          watching a cruise missile coming in. Ginger notices Brigitte
          watching her. Ginger pretends she doesn't see her.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Ginger was gonna kill every one
          of l em.
          A commotion behind them causes everyone to turn.
          Sam is being dragged from his truck by the cops. He is flung
          face-first onto the hood and hand-cuffed.

          COP
          Sam McDonald? You're under
          arrest for the murder of Trina
          Sinclair.
          Brigitte physically fights with herself not to yell out. She
          runs a few steps toward Sam. Brigitte looks back at Ginger,
          who drills her with an evil warning glare.
          The cops shove Sam into the back of a cruiser. They roar
          off.
          Brigitte stands alone, apart from the crowd. The cruisers'
          flashing lights disappear down the street. Brigitte turns to
          face Ginger, mustering her own first menacing look.
          Ginger accepts a cigarette offered by one of her boys.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          They closed the school that day.
          So I never got to my locker. So
          I never got the monkshood. I
          thought, this is it. I fucked
          up.

          EXT. FITZGERALD BUNGALOW - LATE DAY

          The full moon is just making an appearance.
          Brigitte stands in the front room window, which is decorated
          with a Happy Halloween paper sign and plastic bats.
          Brigitte's watching Henry put Styrofoam tombstones in the
          front yard.

           89
          The Fitzgerald family is eating. Brigitte pokes at her food.
          Ginger eats like a fiend, with sunglasses on. Her monster arm
          has been wrapped in gauze from tip to elbow.

          PAMELA
          Now just remember, no boys in
          you bedroom during this party.
          Your room is off limits. Ginger
          are you sure that arm's not
          sprained, or worse?

          GINGER
          Bruise. Lacrosse.

          PAMELA
          Mm Henry when'd you get this new
          meat from Tinny's? Quite nice.
          Brigitte and Ginger exchange a look.

          HENRY
          I haven't been to Tinny's.

          PAMELA
          Then where's all the packs
          marked "t" come from -?
          Brigitte spits out her food.

          BRIGITTE
          I be excused?

          INT. FITZGERALD MINIVAN - MAGIC HOUR

          Brigitte is using the vehicle's portable phone as she eyes
          the silhouettes of the family -still at the dining table - in
          the window above her.
          She stares at her watch during the following,

          911 OPERATOR (O/S)
          911, do you need fire, ambulance
          or police, please.

          BRIGITTE
          (speaking very

          QUICKLY)
          Sam McDonald is not the Beast of
          Bailey Downs. He was at the
          Highway Home Motel when Trina
          Sinclair was killed. Sam didn't
          do it.

          

          

          

          

           90
          Brigitte whips the phone shut, hanging up. She breathes out
          long and slow.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          In case this was the last thing
          I'd do. I wanned Sam out of it.
          Sam shouldn't suffer.

          INT. FITZGERALD DINING ROOM - LATER

          Brigitte hovers in the door way. Henry is reading the paper.

          HENRY
          That Sinclair girl was found at
          the Bernstein's, can you believe
          it?

          PAMELA
          What, last night? I didn't hear
          a thing! Never going to have
          these done in time. Henry help.
          Pamela is feverishly creating little straw witches and such
          party decorations. She has a se]ecl.i.on of dried flowers,
          wheat etc on the table before her.

          PAMELA
          Brigitte, honey we're
          thrilled you two are making
          friends. But next time you two
          do something like this give
          Mummy a little more notice, will
          you? Hate having to scramble.
          Brigitte slides into her regular chair and props her hands on
          her wrists in an attitude of complete distraction.

          HENRY
          What's your sister up to?
          Brigitte looks at Henry as he works on a little witch.

          PAMELA
          She said she had a lot of work
          to do on her costume. Should we
          dress up, you think?
          Henry grimaces. He sifts through the dried plants before
          them. Brigitte double-takes the pile.

          PAME-LA
          oh, Henry. You're no fun at all.

          

          

          

          

           91
          Brigitte sits bolt up right in her seat.

          BRIGITTE
          What is this stuff?

          PAMELA
          Just weeds, old cuttings from
          the yard.

          BRIGITTE
          No, THIS stuff.
          Brigitte plucks out a handful of dried plant with tiny purple
          flowers.

          PAMELA
          Oh, I had that around the
          dahlias. Man at the greenhouse
          said it'd keep the cats out.
          Seemed to do the job. It's got a
          funny name - nun's robe, priest
          hat, something

          BRIGITTE
          Monkshood.

          PAMELA
          That's right. Do we have a
          budding botanist in the family?!

          HENRY
          Pun intended.
          Pamela giggles as does Henry. Brigitte grabs a fistful of
          monkshood and races for the door.

          PAMELA
          Hey, we need that! Brigitte!
          But Brigitte is gone.

          PAMELA
          That was my accent colour!

          INT. BASEMENT PROPER - DUSK

          The half-finished basement has a rec room which Pamela has
          decked out in an infantile version of ghoulish for the party.
          Punch sits ready next to case-lot pop and Tupperware brimming
          with snacks.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15. 1996 92
          Brigitte walks through to the door with a sign, OFF LIMITS.
          Brigitte unlocks the door and slips the monkshood up her
          shirt.

          INT. BEDROOM - DUSK

          Candles are burning all over. Ginger's bed is turned down,
          ready. Brigitte walks in on Jason climbing through the open
          window.

          JASON
          Hey. Must be the place, right?
          Brigitte sneers at him. He holds a half-gone bottle of
          schnapps, a dress shirt and his Good Jeans on.
          The toilet flushes in the john. Brigitte knocks on the door.

          GINGER

          WHAT1

          BRIGITTE
          McCardy's here.
          The bathroom door unlocks but. remains closed.

          GINGER
          Git in here an, gimme a hand.
          Brigitte casts an uncertain look at Jason.

          JASON
          C'mon ladies, there's six other
          guys sitting in the shrub
          waiting.
          Brigitte's face darkens. She slips into the bathroom and
          shuts the door.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Do you think some people deserve
          to die?

          INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Brigitte does not tryo to hide her fear of being in a
          confined space with Ginger. There are razors and whiskers all
          over the floor. shaving cream every where. Ginger is red-
          faced, sweating and hostile.

          

          

          

          

           

          93

          GINGER
          Don't say a fuckin' word.
          Ginger lowers the towel she's wearing enough to show the
          bump on her butt is now a twitching tail. Brigitte gasps.

          GINGER
          Take this gauze and tie it flat.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger, you can't

          GINGER

          DO IT!
          Brigitte takes the roll of gauze. She grabs the tail between
          her fingers and coils it up with utter disgust. Brigitte's
          hands tremble.

          EXT. GIRLS BEDROOM - MEANWHILE/NIGHT

          Jason sits on the edge of Ginger's bed and bounces up and
          down a bit. Between his legs we glimpse a dog tag hanging
          between the mattresses.

          TNT GIRLS BATHROOM - NIGHT
          Brigitte tapes the gauze in place. Ginger throws a robe on
          and grabs the door.

          GINGER
          Now get outta my life.
          Brigitte grits her teeth.

          BRIGITTE
          I gotta get ready for the party.

          GINGER
          Then wait here till I'm done.

          BRIGITTE
          What, through all fifty a' them?

          GINGER
          Oh, don't tempt me.
          Ginger takes a deep breath before she opens the bathroom
          door. Her breath is ragged. She smoothes her hair and chews
          her lip. She's nervous. Ginger opens the door and closes it
          behind her.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 22, 1996 94
          Brigitte hears,

          JASON (O/S)
          It's really dark in here.

          GINGER (01S)
          I'm shy. Lay down.
          Brigitte puts the toilet seat down and sits on it. Brigitte
          lights a smoke. Brigitte withdraws the monkshood from under
          her shirt and has a good scratch where it was itching her.
          OFF-SCREEN are the sounds of slurp kisses and Jason's moans.
          A fly unzips. Clothes fall with soft plunks to the floor.
          Bed springs creak. Plastic condom wrappers crinkle and then
          the SNAP-WHAP of one being fitted on pretty roughly.
          Somewhere above them the door bell starts ringing.
          From a vanity cupboard she pulls a Zombie face-painting kit
          and sets it next to the monkshood.

          EXT. FITZGERALD BUNGALOW -- NIGHT

          Cars are streaming down the street in both directions.
          Groups of COSTUMED TEENAGE BOYS flock down the walks, over
          lawns, and que up to get into the Fitzgerald party.
          On their front porch, Pamela and Henry meet and greet the
          young men, awed by their numbers.

          HENRY
          (to Pamela)
          Notice any girls?
          Pamela shrugs.

          INT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - MEANWHILE/NIGHT

          Brigitte - now in ZOMBIE-face - rubs the monkshood between
          her fingers, crumbling it into a neat pile on the counter.
          OFF-SCREEN from the bedroom, the sounds of Ginger having
          rough sex continue.
          Brigitte peels a centimeter of paper off the end of an unlit
          smoke and wiggles the cigarette, creating a second pile of
          tobacco. She reaches into the radiator vent and withdraws a
          package of rolling papers.

          EXT. FITZGERALD BUNGALOW'S REAR - MEANWHILE;/NIGHT


          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15. 1996 95
          One BOY in a skeleton costume creeps along the shrubs toward
          the Fitzgerald sisters' bedroom window. He stumbles over a
          demon, a Frankenstein and a mummy. They curse one another.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

          OFF-SCREEN, from the rec room part noise grows as things get
          under way outside.
          Ginger waves good-bye to Jason as she undoes Frank's shirt
          buttons. The bathroom door is now inching open a crack.

          INT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - NIGHT

          On the counter at the sink, all evidence of Brigitte's
          project with the monkshood are gone.
          Brigitte peers out the cracked door and then looks away,
          fighting an urge to watch in spite of being grossed out. The
          sounds of sex drift in from the bedroom.
          She catches sight of herself in the mirror. As a ZOMBIE. She
          tugs her shirt tight over her breasts. Nothing to see.
          She smoothes her shirt with her hands, then moves her palms
          down over her waist, her hips. Over her crotch. Brigitte's
          fingers skip under her skirt.
          Brigitte's face tells us she's searching for something under
          there. She's trying this out. But nothing's happening.
          She frowns. She draws her hands out of her skirt and quickly
          washes her hands in the sink. She checks her watch and sighs.

          INT. GIRLS BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Brigitte creeps out of the bathroom on all fours. Above her,
          Ginger's feet and some guy's writhe on the bed.
          Brigitte reaches up to the bedroom door knob. She opens it
          and crawls out.

          INT. FITZGERALD BASEMENT PROPER - NIGHT

          The rec room is packed with over-grown ghouls. Pamela is
          trying to play it cool from her perch behind the punch bowl,
          as she marvels at the costumes and all these kids she's never
          even. met before.

          

          

          

          

           96
          Henry has a group of boys cornered with a college football
          story.
          Brigitte leans against the wall watching the party and
          looking at her watch.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          In English I heard about this
          chick who used a man's name to
          get her books read. She went by
          George but she was really Mary
          Ann? Goes, "It's never too late
          to be what you might have been."
          I was jus' there thinkin', is
          that true? Was it too late to be
          an unsolved Mystery? Alls I had
          to do was walk away...

          MALE VOICE (O/S)
          Brigitte F.!
          Brigitte looks up to see a cheap plastic Frankenstein mask
          looking down at her. Its owner flips it up: it's Sam.
          Brigitte's eyes snap wide open in shock.

          SAM
          They let me go. No evidence:
          someone called in this tip.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          So I decided to stay.

          BRIGITTE
          Hey, you gotta get outta here -/
          Ginger emerges from the bedroom like a reigning diva, and the
          room stops dead.
          Brigitte drops her glass of punch.
          Ginger has come out as herself, as an almost full-blown
          werewolf. She wears a Lill Red Riding Hood cape jobbie and a
          plastic mask. She's the best looking monster you ever laid
          eyes on. Down her belly she has six perfect nipples showing
          and everything.
          The room bursts into a_cheerinq round of applause.

          GUS.' WITH 'AX IN THE HEAD'
          That make-up is amazing!

          (to Pamela)
          Told you. She's a arts-type,
          for chrissakes, look at that.

          PAMELA
          She's very good, isn't she?

          SAM
          (to Brigitte)
          Wow, yer sister's gone to town.

          BRIGITTE
          Yeah, she's gone all right. Hey.
          can you do me a favor?

          SAM
          Sure.

          BRIGITTE
          Can you give somethin' to Ginger
          for me? Jus' - we're Navin' a
          fight, but I got this thing for
          her.

          SAM
          Yeah, what.
          Brigitte shows him what appears to be a joint. Sam takes it.

          BR IG ITTE
          Don't tell her I gave it to you.
          Jus' act like it's from you. She
          won't take it if it's from me.

          SAM
          Oh, okay.

          BR IG ITTE
          An, don't like, go any wheres
          with her. Okay? Jus' come right
          back, 'kay?

          SAM
          Gonna miss me Bee F.?
          Brigitte smiles, embarrassed and freaking at the exact same
          time.

          SAM
          Be right back.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15. 1996 98
          Across the densely crowded room, Sam whispers in Ginger's
          ear. Ginger smiles and nods and palms something he passes
          her.
          Ginger glances at Brigitte, who tries to pretend she's not
          watching. when Brigitte checks again, Ginger is leading Sam
          by the hand toward her bedroom. Sam looks over his shoulder
          and lifts a finger - one second - back at Brigitte.
          The bedroom door shuts behind them. Brigitte leaps toward
          the bedroom. Someone catches her arm and holds her back.

          PAMELA
          one minute young lady, I could
          use a little help here.

          BR I G ITTE
          Let go of me, I have to get
          Ginger!

          PAMELA
          I have to get two more veggie
          trays down those stairs. I
          think your sister' 11 be fine for
          two minutes.
          Pamela is already marching Brigitte up the stairs. Brigitte
          strains to get back. Looking between her mother and her
          closed bedroom door, desperately.

          INT. FITZGERALD BASEMENT PROPER - MINUTES LATER

          Pamela snags Brigitte again as Brigitte dumps the veggie tray
          and tries to get to the bedroom.

          PAMELA
          All these boys came to see you
          two, least you can do is stop
          hiding in your room. Honestly,
          you act like someone'd forced
          this party down your throat.
          Now go be nice.
          Pamela stands between Brigitte and the bedroom door, her arms
          folded.

          BRIGITTE
          Mother. You don't understand.

          PAMELA
          Yes--I do. I was shy too at your
          age. Mingle.

          

          

          

          

           99
          Brigitte backs away with such a dirty look on her face. She
          turns to confront the eager painted faces around her - all
          desperate for some female attention. Brigitte has I want to
          scream written all over her face.

          INT. GIRLS BEDROOM - MEANWHILE/NIGHT

          Sam pushes Ginger away from him. Ginger has Brigitte's gift
          joint smoldering between her finger tips. Ginger is pretty
          out of it, she totters.

          SAM
          okay, cut it out now.

          GINGER
          This dope's fucked. Makin' me
          blaarrggh. C'mon. I'll do ya.

          SAM
          No thanks. Told yer sister I'd
          be right back.

          GINGER
          What's up your ass?!

          SAM
          Don't get mean, s'nothin'
          personal. I happen to think
          Brigitte's pretty cool. and -/

          GINGER
          Leave my baby sister alone. Do
          me, don't hurt her.

          SAM
          I won't hurt her. Now be a good
          girl and finish up your joint.

          GINGER
          oh. Well fuck you.
          Ginger takes a big toke as she paces between Sam and the
          door. Suddenly she's coughing uncontrollably, rubbing her
          eyes, wailing in pain.

          GINGER
          Burning! What is this?!
          Sam makes a move toward her and Ginger blindly lashes out at
          him. Ginger hurls Sam into the bed. Sam's flight path knocks
          the mattress askew: dozens and dozens of dog collars pour
          out over him. Sam fingers one in particular.

          INT. BASEMENT PROPER - NIGHT

          Brigitte sits on the stairs to the main floor cornered by a
          guy dressed as a cow.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Something was definitely fucked.
          Brigitte eyes Pamela, who is slowly being distracted by horny
          young men who will now dance with anybody, even Pamela.

          COW GUY
          Do you think this is a faggy
          costume for a guy? You can just
          say. I dunno I been gettin'
          funny looks. What, like we
          aren't advanced enough that a
          guy can show up completely in
          the spirit of the thing with an
          udder, an' not get treated like
          a freakin' fruit?
          Brigitte looks at her watch. Pamela is dragged off into the
          throng by a band of juveniles singing Do The Hustle. Brigitte
          makes her move at last.

          COW GUY
          snob.
          Brigitte makes a badly-faked would-be casual bee-line for
          their bedroom door.
          Brigitte wiggles the knob. It's locked.

          TNT GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
          Brigitte (still a zombie) unlocks the door and peers in. The
          light is on in the bathroom, the door is ajar. The shower is
          running. There are a few candles burning in corners.
          otherwise the room is dark.
          Brigitte steps inside, closing the door on the party behind
          her. She grabs a flashlight and turns it on.
          The walls are splattered with blood.
          There is gore on the floor. Brigitte plucks the monkshead
          joint from a pool of bloody goo - it is soaked. Useless.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 22, 1996 101
          On the bed, Sam lays with his shirt off and his fly open.
          His face is mutilated. He's missing an eye.
          Brigitte creeps toward him.
          Sam groans. Brigitte leaps back. she tries to speak, but her
          voice isn't working. Her face transforms from horror to fury.
          Then she heads to bathroom door.

          TNT. ATTACHED BATH - NIGHT

          BRIGITTE
          You bitch!
          Brigitte discovers Ginger sitting in the tub floor under the
          running shower, weeping. Her eyes are swollen. Ginger is now
          covered in coarse hair. The water around her is full of
          blood. There is a kitchen knife next to her. Ginger's stoned
          numb on the monkshood dose. She's groggy and weak.

          BR IG ITTE
          oh fuck !
          Ginger is squeezing her now full tail at its base, where the
          blood is oozing between her f..inger.s. Ginger has tried - and
          tailed - to euL her tail off.

          BRIGITTE
          Oh no. Oh no. Fuck, fuck!
          Ginger doesn't move. Ginger looks so pathetic, it's heart-
          breaking. Brigitte snatches the knife away and shuts off the
          water.

          GINGER
          Nobody'll want me now any ways.
          Sc.
          Brigitte takes in the cut, the rest of the monstrosity her
          sister has become.

          GINGER
          I don't wanna do this any more.
          Brigitte yanks Ginger out of the tub and grabs a towel,
          frantic.

          BRIGITTE
          Press this on the cut! Ginger!
          Move, c'mon!

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 22, 1996 1 02
          Ginger does as she's told. Brigitte digs out gauze and tape
          packages. They're both almost empty - they've used it all up.
          Brigitte throws them on the floor.

          GINGER
          I missed you Bee. I'm sorry.
          Brigitte searches Ginger's face.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginge'? That you in there?
          Ginger cracks an uncertain, pained smile. Brigitte does too,
          an exact replica, in fact.

          GINGER
          Ya feeb.
          Brigitte gently turns Ginger around to try and deal with her
          tail. Ginger is woozy and weak from blood loss.

          BRIGITTE
          okay. I can't clean this one up.
          We have to go. Like Go, go. Can
          you do it?

          GINGER
          I'm so woozy.
          Brigitte glances out into the bedroom.

          BRIGITTE
          Um. Ever bite something you
          din't kill?

          GINGER
          No.
          (misinterpreting the
          question - hopeful)
          Wanna be one with me?

          BRIGITTE
          Ah. No. Sam? Isn't dead.

          GINGER
          Oooh nooo.

          BRIGITTE
          Don't worry. Keep pressing.
          T'll be right back.

           1 03
          Sam is fingering his wounds, half-conscious, drooling bile
          and blood. Brigitte (still a zombie) looms up behind him
          with her baseball bat. She fishes in his pants' pocket and
          withdraws a set of keys.

          BRIGITTE
          Hey. Sorry. I really did think
          you were. Like. Not bad. So you
          know, whatever. Any ways. I'm
          really sorry - I have to.
          Sam moans as his good eye rolls up at her. Brigitte blinks
          away tears and looks away, collecting herself.
          Brigitte raises the bat over her head and swings it down as

          INT. FITZGERALD BASEMENT PROPER - MINUTES LATER

          The party is rocking along. Pamela knocks on their door.

          PAMELA
          Girls? You in there? You're
          not being very sociable...
          There's no answer. She tries the knob, and is surprised to
          find it unlocked. She opens the door. She turns on the
          lights.
          Pamela takes in the bloody muck everywhere. The room is
          deserted. No Sam. No sisters Fitzgerald. Just gore.
          Pamela swoons and drops like a deadweight to the floor.
          Henry rushes up, looking in over his wife's body. The boys in
          costume crowd in behind him.

          HENRY
          Pamela, honey, it's just a
          prank, you know how they...
          (he fingers some

          GORE)
          Holy mother of - it's warm.
          Where are my kids?!!

          GUY WITH AX IN THE HEAD
          Ginger went in here with Sam
          McDonald a while back.

          HENRY
          Sam McDonald?

          

          

          

          

           104

          GUY WITH EYE MISSING
          Yeah, you know. The guy they
          thought was the Beast, but they
          let 'im go.
          Henry steps into the room. He spots a bloody trail up to the
          open ground-level window.

          EXT FITZGERALD HOME - NIGHT
          Tires squeal in the street and the county regreening truck
          lurches out of its parking spot.

          INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

          Brigitte (still a zombie) throws the truck into gear with an
          amateur's hand. Her Adidas bag and her jar of two dollar
          bills is on the seat next to her.
          Ginger is just seen through the grate between the cab and the
          dark back of the truck.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Plans, plans arc good. 'Course I
          hardly had one. Adrenaline
          though, adrenaline is pretty
          speedy shit.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger?! Don't eat the body
          okay? I got this idea, an'
          we'll need Sam.
          Brigitte floors it and the truck blasts down their cul du sac
          to the main road.

          EXT. STREETS/TRAVELING - NIGHT

          The truck speeds down the street a tad erratical ly. Sirens
          rise around it.

          INT. THE TRUCK - NIGHT

          Brigitte slows, looking left, right and in the side mirrors
          trying to see where the sirens are coming from.

          BRIGITTE
          Fuck, fuck fuck, FUCK.

          

          

          

          

           105
          Then suddenly, four cop cars blast past them in the opposite
          direction. Heading back to the Fitzgerald house.

          BRIGITTE
          Ha! All rightie then.
          Brigitte drives on.
          What she cannot see behind her in the grate are the glimpses
          of Ginger in the flickering lights of the passing street
          lamps. Her final spurt of transformation is taking place:
          FLASH! Her face is filling in with fur.
          FLASH! Her eyes glow golden, yellow, wolfen.
          FLASH! Her face pulls into a wet snout.
          FLASH! A long pink tongue lolls out between glistening white
          fangs.

          EXT. THE HILLCREST - NIGHT

          The truck rolls to the crest of the hill over Bailey Downs -
          the sight of the bush party. The moon is immense up here.
          You could almost touch it.

          INT. THE TRUCK - NIGHT

          Brigitte eases the truck to the edge of the hill. The lights
          of the homes below them creep into view.

          BRIGITTE
          okay, Ginger? They'll think that
          Sam took us from our room,
          right? 'Cause of his record an,
          the arrest, right? We're gonna
          make this look like he did, any
          ways. He got us, maybe killed
          us, took our bodies to do some
          unspeakable thingy. But then?
          Sam killed himself. You follow?
          Ginger doesn't answer.

          

          

          

          

           106

          BRIGITTE
          So boom, diversion. Meanwhile
          you an, me hit the highway. we
          can hitch, get you cleaned up.
          By the time the find out we
          weren't in Sam's clutches at
          all, we could be any wheres.
          Yeah? Whatcha think?
          Ginger doesn't answer.

          BRIGITTE
          It'll work. (I hope.)
          Brigitte puts the brake on but does not cut the engine.

          EXT. THE TRUCK/HILLCREST - NIGHT

          Brigitte climbs out of the cab. She moves to the back doors
          of the truck, and opens them. In the inky darkness inside,
          she hears heavy panting.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger? C'mon, we got move.
          Shove Sam down here.
          Brigitte climbs up into the truck, reaching for something on
          its floor. Brigitte f itids Sam's prone feet.
          An animal/Ginger launches out at her, knocking her back, out,
          clear of the truck. Ginger isn't Ginger any more - what we
          can glimpse in the darkness is an attack by a creature much
          like the one that bit Ginger. And it's attacking Brigitte.
          Brigitte flails, kicks and punches at it. She breaks free
          and clambers at the tool rack on the inside panel of the
          truck. She grabs a shovel as the creature comes snarling up
          at her.

          BRIGITTE
          Stop. I mean it.
          It lunges at her again and Brigitte clocks it. It slides,
          dazed, off the back of the truck to the ground.

          JUMP TO:
          Brigitte drags Sam's body into the front seat. She sets her
          Adidas bag on the gas pedal. She releases the brake.
          The truck rolls forward. off the top of the hill. Brigitte
          watches as it crashes down, down, rolling and twisting into
          the suburb below. It lands in a heap and bursts into flames.

          

          

          

          

           107

          BRIGITTE
          Nice one.
          Brigitte returns to where It/Ginger was last seen on the
          ground. The shovel and blanket are there. A bloody pool
          trails off into the woods. Brigitte hefts the shovel warily,
          shoulders the blanket, and follows the wetness shining in the
          moonlight.

          INT. TREES/HILLCREST - NIGHT


          BRIGITTE
          Fuck Ginger. Leave a fuckin'
          trail much? Could leave
          everybody a fuckin' map...
          Tense seconds pass as she searches through the scrub and
          trees, shovel ready. we can hear panting and growling.

          BRIGITTE
          I won't hurt you if you don't
          hurt me. 'Kay? Ginge'? 'Kay?
          Brigitte spots something ahead and lowers the shovel as she
          approaches it.
          It/Ginger cowers in the brush, collapsed. Her head and tail
          are bleeding. Brigitte drops to her knees nest to her
          sister, frantic with grief.

          BRIGITTE
          Oh no. Ginger. I didn't mean

          TO
          It/Ginger is gasping, fading. Her eyes start rolling back in
          her head. Brigitte's hand is shaking as it reaches out but
          can't touch her. Ginger licks Brigitte's fingers, slowly.
          Brigitte buries her face in Ginger's ruff, moaning.

          BRIGITTE
          You can't, you can't, we're out.
          You can't, don't don't do this
          to me. Not now. Look, look it's
          all taken care of. we're
          Unsolved Mysteries!

          EXT. A HIGHWAY - PRE-DAWN

          The sunrise has the sky this bloody red.

          

          

          

          

           108
          Brigitte drags Ginger a few feet past a sign next to the
          road: THANK YOU FOR VISITING BAILEY DOWNS!

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          We made it out. There was this
          road? An' the space between
          here and where ever. I did it.
          Brigitte opens the blanket. Ginger has returned to human
          form. Because Ginger is dead.

          EXT. A HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING

          In a small grove of trees, Brigitte pushes the last pile of
          dirt over Ginger's shallow grave.
          Brigitte wipes her caked hands off in the dewy grass. Beneath
          the dirt and dried blood, she finds puncture wounds. BITES.
          Brigitte looks TO CAMERA. She rolls her eyes wearily.
          Brigitte stands and heads to the side of the road. A semi
          appears on the horizon, coming her way. Brigitte lifts her
          thumb.
          The semi's turn indicator comes on as it slows and veers to
          arrive before her.
          ROLL TAIL CREDITS as:
          Excerpts from an episode of the television program UNSOLVED
          MYSTERIES roll. It tells the story of the mysterious
          disappearance of two teenage girls - sisters - who
          disappeared under strange circumstances in the normally quiet
          suburb of Bailey Downs.
          Brigitte and Ginger LOOK-A-LIKES re-enact the summarized
          events of their flight from justice. The cops figured out
          their faked deaths, of course.. Henry and Pamela have
          reportedly denied comment. It is seen from the community's
          perspective as two delusional young women gone totally wrong,
          a grotesque tragedy of youth wasted by mental illness. No one
          can explain though the non-human blood trails leaving the
          scene of their last crime...
          At the segment's close and the credits roll. out, we see the
          traditional high school photos of Brigitte and Ginger.

The Woodward Forensic Institute (WFI) is a 175-bed Intermediate
Security treatment facility for male and female psychiatric
patients. Its primary clientele are those who have histories
of committing criminal offenses and are either committed to the

OPENING CREDITS OVER QUICK CUTS:


INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM - DAWN




PUSH in on a sleeping couple in the dark. The ALARM
CLOCK reads 5:59 AM. The woman's eyes open a second
before the alarm beeps and turns it off. She grabs a
glass of water on her bedside table and drinks it.
Climbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs
(wedding, vacation, etc.). This is MIRANDA GREY: 30,
sharp and prettier than she knows.




INT. GYM SWIMMING POOL - MORNING

Miranda slides through the water. Swimming cap on,
goggles. Her STEADY BREATHING takes us in and out of the
water. Something unsettling about this sound. Something
slightly unsettling too about her detached manner. A
person on autopilot, recognizing only the water and the
perfectly aligned lap stripes leading her path. Like
graphic metaphors for her own conscience: flat. She
emerges from the pool and self-consciously wraps herself
in a towel.




INT. COFFEEHOUSE - MORNING

Miranda pays for a pair of coffees and a newspaper.




INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Miranda's husband DOUGLAS GREY (older, a superficial
analysis would suggest a father figure) serves breakfast.
Miranda smiles thank you and goes back to studying a case
file. He sips from his takeout coffee and reads the
newspaper. A pleasant domestic scene. It's 8:00 AM.




EXT. ST. ANNE'S HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING

Miranda's Volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps.
Doug kisses his wife and hops out. Exemplary carpoolers.
Students are already chatting him up as Miranda drives
off.




EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ON A SURVEILLANCE MONITOR

Miranda's car at some sort of guard gate. A BUZZER lets
her in. As the car drives past we read the plate on the
wall:

INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - MIRANDA'S OFFICE - EVENING

Stark walls. Simple decor. Bookshelves packed with the
according psychiatric tomes and diplomas. Miranda faces
a troubled young mess of a woman, CHLOE: charismatic,
deranged and forever trying to provoke. Mid-session:

                           MIRANDA

             This is your stepfather who came
             to visit you?

                           CHLOE

             My stepfather?  No.   He's dead.
                     (beat)
             I killed him.
Miranda tries not to act surprised at this breakthrough.
Responds with the even keel of a trained psychiatrist.

                           MIRANDA

             That's the first time you admit
             it.

                          CHLOE

             So? There's a first time for
             everything.

                           MIRANDA

                     (jotting this down)
             It means you're finally past the
             denial stage. This is good,
             Chloe.

                           CHLOE

             I never killed anyone who didn't
             deserve it.

                            MIRANDA

             You only killed your stepfather as
             far as I know.

                           CHLOE

             I should've taken care of my
             mother. She knew all along.    You
             remind me of her.

             I remind you of your mother?

                           CHLOE

             Always so put together. Like you
             iron your underwear. Like your
             pussy is the apricot of the
             Promised Land and the bread of
             the --

                           MIRANDA

                     (getting her back
                     on track)
             Let's get back to your visitor
             last night.

                           CHLOE

             The Devil.

                           MIRANDA

             Alright, the Devil. Why would the
             Devil visit you? It's already
             hell in here, what would he have
             to gain?

                           CHLOE

             He came to fuck an angel.
                     (giggles at that)
             I'm his dirty angel.
Before Miranda can analyze that one, the room LIGHTS FLICKER
AND DIE. Darkness. Miranda's breathing speeds up.

                           CHLOE

             He grabbed me by the hair while I
             sucked him and usually I love
             that, I just do -- maybe you can
             tell me why I love it so much --
             but not this time, he was just too
             rough --
As suddenly as it went out, now the POWER RETURNS.      A
visibly uncomfortable Miranda checks the clock.

                           MIRANDA

             That's it until Monday. Try and
             get some sleep tonight, okay?

                           CHLOE

             Sure, Doctor.
                     (leans in)
             Crazy people hear messages from
             God. Not the Devil. You know
             that, right?

                           MIRANDA

             I didn't say you were crazy.

                           CHLOE

             You don't have to say it.
She almost doesn't seem crazy when she says this.
Almost. TWO ORDERLIES appear at the door. Miranda nods
for them to escort Chloe. Chloe shakes their hands away
from her, strides off dramatically. The princess of the
asylum.




INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER

Miranda locks her office, armed with paperwork. The end
of another workweek. DR. PETE GRAHAM, a good ten years
older and Miranda's best friend on the job, approaches.

                           PETE

             Dr. Grey.

                           MIRANDA

             Dr. Graham.
They walk along with the easy confidence of colleagues
who not only respect each other, but enjoy each other.      A
lot.

                           PETE

             Power went out again in our wing.

                           MIRANDA

                     (knows what's coming)
             Same here.

                           PETE

             It's not shrink-appropriate to be
             afraid of the dark, you know?

                           MIRANDA

             You're not shrink appropriate and
             you're about to get promoted.
             Everybody's afraid of something.

                           PETE

             What am I afraid of?

                           MIRANDA

             Yourself. At least you should be.
             What are you up to this weekend?

                                              (CONTINUED)

             events, drink myself to sleep --
             the usual. You?

                           MIRANDA

             Doug wants to look at some Real
             Estate up at Willow's Creek.

                           PETE

             Again?

                           MIRANDA

             He thinks it's fun.

                           PETE

             So is golfing, I'm told.   Who was
             your six o'clock?

                           MIRANDA

             Chloe McGrath -- talk about trying
             to empty the ocean with a tea cup.
             She's a mess.

                           PETE

             I hear Manhattan's full of them.

                           MIRANDA

             Don't start with that. I already
             turned down the job. We're
             staying.

                           PETE

             Good girl.
They have reached an office marked "DR. PHILLIP PARSONS
DIRECTOR" and peer in to see Parsons (50's,
distinguished, commands respect from everyone) on the
phone. He gestures for Pete to sit. Miranda is about to
exit when he covers the mouthpiece --

                           PARSONS

             Miranda, my wife keeps wanting to
             set that dinner with you and Doug.
             Are you free tonight?

                           MIRANDA

             He's stuck at a school board
             meeting.
Parsons looks through his appointment book.

                           MIRANDA

             Next Wednesday it is, Phil.
He nods at her with a smile and returns to his phone
call.




EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT

Miranda drives off, leaving the majestic grounds behind.
A GUARD waves her off.




END OPENING CREDITS.





EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Miranda slows down at the sight of colored lights up
ahead. A knocked-down telephone post blocks the road.
EMERGENCY VEHICLES at the scene. A patrolman waves her
down.




INT. MIRANDA'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

SHERIFF RYAN, 40'S, recognizes her and ambles over.

                           MIRANDA

             Anybody hurt, Sheriff?

                            SHERIFF RYAN

             Nah, telephone post just decided
             to fall. It'll take us a while to
             clear this up so I'm afraid you're
             gonna have to take the long way
             home, Miranda.

                           MIRANDA

             If you say so.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             And tell your husband he owes me a
             phone call.

                           MIRANDA

             Will do. Wouldn't want him in
             trouble with the authorities.

He taps on her hood and heads back to the site.      She
shifts into reverse and makes a U-turn.




EXT. OLD MAIN ROAD - NIGHT

Miranda drives down the curvy road toward an old bridge.
Something definitely creepy about this deserted place --







INT. MIRANDA'S CAR - MOVING

Miranda dials a number on her cell phone, gets the
machine.

                           MIRANDA

             Hi, it's me. Are you there? Pick
             up, pick up. I'm on my way but I
             just got detoured so I'm...
A bump on the road makes her drop the phone on the
passenger seat. She reaches for it and when she looks up
we see:




POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

A TEENAGE GIRL stands smack in front of us.      Naked.
About to get pummelled by us.




BACK TO SCENE

Miranda swerves to avoid her and slams into the railing.
METAL SCREECHES as she struggles to regain control of the
car and finally BRAKES TO A HALT --
She looks in her rearview mirror: the girl is standing
back there. Drunk or high or in any case completely out
of it.

                           MIRANDA

                     (into phone)
             Stay on the line. Don't go
             anywhere. The weirdest thing
             just --

She stares at the dead phone.      Punches the buttons on it.
No go.

                           MIRANDA

             Wonderful.
She tosses the phone on the seat and hops out of the car.




EXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT

Miranda cautiously approaches the girl, who is now not
moving. Just standing there. Her back to us.

                            MIRANDA

             Hello?   Are you hurt?   Hello?
Nothing.     As we get closer we see she is covered in
bruises.     Clearly something horrible has happened to her.

                            MIRANDA

             Were you in an accident? Were you
             attacked? It's okay, I'm a doctor.
                     (beat)
             My name is Miranda Grey...
And now she turns. Young, seventeen tops. Busted lip,
black eye. Miranda pulls off her coat, wraps it around
the girl --

                           MIRANDA

             You're in shock right now, that's
             perfectly natural. I'm going to
             get you to the hospital. Okay?
The girl suddenly grips Miranda's arm.         Hard.

                           MIRANDA

             Don't be scared. It's going to be
             fine.
Now the girl is touching Miranda's face. Her movements
desperate, smothering. Like the movements of a drowning
person. Miranda tries to push the girl's hands back down.

                           MIRANDA

             Hands off me, okay? Tell me your
             name, do you remember your name?
The girl tries to speak but no words come out. Instead
she produces a strained, wettish sound. Creepy as hell.
And now she is prying Miranda's mouth open and she's much
stronger than expected and Miranda is panicking --

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                              9.

             What are you doing? I'm trying to
             help you --?!



The girl opens her own mouth wide like a snake. And as
Miranda muffles a scream, blood starts leaking out of the
girl's eye sockets and from wounds all over her body.

                                            SLAM CUT TO:





INT. BEDROOM - DAWN

Miranda wakes up in a cold sweat.         Just a bad dream.    A
beat.
FAINT at first but GROWING LOUDER, we hear a REPETITIVE
SOUND outside. Like an ECHO of some sort, but vaguely
familiar: THWIP, THWIP, THWIP.
Miranda takes a deep breath, reaches for the glass of
water on her bedside table. Except... it's not there.
She turns to her husband but he's not in the bed. And
now she glances around the room and realizes this is not
her bedroom.
She climbs off the bed and walks in the dark. Trips over
something. A TRAY that CLANGS LOUDLY. Her heartbeat
goes haywire. She feels her way along the wall to a
small opening in the door. A glass pane.
She peers through the glass at the empty corridor
outside, realizing what this must mean, realizing she's
inside a cell.
She jiggles the handle and pounds on the door, frantic --

                            MIRANDA

             Hello?   Somebody help me!







EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

CAMERA SOARS through the tall iron gates, past the guard.
Now we spot the source of our continuing THWIP THWIP
sound: sprinklers watering the impressively-kept gardens.
The expansive complex is more Victorian campus than drab
prison, with separate wings (male and female), research
units, libraries, gym and volunteer outpatient center.




                                                    10.





INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS




A bored group of female patients listen to a social
worker lecturing them. A janitor mops a long corridor.
Patients study at the library under the watchful eye of
orderlies.



A doctor and two orderlies hold down a patient having an
epileptic fit (we'll soon know her as SHELLEY). They
force a biting block in her mouth to avoid her swallowing
her tongue, prepare a syringe.

INT. FEMALE WING STAIRS

Pete rushes up two steps at a time, passing by a NURSE
WITH A CART OF MEDS, who nods respectfully as he goes --







INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIRANDA'S CELL

An ORDERLY unlocks the door for Pete. Through the glass
pane he can see a visibly upset Miranda arguing with the
head nurse: a tough as nails woman in her 50's: IRENE.

                        ORDERLY #1

          Sleeping beauty is awake.
Peter forces a smile, enters --




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL


                        MIRANDA

          Peter, what the hell is going on?
Pete nods at Irene: it's okay, he'll take it from here.

                        PETE

          How do you feel?

                        MIRANDA

          How do you think I feel?    Is this
          a joke?
Peter is half-listening to her, half-signaling to the
nurse with the meds to come in. Miranda catches all of
this, growing more agitated. She wears the uniform all
patients wear: a white T-shirt and sweats. Her wedding
ring is gone.

             Giving you something to calm down.

             I don't need to calm down.   What I
             need is an explanation
Pete grabs the meds from the nurse. Irene and the
attendant step closer to help. Miranda feels them
closing in on her. Peter's tone is infuriatingly gentle:

                           PETE

             Just take this and we can sit down
             and chat.

                           MIRANDA

             Why here, why not in my office?
She looks at the silent faces around her. No sympathy.
Or maybe too much sympathy. Either way it's unnerving.

                           MIRANDA

             I don't want an anticonvulsant, at
             least give me Valium.

                           PETE

                     (nods at nurse)
             Fifty milligrams.

                           MIRANDA

             Jesus Christ, you're gonna knock
             me out? Ten milligrams.

                             PETE

                       (final offer)
             Twenty.
The nurse complies. Miranda stares at the meds, trying
desperately to put this into some kind of perspective.

                           MIRANDA

             How would you feel if you woke up
             in a goddamn cell, dressed like this?

                           PETE

             We can discuss it at length after
             you take your meds.
Awkward nods from Irene, the nurse and the attendant.
Pete holds Miranda's gaze. Miranda takes her meds.

                             MIRANDA

             Okay.    This better be good.
Pete motions for the others to leave them alone.         One by
one they file out and lock the door behind them.




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - LATER

Miranda paces.       Alone with Pete, she is even more upset.

                           PETE

             Miranda, this is very awkward.
             Technically I shouldn't even be
             treating you but the court has
             granted us a waiver until you're
             transferred. So whatever is said
             here won't leave this room. I
             won't tell Parsons, I won't tell
             anyone.

                           MIRANDA

             I want to talk to my husband.

                           PETE

             You can't to that. Sit down,
             please. Try to relax.

                           MIRANDA

             Why would I pretend to be in any
             way relaxed?

                           PETE

             I understand you're upset. But we
             need to put some things in order.

                           MIRANDA

             Two massive understatements.
He hesitates, unsure where to begin.

                           PETE

             How long have you been here?

                           MIRANDA

                     (laughs)
             What is this? Why are you doing
             this to me?

                           PETE

             Just answer the question.    Humor
             me.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                           MIRANDA

             Hi, my name is Miranda Grey. I'm a
             psychiatrist. I transferred here to
             the Woodward Forensic Institute a
             little over a year ago. My job
             entails dealing with a ward of
             schizophrenic women between the
             ages of eighteen and fifty-fife --

                           PETE

             I don't mean how long you've
             worked here, I mean how long
             you've been staying here.
This stops her. Wanting desperately to whip out a
comeback but realizing she doesn't know the answer.

                           MIRANDA

             I'm a doctor, yes? Or was medical
             school just an elaborate dream?

                           PETE

             Of course you're a doctor. A
             great doctor in fact.
The hint of sadness in his voice alarms her.

                           MIRANDA

             Pete, how long have I been here?

                          PETE

             Five days.

                           MIRANDA

                     (barely audible)
             What?

                           PETE

             You were admitted to the
             neurosurgical unit seizing
             violently. That lasted three
             days. Scans revealed left-sided
             weakness, numbness and severe
             fontal lobe deficits.
Miranda shakes her head in disbelief, but we --




FLASHBACK - INT. NEUROSURGICAL UNIT

Miranda seizing violently FROM HER POV: Doctors
struggling to contain her. Arms thrashing, legs.
FLASHES of the wall, the floor. Head crashing against a
cart, out of control.

             negative for PCP, underwent
             extensive hypnosis and received
             amytal injections.
FLASH: Miranda being tied down.      A nurse with a
syringe --




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)

She looks down at her wrists with the reddish marks.

                            PETE

             You were tied down for a day and a
             half so you wouldn't hurt yourself
             and then you went into a state of,
             well --
                     (how to put this?)
             You've been pretty much catatonic.
                     (beat)
             This is the first time you speak.
Miranda, speechless.     Reality sinking in.

                            MIRANDA

             Doug must be worried sick.   I need
             to call him --
Pete shakes his head emphatically.

                           PETE

             You're the most logical person I
             know, bar none. Plus you have a
             photographic memory -- unconfirmed,
             but you do remember events and
             phrases more accurately than anyone
             around. Why am I telling you this?

                           MIRANDA

             You're establishing my personality
             as fairly intellectual, you don't
             consider me impulsive or emotional.

                           PETE

             And that's a fair assessment, no?

                           MIRANDA

             Yes, that's fair. And following
             this pattern of analysis, we're
             about to discuss a traumatic event
             that rendered this psychological
             profile useless, correct?

                           PETE

             Two hundred percent.
A pause here. He's waiting for her to continue. She's
not used to being on the other side of the therapist's
table.

                           MIRANDA

             You think I'm in denial. That I'm
             putting on a brave show -- that
             this is a 'cover' for some
             unbearable emotion I'm hiding.
             Why?

                           PETE

             Don't analyze yourself, just focus
             on remembering.

                           MIRANDA

             I remember Friday night after
             work, if you say that was five
             days ago --
                     (pushing on)
             Anyway, I asked you what you were
             doing for the weekend and you said
             the usual and you made a joke
             about writing country songs and
             drinking yourself to sleep and I
             told you I was going to look at
             some real estate in Willows Creek
             with Doug.

                           PETE

             And then what?

                           MIRANDA

             Then I drove home.

                           PETE

             And then what?

                           MIRANDA

             I got home, I guess, and had
             dinner by myself because --
                     (pauses, struggling)
             Because Doug had an alumni meeting
             at his school and he was going to
             get a ride back. He's the
             principal now, as you well know.
She stops here. Pete waits. The silence is deafening.
She pushes on, but her hands shake a little.

                           MIRANDA

             But wait -- there was an accident
             before that, wasn't there? A girl
             -- she had been beaten. I took
             her to the hospital, right?

                           PETE

             There was indeed an accident, you
             were detoured by the cops. But
             there's no report of any girl.

                           MIRANDA

             No, the cops weren't there. They
             were back on Main Road. A
             knocked-down telephone post,
             correct?
Pete nods.     Miranda is all foggy on the details:

                           MIRANDA

             I saw the girl after that.   She
             was bleeding.

          What's the last memory you have of
          him that night?

          My last -- ?
                  (frowns)
          Tell me nothing happened to Doug.

                        PETE

          Let's backtrack a second. You left
          your office, you were driving home,
          you got detoured by the police --
          Did you call someone on the phone
          that night?

                          MIRANDA

          I don't know.    I might have.

                        PETE

          Who would you call?

                        MIRANDA

          I might have called Doug to tell
          him something. Or checked my
          answering service.

                        PETE

          Were you seeing someone else that
          night?

                        MIRANDA

          I beg your pardon?

                        PETE

          There was some trouble in your

             marriage, I don't know what --
                     (stops herself)
             There is no trouble in my

             tense; why?
His face says he doesn't know how to tell her.

             Did something happen to Doug?

                           PETE

             You don't remember anything else.
             Anything at all?
Frustrated, she snatches his cell phone and starts to
dial:

                           MIRANDA

             This is preposterous.    What's

             He's dead.
This stops her cold. Time stands eerily still. She
stares at Pete as if by looking at him long enough, he
will contradict his statement.

                           MIRANDA

             No, he's not. Don't tell me that.
             Don't tell me that.

             I'm positive.

             You killed him.

           You just need to sleep. It's

Off Pete's nod, a nurse injects the syringe into
Miranda's arm. They hold her down with great effort as

Graduation night. School principal Douglas Grey shakes
hands with proud parents and clumsily formal students.
Miranda grabs a drink from a nearby tray, bored.

           Is that number three?

           Yes, Mr. Principal. Special
           occasion -- I'm celebrating how
           proud I am of my husband tonight.
He smiles weakly at the compliment. Moves his hand
towards her, in an affectionate gesture (or so Miranda
thinks) but instead fixes her bra strap. Ever
methodical.

          this is a mistake.
First we hear our mystery man's voice, then we see him:
Pete. (Yes, the same person she kissed and went to the
movies with.) He places his hand on the door, blocking
her.

                        PETE

          Your marriage is the mistake and
          you know it.

                          MIRANDA

          Don't.

                        PETE

          I'm sorry. That was out of line.
          I feel like a school kid hiding
          from the Principal.

                        MIRANDA

          We are hiding from the Principal.
He smiles. Touches her face tenderly. Torn. A person
used to doing the right thing but not liking that at the
moment.

                         PETE

          I would just like to spend some
          time together.

                        MIRANDA

          We spend time together every day.

                        PETE

          I meant minus the schizophrenic
          women.

                          MIRANDA

          I have to go.    I need time to think.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                         21.





CONTINUED:




He nods.     Opens the door for her.     She starts to walk
away.

                           PETE

             Don't be too hard on yourself, Dr.
             Grey. You haven't done anything
             wrong.

                            MIRANDA

             Not yet.   But I want to.




EXT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - MORNING

PUSH INTO a quiet house on a quiet suburban street. Two
Volvos parked in the driveway. Perfectly-kept front lawn.

                                               CUT TO:








FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE

Another near-subliminal glimpse of Doug laying on the
floor covered with bloodstains. Bloodstained axe on
floor in f.g. Walls covered with bloodstains.




EXT. CHAPEL - DAY

Miranda and Doug laugh at their wedding. It's clearly
hot, because she wipes sweat off his brow with a
handkerchief.




INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick
streak of blood on it. She looks down at her hand,
noticing the blood -- and now we are back in --




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)

Miranda wakes up with a start. The darkness renders the
room almost void of any color. Monochromatic. It takes
her a moment to orient herself. Her eyes wander across
the unfamiliar room, feeling like she's being watched.
We become aware of a RAGGED BREATHING sound. Like
somebody is standing over her bed. But we don't see
anything. Miranda gingerly crosses to the door and peeks
through the glass partition into the empty corridor. She
glances back at the room, stills seeing nothing -- and
bangs on the door.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                        22.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             Can I get some assistance here?
             Hello?!



She waits.     Bangs on the door again.

                            MIRANDA

             Irene?!   Anybody!?
A beat. And now finally we hear FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING.
A light is switched on down the corridor.
The FOOTSTEPS get CLOSER... and CLOSER...
Miranda tries to appear composed. Wipes sweat off her
forehead. Fixes her hair. The FOOTSTEPS now STOP right
out side the door. A KEY goes into the lock and JIGGLES
it.
Miranda waits for the door to open but nothing happens.
Confused, she steps up to the glass partition and
peeks --
The second her face touches the glass, she is met by a
pair of piercing eyes. The eerie teenage girl. Miranda
jumps back, screams.
And when she looks up again, the image is gone.      A beat.
Rational thought kicking in --

                            MIRANDA

                     (to self)
             Wake up, wake up...
                     (beat)
             You're dreaming. It's not real.
             An anxiety dream, that's all.
             That's all. This is dream logic.
             If it was real, they would have
             heard you scream. There are
             twenty employees on the night
             shift. Fact. At least twenty.
She props herself with her back against the wall. With a
view of the whole cell. Just in case. Staring at the
door.

                           MIRANDA

             I'm just dreaming.
And now, FAINTLY at first, but GROWING LOUDER --
FOOTSTEPS can be heard APPROACHING outside. Just like
before.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         23.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm
             dreaming, I'm dreaming.



Like her life depends on that mantra. The FOOTSTEPS get
CLOSER. And her voice begins to falter --

                           MIRANDA

                     (voice rising)
             I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming --
And now the FOOTSTEPS pause outside her door like before
and she holds her breath, horrified, when suddenly we are
hit with the sudden glare of returning light.
EVERYTHING FLASHES WHITE and then COLOR RETURNS --

                           IRENE (O.S.)

             Rise and shine, ladies!




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY

Irene tries to shake Miranda awake.       An orderly and nurse
stand by.

                           IRENE

                     (shaking her)
             That means you, honey.   Up -- !
No reaction.

                           IRENE

             Rise and shine now.    Wake up.
She shakes her harder. And now Miranda's EYES SHOOT OPEN
and she grips Irene's arm. Hard. Like the teenage girl
did.

                           IRENE

             Easy now, it's okay.
Miranda stares at her, coming back to. Starts to speak
but has no voice. Clears her throat --

                           MIRANDA

             I need to see Peter Graham.

                           IRENE

             And you have a session scheduled
             this afternoon --

                           MIRANDA

             Right now.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        24.





CONTINUED:





                            IRENE

             He's not even in yet, now let go
             my arm, honey.




                           MIRANDA

             Doctor Grey, if you don't mind.

                           IRENE

             Actually I do mind. I start
             calling you 'doctor' and everybody
             else wants to be called 'doctor' --

                           MIRANDA

             Please. It's a bit different,
             wouldn't you say -- ?
Irene reaches out her hand and the nurse places a cup
with meds on it.

                           MIRANDA

             What do you think you're doing?    I
             want to speak to my lawyer --
             wait, what are you doing?

                           IRENE

             My job.
Irene shoves the meds into Miranda's mouth --

                           MIRANDA

             C'mon, Irene, don't do this. I'm
             calm now, look -- I'm calm -- !
She struggles as they hold her down and Irene sedates
her.




INT. REC ROOM - DAY

DRIFTING PAST the female patients at their usual activities.
Some watch TV, play dominoes, some pretend to read, some
stare out blankly. Here's Chloe at a table, engaged in
some sort of trivia game with a tattooed Southern redhead
named JENNA:

                           CHLOE


             M.


                           JENNA

             Mallorol, Matzine, Megaphen,
             Meallaril-S, Meleretten, Meleril,
             Mellaril, Mellaril-S, Mesoridazine,
             Methotrimaprazine, Mixidol, Moban
             Modalina --

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         25.





CONTINUED:





                            CHLOE

             Modalina?   Isn't that a band?

                           JENNA

             Trade name for Triflupoerazine.
             Look it up.
Chloe shrugs, if you say so.       Jenna resumes:

                           JENNA

             Moditen, Molindone, Moltipress,
             Motival. That's it for the 'M's.

                           CHLOE

             Not bad. High potency
             neuroleptics starting with 'J.'

                           JENNA

             Trick question. There's only
             Jatroneural.

                           CHLOE

             What do you wanna bet?

                           JENNA

             Bet you a soda.
Chloe checks a reference book.       Nods, impressed.

                           CHLOE

             Right on the money, cowgirl.
             Twenty points and a soda.
CAMERA FOLLOWS HER INTENT GAZE to another patient,
SHELLEY (the same patient we saw earlier mid-fit)
moseying across the room. Nervously takes a seat beside
Miranda.

                           SHELLEY

             Hi there, Doc.
It takes a moment for the heavily-drugged Miranda to
react. She looks up slowly: eyes glazed, painfully out
of it.

                           SHELLEY

             I never got shrinked by you but
             all I hear is nothing gets past
             you, I mean, that's just hearsay
             and I don't pay much attention to
             hearsay because now they say you
             hacked your husband with an axe
             but I say maybe it just slipped,
             right?

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        26.





CONTINUED:




Miranda notices Shelley is toying with a wrinkled
NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. Shelley catches this look and slides
it over to her. Without malice, like a child.




                           SHELLEY

             They put your picture in the
             paper.
It reads "SCHOOL PRINCIPAL SLAUGHTERED. WIFE UNDER
ARREST." Photos of Miranda, Douglas, their house.
Miranda stares at it in disbelief.      Growing sick.

                           MIRANDA

             How did you get this?

                           SHELLEY

             Chloe did. Who knows how? Not
             me. Around here I'm on a need to
             know basis about stuff and most
             stuff I don't need to know. My
             point is about people talking
             behind other people's backs. Like
             before I was here, everything I
             did I thought, 'this'll get them,'
             wanting their approval, wanting
             them to say good things behind my
             back. But now I'm more anonymous,
             more myself. I'm Shelley.
Miranda slides the clipping back to Shelley, clueless as
to how to get out of this conversation, but Shelley has
no problem holding a conversation all by herself --

                           SHELLEY

             You're not like, undercover here,
             are you? They pulled that at
             Spring Grove, had a bunch of
             doctors pretend they were
             patients, see if they could handle
             it. Most quit after day one.
             You're not, are you?

                            MIRANDA

             No, Shelley.   I'm not undercover.

                           SHELLEY

             Because if you were, I'm like the
             Fort Knox of secrets. Ask
             anybody.

                           MIRANDA

             That's good to know. But I'm not.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         27.





CONTINUED:





                           SHELLEY

             Say no more.
                     (sotto)
             I understand perfectly.



She hands Miranda paper and some crayons, whispers:

                           SHELLEY

             Drawing is a great cover.   Good
             luck to you.
With a wink, she's gone. Miranda looks at the room
around her: Chloe spying on her in the corner, Irene and
the nurse sharing a laugh, other patients ambling about,
arguing --
Life among the insane.




INT. LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA - DAY

Patients undress in the bare-bones locker area. An
uneasy Miranda is handed a bar of soap and towel by
Irene.

                           MIRANDA

             I don't -- I think I'm alright.

                            IRENE

             You go in last because you're
             special.
                      (off Miranda's look)
             It's not a Mexican prison, toots.
             Everybody here minds their own
             business.

                           MIRANDA

             If it's all the same, I'd
             rather --

                            IRENE

             State law says we keep you ladies
             clean. And I'm a stickler for the
             law.
                     (beat)
             Now come on. If you go downtown,
             you gotta dance.
Miranda studies the patients already under the spray of
the shower. Something vaguely concentration camp-like
about institutional bathing.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                    28.





CONTINUED:




The shower, like everything else in this place, is
regulated by shifts, so that various groupings of
patients each get their turn. Miranda feels Chloe's gaze
on her across the room. She is stripping off her clothes
for Miranda's benefit, gleefully mangling the last
refrain from the Stones' "START ME UP."

                           IRENE

                     (checking watch)
             That's five minutes, group one.
                     (to Chloe's group)
             Alright, ladies, nice and easy.
The first group of bathers file out, dripping wet past
Miranda, in all shapes and sizes. She registers their
many scars and tattoos, like maps of troubled souls:
names of men, places, religious quotes. Burn scars,
cuts, needle marks. They begin to towel off as Miranda,
slowly and painfully self-conscious, begins to undress in
the corner.
A moment later Irene nods for her to go in.




INT. COMMUNAL SHOWERS - LATER

Miranda hangs her head under the spray and closes her
eyes, trying to shut it all out.
The SOUNDS slowly FADE OUT until all we have is Miranda
and her RAGGED BREATHING. Chloe and Shelley, the last
two out from the previous group, grab towels.
Chloe winks at Miranda when she catches her staring, but
Miranda is not staring at her. She is staring past her
at the tile wall.
More specifically at a hole in the tile where a busted
water pipe pokes out. Clearly at some point there was a
handle there, but now it is just a hole with a busted
pipe.
PUSH INTO the hole to see a perfectly-formed globule of
blood emerge, following by a GURGLING sound which seems
to come from deep in the bowels of the plumbing system.
The blood lingers tentatively, as if unfamiliar with the
laws of gravity, before tracing an upward line along the
tile. The GURGLING GROWS LOUDER, CLOSER, and now more
blood flows from the hole and spreads up the wall.
Miranda looks away, disturbed, and now realizes she is
the only one left in the showers. Panic. Shuts her
eyes.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                         29.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

                     (to self)
             It isn't real. It isn't real.



Opens her eyes.
Five letters are written in blood.       N-O-T-A-L.
Shaking, nauseous, she looks down at her feet and the
drain, too scared to look back up.

                            MIRANDA

                     (to self)
             It isn't real. You're
             hallucinating.
Perhaps. But now blood drips by       her ankle, DRIP, DRIP,
DRIP. And the shooting pain she       feels is coming from her
arm. What the hell -- ? WE SEE        SHARP SLASHES appearing
on her skin, like some invisible      knife is slicing her.
Hallucination or not, she bolts out of the showers --




INT. LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA

Miranda wraps a towel around her bloody arm, too freaked
out to process anything. Fumbles for her clothes and heads
straight to Shelley, tying her shoelaces, muttering.

                           MIRANDA

             Shelley?

                           SHELLEY

             And pick up those damn cigarette
             butts. Jesus, TV is dumb --

                           MIRANDA

             Shelley, can you do me a favor??
Shelley fixes her with an intense conspiratorial look.

                           SHELLEY

             The housewives will find something
             better to do.

                           MIRANDA

             Can you go in the shower and tell
             me if you see anything on the wall?
Shelley doesn't respond. Simply crosses over and heads
for the showers. Miranda gets dressed when a hand on her
shoulder makes her jump --

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         30.

                           IRENE

             Enough privacy for you?

                            MIRANDA

             Yes.   Thank you, Irene.
But now Irene notices the blood seeping through the
towel.

                           IRENE

             What did you do?

                            MIRANDA

             Nothing.   It's nothing --

                           IRENE

             What the hell did you do to
             yourself?!
And now the other patients are curiously watching as
orderlies RUSH IN to haul her away.




INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER

THROUGH a glass pane we see a NURSE bandaging Miranda's
arm. Parsons and Irene confer just outside the room.

                           IRENE

             I looked away for a second. It's
             unacceptable, won't happen again.

                           PARSONS

             Not your fault. Patients always
             find a way to hurt themselves if
             that's what they want.

                           IRENE

             I just didn't peg her for a
             cutter, that's all.
Parsons watches Miranda through the glass.       She can't
look him in the eye.







INT. REC ROOM - LATER

Miranda (with her fresh new bandage) ignores the looks
from the other patients as she rejoins them. Spots
Shelley by the window furthest from the wardens. Scared.

                            SHELLEY

             Oh my God.   Oh my God.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          31.

                           MIRANDA

             You saw it?

                            SHELLEY

             Listen, Doctor. Some people, they
             have a gift. And in here, because
             they categorize us as a bunch of
             schizos, they refuse to
             acknowledge that. It's like that
             Hubble telescope that sees things
             a trillion miles away but what
             it's seeing is just reflected
             light of a star that died a
             thousand years ago? It's like
             that. Doesn't mean you're crazy.
             It only means your eyes open in a
             different way.
Miranda tries to follow the convoluted explanation, but
has a sinking feeling.

                           MIRANDA

             What did it say?

                           SHELLEY

             On the telescope?

                           MIRANDA

             Did you see anything, Shelley?
Shelley glances around to make sure no one can hear.

                           SHELLEY

             That's not tile that wall is made
             out of . It's a holographic
             screen. All part of your mission,
             isn't it?
Miranda shakes her head, feeling foolish.     Walks away.

                           MIRANDA

             Thanks anyway.

                           SHELLEY

                     (taps her forehead)
             This is all we have. The rest is
             dust.




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY

Pete and Miranda stare at each other.     A tense beat.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                           MIRANDA

             It was you I called that night.

                            PETE

             Yes.

                           MIRANDA

             Did you mention that to the cops?

                            PETE

             No.

                            MIRANDA

             Why?

                           PETE

             I didn't think it would help you.

                           MIRANDA

             What does that mean?

                           PETE

             It means they wouldn't have let me
             treat you if they thought I had
             any kind of involvement in what
             happened.

                            MIRANDA

             And did you?

                            PETE

             Did I what?

                           MIRANDA

             Did I make it to your place?   Did
             I see you that night?

                           PETE

             No. We got disconnected and I
             couldn't get through to you. I
             sat there waiting all night.
             Figured you'd changed your mind.

                           MIRANDA

             Why didn't you tell me this before?

                           PETE

             Because the only way you'll be
             able to accept these events is if
             you remember them on your own. My
             job is to assist you in processing
             that information because you're
             not in a frame of mind to do it by
             yourself.

She stares at him.     Queasy.

                           MIRANDA

             You're changing the subject.




                           PETE

             The subject is you don't trust me.

                           MIRANDA

             Right now I don't trust anyone.
She tries to read his face. Reminds herself of who Pete
is and what he means to her. He points at her bandaged
arm.

                           PETE

             You want to talk about today?
She takes a resigned breath, slowly shakes her head.
Wishing she could wake up from this nightmare:

                           MIRANDA

             I want to talk to my lawyer.

                           PETE

             I think that's premature.

                           MIRANDA

             I can't help what you think.

                                             FADE OUT.

EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE GARDEN - DAY

SPRINKLER SYSTEMS doing their thing: THWIP, THWIP,
THWIP... The female patients are out in the gardens for
their freshly dose of air. BOOM DOWN TO Miranda alone at
a bench. A cigarette appears before her, being offered
to her:

                           JENNA

             You a Marlboro girl?
Miranda sees Jenna looming above her, shielding the sun.

                           MIRANDA

             I don't smoke, thanks.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                          34.

                            JENNA

             All we have is our health,
             cupcake.
                      (sits beside her)
             What I do is quit constantly,
             start again. Drives them all
             crazy. One day I quit three
             times.

                          MIRANDA

             Huh.
Jenna lights her smoke, blows out the match slowly.
Miranda turns and checks the building entrance as Jenna
rambles on.

                           JENNA

             They allow me one match at a time
             and pretend they're not watching.
             Check it out: salivating goon
             number one at three o'clock, oh-
             so-inconspicuous goon number two
             at five o'clock.
Miranda follows Jenna's gaze. Sure enough, she's being
closely watched by two orderlies.

                           MIRANDA

             What did you set on fire to wind
             up here?

                           JENNA

             Very perceptive, Doc. I burnt
             down the building where I worked.
             I found a baby at the doorstep,
             called the cops -- of course the
             bottom feeding pricks never
             showed. It's beside the point,
             really.
Miranda shrugs. God knows what Jenna is talking about
but who is she to say? Once again, Miranda checks the
building entrance and now sees Parsons emerge. She
rises --

                          MIRANDA

             Phil.
He keeps walking.     Headed to the parking lot beyond.

                          MIRANDA

             Phil!

He turns. His first instinct is to smile. But he checks
himself, reminding himself of her new status. Slips into
his best professional face:




                           PARSONS

             Hello, Miranda.

                           MIRANDA

             I wonder if I could talk to you.

                           PARSONS

             Of course.
                     (checks his watch)
             Well, actually, I'm about to...

                           MIRANDA

             Your staff meeting's done and
             Thursdays you don't schedule
             sessions until the afternoon.
             This will just take one minute.
             Promise.
Impressive.    She remembers his schedule perfectly.

                          PARSONS

             True.
                     (points)
             But the Sheriff wants to ask me
             some questions.
She follows his look to the parking lot where Sheriff
Ryan emerges from his patrol car. Miranda nods.

                           MIRANDA

             It's about Pete.

                           PARSONS

             What about him?

                           MIRANDA

             Perhaps he's not the most
             qualified person to be treating
             me.
His tone is fatherly yet direct.

                           PARSONS

             Are you complaining about his
             methods or are you referring to
             the nature of your past
             relationship with him?
This surprises her.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         36.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             What did he tell you?

                           PARSONS

             He explained there might be a
             conflict of interest because he
             has feelings for you. You two
             engaged in a kiss at one point.
             Am I right?

                             MIRANDA

             Yes.

                           PARSONS

             I told him we're all grownups here
             and the fact is he's the best doctor
             on my staff. As such, and given the
             severity of the charges you face, I
             consider him the most qualified person
             to assist your recovery. Now, if
             you'll excuse me, Sheriff Ryan is
             not a patient man.
Stonewalled in the simplest of ways, she's left feeling
like an idiot. Watches Parsons join the Sheriff by his
car. The two men shake hands when suddenly Irene runs
past her, yelling --

                             IRENE

             Hey!   Chloe!
Now two ORDERLIES race past. Miranda looks over to see
what the fuss is all about. Chloe is on top of an
institute staff member we haven't seen before, a round
black woman named CONSUELO. Punching her --
Other patients have crowded around the scuffle.

                           CHLOE

             You fucking cow giving me the evil
             eye, huh? Fuck you, you fuckin'
             voodoo witch -- !
Irene and the orderlies yank Chloe off Consuelo. Chloe kicks
and screams like an animal. Consuelo meekly stands up.

                           CONSUELO

                     (heavy Cuban accent)
             Is okay, she's okay -- she don't
             mean nothing.

                           CHLOE

             You bet your goddamn fat ass I
             mean it, you're a witch -- !!

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        37.

                           IRENE

             McGrath, that's enough!
The orderlies start pulling Chloe away.      Chloe spits at
Consuelo, full of venom.

                           CHLOE

             Take your voodoo shit back to
             Cuba --

                           IRENE

             I said that's enough.

                           CONSUELO

             Irene, she's okay. Pobrecita, la
             infeliz. It's a misunderstanding.
             Pobrecita. I was only trying to
             help her --

                            CHLOE

             You wanna help me? You pity me?
                      (grabbing her
                       crotch)
             Suck me.
The orderlies haul Chloe off. Irene disperses the crowd.
Consuelo sighs, embarrassed, wipes a bloody lip. Her
manner says she just wants to get back to her duties.
Excitement over, the patients resume whatever it is they
were doing.
Miranda stares at her bleak surroundings when something
catches her eye: Pete watching her from his office
window. He quickly slides the curtain shut. Odd.




EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY TO NIGHT (TIME LAPSE


PHOTOGRAPHY SHOTS)

A sunny sky grows dark as night envelops us with a SWOOSH --







INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR

SLOW PUSH DOWN empty corridors.      The air thick with dread --




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT

Miranda cries softly, unable to sleep. VOICES trickle in
from the corridor outside, wardens on their rounds, a
SOFT MOAN from another cell, a random SCREAM. She shuts
her eyes, repositions herself on her stomach.

INT. WOODWARD LIBRARY - DAY

Irene escorts Miranda into the library.       A warden
follows.

                           IRENE

             How are we feeling today?

                           MIRANDA

             'We'?

                           IRENE

             Sorry I asked.

                           MIRANDA

             Doesn't seem like the best choice
             of words when treating
             schizophrenics.

                           IRENE

             Fitting right in, aren't you?
The library is pretty    much empty at this hour except for
the LIBRARIAN and the    odd janitor tidying up. An
efficient-looking man    rises from a desk, briefcase in
place, glass of water    -- this is attorney THEODORE

"TEDDY" HOWARD.

             Miranda.

                           MIRANDA

             Hi.
Irene checks her watch.       The warden hangs back, keeping
watch.

                           IRENE

             She's due back in the rec room in
             twenty, Counselor.

                           TEDDY HOWARD

             Thank you kindly.
Miranda sits.      Waits until Irene is out of hearing range.

             Teddy, I know you knew Doug well
             and this is an extremely --




                           TEDDY HOWARD

             I'm here as your lawyer. So
             whatever my relationship was with
             Doug is no longer of consequence.
             First things first, how are they
             treating you?

                           MIRANDA

             Like I'm crazy.

                           TEDDY HOWARD

             You know this place better than
             anyone. Anything out of the
             ordinary?

                           MIRANDA

             Other than me being crazy?   No.

                           TEDDY HOWARD

             The DA is pushing for a hearing as
             soon as next week. They're eager
             to resolve this situation because
             -- well, crimes like this don't
             happen that often around here.
             Doug was a hometown boy who'd done
             good, beloved high school
             principal, a role model. Our best
             shot -- scratch that, our only
             shot -- is to claim temporary
             insanity.
As he speaks, she starts fidgeting with her itchy
bandage.

                           MIRANDA

             Wait, wait, wait -- Teddy, you
             know me. I wouldn't raise a hand
             at my husband for the life of me.
             Not even in self-defense. Isn't
             it remotely possible a burglar
             broke in or some crazed high
             school student attacked Doug and I
             went into shock?
Teddy shakes his head.

                           MIRANDA

             You're telling me there's no other
             suspects in anyone's mind?

                           TEDDY HOWARD

             Frankly, no. Neighbors heard
             screams. They have you at the
             scene, they have the murder weapon
             and they have your prints everywhere.
             The only thing they don't have is
             motive.
She keeps absently playing with the bandage. The
adhesive is giving. The bandage starting to peel off.

                           MIRANDA

             Because there is no motive.

                           TEDDY HOWARD

             And that's what's confusing them.
             The fact that you're a brilliant
             psychiatrist doesn't help either.
             It fills their heads with ideas.
             They figure if you were to plan a
             murder you might know how to fake
             insanity to get out of it.
She pulls off half the bandage, back and forth. Not
looking. BUT WE SEE the beginning of a pattern in her
scarred skin --

                           MIRANDA

             I'm not faking anything.

                          TEDDY HOWARD

             Good. I pass no judgment either
             way. The point is --

                            MIRANDA

             The point is I'm the only person
             who doesn't believe I killed my
             husband. I never thought I'd say
             this, but I feel like I'm in the
             middle of a conspiracy.
                     (beat)
             Do you believe I'm crazy?
An uncomfortable Teddy takes too long before answering.
Miranda looks down, humiliated -- and now she sees it.
Perfectly carved into her arm, her scar reads:

"NOT ALONE."

Petrified, Miranda jumps back, knocks down Teddy's glass
of water all over his papers, her chair topples over.
The warden and janitor look up --
Teddy tries for delicate:

                            MIRANDA

             Forget it.   Forget I asked.
PUSH INTO her face as involuntary tears roll down and we --




INT. PETE'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda. Numb. Pete trying hard to get through. A
beat. We get a good look at the writing on her arm.
(The right arm.)

                           PETE

             I can't help you if you don't talk
             to me.
Silence from Miranda.     He is firm but not unkind:

                           PETE

             I can stand here all day. All
             week. You're the one running out
             of time.
Nothing.     He goes to touch her arm.   She jerks it away.

                           PETE

             What does it mean?
She shakes her head, at a loss. Torn between her
suspicion and the need to confide in someone. Finally:

                           MIRANDA

             I didn't write this.

                           PETE

             Then who?
They stare each other down. There's definitely chemistry
between these two. But the moment is far from romantic.

                           PETE

             You're going to have to trust me.

                           MIRANDA

             Why?

                           PETE

             Because no matter what's going
             through your mind right now, I
             haven't done anything wrong.

                           MIRANDA

             Then you know exactly how I feel.
He starts to speak, stops himself. Switches tactics.
Their banter escalates in speed as their terms get more
clinical:

                           PETE

             You admit you're having a hard
             time differentiating what's
             reality from what's hallucination,
             right? So isn't it at least
             possible that --

                           MIRANDA

             As a doctor I agree with you.
             Maybe -- and this is a big maybe
             -- all of this is just a deep
             epilepsy that extends to the
             limbic structures, but I'm telling
             you --

                           PETE

             How about this moment right now?

                           MIRANDA

             What about it?

                           PETE

             Is this a hallucination?

                           MIRANDA

             You tell me. But I do know what I
             sound like. Paranoia is the
             ultimate awareness, right?

                           PETE

             Which is why I suggest we simply
             increase your dose until --

                            MIRANDA

                      (venom)
             No!   Goddamnit! No!
He steps back at her blowout. She catches the look on
his face and forces herself to sit down.

                           MIRANDA

             I'm sorry. Is there any way we
             can pretend that didn't just
             happen?

                           MIRANDA (CONT'D)

                     (beat; struggling)
             I want to believe you. I do. So
             I'll take your word for it --
             you're not involved in this -- but
             you take mine: I didn't write
             this and I didn't kill my husband.
He studies her.     Finally nods.   New tactic:

                           PETE

             Alright. Let's say you didn't
             write this --

                           MIRANDA

             Number one: I'm right-handed.
             Number two: I would have had to
             bring an X-Acto knife into the
             shower to do this, wouldn't I?
Pete tries to reserve judgment. Her argument has a
certain loopy logic to it. He hesitates, then pulls a
SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS from a manila envelope.

                           PETE

             I think it's time you look at
             these.
Miranda looks at the crime scene photos. Lurid.
Terrible. Here's part of Doug's body. Here's the axe.
And now she sees a closeup picture of the wall with words
on it. In blood, a la Manson family. And it says:

"NOT ALONE."

Miranda immediately tosses it away from her.      Repulsed --

                                         FLASH CUT TO:





FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Miranda furiously writes on the wall with blood. Wipes
her face breathlessly, leaving a thick red streak on it.







INT. PETE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)


                           PETE

             You wrote that. Any idea why?

                           MIRANDA

                     (panic rising)
             No, I didn't. No, I didn't!

Pete retrieves the photograph off the floor and holds it
up for her to study again.

                           PETE

             You're the only person who can
             figure out what this means. Try
             to remember. Stop holding back.
She nods meekly. Staring at the picture. Begins to
shake as all of it finally comes flooding in --

                                       FLASH CUT TO:





FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick
streak of blood on it. She looks down at Doug, crawling
on hands and knees. He moans horribly, in shock. She
grabs the heavy axe from the floor and follows him. He
reaches for the coffee table with the telephone on it and
makes a move to grab it. He has all the speed of a dying
turtle, and that's pretty much what he resembles.
Miranda bites her lip, lifts the heavy axe with both hands.
Doug's hand grabs the phone. Miranda SWINGS THE AXE over
her head and it comes down straight AT CAMERA.
Miranda wipes her face again, catches her reflection in
the mirror over the mantel and stares --
WE HEAR THAT SOUND. The WETTISH GURGLING sound. Miranda
stares at the MIRROR looking for the source of it. For
an instant we see the teenage girl's reflection there,
beckoning. But now she's gone and Miranda is left
studying her own demented expression and now FLAMES RISE
around her. She looks down at her feet: No fire. Blood
on her clothes, axe still in her hands. Looks back up
at:







THE MIRROR VERSION OF MIRANDA

shows a serene expression on her face. Fire enveloping
her. She slowly lifts her hands over her head. In place
of the axe there are CHAINS attached to SHACKLES on her
wrists. She is completely naked, as if purified -- like
an extreme version of Anima Sola. (A Biblical icon in
which a woman in fiery purgatory awaits her fate.)
Time stands still for a mesmerizing moment --
When the MIRROR SHATTERS TO PIECES and we're back to
reality. Miranda stares at the axe she's flung at it.




                                                     45.





INT. MIRANDA'S BATHROOM - LATER




Miranda tries to wash off the blood in the sink. This is
a daunting task, seeing as how she's covered in it. She
stares at her bloody footprints all over the floor, at
the marks on the door handle, towels and wall.



Gasping for breath, almost crying, she turns on the
shower at full blast and climbs into the tub. She
watches the blood wash off her. As if finally coming
back to her body and realizing what she's done, she
slowly slides down the shower wall and curls up in the
tub. Crying. Shaking.     She shuts her eyes as hard as
she can to make it all go away, and we --

                                    FADE TO BLACK.





BLACKNESS

Silence. And now, faintly at first, but GROWING
PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER, we hear the SOUND OF BUZZING FLIES.




FADE IN:





INT. MIRANDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

Miranda wakes up, still in the tub. How long has she
been there, hours? Days? Impossible to know.
But at some point she must have turned off the water.
She sits up, every muscle of her body aching, hair caked
with blood.
The first thing that hits her is the stench. And it's foul,
the putrid smell of decaying flesh. She steps gingerly out
of the tub onto the flooded floor and follows the trail of
blood, mortified at what she will find.




INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Soon enough the press will make the Manson Family
reference, but for now, only Miranda is here to witness
the fruit of her labor. She gasps for air.
Instead she is hit by a wave of nausea. She doubles over
to throw up when there is a FRANTIC RAPPING at the front
door.
She freezes. VOICES and YELLS trickle in. The HINGES on
the door RATTLE under REPEATED POUNDING and she still
stands there as the first FIREMAN breaks in. Sheriff
Ryan and his deputies right behind. A concerned Pete
Graham behind them.

CONTINUED:




The cops take one look at the place and raise their guns
at her, but we can't hear what they're saying because
Miranda's ragged BREATHING has taken over the soundtrack.
Suffice to say that, at the sight of the guns, something
clicks inside her and she turns on her heel and flees --




INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

She slips on blood, nearly falls as she scrambles to the
bedroom --







INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM

She locks the door behind her, hyperventilating in terror.
Instantly there are men POUNDING on it. SQUAWKING RADIOS.
ORDERS BARKED at her. She spots two officers through the
window in her backyard. About to smash the window.
A caged animal, completely surrounded, she covers her face
with her hands. Trembling. The doorknob jiggles violently,
about to give. And when she brings her hands down she is
staring straight into the teenage girl's face. And she
OPENS HER MOUTH WIDE and now we are back in --




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)

Miranda gasps for air, drowning in sensory overload.

                           MIRANDA

             Oh God, oh God, oh God...
She rocks back and forth. Finally aware of what she's
done. She is the killer. No more doubts. And now that
she knows, everything is much worse.
A long, harrowing beat.
WE PUSH IN ON her devastated face.       NIGHT TURNS TO DAY.




INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY

The locks are unlocked. Pete appears at the door.
Miranda glances up at him. She looks like a different
person. Completely destroyed. He crouches beside her.

                          PETE

             You okay?
She shakes her head slowly. He sets his hand on her
shoulder. She turns to him and hugs him tight, holding
on for dear life. Breaks down in sobs.




                                                     47.





INT. PHIL PARSONS' OFFICE - DAY




Parsons leafs through Miranda's file.   Pete stands by the
window, lost in thought.

                        PARSONS

          How much does she remember?

                        PETE

          It all came flooding back last
          night.

                        PARSONS

          Guilt?

                        PETE

          More like an uncontrollable
          reminiscence. Intense, over-
          cathected. She's not feeling
          guilty of her actions, not
          exactly. Sounds to me like last
          night she actually re-lived them
          in great detail.

                        PARSONS

          Hypermnesis following amnesia.
          Could a specific epileptic element
          be involved?

                        PETE

          That's exactly what she suggested.
          Even in her present state, her
          instincts remain impeccable.

                        PARSONS

          I'd like to talk to her.




INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER

Pete escorts a fragile Miranda down the corridor.    The
two orderlies walking ominously behind them.

                        PETE

          Standard procedure.

                        MIRANDA

          I didn't say a word.







INT. DR. PHIL PARSONS' OFFICE - DAY

Parsons on the phone, gestures for them to enter.

             Dorothy, I can't discuss this
             now --
                     (motions for
                      them to sit)
             I'm not taking it lightly, no.   We
             will talk about it at home.
Miranda and Pete sit across from him. Miranda trying
hard to appear composed -- acutely aware of her every
gesture, and of how different her last visit to this
office was. Nothing casual about it now.
She stares at the picture frames on Phil's desk (all
facing AWAY FROM us), the diplomas on the wall, the books
by noted fathers of neurology (works by Hughlings
Jackson, Kurt Goldstein, Henry Head, A.R. Luria). A
framed quote reads:
"'If You Do Know That Here Is One Hand, We'll Grant You
All The Rest.' -- Wittgenstein"

                           PARSONS

                     (into phone)
             Yes, dear. Me too.
He hangs up. Takes a moment to look at Miranda. Tries a
smile but to her it comes off condescending. Fact is --
there's nothing to smile about.

                           PARSONS

             I'm so sorry about this, Miranda.
She nods, dazed. Angles her head to look at a framed
picture on his desk. Parsons looks to Pete.

                           PARSONS

             Has Pete told you about the
             hearing?

                           PETE

             Teddy already filled her in.

                           PARSONS

             Teddy Howard is top notch. He's
             going to do everything in his power
             -- and he's quite resourceful -- to
             prove you're not fit to stand trial.
             Miranda, I know you have no family
             left, so we're your family now and
             we're all going down to the wire to
             protect you and help you in any way
             we --

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         49.





CONTINUED:




PUSH IN ON Miranda who stares intently at something on
the desk. Not listening to a word he's saying --

                            MIRANDA

             Who is that?
Parsons pauses here.      Exchanges glances with Pete.

                            PARSONS

             Excuse me?

                           MIRANDA

             The girl in the picture.
WE SEE what she is talking about: a framed photograph on
the desk is now FACING us. Eerie. It shows Parsons, his
wife Dorothy and a young girl. Our teenage girl.

                            PARSONS

             My daughter.
Miranda looks up at this, perplexed.

                           MIRANDA

             She's the girl I saw.

                           PARSONS

             You're obviously mistaken.

                           MIRANDA

             I'm positive. She was hurt,
             bleeding. Is she all right?
Pete and Parsons trade uneasy looks.

                           PETE

             Miranda, you've seen that
             photograph at least a dozen times,
             every time you've been in this
             office. You're just confused --

                           MIRANDA

             Not about this. Is she all right?

                            PARSONS

             No, she's not... all right.
                     (beat)
             Rachel committed suicide six years
             ago.
This shuts Miranda right up.      Mind spinning.

                            MIRANDA

             How?

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                      50.





CONTINUED:





                           PETE

             Miranda, that's none of your --

                            PARSONS

             That's okay.
                     (to Miranda)
             Rachel was a very troubled girl.
             Handicapped since birth. She was
             born mute. My wife and I tried
             everything to help her fit in
             but... but she ran away from home
             more than once, wanting to end her
             life.
                     (beat)
             And she finally succeeded. Jumped
             off Ashley Bridge. She was only
             seventeen years old.
Ashley Bridge. Mute. Ghost? Miranda hesitates here.
She is not the type to believe in ghosts, and knows full
well what even her suggestion of it will sound like.

                           MIRANDA

             I'm -- I'm terribly sorry, Phil.
Parsons doesn't want to talk about it anymore.    Rises.

                           PARSONS

             Peter, can I speak to you?
The men step outside. PUSH IN ON Miranda's face as she
stares at the picture of Rachel. We catch snippets of
the doctors' discussion outside, increasing her
paranoia --

                           PETE (O.S.)

             ... Textbook psychotic pattern...
             manifestation of guilt...

                           PARSONS (O.S.)

             ... much she knows about Rachel?

                           PETE (O.S.)

             I'm telling you she doesn't...
             Concocted alternate reality...

                           PARSONS (O.S.)

             I'm trusting you... crawling with
             cops.
A DARK SHADOW envelops Miranda's confused face, as we --




                                                    51.





INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT




Miranda's pale skin is visible in the dim monochromatic
light. We are MOVING TOWARDS her, seeing her as if from
the POV of someone approaching her. We become aware of
the RAGGED BREATHING sound. Miranda opens her eyes,
looks this way and that, then closes them again.
She is nearly asleep when she hears a sound we've heard
before. The strained WET SOUND. Miranda's eyes SNAP
OPEN. She slowly sits up, back against the wall.
Squinting to cover every inch of the room.
And now she sees it: a SHADOW crouched in the corner.
Roughly the size of a person. Miranda climbs off the bed
and slowly walks towards it. Scared, but determined.
She wrinkles her nose at the putrid smell coming from it.
She gets closer... closer... The RAGGED BREATHING GROWING
LOUDER as she reaches the shadow --
She stretches out her hand and finally touches...
NOTHING. She swipes her hand through the air, feeling
stupid.

                        MIRANDA

          This is not going to work. I'm
          sick of being watched, and I know
          this place well and it doesn't
          smell this bad.
She paces around the room, feels the wall, taps her head.

                        MIRANDA

          I'm awake, I'm not dreaming. I'm
          alive -- this is not some
          afterlife mumbo jumbo. So-called
          paranormal activity can be
          debunked a million different ways.
          So whatever you are, whatever it
          is I'm making up here -- I'm
          letting you go, I'm setting you
          free. I'm the wrong person. And
          I need to sleep. I'm not afraid
          and I don't believe and I'm fully
          aware that this is all in my mind
          -- fiction -- a concocted
          alternate reality -- and I
          acknowledge it. And now I'm done
          with it. I'm going to sleep now.
The moment is as brave as it is ridiculous. She has
psyched herself into verbally defeating the ghost. And
now she climbs back in bed.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                      52.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

                     (sleepy)
             Besides, if you really were the
             ghost of Rachel Parsons, you would
             let me out of this cell.
A beat. And now we hear the SOUND OF THE DEADBOLT SLIDE
OPEN. The door opens quietly. PUSH INTO Miranda's face.
Properly scared now.

                           MIRANDA

             Holy shit.
If proof is what she wanted, proof is what she got.   From
now on we'll refer to the teenage girl as RACHEL.




INT. FEMALE WARD - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Miranda takes a tentative step outside her cell, feeling
the door with her fingers, feeling along the wall --
still making sure she isn't dreaming this.
She looks down the long, empty corridor, the glare of
neon lights making her readjust her eyes momentarily.
Nobody there. But when she looks down the other way she
sees a pair of bare feet disappear behind the wall. So
quick we're not sure we saw it for sure.
Miranda deliberately walks in the opposite direction.
At night the clinical corridor takes on an unsettling
quality. She silently strolls down the hall, tilting her
head at the various sounds from PATIENTS in their cells.
She turns to make sure Rachel isn't behind her and when
Miranda faces forward again, she realizes she is standing
right across from:







THE NURSES' STATION

Where two nurses are watching TELEVISION. Miranda tiptoes
past them, ducking at the window to remain unseen.




ANOTHER CORRIDOR

This one is wider. Miranda is startled by the sudden
sound of LAUGHTER behind her. The nurses laughing at
their late night show. Momentarily distracted, she
almost knocks over a mop and bucket resting by the wall.
She holds the mop in place and now opens the door to a

SANITATION CLOSET.


                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                      53.





CONTINUED:




She looks for something, a tool. Discards a pair of
brushes and finds a small screwdriver. Pockets it.







THE STAIRS

Miranda hurries up the stairs, hugging the wall to stay
clear from the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA sweeping the area.
She waits at the landing, times it just right -- and
scurries to the next floor.







INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR (OFFICE FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS


ACTION

Knowing her way around here, Miranda keeps a steady pace
as she heads towards her old office. She turns a corner
and stops in her tracks: another JANITOR making his
rounds. She waits until he's out of sight and rushes to
her office.
She pulls out the stolen screwdriver and brings it to the
lock. Starts unscrewing the screws. She does this as
fast as she can, but she's no professional -- so it takes
a few tries. She loosens one screw, then another -- and
clumsily drops the screwdriver. The METAL ECHOES against
the floor.
Miranda sucks her breath in, waits. No footsteps. She
bends down, retrieves it, and holds onto the knob for
balance. It easily turns in her hand. It was open all
along. She simply forgot to check.




INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE

Miranda shuts the door behind her and slips behind her
computer. Shrouded in darkness. Hits a switch and a
SURVEILLANCE MONITOR comes to life. Now she has a view
of the corridors: two guards here, a nurse going for a
smoke, a janitor at the coffee machine and so on.
She switches on her computer and taps her fingers as she
waits for it to boot up.




ON SURVEILLANCE MONITOR

The JANITOR with his coffee cup now heading back towards
Miranda's office corridor --

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                       54.





CONTINUED:




Miranda glances at the door, can see the glare of the
computer screen reflecting against the glass pane. She
tries opening drawers but they're all locked. She
remembers something and digs a sweatshirt from beneath
the couch, uses it to block the light.
Computer powered up, she runs an online search for
"RACHEL PARSONS." Waits as the info appears --

                           MIRANDA

                     (to self)
             Alright. What happened to you?




ON COMPUTER SCREEN

Various listings: The archive news of her funeral,
something about her search and a LOCAL NEWS ARTICLE about
teen suicide. That's the one she chooses. Hits "PRINT."
She checks the surveillance monitor again:     the janitor
now mops right outside her door.







ON PRINTOUT

The heading says "WHAT DRIVES OUR TEENAGERS TO SUICIDE?"
A quick glimpse gives us ages (16, 18, 17) and names of
three local girls who have died. Rachel's name and
PHOTOGRAPH appears with two others: Jenny Dixon and
Andrea White.
Miranda pockets it, looks back at the surveillance
monitor: the janitor is walking away. She watches him
disappear down the hall. Slowly but surely. And now the
screen is empty.
But just for a second. Because suddenly Rachel is there.
Staring straight at her. Makes us jump.




INT. CORRIDOR/STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

Retracing her steps, Miranda shuts her door and hits the
stairs. Playing off the sweep of the surveillance camera.




INT. FEMALE WARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

As she reaches the landing, she hears VOICES coming her
way. She detours down another corridor and hides from
view. Waits for Consuelo and a nurse to exit down the
staircase.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                    55.





CONTINUED:




And now she turns at ANOTHER SOUND. Coming from inside
the room immediately behind her. Room 237. She steps to
the small glass pane on the door and peers inside.







INT. ROOM 237

It takes a moment to adjust our eyes to the darkness but
now we make out TWO FIGURES in the room involved in some
sort of struggle.
Miranda presses her face against the glass and now sees a
flash of metal. Something sharp. Not a knife, but a needle.
And now a blur of hair yanked up by a strong arm. In the dim
light we can make out Chloe, eyes glazed, drooling.
Just for a beat, because now she is slapped down on the
bed like a rag doll and the man with the needle ENTERS

FRAME.








INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda flinches, confused. Glances down the corridor to
ensure she remains undiscovered. Then peers back in.




INT. ROOM 237

Chloe on her stomach on the bed. Her pale naked skin
marked with scratches and bruises. The needle is stuck
in her arm, which hangs off the side. Her mouth is open
but it is impossible to tell whether she is laughing or
sobbing. Abruptly the man climbs on her, pulling off his
T-shirt.
As he discards it we see that it is yellow.




INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Disturbed, Miranda turns away. Except now the corridor
isn't empty. There is a JANITOR at the end. Coffee cup
in hand. Staring at her, disconcerted.

                          JANITOR

             Hey!
Miranda turns and runs.




INT. FEMALE WARD STAIRS

Miranda bolts down the stairs. THUNDERING FOOTSTEPS and
YELLS can be heard right behind her.




                                                      56.





INT. FEMALE WARD THIRD FLOOR




Miranda races down the empty floor towards an emergency
exit door all the way at the end.
TWO ORDERLIES emerge from the staircase and give chase,
shouting for her to stop. PATIENTS holler from their
cells, awakened by the COMMOTION.
Miranda's heart is nearly bursting through her chest as
she gets closer and closer to the emergency door. Twenty
feet, fifteen, ten --
When a side door opens and a MAN IN A YELLOW SHIRT
appears, blocking her path. Miranda tries to avoid
crashing into him but carries too much momentum. Veers
left against the wall but the man easily tackles her and
pins her down.
The orderlies and an nurse arrive at the scene to find
her screaming, hysterical. They hold her down --

                         MIRANDA

           It's him! It's him! Jesus
           Christ, it's him!
The man in the yellow shirt acts as if he has no idea
what she's talking about. Ho-hum, just another psychotic
woman trying to escape. A nurse prepares a needle and
we --

                                          FADE OUT.





FADE IN:





INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

TRACKING ALONG a long desk where the staff finish their
morning meeting. Parsons, Pete and Irene among others.

                         PARSONS

           We've transferred her to a higher
           security room on the fifth floor.
           That's my final concession to any
           type of special treatment.

                         PETE

           And the night staff?

                         IRENE

           They insist her room was properly
           locked, what else could they say?

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                        57.





CONTINUED:





                           PETE

             Could there be any truth to her
             claim?




                           PARSONS

             Peter, we have one hundred and
             forty employees. Thirty-five work
             maintenance. They all wear yellow
             shirts, it's their uniform. I'm
             holding a very discreet inquiry,
             sure -- but I don't want a news
             van parked outside day and night.
             It makes much more sense that she
             tried to escape and got caught,
             doesn't it?
Pete ponders this.     It certainly seems that way.

                           PETE

             I perused Miranda's files on Chloe
             McGrath -- they're damn
             comprehensive. Maybe she was a
             bit obsessed with her.
Irene and Parsons share a look.     He wraps it up:

                           PARSONS

             The scariest gift God gave us is
             our minds. And a bright person
             like Miranda -- she's grasping at
             straws here -- who knows what her
             brain is telling her, now that
             it's snapped.




INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - DAY

A better room, in fact. This one has a view. Heavy bars
on the windows, but still. Miranda paces. Pete is
seated, observing her deteriorating state.

                           MIRANDA

             Did you live here when Rachel
             killed herself?

                           PETE

             Yes. As a matter of fact, I was
             part of the search party that
             found the body.

                           MIRANDA

             Phil must have been a wreck.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         58.





CONTINUED:





                           PETE

             You can imagine. Actually, Phil
             was in Houston undergoing triple
             bypass surgery when it happened.



What was that?     Miranda reacts to this.

                           MIRANDA

             And this is confirmed. There are
             hospital records and so forth?

                           PETE

             I'm sure there are.   Can we get
             back on track now?
Miranda pulls out the folded printout from her pocket.

                           MIRANDA

             What about these other dates, was
             Phil here when the other girls
             went missing and found dead?
A disconcerted Pete looks at the article with the
pictures of Rachel and the others: Andrea White and
Jenny Dixon.

                           PETE

             Where are you going with this?
             First I'm a suspect in Doug's
             death, now what, Phil Parsons
             murdered his own daughter?

                           MIRANDA

             Rachel Parsons disappeared six
             years ago. A week later she's a
             suicide. Andrew White, four years
             ago, same M.O., and Jenny Dixon,
             two years ago. Don't you find
             that unusual?
He regards her. Maybe Parsons is right: she's
desperately grasping at straws now. Skims the article:

                           PETE

             What same M.O.? One jumped off a
             bridge, one hung herself and one
             crashed her car. Who gave you
             this?

                            MIRANDA

             Not one left a suicide note. In
             fact, how is anybody sure these
             were suicides?

             You heard Phil, his daughter had
             tried several times before --




                           MIRANDA

             That's his story. I need to talk
             to the reporter who wrote that.
             Frank something.

                           PETE

             Well, you can't.

                           MIRANDA

             I beg to differ. I know my
             visitation rights.

                           PETE

             You can't because... he died.
Miranda snaps to attention here.

                           MIRANDA

             You're telling me the one local
             investigative reporter who connected
             three highly-suspicious deaths, just
             happens to have conveniently died?

                           PETE

             Frank Albright was an eighty-year-
             old retired sociology professor.
                     (re: the article)
             This is a fluff piece about
             teenage depression and the
             breakdown of the nuclear family.
             You can find one in any local
             paper, anywhere, any other week!

                           MIRANDA

             Don't be smug, Pete. That's one
             thing you've never been. Rachel
             is somehow connected to what I'm
             going through. I don't know
             how -- like you said, I'm not in a
             frame of mind to process the
             information without assistance.
             So I'm asking you for assistance.

                           PETE

             Listen to me. You are not well. I
             had hoped once you remembered the
             murder we could deal with your
             feelings about it but these
             fixations:

             are self-created distractions to
             avoid looking into yourself. And
             the longer you --

                           MIRANDA

             I know this lecture like the back
             of my hand!

                            PETE

             Good.   Saves me the trouble.
Discussion over. He raps on the door. Triple-locks come
unlocked and an ORDERLY is there. Peter exits.




INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Peter hurries down the corridor, passing by a nurse. The
same one who bandaged Miranda earlier, so let's give her
a proper name: CLAIRE. She pushes her cart into the
elevator.







INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY

Claire and her cart emerge from the elevator and she
heads down the long corridor, reaches a door and unlocks
it.




INT. MEDICAL SUPPLY ROOM

TIGHT ON a row of drug-filled shelves. Claire parks her
cart and kicks off her shoes. Digs a pack of smokes out
of her stashed purse when a pair of hands grab her.
Claire squeaks until she sees her attacker: a stoner
type named SIMON. Deftly unbuttoning her uniform, hands
all over her. She means to resist but he's got such
boyish charm.

                           CLAIRE

             Get off me, you dog --

                           SIMON

             Hell, don't go all bubbly with joy
             or anything.

                           CLAIRE

             You can't be in here and you know
             it. Nap in your car.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         61.





CONTINUED:




She finally twists herself out of his grasp. Points an
accusing finger, but she's grinning. Blushing, even.

                           CLAIRE

             Now get out before we get busted.
Properly reprimanded, Simon picks up his folded uniform
and prepares to leave, head hung low.

                           SIMON

             You slay me, Claire.    Honest.

                           CLAIRE

             Sure I do, Boy Scout.
He exits.    She shakes her head, slips her uniform back
on.




INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

Simon presses the button, waits. He checks inside his
folded uniform where we see several stolen vials of
sedatives. The doors begin to close when --

                           CLAIRE

             Hold it, Simon!
He hides the loot behind his back, busted.       She holds the
door open and tosses him his yellow shirt.

                           CLAIRE

             What do you think I am, laundry
             service?

                           SIMON

                     (relieved)
             Won't happen again, ma'am.
She turns and exits.     The doors slide shut.   Meet our
rapist.







INT. WOODWARD CAFETERIA - DAY

Bustling with activity. The room is divided into two:          a
large main area where the patients eat, plus a second,
smaller upstairs area for the staff.
BOOM DOWN to find Miranda eating at a long table.
Shelley beside her, playing with her plastic fork. Jenna
taps an unlit cigarette. As usual, Irene keeps watch
nearby.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                       62.





CONTINUED:





                           SHELLEY

             ... She'd get high on glue and
             make me help her try on my bras.
             Is that the strangest shit you've
             heard?

                           JENNA

             Heard stranger. But she's a case.

                           SHELLEY

             And she always put on a happy
             face. Man, what an optometrist.
Optometrist?     Miranda starts to correct her, but lets it
go.

                           JENNA

             You narced her out, didn't you?
             Boo-hoo. Bet you were a little
             buzzed yourself.
Miranda's gaze strays from this, um, most compelling of
conversations and comes to rest on Chloe. Alone at
another table. Heavily sedated. A wreck.
Miranda rises and walks over. Shelley waits until she's
out of hearing range, leans in to Jenna --

                           SHELLEY

             All work, that woman.   Work, work,
             work.

                           JENNA

             What are you talking about?

                           SHELLEY

             She's like an alcoholic.   But with
             work.

                          JENNA

             What work?

                           SHELLEY

             Not safe to tell you.   Wish I
             could.
Jenna rolls her eyes, returns to her food.




UPSTAIRS

Parsons watches intrigued as Miranda sits beside Chloe
and starts talking. From Parson's POV up above we can
see pretty much the entire dining area.




                                                     63.





BACK TO MIRANDA




Trying to get Chloe's attention. But Chloe just stares
at her untouched food, glassy-eyed.

                         MIRANDA

           I saw what happened. I'm sorry.
No reaction.

                         MIRANDA

           Have you told anyone?   Chloe?
Nothing.

                         MIRANDA

           Look, Chloe -- the person who did
           this to you is not the devil. And
           if you can identify him, I'll make
           sure the motherfucker is arrested.
Now Chloe looks at her, like something finally registers.

                         CHLOE

           Doctor, did you just say
           'motherfucker'?

                         MIRANDA

           Do you know his name? Maybe you
           saw a nametag on his uniform?
           Think.
Chloe simply stares.    Finally shakes her head.

                         CHLOE

           Man, you must really hate me.

                          MIRANDA

           What?   I don't hate you.

                         CHLOE

           You hate me because now you're
           just the same as me. You must
           feel so embarrassed.

                         MIRANDA

           I don't hate you. And I don't
           feel embarrassed.

                         CHLOE

           That's just a pat answer you have
           because you're new at this. Trust
           me, I know what I'm talking about.

                           MIRANDA

                     (rising)
             Forget it, alright? Forget we had
             this conversation.



Chloe abruptly grabs her arm.     Tightly.

                           CHLOE

             You know what happens next?

                           MIRANDA

             I get the distinct feeling you're
             going to tell me.

                           CHLOE

             The shock wears off and the guilt
             kicks in. And that guilt is the
             real motherfucker. You'll be
             watched 24/seven, because they're
             afraid you'll kill yourself. Dr.
             Graham will question every harmless
             gesture, every innocent comment, ever
             twitch you make and eventually -- and
             it's a fucking tedious 'eventually'
             -- you'll stop hating yourself for
             what you did. But what replaces that
             hatred is this unbearable sadness. And
             you don't lose that as long as you live.
PUSH IN ON Miranda.     Deeply affected by Chloe's words, as
we --




INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY AND NIGHT


MIRANDA'S RESIGNED DAILY GRIND IN QUICK DISSOLVES --

A) Miranda and the other patients line up for meds in
the rec room.
B) Irene keeps watch in the garden as the women get
their daily fresh air.
C) Wardens watch as each patient enters their cell at
night and the lights go off.







INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT

Echoing an earlier scene, we are MOVING TOWARDS her --
her pale skin visible in the dim monochromatic light.
Miranda flicks a look this way and that, alert. Sensing
something.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                    65.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             Leave me alone. Go away.
Just like a crazy person. She listens for any further
noise, hears none and shuts her eyes. Exhausted.

                           MIRANDA

             I've lost my fucking mind.   Happy
             now?
Silence. But now the BEDSPRINGS CREAK behind her and she
whips around and starts to scream as a big hand covers
her mouth. Her eyes open wide at the sight of Simon, in
his yellow shirt. He shoves her against the mattress and
presses his full weight against her. She lets out a
muffled scream as he uncaps a syringe with his teeth and
brings the plunger to her throat. Straight into her
jugular.

                           SIMON

                     (sotto)
             This is gonna hurt you more than
             it hurts me.
She flails and kicks desperately but he pins her down.
The BEDSPRINGS STRAIN violently and now he's straddling
her, squeezing the plunger into her throat. Her eyes
welling up:

                           SIMON

                     (sotto)
             I've always wanted to do a doctor.
She manages to free one hand and yanks the syringe from
her throat. It flies to the floor. He grins, enjoying
this:

                           SIMON

                     (sotto)
             The more you fight me, the harder
             I get, pussycat -- so pretty
             please, with sugar on top -- keep
             still.
Simon paws at her clothes as she struggles to defend
herself. He finally slaps her free arm down. Presses
his knee against it, immobilizing her once more. Now he
produces another syringe from his pocket. Checks it.
Miranda shakes her head, pleading. A scream stuck in her
throat. But nobody can hear her.
Simon brings the syringe towards her when suddenly we
hear a LOUD CLANGING at the door. Shaking it off its
hinges.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                       66.





CONTINUED:




Simon looks up, confused. Nobody is there. The split-
second distraction is all Miranda needs to shove him off
the bed. She fumbles for the discarded syringe and STABS
HIS CHEST WITH IT -- squeezes the plunger --




                           MIRANDA

                     (sotto)
             Take that, son of a bitch.
Simon moans as the full dose hits his system and his body
goes limp. Miranda exhales, coming back to herself. A
beat.

                           MIRANDA

             Rachel?
No response.     Miranda grabs his keys, begins to undress
him.

                                             CUT TO:





SECURITY CAMERA POV

shows a uniformed janitor calmly walking down the
corridor. PULL BACK to see we are in --







INT. SURVEILLANCE BOOTH - NIGHT

A bank of monitors keep watch on the premises   after dark.
TWO GUARDS play cards (Uno), bored to tears.    A cursory
glance at the monitors produces no reaction.    Certainly a
janitor walking down the corridor is no cause   for alarm.




EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Dead quiet. CRICKETS CHIRP or whatever it is    crickets
do. Miranda steadies her breathing, perusing    rows of
unfamiliar cars. She clicks Simon's key-ring    button
repeatedly until a set of headlights blink on   and off.




INT. SIMON'S CAR - NIGHT

Miranda slips behind the wheel, STARTS the CAR. The RADIO
KICKS IN at EAR-DEAFENING VOLUME. She nearly drops dead.




EXT. WOODWARD GATE - NIGHT

The gate GUARD reads a magazine as Miranda's stolen car
approaches. The guard barely registers the driver in the
booth mirror, immersed in his article. Hits a button to
open the gate for him. It opens SLOWLY. S-l-o-w-l-y.




                                                   67.





INT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT




Miranda, sweating, watches the receding image of the
institute behind her. Turns on the main road. Free.

                        MIRANDA

          Thank you, thank you, thank you.
She glances back, makes sure no one is following her.
Catches her own reflection in the rearview mirror: the
scared eyes, the haunted face. The new version of
herself.
She flips the RADIO dial: BAD NEW AGE MUZAK. BAD
COUNTRY. BAD DISCO. More BAD NEW AGE MUZAK. She finds
IGGY POP'S entirely appropriate "THE PASSENGER) and lets
it play.




ANOTHER ANGLE

Now we are seeing her as if from the POV of someone
traveling alongside the car. Peering THROUGH the
passenger window. Miranda becomes aware of this, slowly
glances over. Sees nothing but her own reflection.
Turns back forward.
We NOTICE the blue cigarette lighter key chain dangling
off the dashboard. Nothing but a long stretch of road
ahead.







EXT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The neighborhood perfectly quiet late at night. Miranda
parks in the driveway and stares at the empty house.
Steels herself, climbs out of the car and heads around
back.
She finds her SPARE KEY behind a potted plant, takes a
deep breath and lets herself in through the back door.




INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE

POLICE CRIME-SCENE TAPE everywhere. She turns on the
kitchen light only and scurries to her bedroom without
even looking in the direction of the living room,
avoiding the scene of the gruesome crime altogether.
Eerie as hell --




INT. BEDROOM - QUICK CUTS

Miranda stuffs clothes into a suitcase, finds her passport,
digs out some cash from a box. Quick change of clothes to
get rid of the rapist's uniform. Fast, fast, fast --




                                                       68.





INT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT




Miranda watches her house fade from view in the rearview
mirror as she drives down the block. Shudders. Flips
the RADIO dial with shaky hands.




                          RADIO DJ (V.O.)

            ... Weather forecasters predict
            heavy winds tonight as a major
            thunderstorm rolls in tomorrow.
            You're listening to KLPG, 101.4 on
            your dial. This next honky-tonk
            heartbreak classic is...
She looks in the rearview mirror once more.      Only this
time she is met by a piercing pair of eyes.
Rachel's.     Inside the car.
Rachel's mouth opens unnaturally wide, revealing a gaping
abyss of rotted teeth and flesh -- and lets out the wet
sound. A threatening howl this time, pure venom.
Miranda covers her face, jerks the car. It does a 180
and slides to a halt in the middle of the street --
Facing the direction of her house again.




EXT. STREET

Miranda jumps out, panicked. Glances around. Looks
inside the car: no Rachel. A beat to catch her breath,
making up her mind. Slides behind the wheel and makes a
U-turn.







INT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda flips the rearview mirror so it faces the ceiling
and turns UP the RADIO. GUNS the pedal. Freaked.
She's driven maybe 20 feet when suddenly her ENGINE DIES --

                          MIRANDA

            No.
The CAR SPUTTERS to a stop. Miranda goes to turn the key
but suddenly freezes. Looks at the ignition oddly and
notices the key is gone.

                          MIRANDA

            Why are you doing this to me?
A dead-still beat. Glancing around, she is even more
startled to see the blue lighter key chain lying in the
middle of the street.




                                                      69.





EXT. STREET - NIGHT




Miranda opens her car door and walks down the empty
street to retrieve her suddenly magical keys.
We watch her reach the keys, all alone out here. The
moment she bends down to pick it up she is blinded by the
glare of HEADLIGHT and the ROAR OF AN ENGINE. Miranda
jumps out of the way, narrowly avoiding being flattened
by a ROAD SWEEPER, spraying water as it goes.
She watches the truck disappear down the block. Heart in
her throat. Calms her nerves and now walks over to the
pesky keys again. Smack in the middle of a puddle now.
BOOM UP the posts harnessing power lines which surround
the area until we STOP ON a pair of INDUSTRIAL BOLTS
fastened around the insulators of a thick power line.
From here we see Miranda bend down and pick up her keys.
And now the bolts suddenly shake off their hinges, coming
loose right in front of our eyes -- moved by some
invisible force --
Miranda tilts her head at the sound of a METALLIC SNAP
and turns. The bolts pop out of their sockets. The LIVE
WIRE uncoils like some gigantic serpent and swings
straight towards the paralyzed Miranda --
She looks down at her feet, ankle-deep in the puddle,
back up at the 11,000 VOLTS OF POWER about to fry her to
a crisp and jumps out of the way at the last second. The
wire hits the water and the monumental charge sends
SPARKS flying in every direction. It looks like
lightning.
A silent, sudden beat.   That was as close as close gets.

                        MIRANDA

                  (fighting tears)
          What do you want from me?
No sign of Rachel. Miranda yells at the air, glancing
over her shoulder, seemingly demented:

                        MIRANDA

          What is it you want me to do?!!
A moment. Miranda stranded. The stolen car in the
middle of the road. And now the SQUEAK of a GATE OPENING
abruptly. Miranda whips her head in the direction of the
sound.
It's the front gate to her house. And now the front door
SWINGS OPEN. And now the living room LIGHTS switch on.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                       70.





CONTINUED:




Clearly Rachel wants her back in the house.

                           MIRANDA

             I can't.
                     (softly)
             Please, please don't make me go
             back in there.
But even as she's saying this her feet are moving towards
it. She pauses, looks at the car in the middle of the
road. Looks at the fizzling puddle where she was almost
electrocuted. No neighbors have come out to investigate
yet, but how long can that last? She walks to the car.




INT. SIMON'S CAR

Miranda climbs in, not sure whether to laugh or cry here.
She's never asked a ghost for permission before:

                           MIRANDA

             Bear with me, I'm just parking it
             out of the way so it won't look
             suspicious in the middle of the
             road -- okay.
She STARTS the ENGINE and pulls over to the sidewalk.







INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE

Miranda stands in her living room, staring at her
handiwork. Frozen with dread.
The blood has been cleaned up some, but the mess remains.
The upturned furniture covered in plastic, the chalk
outline of the body, the yellow crime-scene tape, the
shattered mirror above the fireplace, the muddied
footprints of dozens of cops, coroners, etc.
The faded writing on the wall:       "NOT ALONE."
Miranda takes it all in, not entirely sure what she's
supposed to be looking for.

                            MIRANDA

                     (piecing it together)
             Not alone. What happened to you
             happened to other girls.
                     (beat)
             I understand. And I'm sorry. But
             there is nothing I can do about it
             now. It has nothing to do with
             me.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         71.





CONTINUED:




Not knowing what else to do, she turns to exit when the
TELEVISION SET suddenly COMES TO LIFE, making her jump.
The unmistakable MUSIC from some old WB cartoon at FULL

BLAST.




She stares at the TV screen. Is there some sign here she
should be able to follow? She crosses to turn it off and
immediately doubles over in pain --

                            MIRANDA

             Shit.
She looks at her foot. A big SHARD OF GLASS is stuck
right through the flimsy hospital slipper into her skin.
Blood already seeping from the nasty cut --




INT. BATHROOM

Miranda seated on the edge of the tub, slowly pulls out
the piece of glass, drops it in the wastebasket. She
grabs a cotton ball and alcohol and starts cleaning the
cut.
And now, FAINT at first, but GROWING LOUDER -- she hears
the hollow WET SOUND we've come to associate with Rachel.
Inside the room with her --
Miranda stares at the medicine cabinet. Did the mirror
move? We watch her from the MIRROR POV as she holds
perfectly still, listening. The SOUND now seems to have
STOPPED. A silent beat.
She turns her attention back to cleaning her cut, grimacing
as the alcohol burns her skin. It looks painful.
And now the slow SQUEAK of the MEDICINE CABINET DOOR makes
her look up again. And she sees herself in the mirror like
the night of the slaughter: flames all around her. Naked
arms raised. Wrists shackled. Anima Sola.
She stares.     Mesmerized.    The sound of FLAMES GROWING

LOUDER.


                             MIRANDA

             No.   No.   No...
Miranda walks slowly to the mirror. Incredibly, the
image reflecting back at her also grows bigger. As if
the two versions of her are literally walking towards
each other. FROM A SIDE ANGLE WE SEE both their faces
mere inches apart. Miranda brings her fingertips to the
mirror and touches it. Immediately pulls her hand back.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                     72.





CONTINUED:




Miranda stares at her fingertips. The tips are burnt.
The skin sizzles softly. 200 percent scientifically
impossible. And when she looks up at the mirror again --
the image is gone.



It is now deathly quiet. And what she finds herself
staring at in the mirror is the reflection of something
just behind her. A folded newspaper discarded in the far
corner of the room.
She turns to look at it now. It's opened to the REALTY
LISTINGS page. Doug must have left it there. She picks
it up and looks closer: Focusing on a picture of a bank-
repossessed property.
The address is in Willows Creek.
Her brain wires start clicking. This must be what Rachel
wanted her to see. She stares at it.
PUSH IN ON the picture as we --

                                     MATCH CUT TO:





EXT. WILLOWS CREEK PROPERTY - DAWN

A "FOR SALE" sign still flapping in the wind.   The first
few rays of light break through the dawn sky.
Miranda's (Simon's) car approaches up the road until it
FILLS the FRAME and parks. Miranda steps out.
She studies the house before walking up the drive. We
watch her peek through windows and walk around back,
looking for something. What exactly, we don't know.
(Neither does she.)
She makes her way back to the starting point and fixes
her stare now on the barn. The one place he hasn't
looked.







INT. BARN

Dark, empty. The WIND outside causes the ALUMINUM SIDING
to FLAP NOISILY. It's slightly unnerving, but hey, it's
just the wind. Miranda covers the distance of the large
room, perplexed. There is something about this place.
Something she can't quite put her finger on. Beckoning
her.
With a last fruitless look, she heads towards the front
door when a glint of mental in the opposite corner stops
her. She moves to it.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                       73.





CONTINUED:




And here, where the walls should meet, there is a narrow
gap, leading to a passage, maybe five inches wide. A
padlocked chain has been threaded through a hole in both
walls, holding them together. Miranda inspects the heavy
padlock, the source of the glint. She tugs on the wall
and opens it to the limits of the chain, but that's only
a few inches more. Miranda peers into the darkness
beyond, but can't see a thing.
Hesitating only a moment, she turns sideways and slides
herself into the claustrophobic slot.
She moves forward cautiously a few feet until her face
brushes against something hanging in the air. She stops,
startled. It's a pull-string hanging from a naked light
bulb.
She tugs on it. And now she has 60 watts of reddish glow
to see the hatch on the floor immediately in front of
her. She pulls on the LATCH and it opens with a RUSTY
CREAK. She peers into the pitch-black basement below.
Feels around for the beginning of a stepladder and climbs
down.




INT. SECRET BASEMENT

Miranda emerges from the ladder into total darkness.
Whatever dim reddish light was provided by the bulb
upstairs does not reach here. She feels around the wall
for a switch. Nothing.

                           MIRANDA

                     (to self)
             It's not shrink-appropriate to be
             afraid of the dark, right?
Abruptly there's a sharp CLICK as she lights Simon's key-
chain lighter, and the wavery light illuminates the vast
space. Rats scurry for cover. It takes a second to orient
ourselves. Something metallic catches the lighter's
reflection way in back. Miranda walks towards it.

                          MIRANDA

             Hello?
She takes a few more steps until her foot hits a bulk on
the floor. She stops. Kneels down and in the dim half-
light we make out a backpack. She unzips it and rifles
through it (T-shirts, underwear, Walkman) until she finds
a wallet. Opens the billfold and brings the lighter next
to the ID: the picture belongs to a teenager named

"TRACY MARIE SEAVER."


                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                    74.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             Is there anybody here?   Hello?
The lighter in her hand is getting hot, so she lets it
click off. When it comes back on we see she has wrapped
a ragged T-shirt around it for insulation.
Miranda steps deeper into the room. Up ahead, she can
make out the metallic thing that reflected light before.
It is a hook in the ceiling. And suspended from it are
several heavy chains.
Like a meat rack.
And now she catches a whiff of the terrible smell and
sees the body of the teenage girl: hanging upside down,
tied around the hands and ankles.
Medical training kicking in, Miranda quickly lowers the
girl to the ground, causing the angry rats to skitter
away.

                            MIRANDA

             Go away!   Fuck off!
(We see the following in between flicks of the lighter so
that we go from midnight black to wavery light in an
almost strobe-light effect:)
She checks for vital signs, pulse, heartbeat -- Miranda's
adrenaline at full tilt --

                           MIRANDA

             C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --
She strikes the flint and brings the lighter to the
girl's pupils. Inspects them. Slaps her repeatedly,
clinically.
The strobe effect also allows us glimpses of the
immediate surroundings:   household tools strewn about;
wire cutters, pliers -- a pool of dried blood.

                           MIRANDA

             Wake up, Tracy, wake up --
Nothing. She unties the wires around the girl's ankles.
The skin swollen grotesquely around them. She shakes the
girl. Slowly coming to the realization that it's too
late.




                                                          75.





EXT. BARN - LATER




Miranda comes crashing out of the barn, doubles over and
throws up. The bright light outside blinding her
momentarily. Her bloodshot eyes taking a moment to
register --







THE PATROL CAR

parked in front of the house. A POLICE OFFICER
cautiously peering inside her stolen car. He looks up
and notices her.
Miranda hesitates. Nowhere to run.      The officer waves.
His name is TURLINGTON.

                         OFFICER TURLINGTON

          Howdy there.
He says this while already strolling over.        Miranda's
mind races a mile a minute --

                        OFFICER TURLINGTON

          Everything okay?

                         MIRANDA

          Y-yes.

                        OFFICER TURLINGTON

          That your vehicle, ma'am?
She stares at the young, friendly cop. His left hand
resting on his belt. Right next to his gun. But it
seems as if he has no idea who she is. At least not yet.

                        MIRANDA

          Yes -- I -- I just pulled over.     I
          was -- looking for a bathroom.
          Morning sickness, you know...

                        OFFICER TURLINGTON

          Congratulations. But I'm afraid
          this is private property -- you
          can't just waltz on in. You
          understand that.
She nods, nerves shot to hell.     Starts walking.

                        MIRANDA

          I'll be on my merry way now. My
          husband will never forgive me if I
          get a ticket for trespassing.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         76.





CONTINUED:




The cop nods at that, seeming to have a fair grasp of
marital dynamics. He flashes a smile but suddenly stops,
whips out his gun and trains it on her --




                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Holy shit.
                     (clicks the safety
                      off)
             Lady, stay right where you are.
Miranda shuts her eyes, busted.     Freezes.

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Hands up where I can see them.
Miranda awkwardly raises her shaky hands.

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Nice and slow, start talking to
             me. And make it good. Tell me
             just exactly who that is.
A confused Miranda slowly turns in the direction he's
looking to see Tracy Seaver at the barn door. Dragging
herself in agony, clearly in a severe state of shock.
Battered, yet somehow -- incredibly -- still alive.
But just barely.




EXT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - DAY

A car pulls up to the chaotic ER area.       Phil Parsons and
Pete step out, rush inside.







INT. HOSPITAL ER - MEN'S ROOM - DAY

Sheriff Ryan is busy at the urinal. But even here he
can't find any peace because Teddy Howard is on his
case --

                            SHERIFF RYAN

             Mr. Howard -- let me simply list
             the events your client was
             involved in last night. First she
             drugs a janitor, steals his car
             and escapes a mental
             institution --

                           TEDDY HOWARD

             Hold on, there isn't even any
             substantial evidence --

Sheriff Ryan zips up his pants, flushes and runs the sink
to wash his hands --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Mr. Howard -- there isn't evidence
             because the overdosed janitor
             hasn't woken up, that's why -- and
             when your client was questioned on
             the matter she admitted to
             injecting a full syringe of --

                           TEDDY HOWARD

                     (handing him a
                      paper towel)
             You had no right to question my
             client without my presence --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Mr. Howard, this is not a courtroom.
             Your client was read her rights and
             she still insisted --

                           TEDDY HOWARD

             -- Let me ask you this, Sheriff:
             what exactly was a janitor doing
             with several vials of sedatives
             inside my client's cell? And is
             it not possible he had taken some
             drugs himself before my client --
Sheriff Ryan discards the paper towel and walks out to
the waiting room, Teddy following closely --




INT. ER WAITING ROOM

Paramedics and nurses doing their thing. The young
officer who arrested Miranda hands the Sheriff a cup of
coffee.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             I'm not a drug expert. I'm simply
             stating the frigging facts.
Sheriff Ryan burns his tongue on the coffee, notices
Parsons and Pete approaching. Relief crosses his face.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Phil, thank God -- this guy's
             driving me nuts!

                           PARSONS

             What happened?

CONTINUED:





                           SHERIFF RYAN

             An 'incident' -- for lack of a
             better frigging word -- involving
             Miss Grey and a teenage girl who's
             been tortured and is in critical
             condition and chances are slim
             she'll even utter another word.

                           PETE

             Who's the girl?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             A runaway from Portland, Tracy
             Marie Seaver. Reported missing a
             couple weeks ago. We found Miss
             Grey in some barn off Willows
             Creek with the girl all messed up.
             I'm just now waiting for the
             surgeon to give me an update.
                     (to Teddy)
             Notice, Counselor, how I'm not
             even mentioning her trespassing or
             lying to a police officer.
Teddy waves him off in frustration.     Goes to talk to
Turlington.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Christ, the woman's got the entire
             hospital busy --
Sheriff Ryan notices Teddy talking to Turlington --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Why are you harassing my deputies?

                           TEDDY HOWARD

             I'm only asking him where he got
             the coffee -- ?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             He's not at liberty to answer
             that. You've had enough goddamn
             coffee already.
The Sheriff leaves Pete and Parsons. They walk over to
the water cooler where they can talk more privately.

                           PETE

             We need to get Miranda back to the
             institute. She needs psychiatric
             care, not a prison cell.

                                                (CONTINUED)

Parsons nods, lost in thought.        Sheriff Ryan returns.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Phil, how well does your wife know
             the suspect?

                           PARSONS

             Why do you ask?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Because she's at the station right
             now, demanding to speak with her.
Parsons frowns at this, concerned.        Pete studies him.




INT. COUNTY STATION HOLDING CELL - DAY

Bare room. A desk and two chairs. Glass window         panes to
insure no privacy. DOROTHY PARSONS (50s) waits,        seated.
The door opens and a DEPUTY escorts Miranda in.        She sits
across from Dorothy, looking as lost as can be.        A long
beat.

                            DOROTHY

             How are you?
Miranda doesn't answer. Her mind elsewhere.         Namely back
at the barn and how it connects to Rachel.

                           DOROTHY

             I needed to see you, but I'm not
             sure where to begin. I don't know
             you well, I certainly have nothing
             but fond feelings for you. Phil
             always keeps me posted on his
             colleagues and his work and -- in
             any case, I have always thought of
             you as a very bright, very
             perceptive doctor. Even though I
             don't know you well.
She pauses here. Miranda looks up now. Her face hollow
and exhausted. Bags under her eyes. A person who has
seen too much. Wondering where the hell this is going.

                           DOROTHY

             My point is, my point being --
             when Rachel died I had, um, I
             suffered through these spells,
             these recurring dreams.

                           (MORE)

                                                          80.

                           DOROTHY (CONT'D)

             And eventually, once I came to
             terms with her death, they went
             away. Losing a child is the
             hardest, most inconceivable event
             a mother can --
She drifts off.     Takes a beat to collect herself and
resume:

                           DOROTHY

             The past few days I have been
             having the same dream. A
             nightmare.
Miranda can't help but smile to herself at that.

                            MIRANDA

             That word.   Nightmare.   Welcome to
             my life.

                           DOROTHY

             This nightmare involves Rachel but
             it also involves you. In the
             nightmare Rachel holds a box in
             her left hand. A small box. And
             she repeats a series of numbers.
             Now, Rachel never spoke, from the
             time she was born -- she had a
             condition -- I often asked God why
             he punished this child in such a
             way -- she couldn't speak, but she
             was extremely bright. She wasn't
             autistic as the doctors claimed --
Dorothy Parsons starts to cry. A moment passes like
this. It seems she won't recover enough to continue her
tale.

                           MIRANDA

             Mrs. Parsons, you need a
             therapist. Normally I would
             encourage you to schedule a
             session with me but as you can
             see --
Dorothy shakes her head, determined to finish.       She pulls
out a folded piece of paper.

                           DOROTHY

             Every night the same box in her
             hand and the same numbers. I
             wrote them down.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        81.





CONTINUED:




She slides the paper over. Miranda watches her
carefully, then looks at the piece of paper. The numbers
are:




1-0-2-2-0-1.

A long beat.

                           DOROTHY

             It's a message. It's a code for
             something. I don't know what.
             But she wants you to have it.
Miranda studies it. Studies this woman, who quite
frankly seems to have completely lost her mind. Then she
looks back at the numbers and is slowly hit with a
realization.

                           MIRANDA

             October 22nd, 2001. It's my
             wedding date.
She stares at Dorothy, stunned. Brain click-click-
clicking. Her wildest fears confirmed: Doug is behind
this somehow.

                            MIRANDA

             That code belongs to a safety
             deposit box my husband kept in a
             bank up in Newcastle, that's where
             his parents live.
                     (beat)
             Dorothy, I need you to drive up
             there and open it.
Dorothy stares at her, scared.     And finally nods.




EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY

Pete hurries down the front steps of the main building as
TWO POLICE CRUISERS pull up. Miranda is brought out of
one of the cruisers by two OFFICERS.

                           PETE

             We can take those off now.
Sheriff Ryan leans out of the other cruiser.

                            SHERIFF RYAN

             Don't push it, Doctor. She's
             cuffed until your people secure
             her in a cell.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                           82.





CONTINUED:




Pete sighs, gestures for the officers to bring her in.
Irene and two heavy-duty orderlies will also be part of
the escort. Miranda locks eyes with Pete as she
approaches.




                           PETE

             Are you alright?

                           MIRANDA

                     (quietly)
             I was wrong. It wasn't Phil
             Parsons. It was Doug.

                           PETE

             Can we talk about this later?
                     (to Sheriff)
             Thanks, Sheriff.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Tomorrow morning first thing my
             deputies are here.

                           PETE

             I know, I know. We'll see you
             then.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             And my offer still stands if you
             need added security.

                           PETE

             Thank you. She won't go anywhere.
             I guarantee it.
The Sheriff waves, whatever. Knocks twice on the hood
and the officer behind the wheel shifts into drive.

                           MIRANDA

             That's why Rachel picked me.    It
             was Doug. I'm so stupid.
Pete regards her now, has no idea what she's going on
about this time. Tries to remain professional.

                             PETE

             Inside, okay?




INT. CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER

Lunch time for the female wing. An excited Shelley
rushes over to a table where Chloe and Jenna are,
whispers something to them. They glance at the door.

                                                  (CONTINUED)





                                                        83.





CONTINUED:




A moment later, Miranda walks in with her police escort.
Taking her across the cafeteria towards the back door.
An uneasy Pete leads. Irene and the wardens at the rear.



Miranda glances at the women staring at her like a
specimen. Like somehow she's even more dangerous than
them. Top dog, as it were, of the crazies.
And then, halfway across the room, one of the women
stands up. Chloe. She claps her hands together.
Slowly. Miranda watches her, confused. And slowly
Shelly, Jenna and others rise as well. All of them
joining Chloe in clapping.

                             PETE

             What is this?

                           IRENE

             She's a hero. Little Red Riding
             Hood put the big bad wolf in a
             coma.
Pete nods.     Just what he needed.   The OFFICERS trade looks.

                           OFFICER #1

             They're not gonna start something,
             are they?
Irene shakes her head, amused.

                           IRENE

             You ain't scared of a bunch of
             women now, are you, Officer?
The entire cafeteria is on their feet showing their
solidarity for Miranda. Chloe locks eyes with her,
mouths the words "thank you."
And Miranda is hauled out the side door.




INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL

White. Surveillance cameras in every corner. Two
separate doors with elaborate locks. High security all
around. The officers undo Miranda's cuffs and excuse
themselves.
Pete gestures for Irene and the Orderlies to leave as
well.

                           ORDERLY #1

             We'll be right outside, Doctor.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         84.





CONTINUED:




Once the doors are locked and they're alone, the
conversation jumps straight into frustrated high gear:

                           PETE

             I pulled a lot of strings to get
             you transferred back. The best
             case scenario you're looking at
             right now is five years here.
             Five. Under my --

                           MIRANDA

                     (interrupting)
             Peter, I didn't believe in ghosts
             before this. And neither do you.
Pete is at the end of his rope. Can't hide his sadness
when he looks at her. Still, he tries to get her back on
track:

                           PETE

             But you know that the brain is
             fully capable of tricking you into
             seeing all sorts of things. The
             simplest chemical deficiencies
             can --

                           MIRANDA

             Chemical deficiencies can't get
             inside of you and make you do
             terrible things you don't remember
             doing!

                            PETE

             I'm a very open-minded person, but
             as a doctor --

                           MIRANDA

             No, you're not. You're a close-
             minded academic, just like me.
             You told me once that I was the
             most logical person you knew,
             remember? Well, everything that's
             happened has an explanation but it
             has nothing to do with psychiatry
             or science. Rachel Parsons was
             abducted and she was murdered six
             years ago -- tossed off the Ashley
             Bridge by my husband. My
             harmless, righteous 'community
             leader' husband -- that's how
             pathetically blind I've been.

                           MIRANDA (CONT'D)

             Andrea White and Jenny Dixon were
             also abducted and murdered -- now
             this was before I met Doug but I
             bet you anything that they both
             went to his school. Then he
             obviously stopped for a while:
             fear, guilt, distractions --
             namely me -- delayed him from
             reverting to his sickness. That's
             why I didn't notice anything. I
             believe he really tried to lead a
             normal life, for me. Then along
             comes Tracy Seaver and he can't
             resist. Locks her up and tortures
             her in some abandoned property --
She shows him the crumpled newspaper listing.

                           MIRANDA

             Here's Doug's interest in real
             estate, Pete.
Pete stares at the realty listing for Willows Creek.

                           MIRANDA

             Rachel Parsons is a pissed-off
             ghost with an agenda, furious at
             her parents for giving up on
             her -- she's been trying to
             communicate with them for years
             but they're too goddamn logical to
             pay attention -- and she picked
             me, she sought me out that night
             and sent me home to fix her
             problem. Made sure I killed Doug
             because he was going to do the
             same thing to Tracy Seaver as he
             did to her. And she will get rid
             of anyone who stands in her way.
Pete takes all of this in.     Dumbfounded.

                           PETE

             Is that a threat?

                           MIRANDA

             To whom?

                           PETE

             To me.

CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             To you? I'm telling you she
             nearly electrocuted me when I
             tried to leave town and she led me
             to that barn and if I don't do
             what she wants -- she's going to
             kill me.
Pete can see that she's petrified. He starts to speak,
but she hushes him by gently placing her finger on his
lips. The gesture is tender, almost romantic. A
reminder of their very real connection.

                           MIRANDA

             I need you to at least consider
             the possibility that I'm not
             insane.
                     (beat; pleading)
             Not as a doctor. As the only
             person I trust in this world.




EXT. NEWCASTLE COMMUNITY BANK PARKING LOT - DAY

A tense Phil and Dorothy Parsons in their parked car.

                           DOROTHY

             I'm not doing it for Miranda, I'm
             doing this for Rachel.

                           PARSONS

             You're making a complete fool of
             yourself. Do you realize what you
             sound like?
She sighs, climbs out of the car, leaving him there.
Takes three steps. Stops. Turns back around and lets
him have it:

                            DOROTHY

             What do I sound like, Phil? Like
             one of your patients? Well, it's
             probably because that's exactly
             how you treat me. And I've had
             enough of this deafening silence
             between us, this exemplary
             mourning in front of the
             community, tiptoeing around our
             lives with you pretending Rachel
             never existed.
BANK CUSTOMERS walk around the argument, pretending not
to hear. Phil is mortified. But Dorothy doesn't care:

                                               (CONTINUED)

             I'm losing my mind. Our daughter
             is gone and I miss her and I'm
             angry.



She turns and storms off. Phil takes it all in for the
first time. A moment later he climbs out of the car.




INT. BANK VAULT - DAY

A solemn GUARD places the safety deposit box on the table
in the middle of the room. Steps back through the gate
and waits. Dorothy and Phil stare at the box for a
moment.
Finally, Phil punches in the code written out by his wife
and opens it. He sorts through some paperwork that means
nothing to him until his hands feel a thick envelope. He
opens it and spills the contents on the table.
It is a stack of POLAROIDS.
Dorothy leans in and immediately her face darkens. She
grabs onto the table, shakily -- and is forced to sit
down. A horrified sob rises from deep inside her, comes
out like the howl of a dying animal. Her husband pales,
all blood draining from his face.







EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - EVENING

The sky darkens fast.     The storm moving in.




INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NURSES' STATION

THUNDER RUMBLES outside, making a tray of meds rattle.
PAN UP to see Consuelo, the round black woman we might
remember Chloe beating up earlier. She shakes her head.

                           CONSUELO

             It's gonna be an interesting
             night.




INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL

Miranda looks up at the sound of the BOLT BEING DRAWN and
the handle unfastened. Through the door comes Consuelo,
carrying a tray. Sets it down by the bed.
She is on her way out when she pauses, stares at Miranda.

That term again, "we." Doctor-speak.         Miranda doesn't
have the energy for it:

                           MIRANDA

             Just fine, thank you.

                           CONSUELO

             The spirit is not fine.    She's
             very unhappy.
What was that? Normally Miranda would look at this woman
as if she were crazy, but things have changed.

                           MIRANDA

             How -- how do you know?

                            CONSUELO

                     (shuts her eyes)
             But she's only a girl. Do you
             know her name?

                              MIRANDA

             Yes.   Rachel.

                           CONSUELO

             Have you talked to her?

                           MIRANDA

             Yes, I -- you could say that.
Consuelo holds Miranda's hands firmly, "reading" her.

                           CONSUELO

             She's very, very angry. And she's
             not finished with you yet.

                           MIRANDA

             I'm sure that's meant to sound
             comforting but --

                           CONSUELO

             She wants to show you something.

                           MIRANDA

             That may be so, but I want her to
             go away.

                           CONSUELO

             Then you need to protect yourself.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          89.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             And how exactly would I do that?

                           CONSUELO

             Mira, first I'm gonna bring you
             some cascarilla, it's a powder,
             you get it anyplace, it comes from
             eggs -- you pour it all over
             you --
                     (indicates)
             Like this --

                           MIRANDA

             Look --
                     (reading nametag)
             Consuelo, I appreciate what you're
             trying to do, but I honestly don't
             think this ghost will go away if I
             pour some egg powder on myself --
Consuelo holds up a finger, hushing Miranda.      She's
receiving something here. Shudders.

                           CONSUELO

             She made you do things.   Bad
             things, didn't she?

                           MIRANDA

             Yes.

                           CONSUELO

             And you carried this out for her.
             She used you as a vessel...
Consuelo's grip tightens on Miranda as we --

                                         FLASH CUT TO:





FLASHBACK - EXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT

We're back at the bridge.     Rachel pries open Miranda's
mouth. Miranda panics:

                            MIRANDA

             What are you doing? I'm trying to
             help you -- ?!
Rachel opens her mouth wide like a snake. And as Miranda
screams, blood starts leaking out of Rachel's wounds.
And now we see it. Rachel's lips touch Miranda's and
BREATHE HER SPIRIT INTO Miranda with a WHOOSH --




                                                       90.





INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)




Consuelo lets go of Miranda's hand. Like recoiling from
fire. Speaks in the simplest of ways. The truth:

                         CONSUELO

           You were possessed by her.

                         MIRANDA

           Yes.

                         CONSUELO

           Ay, probrecita. You're both in
           terrible danger. She's scared too
           but she can't step back into the
           light until she finishes what she
           started here. And now you're the
           only person who can help her find
           the way back.

                         MIRANDA

           I don't know how to do that -- I'm
           not qualified for it. You do it.
Consuelo crosses herself. A sign of respect for the
situation. But it has a chilling effect on Miranda.

                         CONSUELO

           Despair is the only unforgivable
           sin. You'll be in my prayers,
           Miranda.
Prayers?   What good is that going to do?   Consuelo exits.




EXT. PARSONS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Two POLICE CRUISERS parked outside.







INT. PARSONS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A glassy-eyed Phil Parsons serves himself another Scotch,
devastated. The SHOT is FRAMED so that we see the
bedroom door is open, Dorothy lying in bed, heavily
tranquilized.
Sheriff Ryan inspects the photographs.




ON THE LURID POLAROIDS

Postcards from hell: scared teenage girls in forced
poses -- gagged, tortured -- Andrea White, Jenny Dixon,
Tracy Seaver...

                                                       91.





CONTINUED:




And young Rachel Parsons.

                           PARSONS

             This proves that her story is
             true: my daughter appeared to her
             in some form and guided her
             through all this, putting things
             right.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Come on, Phil, you of all
             people --

                           PARSONS

             I of all people hold logic, reason
             and facts above everything else.
             And seek the truth through proof
             and proof only.
                     (re: pictures)
             And what do you call that?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Has it occurred to you that maybe
             she knew what her husband was
             doing to those girls?

                            PARSONS

             No.   Frankly, it hasn't.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Maybe she couldn't stand the guilt
             and cooked up this far-fetched
             tale to tug at everybody's
             heartstrings. The fact remains
             she hacked her husband to pieces.

                           PARSONS

             The fact remains my daughter was
             murdered and Miranda stopped the
             killer. A killer who was loose
             under your incompetent nose for
             over six years. We don't know how
             many future victims were spared,
             but we do know she saved that girl
             in the barn's life. And that's
             more than you or I can say -- !

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Calm down. For the record, that
             girl is on a ventilator. The
             doctors don't think she'll make it
             through tonight.

CONTINUED:





                           SHERIFF RYAN (CONT'D)

             Now, you want to stand up in a
             courtroom and tell a judge that a
             ghost is behind all this, that's
             your prerogative -- but I have to
             abide by the law. And the law
             says Miranda Grey faces criminal
             chargers. So here's what we're
             going to do. I'm going to leave a
             cruiser outside to make sure you
             don't go anywhere tonight and two
             of my deputies will go guard Ms.
             Grey until tomorrow morning.
             Phil?
Parsons doesn't respond.     His eyes far away.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             There will be no breakouts, no
             aiding and abetting, no taking the
             law into your own hands. It'll
             take an Act of God for Miranda
             Grey not to show up in that
             courtroom tomorrow. Are we clear?
And now the Sheriff can see that Parsons is crying.
Quietly, miserably. And it's a disparaging sight.
Sheriff Ryan exits. Two deputies follow, RADIOS

SQUAWKING.

Parsons remains still for a moment, then digs a
photograph out of a drawer. A picture of Rachel in
happier times.

                           PARSONS

             I'm sorry. I will never forgive
             myself for what happened to you.
             Not as long as I live.
                     (breaking down)
             I miss you so much.
He sits there, staring at his dead daughter. Grieving.
WE PULL BACK to see he is not alone. Rachel is watching
him.




EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT

The WIND has really PICKED UP now. A massive LIGHTNING
BOLT streaks the sky, officially announcing the storm's
onset.
A POLICE CRUISER pulls up to the guard gate.




                                                            93.





INT. WOODWARD SURVEILLANCE BOOTH




PAN OFF the bank of monitors TO the same two guards we've
seen before. Playing yet another bored card game. The
LIGHT RAPPING on their glass door makes them look up.




                             GUARD #1

             Help you?
TWO OFFICERS stand there.       We recognize one of them:

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             We're here on Miranda Grey detail.
The Guards shake their heads, chuckle.

                           GUARD #1

             Sixth floor. You can get a couple
             chairs from the nurses up there.
             A pretty decent cup of joe too.

                             OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Thanks, guys.
The Guard points at the bank of monitors.

                           GUARD #1

             Although why the Sheriff is making
             you fellas waste your time is
             beside me. We got her right here.
             She ain't going no place.




ON MONITOR

Miranda inside her pristine white cell.       Restlessly
pacing.

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Looks perfectly harmless, doesn't
             she?

                           GUARD #1

             Don't they all, Officer, don't
             they all?
The men share a chuckle over that one when suddenly
THUNDER CRACKLES and the power goes out.
No monitors, no radio, no nothing.       Pitch black.

                            GUARD #1

             Shit.   There goes the card game.
Abruptly there's a SERIES OF sharp CLICKS as FOUR
FLASHLIGHTS come alive.




                                                        94.





INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL




The THUNDER outside RATTLES the WINDOW PANE. The only
light source being the intermittent LIGHTNING as the

STORM RAGES.




She paces in the dark.    Sits.   Waits.




INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - STAIRS - SAME TIME

The two cops use their flashlights to hustle up the stairs.







INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - SAME TIME




Miranda holds her breath, listens. And sure enough,
somebody else is in the room. She looks around.

                          MIRANDA

          No.   No.   What do you want -- ?
And now LIGHTNING streaks the room and we see Rachel in
the corner. Staring with her dead eyes. Moving towards
her.

                         MIRANDA

          I've done everything you've asked
          me to. My life is ruined. I
          can't take this anymore. I
          can't...
                   (faintly)
          You have to step into the light,
          Rachel. You don't belong here --
          you don't belong...
But it doesn't work. Rachel keeps walking towards her.
Miranda backs up against the wall. Trapped. Fighting
tears --

                        MIRANDA

          Into the light --
                  (loudly)
          Can somebody come in here?       I need
          help. Somebody, please!




INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DIFFERENT FLOOR - STAIRS -


SAME TIME

The cops reach the landing where we see other flashlights
down the corridor. They walk towards them.

                        IRENE

          And who are you?

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        95.

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Officer Turlington, ma'am. We're
             supposed to sit outside Miranda
             Grey's cell all night.




                           IRENE

             Knock yourself out. Next floor up.
                     (loudly)
             It's only a power outage, ladies
             -- let's call it an early night.
The cops head down the corridor.




INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - SAME TIME

Rachel stretches out her arm to Miranda's face --

                           MIRANDA

             Please don't. Why are you doing
             this? It's over. Over and done!
Rachel slowly shakes her head, places her hands on
Miranda's eyes and shuts them --

                                       FLASH CUT TO:








MIRANDA'S VISION - ANDREA WHITE

in her school uniform. Staring straight ahead. Now the
image is bathed in a red and blue light and we see her
half-naked, bruised. Dead.

                                       FLASH CUT TO:





JENNY DIXON

staring AT us in her school uniform. Now abruptly she is
a hellish vision: opening her mouth in agony, also
bathed in the strange red and blue light --

END OF MIRANDA'S VISION.





INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda screams at the visions.    Rachel holds her steady.

                          MIRANDA

             Stop it! I don't want to see
             this! I can't help you anymore!
             Stop it!

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                        96.





CONTINUED:




Now a heavy RATTLING makes her turn to the door. One of
the HINGES has SHATTERED and the latch itself is half-
pulled from the doorframe. Relentless POUNDING on the
other side.




                           MIRANDA

             Let me out of here! Let me out!
There's a deafening SOUND like a thousand bells ringing
at once and Miranda covers her ears --
Outside WE HEAR MURMURS, YELLS, INSTRUCTIONS --




INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - CORRIDOR

The cops arrive to find every door in the corridor flung
open. Confused patients spill out as guards and nurses
try to restore order. RADIOS SQUAWK, flashlights beam
and FOOTSTEPS fill the dark corridor as patients try to
escape.







EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

FIRE ENGINES and PATROL CARS arrive at the scene, SIRENS
blazing. Sheriff Ryan and additional deputies rush from
their cars to contain the breakout. A large SPOTLIGHT
comes to life. We spot Jenna making a run for the garden
wall when the spotlight hits her. Two officers rush
after her.




INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE

Sheriff Ryan makes his way through the mayhem, past Irene
helping a patient, past nurse Claire cowering in a corner --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Christ Almighty.
Sheriff Ryan hits the stairs.




INT. SIXTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

Officer Turlington runs down the corridor, searching
frantically with his flashlight --




EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT

A car pulls up at the scene.     Pete and Parsons step out.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                          PETE

             Miranda...
Pete rushes up the steps --







INT. SIXTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

Officer Turlington looks inside Miranda's cell. Empty.
And as he is about to speak into his walkie he spots her:
Seated by the elevator. Holding a biting block in
Shelley's mouth as her seizing subsides.

                           OFFICER

                     (into radio)
             Sheriff? I have Miss Grey right
             here.
He flashes his light at her.     Miranda looks back blankly.

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Sorry, we thought you might have
             made a run for it.

                           MIRANDA

             Page Irene ASAP. This patient
             needs her meds.
Turlington nods. Miranda looks down at a grateful
Shelley, whose head is cradled in her lap. Brushes the
matted hair off her face. Carefully removes the biting
block, making sure Shelley is alright.

                           SHELLEY

                     (after a beat)
             You're gonna get that Pulitzer
             after all.

                           MIRANDA

             Shh, shh, just rest.

                           SHELLEY

                     (sotto, smiling)
             I told you I could keep a secret.







INT. REC ROOM - LATER

The patients are all assembled here. Flashlights galore.
Irene and Consuelo do head counts. Guards, officers,
janitors -- everybody. Irene points a finger at Jenna.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         98.





CONTINUED:





                           IRENE

             You have really disappointed me
             tonight, Jenna --




                           JENNA

             Give me a break. You wouldn't
             respect me if I hadn't tried --
Parsons breaks away from Turlington, heads over to Pete
and Miranda --

                           PETE

             Everybody accounted for?

                           PARSONS

             We're doing the final count.   Now
             they can't find the Sheriff.
Miranda scans the near-dark room, looking for someone.
Watches Turlington step aside to take a call on his
radio.   Parsons regards her with newfound respect:

                           PARSONS

             Are you alright, Miranda?

                            MIRANDA

             Fine, Phil.   Thanks for asking.
Suddenly all the policemen in the room begin to exit --

                           PETE

             What's going on, Officer?

                            OFFICER TURLINGTON

             One of your patients is holding
             the Sheriff at gunpoint. She's in
             the cafeteria.
Pete glances at Miranda.      She knows exactly who it is:

                           MIRANDA

             Chloe.
Turlington is about to exit when Parsons stops him:

                           PARSONS

             I think Doctor Grey should be the
             one to talk to her.




INT. CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER

The DOOR CRASHES open and Chloe shoves the Sheriff
inside. She has a gun pressed hard against his ear.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          99.





CONTINUED:





                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Young lady, I don't know how you
             think you can get out of here,
             but --




                           CHLOE

             You're very polite for a piggy.
             Now take off your uniform.
Sheriff Ryan hesitates.      Chloe presses the gun against
him.

                            CHLOE

             Do it quick.   I won't make fun of
             you.
The sound of the UPSTAIRS DOOR BEING THROWN OPEN makes
her glance up. She trains her flashlight at the second
level, stepping behind the Sheriff to use him as cover.

                           CHLOE

             Nobody better fucking move up
             there or I'll blow this piggy's
             head off!
Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM searches the section. Catches the
reflection of a police shield hiding behind a table.

                           CHLOE

             That means you, fucko. Up on your
             feet or I'll start by shooting his
             ear off.
A beat.   Officer Turlington rises.      Slow and deliberate.

                           CHLOE

                     (to Sheriff, sotto)
             Tell junior the grownups are
             talking now and he's not allowed
             in here. Do it.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Turlington, it's alright. I
             can -- I'm just going to --

                            CHLOE

             The grownups are talking.   Don't
             paraphrase me.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             The grownups are -- are talking
             now. Just leave.

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                          100.





CONTINUED:




A voice startles Chloe from behind, at floor level.

                            MIRANDA

             Chloe?   Can I talk to you?



Chloe flicks the flashlight to see Miranda by the door.

                           CHLOE

             Dreadful timing, I'm real busy.

                           MIRANDA

             You have to let him go.   I'm sorry.
Chloe flinches at that. Like all this multitasking is
affecting her. She digs the gun deeper into the Sheriff's
neck, making him cower to his knees, execution style --

                           CHLOE

             Look -- let's not confuse things.
             I like you. But this is my only
             chance.
                     (to Sheriff)
             Now take off that goddamn uniform
             before I get really pissed.
The Sheriff glances at Miranda. Miranda nods.       The
Sheriff begins unbuttoning his shirt --

                           MIRANDA

             What are you going to do? Put on
             his uniform and walk out of here?
             Think about it, Chloe. They know
             you have him. The place is
             crawling with cops.

                           CHLOE

             What are my options? To grow old
             in this place? It's clear they will
             never let me go. Never. Ever.

                           MIRANDA

             That's not true. You have less
             than a year left here.

                           CHLOE

             That's a lie! I'll never stop
             being sick, they'll just find
             something new that's wrong with
             me. No wonder you doctors can't
             help anyone -- all you have are
             deficit columns and stupid tests
             designed to point out what part of
             the puzzle you think we're missing!

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         101.





CONTINUED:




She starts sobbing.     Letting everything go --

                           MIRANDA

             You're right, doctors never
             concentrate on the things patients
             are actually capable of. But I
             know you, Chloe, you've been
             through things that most people
             don't survive. And you have a
             wonderful future in front of you
             if you choose it. It's up to you.
This gets through to Chloe.       Her grip loosens on the gun.

                           MIRANDA

             No more guilt, no more hatred, no
             more unbearable sadness. You have
             no use for any of that anymore.
             Your life begins this very second.

                             CHLOE

             I'm so tired.    So goddamn tired --
Miranda walks over and embraces her.       Chloe hands her the
gun.
And that's when the power returns.
Miranda and Chloe frozen in their embrace. Sheriff Ryan
on his knees. In the sudden, shocking glare of returning
light, color abruptly re-enters the world and every
RADIO, PHONE, FAN and MACHINE that were left on HUM TO

LIFE.

Miranda finds herself staring at Sheriff Ryan, bathed in
the glow of the flashing red and blue lights from the
cruisers outside. The image a replica of the Andrea
White and Jenny Dixon visions.
Peeking from his half-unbuttoned shirt is the beginning
of a chest TATTOO. Miranda slowly trains the gun on the
Sheriff, finally struck with the realization:

                           MIRANDA

             It was you, wasn't it?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             What are you talking about?
She opens his shirt to reveal the tattoo: a 1950s pinup-
style WOMAN SURROUNDED BY FLAMES, ARMS RAISED, SHACKLED.
Anima Sola. Miranda's recurring vision from the night of
the slaughter.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        102.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             'Not alone.' That's what Rachel
             has been trying to tell me all
             along. Doug was not alone. You
             were with him. This whole time
             it's been you. You covered up
             their deaths to look like
             suicides.
The Sheriff throws his jacket on, starts walking --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             You've lost your mind.

                           MIRANDA

             Don't fucking move.
The CLICK! of a SAFETY being released makes him pause.
He turns to look at her. A tense beat.

                           PETE (O.S.)

             Miranda, don't do it!
She glances at Pete's pleading face and the room around
her: cops everywhere. All guns trained on her.
Sheriff Ryan speaks low so only she can hear the
following:

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             And just exactly who would believe
             you? No proof, no living witness.
             Everybody knows you're crazy.
Miranda's finger itches on the trigger as they face off.
Her hand starts to shake. Sheriff Ryan turns and strides
off. Getting away. Further. Further...
But as much as she wants to, she can't bring herself to
do it. Finally brings the gun down. The armed policemen
rush over and disarm her, shove her to the floor and cuff
her.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             I want that woman in custody. She
             has a judge to face in the morning.




EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT (HEAVY RAIN)

Turlington escorts a cuffed Miranda to a waiting cruiser.
He jumps behind the wheel and starts to pull out when
Pete suddenly taps on Miranda's window, startling her --

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         103.





CONTINUED:





                           PETE

             I'll call your lawyer and -- !

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Sir, not now --

                           PETE

             I'll meet you at the station!
She shakes her head.     Mouths something Pete can't make out.

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Sir, please --

                           PETE

             What?
Turlington hits the gas. Miranda presses her face
against the window so only Pete can see her say the
following:

                           MIRANDA

             The girl in the hospital.
Pete locks eyes with her, nods -- as the cruiser leaves.




INT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - RECOVERING ROOM - NIGHT

Tracy Seaver lies unconscious, hooked up to a series of
machines. PULL BACK to find Pete with a young DOCTOR.

                           DOCTOR

             Her condition remains the same.
             Basically that ventilator is
             keeping her alive. We have no
             reason to think she'll ever wake
             up. I'm sorry.
Pete nods, disconcerted.      Stares at the girl.

                           PETE

             You mind if I stay here tonight?

                           DOCTOR

             Hey, it's a big place. The more
             the merrier. If I can just ask
             you to wait outside.







INT. WAITING AREA

The Doctor gestures for Pete to make himself comfortable.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                           104.





CONTINUED:





                           HOSPITAL LOUDSPEAKER (V.O.)

             Dr. Brooks to ER. Dr. Brooks --

                            DOCTOR

             That's me.   Excuse me.
The Doctor rushes off.




INT. RECOVERY ROOM #2

Like Tracy Seaver, Simon Reynolds is hooked up to a bunch
of machines and cables. Suddenly his EYES SHOOT OPEN and
the CARDIAC ALARM SQUEALS --
Two NURSES rush in.       The young Doctor right behind.

                            NURSE #1

             V-tach.
The EKG whipsaws. The Doctor feels for a pulse, then slaps
on the defibrillator pads, places the paddles on the chest --

                            DOCTOR

             Clear!
He begins chest compressions on Simon's heart. He spasms
violently once, twice -- And then it stops. The Doctor
and Nurses stare at the monitor. Flatline.
Unseen by them, Rachel steps out of the room.







EXT. COUNTY POLICE STATION - NIGHT

WE SEE Turlington and two other COPS climb in a patrol
car and drive off. WE MOVE INSIDE the empty station...




INT. SHERIFF RYAN'S OFFICE

Sheriff Ryan takes a healthy chug from a fifth of Scotch,
slips it back in a drawer. Stares at his hands. Steady as
a rock. Takes a deep breath. Knows what he must do next.
A religious man despite everything, he brings his thumb
to his forehead and crosses himself.




INT. COUNTY STATION - HOLDING CELL - MOMENTS LATER

Miranda's eyes snap open at the SOUND OF DEADBOLTS
SLIDING UNLOCKED. Hopeful. Could this be Rachel?

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         105.





CONTINUED:




A looming figure appears at the door. Doesn't bother to
shut it. Stares at her silently for a long while. And
so begins a claustrophobic cat and mouse game:




                           SHERIFF RYAN

             How did you know?

                            MIRANDA

             You tell me.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             This isn't one of your word
             association games, Doctor. Did
             Douglas tell you that night?

                           MIRANDA

             Why wait this long if he had?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Maybe it's your amnesia. Maybe
             you blocked it out.

                           MIRANDA

             Maybe. But it seems to me that
             it's vital you know for sure.
He studies her. Takes a step towards her. Miranda
responds by stepping back. A slow motion semicircle, if
you will. She eyes the open door. Tempted.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             You think me and Doug are
             monsters. That this was all a
             carefully laid out plan with those
             girls. But it wasn't that at all.
             You do things sometimes and you're
             not sure why you did them. Then
             you realize you can live with them
             and so can everyone else. Life
             goes on.

                           MIRANDA

             If you're looking for forgiveness,
             you came to the wrong place.
She's stalling, trying to keep him talking and he knows
it.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             One thing about fear is it makes
             people say the dumbest things.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                       106.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             Be that as it may, you're afraid
             too -- because you know killing me
             won't solve your problems.




                           SHERIFF RYAN

             My only problem is you.

                           MIRANDA

             What about Parsons? And Peter?
             They know. And that girl in the
             hospital will never forget your
             face. You miscalculated, now you
             pay.
Patience tested, he suddenly WHACKS her across the face.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             I hate a bad bluffer.
She makes a big effort to hide how much that stung.

                           MIRANDA

             I sure hope that felt good because
             you can't afford too many more
             signs of struggle. Can you?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Go ahead, hit me back. It's what
             you want.

                           MIRANDA

             No, that's what you want me to do.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Back to profiling, huh? Your
             thought process is completely
             transparent.
And now Miranda briefly takes the reins of the
conversation. Analyst and patient in session.      Echoing
her opening scene with Chloe.

                           MIRANDA

             So we're even. You left that door
             open so I'd try and run, it's what
             you get off on, isn't it?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             I guess we'll find out.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                        107.





CONTINUED:





                           MIRANDA

             And yet you have to make me look
             like a suicide. With what, your
             belt?
                     (off his shrug)
             How would I get access to a belt?

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Trust me, prisoners hang themselves
             with just about anything.

                           MIRANDA

             I don't think that's going to
             satisfy you. You won't be able to
             do this clean. You have too much
             guilt inside.
SMACK! Another slap across the face. Miranda's knees
buckle. But she remains standing. Her lip trembles.

                           MIRANDA

             You're losing grasp of the
             situation. It was different with
             those girls. I bet all they did
             was cry and scream.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Don't worry, you'll scream.
                     (after a beat)
             Take off your shirt.
This throws her off.     She shoots a quick glance at the
door.

                           MIRANDA

             Aren't I a little old for you?

                            SHERIFF RYAN

             Take it off.
She hesitates.    He draws his gun, tired.    Removes the
safety.

                           MIRANDA

             That's for show. You know you
             can't shoot me.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             But I can smash your teeth out and
             make it look like you bashed your
             head against the wall. Now shut
             up, take off your goddamn shirt
             and pull off your bra.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                          108.





CONTINUED:




Miranda is petrified now.      Running out of ways to hide
it.

                            SHERIFF RYAN

             Today, Doctor.
In a sudden move, Miranda shoves the chair at him and
bolts out the door. The Sheriff doesn't move to stop
her.




INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda dashes down the hallway, trying to escape. Takes
quick inventory of the space: two more holding cells
like her own, a row of filing cabinets, and a storage
area with barred windows. She makes a turn up ahead and
reaches another gate down the corridor. A sliding gate
that closes off the cell area from the main station.
She tries the gate. Locked, naturally.       She shakes and
bangs on it, desperate.

                            MIRANDA


             TURLINGTON!!   SOMEBODY HELP ME!!

No response. And no way to disguise the sheer panic in
her voice. She fell for his trap. They're all alone
here.







INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - SAME TIME

Ryan smiles at that. Re-holsters his weapon and walks
towards her, taking his time. Relishing the hunt.

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Doug mentioned you were painfully
             'modest.' But enough about you,
             let's discuss Rachel.




INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Now Miranda searches for a place to hide.        His FOOTSTEPS

GETTING CLOSER --


                           SHERIFF RYAN (O.S.)

             She was no crippled saint. Wasn't
             the first time she turned up at
             Doug's house all messed up.




                                                     109.





ANOTHER ANGLE




Sheriff Ryan peeks down the corridor where we last saw
Miranda. The gate still locked. She's not there. He
traces her steps, clearly enjoying this:




                        SHERIFF RYAN

          Sure she was a minor, but she
          wasn't going to let that get in
          her way.




INT. STORAGE AREA - SAME TIME

Miranda is cramped underneath an upturned desk. The SHOT
is FRAMED so we can see the doorway. She prays silently:

                        MIRANDA

                  (sotto)
          Rachel, where are you when I need
          you?
Clearly not here.   Sheriff Ryan's voice getting closer:

                        SHERIFF RYAN (O.S.)

          Those other girls -- make no
          mistake -- they knew what they
          were getting into.
He appears at the doorway now, peeks inside the room.
Sensing her in there. Miranda holds her breath.

                        SHERIFF RYAN

          I'm not saying they knew they were
          going to die, but truth is, Doug and
          I didn't know it was going to end that
          way. It was just the natural extension
          of that moment. So yeah, we fucked
          them and we killed them. And we knew
          it was wrong. Sure we did.
He reaches the upturned desk and flips it over with a
CLANGING SOUND. Miranda wasn't underneath that one. She
scrambles to the door behind him as he turns --







INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

She slams the door shut on his fingers and fumbles to
slide the deadbolt behind her when the door suddenly
SMASHES OPEN against her, knocking her backwards onto the
floor --
He looms over her. She reaches around for anything to
defend herself. Nothing there. Game over --

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                       110.





CONTINUED:





                             SHERIFF RYAN

             It wasn't some satanic pact,
             society didn't make us do it. But
             I believe given the proper
             circumstances a person is capable
             of anything -- certainly in my
             line of work you see it day in,
             day out.
                      (beat)
             Tell you what, keep the shirt.
             The bra will do.
Miranda stares, helpless. The Sheriff gestures for her
to begin. Like he has all the time in the world.
Miranda slides up the wall and starts to unclasp her bra
under her shirt. Petrified --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Chin up, Doctor. You wanted to
             get to the bottom of this and you
             did. You followed it all the way
             through. This is how it ends.
His demeanor and voice are eerily calm,    as if in a
trance. He takes the bra from her hand     and hangs it
around her neck, as if helping somebody    with their tie.
She takes a step back and finds herself    pinned against
the wall --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Doug settled down once you two got
             married. New start and all that.
             Wanted nothing to do with this
             runaway I'd found, Tracy Seaver --
He squeezes the bra tightly around her throat, choking
her. She stares straight into his eyes -- her whole
body simultaneously frozen in place and shaking
uncontrollably --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Or so he claimed. Because the
             truth, Doc -- is people never
             change. The son of a bitch
             couldn't resist. I asked him to
             dump the body and instead he went
             found some barn to work her out of
             his system some more. Go fucking
             figure.
And now we PAN DOWN TO see Miranda's left hand ever so
slowly reach for his holster...

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                         111.





CONTINUED:





                           SHERIFF RYAN

             You can't count on anyone, even
             friends you've had your whole
             life.



They're so close together their noses nearly touch. He
gazes into her eyes, watching life drain out of her. He
applies one final burst of pressure, stretching her skin
to the point of no return --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             The only soul you can ever count
             on is yourself --
BLAM! A GUNSHOT rings out and half his ear explodes in a
gush of blood. He stumbles back, still on his feet,
dazed.
He looks up at Miranda with the gun trained on him.
Struggling to catch her breath. A faint smile forms on
his lips, somehow appreciative of this turn of events.

                            SHERIFF RYAN

             Why, Doctor.   That was unexpected.
He steps forward, almost playfully. She slowly shakes
her head. Wraps her fingers tightly around the
trigger --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             You sure about this?
He stares at her. Blood flowing from the side of his
head. He's now standing directly in front of Miranda's
open cell, weighing his options at triple speed --

                           SHERIFF RYAN

             You need me alive for your story
             to stick. Be logical now. You
             know you can't kill me.
He takes exactly half a step forward when Miranda drills
a BULLET through his forehead. Sheriff Ryan splays
backwards and lands with a crash.

                           MIRANDA

             Logic is overrated.




INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

The door to Tracy's room is closed. WE FIND Pete where
we left him, by the soda machine, fighting to stay awake.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                      112.





CONTINUED:




MOVING TOWARD him, we COME TO REST ON the back of his
neck. So TIGHT we can actually see the hairs on the back
of his neck. And as he feels the SWOOSH of a cold
whisper, they stand up on their ends.



Pete turns to Tracy's room to notice that the door is now
open. Strange. He stands up and walks to the door.




INT. RECOVERY ROOM #1

Pete looks oddly around the room.

                           PETE

             Anybody in here -- ?
As he turns, we REVEAL Rachel slipping out of the room.
Unseen by him, of course. Pete starts to exit when Tracy
opens her eyes. Groggily waking as if from a dream.

                             TRACY SEAVER

             Hello -- ?







EXT. COUNTY POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Turlington comes out of his cruiser, carrying a bag of
take-out food. Chatting with his colleagues.




INT. HALLWAY TO SHERIFF RYAN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Turlington raps on the Sheriff's door and opens it.

                             OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Sheriff Ryan?
No sight of the man.  That's odd. Maybe he's in the
bathroom. Turlington heads in that direction.




INT. MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Turlington peeks in.      checks the stalls.

                             OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Sheriff?
Nobody. He notices the back window is open because
raindrops are blown in by the wind. He looks out to the
parking lot for a moment before shutting it.




                                                      113.





INT. POLICE STATION - CORRIDOR




The FRONT DESK OFFICER is trying to hold back a grim Pete,
Parsons and Teddy Howard from heading to the back area.

                        FRONT DESK OFFICER

          I'm sorry, but nobody is allowed
          to visit at this hour --

                        PETE

          Is the Sheriff here or isn't he?

                        OFFICER TURLINGTON

                  (reaching the scene)
          Help you, gentlemen?

                        PETE

          We're here to see Miranda Grey.

                        OFFICER TURLINGTON

          You know full well you're not
          allowed to see --
Teddy Howard slaps an official-looking document on him.

                        TEDDY HOWARD

          That's straight from Judge
          Wilkinson. Take us to her cell.

                        FRONT DESK OFFICER

          Better get the Sheriff out here.
Turlington looks over the paperwork, confused.

                        OFFICER TURLINGTON

          Sheriff Ryan isn't here. His car
          is gone too.

                        PARSONS

          Officer, unlock the goddamn door
          to Miranda's cell or I'll break it
          down myself.
Turlington is not used to being spoken to this way,
certainly not by upstanding directors of psychiatric
institutes. He leads the men down the corridor and
unlocks the cell. The men wait as all three locks are
dutifully undone and then the heavy door is slid open.
The men look inside and instantly stop in their tracks.




INT. HOLDING CELL

Sheriff Ryan, splayed.   Very dead.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                           114.

                           OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Jesus H. Christ.
Teddy Howard has to look away. Pete places his hand on
Parsons' shoulder. Parsons simply glares at the dead
man, eyes filled with hatred.
No sign of Miranda anywhere.        Vanished.   Like Houdini.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:





EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY

CAMERA SOARS THROUGH the tall gates, PAST the guard, PAST
the sprinklers watering the impressive gardens. A
TAXICAB pulls up.

SUPERIMPOSE:     SIX MONTHS LATER

A healthier, much happier-looking Chloe shakes Pete's
hand at the front steps. Small suitcase by her side.

                           CHLOE

             Thank you for everything, Dr.
             Graham. I'll never forget all
             you've done for me.

                           PETE

             It's been my pleasure, Miss
             McGrath. Good luck out there.
Chloe smiles.     Awkward.   Her first day out in the real
world.

                           CHLOE

             Well, I guess this is it. I hope
             not to see you again unless it's
             for coffee or something.

                           PETE

             Hey, you never know. It's a small
             world, unless you have to clean it.
Chloe picks up her bag, climbs down the steps to her cab.
Stops midway, turns:

                           CHLOE

             You don't have to tell me if you
             don't want to, but -- have you
             ever heard anything from -- ?
Pete shakes his head. Chloe nods, climbs inside the cab.
Pete waves as it drives off. Then he pulls out a postcard
from his pocket. It has a New York City postmark.




                                                      115.





INSERT - POSTCARD





                        MIRANDA (V.O.)

          Dear Pete. Hope this finds you on
          both feet, preferably having been
          promoted to director after Phil's
          retirement. Not that you had much
          competition, but a big hug to you
          anyway... I was as surprised as
          anyone to read about Sheriff
          Ryan's suicide and the startling
          discovery that it was he who
          murdered my late husband. I wish
          I could personally thank certain
          people for their convincing
          testimonies in the case.




NEWSPAPER HEADLINES

questioning," with a picture of Miranda underneath.
B) "Guilt-ridden serial killer killed accomplice, then

          As for myself, I have a new name
          now and a job working with teenage
          girls at a runaway shelter, trying
          to keep an open mind at the
          horrors they tell me...







EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

BOOM DOWN TO a young woman kneeling down to set flowers
on a grave and we recognize her as Tracy Seaver.
Shockingly cleaned up and properly attired -- she's even
cute.

                        MIRANDA (V.O.)

          Which reminds me: Consuelo the
          Cuban witch is a keeper, don't
          fire her. She knows things about
          the world you and I don't.

PULL BACK to see the gave is Rachel's, and it is
positively overflowing with flowers. She's become
something of a cause celeb in these parts. Tracy walks
back to the retired couple holding hands, Phil and
Dorothy Parsons.

                           MIRANDA (V.O.)

             Well, gotta run now, I have some
             country songs to write and lots of
             social invites to decline...
STILL PULLING BACK THROUGH the lush cemetery, PAST
several trees until we find Rachel watching the serene
scene. She turns TO CAMERA now and we PUSH INTO her
eyes, finally at peace, until it FILLS the SCREEN and in
it we see...




EXT. BLEEKER STREET (NYC) - DAY

Miranda walking among the throng of pedestrians. She
looks confident, relaxed, down to earth. No longer the
tightly wound professional at the beginning of our story.

                           MIRANDA (V.O.)

             P.S. And in case you're wondering
             what the chances are of me buying
             you a beer and maybe finishing
             something we almost started, the
             answer is: it's just not going to
             happen. Especially not at
             McSorley's next Friday night. Say
             around nine. So you probably
             shouldn't bother showing up. All
             my love, M.G.

          HONG KONG - AN OUTDOOR MARKETPLACE
          Crowded. Filled with oriental and British merchants.
          You can buy anything here. Electronics. Food. Any-
          thing.

          RAND PELTZER
          walks through the owd. An American businessman.1-He
          wears a tas eful g3,y suit. He's thin, with distinguished
          good looks and thin brown hair. He's 56 years old.
          Rand looks around; fascinated by the vast array of people
          and merchandise. He stops at a booth. A tiny ORIENTAL,
          WOMAN stands behind the counter. Rand gives her a polite
          smile.

          RAND
          Hi. I'm from out of town...
          on business from the U.S.
          The woman nods and smiles.

          AN ORIENTAL MAN
          passes by. He is very old. Deep wrinkles. Long white
          hair. Ragged clothes. A rotted smile. Overhearing
          Rand, the man stops to eavesdrop.

          RAND
          (explaining to
          Oriental woman)
          I'm looking for a present...
          for my son.
          The woman nods. She searches through her wares. She
          holds up a basketball. Rand shakes his head.

          RAND
          He's not really involved in
          sports...
          The woman puts away the basketball. She picks up a Sony
          "Walkman". Rand again shakes his head.,

          RAND
          No. I want something unusual...
          something he can't get at home...
          something different..

          
          

          .2.

          A HAND
          reaches out and grabs Rand's arm. Startled, he turns.
          The Oriental man stands before him. He stares into Rand's
          eyes.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          I can help you.
          He leads Rand away from the booth.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          I offer something very different.
          Very unusual.
          Rand is puzzled. The Oriental leads him to a doorway.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          Follow me.
          He opens the door, motioning for Rand to follow. Rand
          pauses, skeptical.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          Come. Take a look. It will cost
          you nothing.
          (a beat)
          You won't be disappointed.
          The Oriental enters. Rand shrugs and follows.

          INSIDE
          Rand follows the man up a narrow, dark set of stairs.
          At the top, they enter a room.

          INT. ROOM

          Dark. No windows. No furniture. Filled with cardboard
          boxes and wooden crates.
          Rand crinkles his nose. It su,Qlls bad in here.
          The Oriental flips on a dim light bulb. He leads the
          nervous, apprehensive Rand to a dark corner of the room.
          The Oriental picks up a small, metal box. A HIGH PITCHED
          GIGGLE echoes from inside the box.

          

          

          

          

          3.
          Rand is very puzzled.
          The Oriental rests the box on a stack of crates. He opens
          the box.
          A TINY CREATURE is inside'.
          The animal is eleven inches tall and stands; upright on
          two legs. It has two arms, with small; four-fingered
          hands. Its body is covered with fluffy brown fur. The
          piercing eyes are big, sad. Its ears are long and pointed.
          A tiny black nose sits above a wide mouth, with small,
          square teeth.
          The creature is smiling. It lets out a giggle.
          Rand is delighted and surprised. He's never seen anything
          like this. The animal is more charming than a Disney
          character.
          The Oriental claps his hands.
          The creature leaps from the box, onto Rand's shoulder.
          The animal licks Rand's cheek.' He laughs, amused by the
          creature.
          The Oriental claps his hands again.
          The creature hops back into the box. It stares at Rand
          with those cute green eyes'.

          RAND
          (to the Oriental)
          What is it?

          ORIENTAL MAN
          It is called ' Mogwai ' .
          (a beat)
          A very rare and intelligent animal.
          I found it in the fields near my
          home It will obey all orders.
          It learns fast.
          The Oriental looks at Mogwai and claps his hands.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          (Chinese,; English

          SUBTITLES)

          

          

          

          

          4
          --Mogwai leaps to the ground. It scurries across the floor,
          to a wooden crate.
          Mogwai removes a raw tuna from the crate. It tears off a
          chunk of the fish and carries it to the oriental man..
          He takes the fish. Mogwai hops back into the box.
          Rand shakes his head. Amazed by the animal.
          he Oriental takes a bit from the raw fish. Juice runs
          own his chin. He smiles at Rand.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          And if you are ever in need of
          a song...
          He claps his hands to the creature.

          ORIENTAL MAN.
          (Chinese; English

          SUBTITLES)
          Music.
          Mogwai begins to hum, in an unearthly falsetto. It's
          beautiful.
          Rand watches with wide eyes. He feels like a child again.

          RAND -
          How much?

          ORIENTAL MAN
          One hundred American Dollars.
          Cash.
          Rand removes five twenties from his wallet. He gives
          them to the man.
          The Oriental smiles and claps his hands. Mogwai jumps
          onto Rand's shoulders. Rand pets it. Mogwai emits a cute
          giggle.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          It never sleeps. It will eat any-
          thing... but prefers raw meat.

          (PAUSE)
          It must always be kept indoors during
          the day. It lives in shadow. It
          hates bright light. Direct sunlight
          will kill it.
          Rand nods. He takes Mogwai from his shoulder and puts it
          into the box. Rand puts the box under his arm. The
          Oriental smiles

          

          

          

          

          ORIENTAL MAN
          Your son will enjoy his new friend.
          Rand smiles and exits. The Oriental takes a bite from
          his raw fish.

          INT. HONG KONG AIRPORT

          Rand is on the pay telephon His baggage rests beside
          him.
          Mogwai is inside of a small plastic pet box. The creature's
          bright eyes shine from inside.

          RAND
          (into the phone)
          Yes, Fred. The Tai-Chan account
          is definite. MmmHmm. My plane
          l eaves in twenty minutes. See
          you in Pennsylvania.
          He hangs up. He picks up his bags and walks to the check-
          in counter.

          THE CHECK-IN GIRL
          tags Mogwai's box and puts it on the conveyer belt.
          Rand watches the box disappear through the baggage chute.

          CHECK-IN GIRL
          Don't worry, sir. Your pet will
          be safe.
          Rand smiles.

          Rand is eating his airline dinner. AN ORIENTAL STEWARDESS
          walks up and refills his coffee. He looks at her.
          with the word 'Mogwai'?

          She nods.

          RAND
          What does it mean?

          STEWARDESS
          Devil.
          She moves to the next passenger.
          Rand stares. Surprised. Confused.

          a bank teller, writes out a receipt for a customer.

          

          

          

          

          7.
          Billy is 26 years old. His sturdy build and good looks are
          buried beneath wire rimmed glasses, slicked dirty-blonde
          .hair, a red sweater vest, a loose fitting checkered shirt,
          baggy corduroys and worn loafers.
          râ¢ Finishing the transaction with his customer, Billy looks to
          the line of waiting people.

          BILLY
          Next.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          an elderly woman, walks to Billy's window. She's a real
          prude. Tight lips. Heavy make-up. Bleached hair. Cheap
          fur coat. She hands Billy a personal check.

          another teller, works beside Billy. Tracy is pretty. Big
          brown eyes. A sexy smile. Long dark hair. Perfect figure.
          25 years old.
          Tracy counts out some cash to a customer. She's trying

          cult when

          GARY LUCIA
          the bank security guard, is trying to make her laugh. He
          stands by the bank entrance, making funny faces at Tracy.
          Gary is 30 years old. Former high school jock. Dark,
           thick hair. Deep brown eyes. Muscular. A strong, handsome
          face.
          Meanwhile, Billy gives the check back to Mrs. Deagle.

          BILLY
          I can't cash this, M'am. Your
          last check hasn't cleared.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          Don't you recognize me?

          BILLY
          No, M'am. I'm sorry...

          

          

          

          

          8.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          (loud, so everyone can

          HEAR)
          My name is Mrs. Julia Deagle! My
          husband manages the.Sparkle Market!
          We've been banking here for sixteen
          years!

          c eck hasn't cleared and...

          MRS. DEAGLE
          That's the problem with this world.
          It's a mess because of people like

          BILLY
          It's not my.fault your check didn't
          clear, M'am,

          MRS. DEAGLE
          Don't get smart with me, oung man.

          BILLY
          I wasn't getting smart, I was...

          MRS. DEAGLE
          (shouting,-looking

          AROUND)
          Where's the president? I want to
          see the bank president!
          Billy rubs his eyes. Tense. Embarrassed.
          Everyone watches the scene. Tracy. Gary. The customers.

          ROLAND FRESCO
          the bank's Vice President, walks over to Billy and Mrs.
          beagle. Roland is tall, slender with thin grey hair and
          a pencil thin moustache. Friendliness and courtesy are
          his job. He smiles at Mrs. Deagle.

          ROLAND
          What seems to be the problem,
          M'am?

          MRS. DEAGLE
          My name is Mrs. Julia Deagle. This
          young teller is being very rude! I
          demand that you fire him!

          

          

          

          

          9
          Roland looks at Billy. Billy rolls his eyes. Roland
          smiles.

          ROLAND

          (COMFORTING)
          Now,-Mrs. Deagle...I'm sure this
          isn't that serious. I'm sure an
          apology would fix things right
          up. Wouldn't it?
          The woman shrugs.' Roland turns to Billy.

          ROLAND
          Apologize to the woman, Billy.
          Billy leans to Roland.

          BILLY
          (angry whisper)
          I. didn't do anything wrong.

          AA;

          ROLAND
          (doesn't care, the
          customer comes first)
          Just apologize.
          Roland.leans back and smiles at Mrs. Deagle.
          Billy looks at her. He doesn'-t want to do this.
          Everyone in the bank is watching him, waiting for him
          to take a stand.
          Billy sighs. He needs his job.

          BILLÂ°
          (forcing himself)
          I'm sorry, Mrs. Deagle.
          She nods and smiles. Roland puts his hand on the woman's
          shoulder.

          ROLAND
          Come back to my desk, Mrs. Deagle.
          I'll personally take care of your
          banking problems.
          Roland walks back to his office with Mrs. Deagle.
          Gary chuckles. Tracy goes back to work.
          Billy just sits. Angry. Humiliated. He calls the next
          customer.

          King". He walks to the bank lobby.

          TRACY
          stands in the lobby, putting on.her coat. Billy moves to
          help her.

          BILLY
          Let me.
          He helps her on with the coat.

          BILLY

          Gary walks up. He puts his arm through Tracy's.

          GARY
          Let's go. I'm hungry.
          (notices Billy)
          Hey, Peltzer...Whydidn't you stand.

          GARY
          What's this?

          BILLY
          It's a book. You read 1t.
          Billy exchanges a smile with Tracy. Gary isn't amused.

          GARY

          what's it about?

          C'mon. Let's go.
          Tracy gives a wave to Billy. She and Gary walk away.
          Billy watches. He draws an imaginary sword from his side.
          He lifts the sword and lunges forward. At Gary.
          Billy sits at a table. Alone. He's reading his book. He
          eats, but his wide eyes never leave the page. He's fas-
          cinated by the story. Like a child. He gets to a funny
          section.. He laughs.

          That's the kind of guy who'll shoot
          a president.

          Real weirdo.

          Billy continues to read, totally caught up in his book.
          Totally caught up in his fantasy.

          Billy drives home from work. He moves slow. The snow
          still falls. The roads are icy.

          CAR RADIO (V.0.)
          .And the snow keeps coming, folks.
          Looks like we're gonna have a White
          Christmas. Another three inches is
          expected tonight...
          Billy looks out of his side window and sees

          PETE FOUNTANE
          walking home from school. Pete is 16 years old. A chunky,
           pleasant baby faced kid. With his bright orange down jacket,
          Pete resembles a tiny snowman.
          Suddenly, Pete.slips on the ice. Bam. Right on his ass.
          His school books scatter over the ground.

          

          

          

          

          13.
          Billy stops the car. He gets out and hurries to Pete.

          BILLY
          Pete...You okay?
          Pete nods. Billy helps him up. Pete brushes himself off.
          Billy is amused by the boy.

          BILLY
          You want a ride home?

          PETE
          Thanks. That'd be nice.
          Billy helps Pete pick up his schoolbooks.

          Lancelot raises Excalibur and...
          Wham! He knocks the Black Knight
          down ! Then with-another swing...
          Wham! He finishes him off!

          PETE
          (impressed by
          Billy's storytelling)
          Wow...
          Billy digs into his pocket and gives Pete the copy of
          "Once And Future King".

          BILLY
          Here. You can borrow it.
          Pete takes the book.

          PETE
          Hey, Billy...You know so much about
          Vikings and stuff...You should
          write one of these stories yourself.

          

          

          

          

          14.

          PETE

          BILLY

          (CHUCKLES)
          I've only got about 70 pages done...
          But as soon as it's published, you'll
          get one of the first copies. Speci-
          ally autographed by the author.
          Pete smiles. Billy makes a turn. He pulls into the parking
          lot of

          DOUGAL'S ANTIQUES
          A huge, three story home, with an antique shop set up on
          the first floor.
          Billy and Pete get out of the car and enter the store.

          DORRY DOUGAL
          the 64 year old storekeeper, stands behind the counter.
          Dorry is husky, bald on top, with thick patches of red hair
          on his temples. A huge, red moustache sits beneath his
          bulbous nose. His arms are thick, hairy. A strong Irish-
          man.

          DORRY
          Good afternoon to you, Billy.

          BILLY
          Hi, Dorry.
          (eyes light)
          Is it ready yet?
          Dorry smiles. He reaches to a shelf behind the counter.
          He removes ,a long object, wrapped in a piece of green cloth.
          He rests it on the counter.

          

          

          

          

          15
          Billy watches with.wide eyes. Pete is curious.
          Dorry slowly unwraps the object. Inside the cloth, is a
          long silver sword, with a gleaming blade and an engraved
          steel.holster.. - Pete is impressed..

          DORRY
          (to Pete)
          It's an authentic replica of an
          Eleventh Century sword.
          Billy's eyes examine every inch of the sword. It's
          beautiful.

          DORRY
          I got most of the rust off...But
          there were a couple spots that
          wouldn't budge.
          Billy runs his finger along the blade.

          DORRY
          Careful. It's sharp.
          A big smile covers Billy's face.- He's in love with the
          sword.

          BILLY
          What do I owe you?

          DORRY
          Two hundred. You can pay me twenty
          a week.
          Billy pulls a twenty from his wallet and pays Dorry.
          Billy carefully wraps the sword and puts it under his
          arm.

          BILLY
          Thanks, Dorry.

          DORRY
          My pleasure, son.
          Billy and Pete exit the store.

          Billy sits at the table, eating dinner with Lynn.

          LYNN
          How was work?

          BILLY
          Okay.

          LYNN
          Have you asked that Tracy girl
          out yet?

          LYNN
          I was just curious.

          Yeah,.well it's none of your

          Nervous,Lynn popsvalfum with her wine.

          (OFFENDED)
          I guess it's none of my business
          that your clothes are washed and
          ironed, or that you have a hot
          meal on the table...

          BILLY
          No. It isn't. I'm old enough
          to take care of that stuff myself.
          I'm old enough to get a place of
          my own.

          LYNN
          Don't start that again. Your
          Father's coming home tonight.

          BILLY
          Good. I think we should talk
          about it.

          LYNN
          It'll put him in a bad mood.

          BILLY
          No, it'll put you in a bad mood.
          Lynn and Billy exchange a glare. They look down at their
          food.
          A few silent, uncomfortable moments pass.
          Lynn looks back to Billy. She smiles. Time for the
          tender approach. She touches his hand.

          LYNN
          Billy, honey...

          BILLY
          (moves his hand
          from hers)

          have to struggle like we did.
          We want to help, until you can

          year to finish my novel. . .and what
          if it doesn't get published?

          LYNN
          It'll get published.

          BILLY
          But what if it doesn't? Are you
          gonna take care of me until I'm
          old and grey, working on my 25th
          unpublished novel?...

          LYNN
          If it takes that long, yes.

          to 'leave now! I rve got to try and
          make it on my own now!
          Before Lynn.can reply, A VOICE INTERRUPTS.

          RAND (O . S . )
          Is anybody home?
          Lynn stands and whispers to Billy.

          LYNN
          Please, let's forget about this.
          Just for tonight. Okay?
          Billy pauses. Finally gives in and nods.
          Lynn stands. She pops another valium and exits to greet
          her husband. We hear them, exchange an excited ".hello".
          They kiss and laugh, glad to be in each other's arms.
          Billy just sits. Burning.

          Suitcases rest on the floor.' Beside them, is, Mogwai's
          plastic case.
          Billy enters. Rand sees him.

          RAND

          Billy .. ,
          Billy walks to his Father. They embrace.

          BILLY
          (happy to see him)
          Hi, Dad.
          They hold each other for a second. Lynn closes the front
          door. Rand picks up Mogwai's case. Lynn turn's to her
          husband.

          RAND
          (takes Lynn's hand)
          Not now. I've got a surprise for
          both of you. Come on.
          He leads them into the living room. Lynn and. Billy exchange
          a puzzled glance. They follow Rand.

          INT. LIVING ROOM

          Rand dims the lights. He motions for Billy and Lynn to
          sit on the sofa. They do. Barney sits on Billy's lap.
          Rand sits in front of them, on a leather easy chair. He
          rests Mogwai's case on his lap. He opens the case.
          Mogwai leaps out, onto the coffee table.
          Lynn and'Bill are startled. They stare at the creature in
          wonderment.
          Barney hates it. He growls at Mogwai.

          

          

          

          

          21.
          Rand lights a cigarette. He turns to Mogwai and claps
          his hands. The creature picks up an ash tray and carries
          it to Rand. Mogwai hops onto Rand's lap.
          Lynn and Billy are amazed...

          BILLY
          (staring at Mogwai)
          What is it? A.monkey? A rat?.

          RAND
          Your new pet.

          BILLY

          (UNCERTAIN)
          Mj Oh, yeah?...
          Mogwai starts to sing, humming in that unearthly falsetto.

          BILLY
          What's that?

          RAND
          He's singing.

          BILLY
          Sounds kind of creepy.
          Barney still growls.

          RAND
          Barney! Be a good dog and go up-
          stairs!
          Barney reluctantly hops off Billy's lap and exits.
          Lynn stares at Mogwai.

          LYNN
          I think he's just darling.
          Mogwai.
          Rand holds the creature out to Billy.

          RAND
          Hold him.

          BILLY
          (inching back)
          Maybe later.

          RAND
          C'mon. He won't bite.
          Billy forces himself to take the creature. Mogwai nestles
          close to Billy. Rand smiles at his son.

          RAND
          He likes you.
          Billy looks nauseous. Lynn stands.

          LYNN
          You two look so cute together.
          I have to take a picture.
          Lynn walks to a nearby drawer, opens it and removes-a
          Kodak Instamatic.
          Mogwai is on Billy's shoulder, licking his cheek.. Billy
          hates it.

          RAND -
          I want you to take good care
          of him.
          Lynn focuses the camera on Billy and Mogwai.

          LYNN
          Okay smile.
          Billy forces a smile. Mogwai still licks his cheek.
          Lynn snaps the picture. Flash!
          Mogwai lets out a high scream. Frightened of the bright
          light, Mogwai jumps back, accidentally scratching Billy's
          cheek.

          BILLY
          Little bastard.
          Mogwai scurries back to Rand. He pets the creature,
          comforting it

          

          

          

          

          11 23.
          Settle down, Billy-There's no
          reason to get upset. The little
          fellow's scared. He hates bright
          light..
          Billy shrugs. He wipes his fingers along the scratch on
          his face. He looks -at t em.
          There's blood on hisï¿½4ingertips.
          Billy looks at Mogwai.
          The creature looks at Billy. It giggles.

          INT. BILLY'S ROOM - LATER

          Billy sits at his desk, working on his novel. His typing
          is fast, intense. A small desk lamp lights.his working
          area.
          Mogwai watches Billy. from the darkness of the book shelves.
          Above Billy., The creature begins to sing.
          Billy tries to ignore Mogwai's singing. No good. It gets
          on his nerves. Billy slams his hand on the desk top. He
          glares at the creature.

          BILLY
          Shut up.
          Mogwai stops singing. Billy goes back to his writing.
          Mogwai.hops from the shelf. Staying out of the direct
          light, the creature moves across the desktop and cuddles
          up to Billy's arm. He jumps back.

          BILLY
          Get off of me.
          Mogwai just looks at him.

          BILLY
          Get.off`my desk.
          Billy shines the bright.desk light into the creature's
          eyes. Mogwai screams and jumps. off the desk, to the floor.
          Billy looks down at the creature.

          Billy goes back to his work.
          Mogwai is-bored. The creature leaps up to the bed.. It
          sees the sword. Mogwai lifts one end, examining it. It's
          too heavy. The sword slips off the bed and falls to the
          floor.
          Billy turns.
          Mogwai takes a step back. Guilty. Frightened.
          Billy picks up the sword. The handle is chipped.

          BILLY
          (angry, to Mogwai)
          You stupid little...
          Billy raises the sword over.Mogwai. He's ready to kill
          the tiny creature.
          Mogwai loo] .s up at Billy. The creature is shivering. It
          is frightened. It's big, green eyes are watery.
          Billy suddenly feels sympathetic. He lowers the sword and
          picks up the.creature.

          BILLY

          (TENDER)
          I'm sorry.. .just try to be more
          careful.
          Billy holds Mogwai to his chest. He's petting it, com-

          BILLY
          Starting work early today?

          TRACY
          Oh, hi. Well, I thought the
          roads would be icy.

          BILLY
          We've got a half hour before

          â¢be able to quit the bank.

          TRACY
          I'd love to quit. I'd run straight
          to the airport and buy a one way
          ticket to Paris.

          BILLY
          Why Paris?

          I've only seen it in movies and
          T.V... . But it seems like it's
          got everything that this town
          doesn't...Museums...great restaur
          ants... Beautiful artworks and
          architecture...
          (embarr-a s-s-ed )
          Listen to me, talking like I've
          been there 10 times. I shouldn't
          get so carried away. It's only a
          dream.

          BILLY
          Hey...Don't give up on your dreams.
          They just might come true.
          Tracy shrugs and takes a sip of coffee.

          BILLY
          Can I ask you a personal question?
          (Tracy nods)
          What is it with you and Gary? Is
          he your boyfriend?

          TRACY
          He thinks he is.

          BILLY
          Do you think he is?

          TRACY
          No. I think of him more as a friend.
          But he thinks of me as a lot more.

          BILLY
          So there's a possibility...I mean...
          I.just might have a chance with you?

          TRACY
          (smiles),
          Don't give up on your dreams. They
          just might come true.

          pl)ants_ ith a.spray bottle.,
          Mggwai's case sits on the ed. The creature is inside.
          Billy finishes his watering. He sits at his desk. He
          takes adrink from glass of milk and snacks from a plate
          of brownies. He proofreads some pages from his novel.

          PETE (O.S.)
          Hello? Is anybody home?

          BILLY

          (SHOUTS)
          n here, Pete.
          Billy holds the tray of brownies to him.

          BILLY
          Want some?

          PETE _
          I'm s'posed to be on a diet...
          He grabs a brownie. He notices Mogwai's case.

          PETE
          What's in there?
          Pete walks over and opens the case. Mogwai hops out, onto
          the bed. The creature giggles. Pete is, taken aback.

          PETE
          What is it?

          BILLY
          A present from my Dad.
          Pete picks up the creature and pets it. Pete likes Mogwai.

          PETE
          It's neat.
          Billy shrugs. Mogwai sees the brownies. The creature hops
          from Pete's hands, onto the desk. Mogwai grabs a brownie
          and starts to eat.

          

          

          

          

          28.

          PETE
          Hey, Billy.. .You think I might
          be able to borrow it? Just for
          a night?

          BILLY
          I dunno, Pete...

          PETE
          C'mon...My Mom will never know.
          I'll hide it under my bed.
          Pete reaches down to pick up Mogwai. His hand clumsily
          knocks over the water bottle.
          A few drops of water splash Mogwai.
          The creature arches its back and lets out a high pitched
          scream.
          Billy is surprised. Pete takes a step back. Scared.
          Mogwai tenses up. The spots on its body that were hit with
          water begin to bubble... .expand...'
          Billy can't believe his eyes.
          Mogwai writhes in pain. The spots on its body expand more,
          getting bigger, bigger.. .ready to explode.
          Billy and Pete stare. Fascinated.
          The spots burst.

          FOUR NEW CREATURES
          popout. Clones of Mogwai.
          The spots on Mogwai's body bond together and disappear, as
          if they were never there.
          There are now five identical creatures on the desktop.
          Billy and Pete share a shocked glance.
          Billy grabs the water bottle. He has to be certain that
          he wasn't halucinating. He splashes a little more water
          on one of the new creatures.
          The process begins again. The creature's body,contorts.
          A few lumps form. The lumps expand until...they burst.

          THREE MORE CREATURES ARE BORN.
          Billy tries to make sense out of it all.
          EIGHT CREATURES stand on.the desk top, examining their
          new world.
          Billy picks up his glass of milk. He splashes some milk
          on one of the crealtures.
          Nothing happens.

          BILLY
          They must only multiply with plain
          tap water.

          Wow..â¢.thisâ¢is better than "Twilight Zone ( )
          Pete looks at Billy.

          PETE
          Now can I have one?

          BILLY
          (still dazed)
          Huh? Well, yeah. I guess so.
          Pete grabs one of the creatures, taking it from the group.
          It cries out. In a high, piercing scream.
          The other creatures leap at Pete. They grab the creature
          and bring it back to their group.

          PETE

          (SCARED)
          Maybe I won't take one.
          The creatures have moved to the brownies. They rip the
          brownies to pieces, devouring them. They're giggling.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Rand sits in a chair, opposite Billy. The 8 creatures

          these things.

          RAND
          We know they're cute.. We know.."
          they're intelligent. And now we
          know they multiply by water.

          BILLY

          over there, we're not gonna;getjten

          A creature licks Rand's ear. He chuckles.

          All I know, is that I've got a million
          dollars sitting in my lap.

          BILLY
          Huh?

          RAND
          I'm going to market these things.

          word gets out. Everyone will want
          a Mogwai of their very own.

          BILLY
          Don't you think we should have them
          checked out first? Just to make
          sure...

          The sun rises behind the house. Snow is falling.

          INT. ATTIC

           The tr p door opens. Billy and Rand climb inside. They
           .both carry flashlights.
          They s ine the lights through the attic, looking for the
          creatu es. They see nothing.
           Billy spots something. He nudges his Father.
           There are NINE INDIVIDUAL PODS, stuck to various places-on
          the floor. The pods are 16 inches long, 12 inches in dia-
           meter. They are wrapped with a vein-like wire and covered
          with a thick, syrupy glaze.

          RAND
          What in the hell?...
          Billy picks up a broomstick andl pokes one of the things.
          Won't budge. Hard as a rock.

          BILLY
          Damn things are stuck to the
          floor.
          Rand picks up a baseball bat. He raises it over his head
          and swings down, hard. Against the pod.
          The bat snaps in two.
          The pod is unblemished.
          Rand rubs his stinging hands. Billy and Rand just look
          at each other. Puzzled.

          ROY
          Exactly. Those things in the
          attic-are cocoons. Inside,. the
          creatures are going through some
          sort of change...a metamorphosis.

          BILLY
          Why did they attack my dog?

          ROY
          Simple. They're animals. They
          were hungry. Aside from water,
          food is their main concern.

          RAND
          How long until they hatch?

          ROY
          A week...a month...I really can't
          say.

          BILLY

          I'm not waiting around to find
          out.

          ROY
          Billy, don't be hasty...You've
          stumbled onto a new life form.
          What comes out of those cocoons
          could be a major scientific
          discovery...

          BILLY
          Screw'science. I want them des-
          troyed.

          a point...

          Dad, they killed Barney. Or
          have you already forgotten?

          CAMERA PANS UP TO
          RAND. He's holding the gas torch, aiming it at the cocoon.
          Billy stands beside him. They're inside-theattic.
          Rand shuts off the torch. He touches the cocoon. It
          appears unharmed.

          RAND
          Not even warm.
          (shakes his head,

          SURPRISED)
          They're indestructible.

          BILLY
          Now what do we do?

          RAND
          I get back from Seattle on
          Wednesday. I'll call some con-
          struction people. They'll come
          in next week and cut these things
          out of the floor.

          BILLY
          I don't think we should wait. Let's
          do it ourselves.

          RAND
          No. It's late. I've got an early
          plane to catch.

          (PAUSE)
          The attic door is locked. There are
          no windows up here. Nothing can get
          in or out.
          Rand pats Billy on the back.

          RAND
          Son, you've got to stop worrying.

          INSIDE
          Billy sees Lynn's body. She lies on the floor. Dead.
          Billy walks to her.
          Lynn is covered with bites and scratches.
          Billy looks away. Angry. Saddened.
          He notices the cocoons. All hatched.
          Sounds echo from downstairs. Thumps. Giggles.
          Billy's face goes white with fear. There's more.
          He dashes out of the attic.

          UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
          Billy walks slowly. Clutching his sword. Ready for an
          attack.
          He descends the stairs.

          A CREATURE
          leaps from the overhead chandelier. It lands on Billy's
          back.
          The creature tries to bite Billy's neck.
          Billy slams his blade 'nto Mogwai. He whacks the creature.
          Again and again.
          Finally, Mogwai falls to the floor.
          Billy brings down his blade. Hard.
          It slices Mogwai's head off. The creature's body quivers.
          It dies.
          Billy moves to the living room.

          LIVING ROOM

          flash.
          Billy enters.

          AN OBJECT
          flies at Billy from across the room. He ducks.
          A DINNER PLATE smashes against the wall behind him.
          Billy looks to the

          CHINA CABINET.
          A CREATURE sits on the middle shelf. Giggling. It throws
          another plate at-Billy.
          He bats the plate away with his sword.
          Mogwai continues to throw plates at him.
          Billy dodges the plates, making his way to the China Cabinet.
          There, he lunges forward with his sword. Bullseye. Mogwai
          is stabbed. Straight through the chest.

          The creature screams, writhing in pain. It falls from the
          China shelf to the floor. Dead.
          Billy slowly moves across the room. His eyes dart back
          and forth, looking for creatures.'
          He walks by the fireplace.
          Three large RED VELVET STOCKINGS hang from the mantle.
          Each one is inscribed with a name: BILLY, RAND and LYNN.

          A-CREATURE
          pops out of each stocking. Growling. Snarling.
          Startled, Billy jumps back.
          The three creatures hop to the floor and move towards

          BILLY:
          He clutches his sword. Tight.
          Two creatures leap at him.
          He spears one in mid-air.
          He quickly spins around, knocking the other Mogwai to the
          ground. He stabs the creature in the throat. He twists
          the sword until Mogwai chokes to death on its own blood.
          The remaining creature attaches itself to Billy's leg.
          It takes a bite from his calf.
          Billy cries out in pair.
          Mogwai stays on. Biting hard.
          Billy kicks his leg near the fireplace.
          Scared of the firelight, Mogwai lets go.
          Billy stabs the creature.. He holds Mogwai in the roaring
          flames of the fireplace. Mogwai screams until it burns to
          a crisp.
          Billy removes his steaming sword.
          The charred creature collapses into the flames. Dead.
          Billy checks his leg. A small bite.
          He walks to the kitchen.

          TWO CREATURES
          are inside. They don't notice Billy.
          One has crawled into the large blender. It laps up the
          left over white icing.
          The other sits on the table. It nibbles on the Santa cookies.
          Billy looks at the bl!ende1r. It's' unplugged.
          Billy moves quickly. He dashes across the room and plugs
          in the blender. It starts with'a loud whirr.
          The startled creature spins inside.. Mogwai's screams
          die as it is chopped into a green mush.
          The remaining creature growls at Billy.
          Billy lunges forward with his sword.
          Mogwai leaps out of the way, onto the kitchen cabinet.
          Billy turns to the creature.
          Mogwai stands in front of the open microwave oven.
          Billy pokes at the creature with his sword.
          Mogwai takes a few steps back.
          Billy still pokes at Mogwai, forcing the creature into
          the oven.
          Billy quickly closes theoven door.
          Mogwai is trapped inside.

          Inside, Mogwai screams and pounds against the glass door.
          Soon, the creature falls.' Its body quivers. The armor-,.
          like skin bubbles and pops. Mogwai boils to death.
          Bill wipes the swea from hs brow and exits the kitchen.

          LIVING ROOM
          Billy enters. He looks at the dead creatures. He sighs.
          Relieved. They're all gone.
          Billy rests his sword against the wall. He picks up the
          telephone and dials "0".

          BILLY
          Yes, could you connect me with
          the Sheriff's Office?...

          A SWIFT SHADOW
          moves across the floor, behind Billy.

          BILLY

          Billy turns. Face to face with Mogwai.
          Billy glances to his sword. A few feet away. Against
          the wall.
          Mogwai takes a step closer.
          Billy reaches for the sword.
          The creature leaps and lands on Billy's chest, knocking
          him to the floor. {
          .Billy wrestles with the creature. He tries to grab the
          sword, but Mogwai is clawing and biting at him.
          Billy's hand finally reaches the sword. He snatches it.
          He brings down the blade, into the creature's arm.
          Mogwai jumps back. Wounded.
          Billy stands. He raises his sword to finish off the creature.
          Mogwai dodges theblade, jumping to the window ledge.
          Billy moves toward the creature.
          Mogwai smashes through'the window, escaping into the night.
          Billy hurries out of the house.

          OUTSIDE
          The blizzard is starting up.
          Billy arrives at the broken window. He looks to the ground
          and sees

          MOGWAI'S FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW
          They stretch across the backyards of suburbia, disappearing
          into the darkness.
          Following the footprints, Billy runs after the creature.
          a cute, blonde-haired, blue-eyed 8 year old
          backyard. She is building A snowman.

          Before Peggy can scream, Mogwai grabs her.
          The creature pulls Peggy inside the snowman.
          Peggy puts up afight. But she isn't strong enough. Her
          little feet kick as she is pulled inside of the snowman.

          BILLY(
          arrives in Peggy's backyard. He sees the young girl's
          legs kicking from the snowman's torso.
          Billy rushes over. He grabs Peggy's legs. A tug of war.
          Billy pulls Peggy out of the snowman.

          Billy quickly attacks the snowman with his sword.
          He swings and swings until "Skippy" is nothing but a pile
          of snow.
          But there is no sign of Mogwai.
          Billy spots footprints leading away from the snowman.
          Mogwai has escaped.
          Billy runs after the footprints.
          Peggy watches him disappear around the corner of the house.
          Peggy's Mother opens the door. She is puzzled by the pile of

          BILLY
          sits in front of the two men. A serious, helpless look
          covers his face.
          Frank leans toward Billy.

          FRANK
          (holding back a

          LAUGH)
          Let me get this straight... You're
          telling me that 'little monsters'
          are multiplying by the hundreds,
          down at the 'Y'?

          BILLY
          Yes... that's right...

          FRANK
          These little things killed your
          Mother and the Fountane boy?
          Billy nods.

          FRANK
          And they eat human flesh?

          BILLY
          (nods, displaying
          the bite on his

          CALF)
          They did this.

          BILLY
          It wasn't a dog, sir.

          (NERVOUS)
          Look... these things are deadly
          when they're alone. but if a
          couple hundred get loose.. . They'll
          be hungry. Real hungry. They'll

          Frank looks at Billy.

          FRANK
          Look, Billy...We all know that you
          have a very active imagination. My
          brother told me about the books you
          read down there at the bank ...Now,
          Dungeons and Dragons are fine if
          you're five years old, but...
          Billy stands. Upset.

          BILLY
          My Mother is dead. So is my friend.
          I am not imagining things.
          Billy glares at Frank. The Sheriff sighs. He looks at
          Officer Brent.

          FRANK
          Brent, go with Peltzer...check
          out the 'Y'...then his house.

          BILLY

          Sheriff... you should radio for

          FRANK

          Listen P?ltzer, now you're getting
          me pissed off. You're lucky I don't
          just throw vuu out on your ass for
          telling me stories.
          Frustrated, Billy exits with Officer Brent.
          Frank shakes his head. He picks up the phone and dials.

          EXT. Y.M.C.A.

          The building appears calm. Peaceful. No sign of the
          creatures.
          The police car pulls.into the parking lot. I

          INT. POLICE CAR

          Officer Brent parks the 'car. Billy silts beside him.
          Brent looks at the building.

          BRENT
          Looks fine. I don't see anything.

          BILLY
          They're inside.
          Brent checks his pistol. It's loaded.

          BILLY
          Look...You can't go in there
          alone. It's'suicide. You've
          got to radio for more help...

          BRENT
          (holds up the

          PISTOL)
          I've got, all the help I need.
          Brent handcuffsBilly to the grating of the police car.

          BILLY

          (PLEADING)
          Please... listen to me...You can't
          go- in there...
          Brent gets out of the car and walks to the building.
          A nervous, frustrated Billy watches.

          BRENT
          walks to the building's front door. Locked. He smiles.
          He takes astep back, draws his gun and shoots off the
          door lock.
          He enters.

          BILLY
          waits in the car. Frightened. Restless.

          His sword lies on the back seat. Billy grabs it.
          He begins to pound at the handcuff chain with his blade.

          INT. Y.M.C.A. HALLWAY

          Pistol drawn, Brent walks down the hallway, to the gym
          doors.
          He can hear the sounds from inside. Gurgling. Breathing.
          Giggling.
          He takes a drink from his hip flask. He enters the gym.

          INSIDE
          Brent is shocked by what he sees.

          HUNDREDS OF PAIRS OF BURNING GREEN EYES
          fill the gymnasium, shining in the darkness. Like a
          starry night.

          DROVES OF MOGWAI
          are still coming out of the swimming pool.
          Brent is frozen. He tries to scream.
          The creatures notice him. Several move towards him.
          Brent fires his pistol. Useless. There are too many
          creatures.

          BILLY
          He hears the gunshots. He moves faster, desperately
          hacking at the handcuff chain with his sword.

          CUT TO:

          INSIDE - BRENT
          drops his gun. Out of bullets. He turns to run.

          

          

          

          

          68.
          A creature leaps. It lands on his back.
          Another leaps at him. He falls to the ground.
          Brent screams-as the:creatures jump him.
          They cover him like a blanket.
          They feast.

          CUT TO:

          BILLY
          Sweating. Nervous. Hacking away at the handcuff chain.
          Brent's screams fade in the background.
          Billy looks out the side window. He sees

          THE Y.M.C.A.'S FRONT DOORS BURST OPEN
          Droves of creatures pour out into the night.

          BILLY
          panics. He hacks at the chain. Harder. Faster.

          THE CREATURES
          move toward the police car.

          BILLY
          finally breaks the handcuff chain. He quickly moves to
          the driver's seat and starts the car.

          THE POLICE CAR
          tears out of the parking lot
          The creatures still pour out of the 'Y'.
          drives. He looks to the rearview mirror. The

          'burns in the mirror. The creatures are following'him.

          BILLY
          drives faster.

          BILLY

          (PANIC)
          I gotta warn people. . .1 gotta tell

          THEM
          He flips on the police siren and heads for town.

           CUT TO:

          THE SUBURBS
          Peaceful. Calm. Christmas lights twinkle.

          THE POLICE CAR
          suddenly squeals down the main road. Lights flashing.
          Siren blaring.

          BILLY
          steers the patrol car into the first driveway.
          The car screeches to a stop. Billy gets out. Sword in
          hand, he runs to the front door of the house. He
          knocks. Hard.

          MR. FUTTERS
          a balding, middle-aged man, wearing a bathrobe and pajamas,
          answers the door.

          MR. FUTTERS

          (PUZZLED)
          Billy Peltzer?...What's going on
          here?..

          

          

          

          

          70.

          BILLY

          (BREATHLESS)
          They're coming.

          MR. FUTTERS
          Huh?..

          BILLY
          (fast, hyper)
          You've got to keep your wind ws
          locked. Or better yet...boa d them
          up! And your lights... You've got
          to leave them on!
          f+ MR. FUTTERS
          What are you talking about, boy?

          BILLY
          There are these little things...
          animals...They're all over the
          place! They'll kill you and your
          family!...
          Mr. Futters starts to laugh.

          MR. FUTTERS
          Have you been drinking?

          BILLY
          No sir, I...

          MR. FUTTERS
          And what the hell is that? A
          sword?

          BILLY
          Yes...

          MR. FUTTERS
          And what are-you doing with the
          Sheriff's car? Are you on drugs?
          Billy starts to explain when

          MR. DEAGLE
          the next door neighbor, walks onto his porch.
          Deagle is a portly man, with curly grey hair and a beard.
          He calls to Mr. Futters

          

          

          

          

          71.

          MR. DEAGLE
          Hey, Joe...I saw the police car.
          You in some kind of trouble?

          MR. FUTTERS
          ,No, it's this Peltzer kid. He
          thinks we're gonna get: eaten up
          by wild animals. And he's
          carrying a sword.

          MR. DEAGLE
          Did you say 'Peltzer'? Billy
          Peltzer?

          MR. FUTTERS
          1 Yeah...

          MR. DEAGLE
          (shakes his head)
          He's a nut. Went crazy in the
          bank today. Called my wife all
          kinds of names.
          (to Billy)
          You smartass son of a bitch. If
          I was ten years younger I'd beat
          the crap out of you.
          Billy sighs, frustrated.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          joins her husband on the porch.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          What's the matter?...
          (she sees Billy)
          Oh, it's you. Here to
          apologize?

          MRS. DEAGLE

          I knew he was crazy from the
          start.
          (glares at Billy)
          I hope they lock you up for
          good, and throw away the key.
          Mr. Deagle puts his arm around his wife.

          MR. DEAGLE
          C'mon back inside, dear. Let's
          finish watching 'Dallas'.
          (to Mr. Futters)
          G'night, Joe.

          MR. FUTTERS
          Good night, Ed.
          (to Billy)
          You've got ten seconds to get
          the hell out of my yard. Then
          I'm.calling the Sheriff...if he
          isn't out looking for you already.
          He slams the door and goes inside.
          Billy just stands there. Defeated. Frustrated.

          A CREATURE
          hisses. Behind Billy.
          Billy turns. Mogwai leaps at him.
          Billy raises his sword and swings.
          He knocks the creature down. He stabs Mogwai.
          Mogwai dies with a long scream.
          Billy looks up and sees

          THE PACK OF CREATURES
          moving down Main Street. They have arrived. Looking for
          food.
          Many break into the house across the street. There are
          some human screams. Then the house lights go out.

          

          

          

          

          REV. 4/30/82 73
          Several creatures come towards Billy.
          Billy runs to the police car. He opens the door and gets
          inside.
          A creature leaps at him.
          Billy slams the car door. It severs the creature4si-rand..
          Several creatures surround the car.
          Billy hears a familiar voice. Screaming. He looks out
          the window.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          comes running out of her house, towards the police car.
          f_ She-'s screaming for help.

          I
          A creature is on her back.
          Another creature leaps at her.
          She falls. Into the snow.
          Several creatures attack Mrs. Deagle. Her screams fade.
          So does her life.

          BILLY
          looks away. More creatures are. surrounding the car.
          They pound against the windows. They want in.
          A scared Billy flips on the police radio.

          (a beat) 1
           There's a ladder beside the garage...
          Billy runs to the garage side. e reaches down and picks
          up a rusty aluminum ladd r.

          I
          He puts the ladder up to Tracy's window and climbs to her.

          INT. TRACY'S ROOM


          THE BEDROOM DOOR BURSTS OPEN.
          Two creatures stand there Growling. 'Hungry. They,
          move to Tracy.
          She screams.
          Billy gets to Tracy. He quickly pulls her out of the
          window. They begin to climb down the ladder.

          ON THE GROUND BELOW
          a creature jumps onto the ladder.
          Tracy. is startled. She nearly falls. Billy grabs. a. better
          hold of her. He drops his sword. It falls to the ground
          and lands in the snow.
          The creature looks up and sees Billy and Tracy. A few
          feet above. Mogwai begins to climb the ladder, going
          after them.
          Billy and Tracy start to climb up the ladder.
          But the two other creatures come out of Tracy'.s bedroom
          window. They see Billy and Tracy below. They climb oft
          after them, down the ladder.
          Billy and Tracy are trapped. Sandwiched between the
          creatures.
          Billy looks to his sword on the ground. So far away.

          

          

          

          

          REV. 4/30/82 78
          Thinking fast, Billy pulls the ladder back.
          It sways. He pulls harder.
          The ladder tilts to the ground. Falling.
          The three creatures are thrown to the ground, into the
          deep snow.
          Billy and Tracy ride the ladder down. The snow breaks
          their fall.
          The creatures dig their way out of the snow. They move
          towards Billy and Tracy.
          Billy snaps up his sword and jumps to his feet. Ready
          to fight. He keeps one protective arm around Tracy.
          The creatures surround them. Waiting for the right moment
          to attack.
          One of the creatures moves forward.
          Another leaps behind Billy.
          Billy lunges forward and spears the first creature.
          He quickly reels around, slicing the other creature in
          two.
          Both creatures lie in the snow. Dead.
          Billy turns to the last Mogwai. With two swings of his
          blade, he kills the creature.
          Billy wipes the green blood off his sword with his coat
          sleeve. Breathless, he looks at Tracy .
          Hair .hangs in his eyes. Blood runs down the side of his.
          sweaty, unshaven face. His dark brown eyes stare at Tracy.
          The transformation from meek bank clerk to sexy hero is
          complete.
          He embraces her. They run to the police car and get inside.
          Billy'starts the car. He and Tracy drive off into the
          night.

          Gary drives. Frank sits beside him. Gary flips on the siren
          and lights. He smiles. Like a little kid. Frank reaches
          over and.turns off the siren. Gary complains.

          GARY

          Gary laughs. Frank sighs

          GARY
          So when are you gonna make me
          Deputy?

          FRANK
          When you grow up.

          Why don't you fire Brent. He's
          nothin' but a drunk. I'could do
          a lot better.
          They arrive at the outskirts of town. Frank notices some-
          thing up ahead.
          He can see the shadows of the creatures. Crawling on
          houses. Running across the front lawns.
          Frank motions for Gary to slow down.

          FRANK
          Something looks weird.

          A CREATURE
          leaps onto the car's passenger' side. The creature grabs
          Frank' arm. He tries to shake off the creature.
          Gary gl nce over. Shocked. Horrified.
          Mogwai takes a huge bite out of Frank's arm. He screams.
          Gary turns to help him.

          THE POLICE-CAR
          slides on the ice. It slams-into a guard rail, flips over
          a ditch and spins to a stop.

          Billy drives, as fast as possible through the heavy snow.
          He's headed out of town. Tracy sits beside him. She
          looks out the window..

          OUTSIDE
          The rows of once peaceful, cheerful homes are now the
          scenes of frenzied horror.
          People run out into the night, screaming for help, only
          to be dragged to the ground by creatures.
          Ravaged bodies lie in the snow. Frozen.
          An ambulance is overturned on the roadside.
          Phone lines are town down.
          The creatures have made their way across town. They now
          attack the last few houseson the block.

          Billy quickly opens the police car door. He jumps out.

          OUTSIDE
          He closes the door. Tracy is safe inside.
          Billy walks to the.sheriff's car. He stays in the safety
          of the headlight's beam.
          Billy stops a few feet from the sheriff's car.
          The passenger side is crushed. The driver's side is
          barely damaged, save for a dented, jammed door.
          Gary pounds against-the door. He wants out.
          Billy grabs the car handle. He pulls hard. The door
          pops open. He pulls Gary out.
          Gary gets to his feet. He's okay. Billy looks inside
          the car.
          Billy closes the door.

          C'mon. Just stay in the light.
          They're afraid of the light.

          Billy hops into the driver's seat. He rests the sword
          beside him.--He--starts the car and continues to drive.,
          Gary gives Tracy another kiss. He needs her comfort.
          Billy just stares ahead, at the snowy road.

          The police car pulls into the driveway.

          Billy turns to Gary and Tracy.

          got here yet.

          Let's go inside and warm up.
          They exit the police car.

          DORRY
          comes to the door. He sees the worn, hollow faces of Gary
          and Tracy. He sees the bruised and bloodied Billy.

          BILLY
          .and they originate from this
          marketplace in Hong Kong.
          Dorrystands and shakes his head.

          DORRY
          Hard to believe. Like Satan's
          come to walk the earth.

          BILLY
          (looks at everyone)
          You see...they''re drawn to water.
          Now, if my hunch is correct... They'll
          be leaving town, and heading for the
          water tower-which means they'll have
          to pass by here tonight.

          We have to get help. These things
          have to be kept under control. If
          they get to the water tower .they

          maybe the Country. They're like
          inhuman divining rods.

          Why didn't you think of that before,

          I did. But nobody would listen.

          You did it. You killed all
          those people.. You're. a murderer,
          Peltzer.
          Billy lunges at Gary. They fall to the ground. Fighting.
          Dorry and Tracy break it up.

          TRACY
          If we want to stay . alive... We
          have to stick together.
          Billy turns away. Cooling off.
          Gary is comforted by Tracy. But she keeps her eye on
          Billy. Dorry looks at everyone.

          DORRY
          We should get in touch with

          A frightened Gary holds Tracy.

          The giggling gets louder. Closer. Billy turns to Dorry.

          was when I got drafted. The
          other, was when I was six years
          old.
          (everyone listens)
          It.was Christmas Eve. My sisters
          and I were decorating the tree
          with our Mother. We were singing
          caroles...happy ...excited...
          waiting for Dad to get home from
          work.
          (a beat)
          A few hours passed, and we started
          to worry. Dad wasn't home yet. My
          Mother called the office. They said
          he left.

          (PAUSE)
          After about a week... the police gave
          up. My Mother was close to a nervous
          breakdown... The rest of us weren't
          eating.. .we couldn't sleep.. .Every-
          thing was falling apart.

          (PAUSE)
          It was snowing outside. The house
          was cold. I threw some logs on
          the fire.--..That's when I noticed
          the smell.

          The firemen came. They broke

          Instead, they pulled out my Father.

          He was dressed in a Santa Claus

          The coroner said that he lost
          his footing. He slipped and
          broke his neck. Died instantly.
          His body was lodged in the narrow
          chimney shaft.

          Everyone has a chilled look on their faces. Dorry just
          stares.
          Billy stands and clears his throat..

          BILLY
          Well...I think you should all
          try and get some sleep.

          Billy...
          He looks at her. She gives him a comforting smile.

          TRACY
          I just wanted to say thanks...
          I mean...If it wasn't for you, I
          don't know what any of us would
          have done.
          Billy smiles.

          TRACY
          is it okay if I sleep here? On
          the floor beside you?...I'd feel
          a lot safer.
          Billy nods. Tracy moves a carpet next to Billy's chair.
          She lies on the carpet. She closes her eyes.
          Gary watches from the sofa. Jealous.

          

          

          

          
          Dorry has fallen asleep in his chair.
          Billy sits. Sword on his lap. He guards the door.
          Sounds still echo-from downstairâ¢s,.throughout the antique
          store.

          CLOSE-UP - BILLY
          The horror of it all finally hits him.
          His eyes fill with tears.
          He cries. Alone.

          FADE OUT.

          The others are asleep.
          Billy's hand quivers. The sword drops to the floor. He
          wakes. Startled. He quickly grabs the sword.
          Everyone else wakes from the sound.

          BILLY
          (looking at their
          scared faces)

          The dead body of an old man is slumped across a table.
          A half eaten Big Mac is still in his hand.
          In a booth, sits a dead family: Mother, Father, boy and
          girl. Their food still sits-in front of them. Untouched.
          A dead cashier girl lies on the counter.

          sit at a table in the rear of the restaurant. Away from

          They eat burgers and fries. Gary takes a bite of his

          It's.possible. But it's more
          important to get at the creatures.
          We've got the advantage now. It's

          they could make it to the water

          Gary reluctantly takes. off his T-shirt. Billy ties the
          two shirts together. He winds them into a cord.
          He finds a connection in the gas line. He begins to
          pound against it with the handle of his sword. The. sounds

          The CLANG of Billy's sword hitting the pipe is heard.

          turns the gas back on and lights the end of the crumpled.
          shirt with a match. The flame slowly creeps up the shirt,
          to the line.

          Creatures come at Tracy. She picks up a section of thick
          lead pipe and bats off the oncoming Mogwai.
          Gary finally turns on the flashlight beam. It keeps some
          of the Mogwai at bay.
          Fire creeps up the T-shirt, getting closer to the gas
          line.
          Billy gets all-the creatures off Dorry.
          More creatures come through the door.

          CcUNTLESS CREATURES
          are pouring out of the theater. Into the night.

          THE POLICE CAR
          squeals away into the night.

          INT. CAR

          Tracy examines Billy's shoulder. A deep cut.

          THE CREATURE ON THE BACK SEAT
          opens its eyes. It lets out a high pitched, wounded cry.
          Tracy picks up the sword, ready to kill the creature.
          Billy stops her.

          BILLY
          Wait...
          He looks out the rear window.

          THE PACK OF CREATURES
          are following the police car.

          BILLY
          looks at the creature on the back seat. It still cries
          out in that high pitched scream.

          BILLY
          (to Tracy)
          Hear that? He's calling his
          friends for help. They're
          following us. As long as
          he's alive and screaming... they'll
          come after him.

          BILLY
          We can't kill him. He's our
          bait. We'll be able to lead them
          away from the water tower.

          back seat)
          Just keep an eye on the thing...
          make s re it doe n' hurt us.
          Tracy keeps the swo d on the cre ture. Billy guns the
          engine and screeches off. He looks to the rearview
          mirror.

          THE COUNTLESS GREEN EYES FOLLOW..

          THE POLICE CAR
          pulls into the station'lot.
          Billy and Tracy get out. They look tired. Worn. They've
          been driving all night. Billy pumps gas into the car.

          THE WOUNDED CREATURE
          still lies on the back seat. Mogwai still screams in
          its high pitched wail.

          TRACY
          looks into the distance.

          THE PACK OF GREEN EYES

          Billy starts the car. Tracy looks into the back seat.

          TRACY
          Billy!...

          THE CREATURE IS GONE.
          Billy and Tracy are shocked. Puzzled.

          CUT TO:

          BEHIND THE POLICE CAR
          The creature has crawled outside, through the rear
          window. It crawls BENEATH THE CAR, moving into the engine.

          BILLY AND TRACY
          look around. Puzzled. Confused.

          BILLY
          Where in the hell?...

          The car stalls. Billy tries to re-start it. No good.
          Dead engine.

          Billy and Tracy get out of the car.

          that the creature has ripped from the engine. Mogwai

          Tracy finds a small, red metal toolbox., She empties
          it and carries the box back to the car.

          BILLY
          grabs the creature. Mogwai is still wounded and dazed.
          But it manages to bite and scratch at Billy.
          Tracy holds the tool box open. Billy forces Mogwai inside.
          He closes the tool box and locks it shut.
          Mogwai is trapped inside. The creature pounds against
          the metal. Its loud cry echoes from inside.
          Billy checks the car's engine.

          BILLY
          Damn! He ripped out the
          coil wires! The car won't
          run without them!

          TRACY
          Can you fix it?
          Billy looks into the distance. The creatures are getting

          Billy fights off the oncoming Mogwai with his sword.

          AT THE TREE'S BOTTOM
          Several creatures have begun to gnaw at the tree trunk.

          BILLY AND TRACY
          are near the treetop. They cling to a large, thick branch.
          The creatures still chase after them. Billy keeps them

          the stairs to the basement curiosity shop.

          MR. WING, the storekeeper who took Gizmo home after the
          Gremlins' night of carnage, opens the door, beginning his day.
          As he lights his pipe, he HEARS a commotion upstairs.

          3 EXT. STREET 3

           PEDESTRIANS dodge a long black LIMOUSINE as it pulls up short.
           ANGLE reveals that most of the stores on the block have closed
           -- GOING OUT OF BUSINESS signs and boarded-up windows.
           FORSTER, a sour-faced man in a business suit, gets out of the 
           limo, followed by three beefy MEN, also in suits. The three
           big men take a big-screen TV VT and a VCR out of the car.

           into the store.

           Mister Wi Daniel Clamp would
           like to see you.

           The men quickly set up the big-screen TV set and VCR. One of
          the men puts in a tape and hits some buttons, and the TV screen
          fills with the face of DANIEL CLAMP. At a young 40, he's New

          (READS)
          "The Clamp Chinatown Center --
          Where Business Gets Oriented."
          When I put up a building, it's the
          biggest -- it's the newest -- it's
          the best. People are going to be
          killing each other to get into
          this building --
          The soft O.S. TWITTERING of Gizmo is heard from the rear alcove
          of the store.

           GIZMO (O.S.)
           Tee vee!

           CLAMP (ON TV)
           Now,'we've been able to reach an
           understanding with everyone on the
           block -- except for you. Let me
           show you what I willing to do
           for you -- a s tand and
           souvenir cone on, right here
           under the at The foot
           traffic thrr here is going to
           make the building look like
           a ghost town.

           Mr. Wing regards the video image impassively. 


           CLAMP (ON TV) (CONT.)
           Please IF us know when you've 
          made a decision, Mister Wing. You
          know, I believe that there's
          always an area of agreement that
          two people can reach.
           The Clamp Corporation's LOGO a stylized "C" -- fills the 
          wereen, replacing Clamp's image.

          MR. WING
          Yes -- a man can always agree with
          others. It is more difficult to
          agree with oneself.

          FORSTER
           Does that mean you -- 
          He's interrupted as Mr. Wing COUGHS -- a rattling spasm that
          sounds deeply unhealthy. When the coughing subsides, he
          answers Forster.

      

          MR. WING
          I'm sorry. Please tell Mister
          Clamp that the answer is no.

          FORSTER
          Keep the TV.
          As Mr. Wing walks Clamp's men to the door in b.g., HOLD on the
          TV set -- and a small, furry PAW that reaches into FRAME to
          change the TV CHANNEL.
          With the change of stations, the TV screen fills with a SCENE
          from a Rambo picture. SYLVESTER STALLONE addresses the movie

          CAMERA:

          STALLONE
          To survive a war... you've got to
          become war.
          Then he screws an explosive-filled metal ARROWHEAD onto an
          arrow, and SHOOTS the arrow from a bow. The arrow hits a
          HELICOPTER, which bursts into FLAMES.

          GIZMO (0.3.)
          Neat!

          But as the helicopter starts to burn, Mr. Wing comes back and
          angrily turns the TV set OFF, addressing the unseen Gizmo.

          MR. WING
          Television again! Ai-vuh !. An -
           invention for fools.

          BODYGUARD
          I'm sorry that didn't work out,
          sir. I thought he'd like the TV.

          FORSTER

          LIGHTS ARE LOWERED above a covered cage. Martin pulls back the

          He abruptly switches the MUSIC off, and GRABS Gizmo just before
          the Mogwai can make good his escape. Dr. Catheter sticks the
          frightened Gizmo back in the cage, and shuts the side door
          firmly.

          A JANITOR, pushing a cart of cleaning supplies, comes into the
          office area. Gizmo, on the floor, peeks around a corner to
          watch as the cart's wheels rumble past him.
          As SEEN by Gizmo, the towering janitor stops at the department's
          WATER FOUNTAIN and tries to get a drink. The fountain's spigot
          OVERSHOOTS, giving the janitor a SPLASH in the face.
          Gizmo inches away from the source of the water, and -- seeing a
          puddle on the carpet where the water landed -- carefully avoids
          it. He keeps moving, and evades a second ARC of errant water
          from the fountain.
          The janitor decides t )gx,the fountain. Attacking the spigot
           with a wrench, he sends off 1morq STREAMS of water. To duck
          0 them, Gizmo takes cover, back, isu; under Billy's desk...
          .and doesn't see a big SPLASH F'o }wezï¿½ hit Billy's Chinatown

          and the blob of water ROLLS DOWN the illustration board...
          .down the side of the desk...
          Gizmo looks up, but too late. From his POV, the blob of paint-
          tinted water is huge, and coming down fast. It HITS him --
          -- and, as the janitor's feet and the wheels of his cart pass in
          â¬.g., CAMERA HOLDS on Gizmo on the floor, writhing in pain. The
          janitor leaves, and Gizmo SCREAMS, as -- THWIP! THWIP! -- two
          tiny FURBALLS shoot out of his body and land in the open DRAWER
          of a nearby filing cabinet.
          THWIP! The painful Mogwai replication continues, and a third
          furball caroms off a drafting table and into a wastebasket.
          THWIP! The fourth and final offspring shoots from Gizmo's body,
          and -- as Gizmo watches in horror and pain -- BOUNCES crazily
          around the office area, a little Superball of fur.
          As Gizmo sits up and looks up, we watch with him -- four newborn
          Mogwai HANDS reach out of the filing cabinet drawer, gripping

          S
          the top edge from inside.

          Mogwais are revealed, standing in the drawer: GEORGE AND LENNY,
          an inseparable pair. Lenny is big, dumb, and loyal, while
          George is small, with a criminal caginess -- he gets Lenny to do
          everything for him.
          Gizmo watches the wastebasket where the third furball landed
          start to ROCK back and forth -- but is distracted as the
          BOUNCING FURBALL hits the floor in front of him, then ricochets
          up onto a DESKTOP.
          To SOUND FX of a bowling ball hitting the pins, the furball
          rolls into a desk corner, and the third Mogwai unfolds --
          upside-down. This is DAFFY, a dizzy, uncontrollably antic
          Mogwai with the demented juvenile Joie de vivre we associate
          with the great Daffy Duck.
          In the first seconds following birth, Daffy goes daffy over the
          very fact of being alive. He sees his little hands and feet
          unfold,. and gives a WHOOP

          wastepaper, which is violently toss e ut...
          .until MOHAWK, the fourth new Mogwai, emerges. This guy is
          pure, malicious evil, a new strain of badness. Even as a furry
          Mogwai, he's about as cuddly as a cockroach.
          While Daffy, up on the desktop, starts playing with everything

          Gizmo -- standing now -- backs away. There's a grated VENT
          opening low on the wall behind him.
          Lenny grabs Gizmo with a fast-moving paw, and Mohawk, moving in

          Outpost jeans store that opens onto the lobby. A couple of

          that aren't, urn, fringed?
          They hold up several pairs of pants. All of them are "fringed"
          from the knees down -- as if they'd been CLAWED to tatters.

          wall.
          The Gremlin JUMPS at Clamp, who tries to bat it away from his
          face, like a kid panicked by a moth --
          -- but his flailing knocks the Gremlin back, so that its foot is
          caught in the hopper of the secretary's SHREDDER. Hating to do
          it, using only his fingertips, Clamp PUSHES the struggling
           Gremlin down into the machine --
           -- which SPRAYS him out of the bottom like a black, bloody,
           eyes-only memo of DEATU.
           As Clamp stands gasping Â®de the machine, the door to the
           corridor opens, and Billlybu in. He sees the shredder, and
          0 the tattered Gremlin remaips 4 j ng from it.

          1   INT. PETER & MARIA'S BEDROOM - DAY                               1
          
              FADE IN on MARIA (late 20s), asleep in bed. She's
              breathtakingly beautiful. Morning light fills the room.      The
              sound of wind, and rippling cloth.
          
              Maria stirs, and opens her eyes.     She stretches contentedly.
          
              Then she frowns.    Rolls over.    She's alone in the bed?
          
              No, she's not: PETER (20s) sits on the edge, his back to her.
              Two fresh, steaming mugs of coffee sit on a tray near him.
          
                                     MARIA
                        Hey.     Are you okay?
          
              Peter doesn't turn. He slowly stands and walks forward
              towards an OPEN WINDOW.
          
              There's something strange about the way he moves -- stiffly,
              almost jerkily, straining his joints and muscles.
          
              Maria gets out of bed, concerned.
          
                                    MARIA
                        Peter?    What's the matter?
          
              He pauses at the window.    Turns his head to look back at her.
          
              His eyes are vacant.    His face is a blank.
          
              Then Peter slowly leans forward.     And falls from the window.
          
              Maria stands in shock as the sound of SCREECHING TIRES from
              outside reaches her ears. Then SCREAMS OF TERROR from below.
          
              Aghast, she finally manages to numbly walk forward, towards
              the window. We MOVE PAST her and TILT DOWN TO REVEAL --
          
              -- PETER'S BODY lies in the middle of the street.     His head
              has burst open, his body broken and twisted.
          
              ON THE PAVEMENT: a line of blood appears, moving down the
              center of the screen. As if hitting grooves we cannot see --
          
              -- the blood slowly forms the shape of two KANJI CHARACTERS.
              A translation appears over them: "The Grudge."

              A blur of movement as hundreds of people stream up from a
              subway tunnel. Most are Japanese. We're not in Kansas.

               Standing in the middle of the rush-hour pedestrian traffic is
          
               KAREN (20s, American). She faces upstream, looking for
               someone. The flow threatens to carry her away in a
               heartbeat. She looks fragile, intimidated by the madness.
          
                                   DOUG (O.S.)
                         Karen!
          
               She turns to see her boyfriend DOUG (20s, American)
               approaching. With a reassuring smile he takes her hand --
          
               -- and together, they force their way through the throng,
               trying to escape the flow. They're jostled and crushed by
               the crowd, and Doug protectively pulls Karen closer.
          
                                   KAREN
                         I'll never get used to this.
          
                                   DOUG
                         Maybe we should find a different
                         train station.
          
               He abruptly stops, right in the middle of traffic, still
               holding Karen's hand. She turns, wondering what's going on.
               She sees the smile on his lips a moment before --
          
               -- he sweeps Karen into his arms and kisses her. As if the
               crowd of businessmen surging around them isn't there at all.
          
               It's tender and loving, and she responds... at first.   But
               then she pulls away, shy.
          
                                   KAREN
                         A public display of affection is
                         considered rude in Japan.
          
               There's an opening ahead into a SIDE STREET.   Doug and Karen
               deftly slip out of the traffic --
          
          
          2a                                                                 2a

               -- and walk hand-in-hand down the much quieter street, away
               from the crowded thoroughfare.
          
               Doug smiles as they pass by two JAPANESE HIGH SCHOOL COUPLES,
               making out on the street corner. He turns to give Karen a
               sarcastic look --
          
                                  Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      2A.
          
          
          
          -- but she didn't notice the school kids. She's looking in
          the other direction, at a trickle of SMOKE wafting up over a
          nearby fence.
          
                              KAREN
                    What's that?
          
          Doug follows as she walks toward an OLD TEMPLE, nestled
          beneath a skyscraper. A collision of the ancient and modern.
          The fence surrounds a GRAVEYARD adjacent to the temple.
          
                              DOUG
                    We walk past this temple every day,
                    Karen --
          
                              KAREN
                    Yeah, but I've never seen this
                    before.
          
          A JAPANESE MAN stands before an ornate headstone, lighting a
          bundle of incense and bowing before the grave.
          
                              KAREN
                    It's a Buddhist ritual. The
                    incense smoke carries the prayers
                    to the spirits of his ancestors, to
                    help them remain at peace.
          
          CLINK. She turns as Doug, grinning, lights a cigarette with
          his Zippo, flicking it shut and pocketing it.
          
                              DOUG
                    It's amazing. You're like this
                    infinite storehouse of wisdom. Or
                    trivia. I'm not sure which.
          
                              KAREN
                    It's not trivia. It's what they
                    believe. And it's far better, by
                    the way, than your little pollution
                    ritual.
          
          Doug's grin softens to a smile. He doesn't respond... but
          the way he's looking at Karen makes her curious:
          
                              KAREN
                    What?
          
          He turns away for a moment, almost shyly, dropping his
          cigarette and crushing it. Finally:

                    Nothing. I just -- I like that
                    about you. You seem to be able to
                    remember everything that's really
                    important.
          
          She smiles.   A tender moment.   Then... he checks his watch.
          
                              DOUG
                    Except the time.
          
          Karen checks her own watch, realizing --

                    Oh, crap --
          
          She grabs his hand and starts to walk quickly.

                An international college in Tokyo. The autumn chill doesn't

                Karen and Doug approach the doors of a NURSING CARE CENTER.
                She pulls him to the side just as he's stepping under a
                WORKMAN'S LADDER by the doors.

                              (before Doug can respond:)
                          And I might have a vested interest
                          in those years.

                Doug smiles, kissing her romantically.   Then:
          
                                    DOUG

          Then Karen walks through the doors into a bright, atrium-like
          lobby area. She waves "hello" to the RECEPTIONIST.

          Leaning against a desk behind Reception is Karen's boss ALEX

          ringing. An ANSWERING MACHINE picks up in Japanese.

          turns and comes back down, walking over to Alex.

                    I just came by to pick up some
                    books I left here. I'm not
                    scheduled to work today --

                    I know. But are you free?    Do you
                    have class?

                    Just a test to study for.   Why?
          
          Alex smiles, holding out a file.

          Karen takes the file and opens it, looking at the first page -
          - a picture of an OLDER WOMAN (EMMA) is attached.

                    It's Yoko's case, but she didn't
                    show up for work this morning, and
                    I can't reach her at home. She
                    must be sick, or something. And
                    she has the damn house key.
          
          Studying the file, Karen squints.

                    "Mild dementia with severe
                    lethargy." Apparently she sleeps
                    through most of the day. Her
                    daughter-in-law doesn't work, so
                    she'll probably be there.
          
          Karen seems unsure.   It's a big step for her.

                    me about getting out there on your

          One of Alex's CO-WORKERS appears in the doorway, motioning to

                    forget to bring a map.

                Japanese characters. She glances up at
          
                THE WALL CHART: a color-coded diagram shows how the long
                address string is broken down into Postal Code, Prefecture,

                Karen nods.   But she's not quite as confident.

                Karen sits uncomfortably on the crowded transit car, squeezed
                in tightly by the people around her. The LOUD CRYING of a
                baby adds to her discomfort.

                Karen walks down the populated sidewalk, weaving through
                STREET VENDORS, and passing a large GROCERY STORE.
          
                She pauses, looking at the address on her card. She
                approaches a WOMAN and her DAUGHTER (6) and speaks to them in
                Japanese. The woman nods, pointing towards a small ALLEY.
          
                Karen gives the daughter a smile;   the girl hides behind her
                mother's leg.

               Karen exits the alley, entering a quiet, narrow street.
               She's still not sure if she's in the right place.

               -- it's THE HOUSE.   Cozy and shaded, nestled into the dead
               end of the street.   Large by Tokyo standards.
          
               She double-checks the address and opens the gate, walking
               around a BICYCLE leaning against the wall and following the
               stepping-stone path to the front door. She knocks. No
               answer. She tries again. Nothing.
          
               Then, an afterthought, she tries the handle.   It's unlocked.

               A SCRAPING sound grabs Karen's attention.
          
               HER POV: at the far end of the room, a FROSTED-GLASS PANELED

               A HAND is visible on the other side, clawing at the glass.

               EMMA (60s, American). The older woman in the picture from

                         I'm from the Health Center. I'm
                         substituting for Yoko, just for

               remembers Karen introducing herself before.
          
               Kneeling in front of Emma, Karen notices a BAND-AID around
               one of her fingers. Blood has soaked through it.

                             (still no reaction)
                         Would you like a bath? Maybe that

               intake, jamming it.

               Karen walks back into the Living Room. She looks underneath
               the couch for the missing piece. Can't see anything.
          
               She lays down and sticks her arm under the couch, feeling
               around. Nothing.
          
               Karen sticks her arm in deeper, to the shoulder, straining...
          
               She suddenly jerks her arm back, wincing.   She has a small
               cut on her finger.
          
               Karen looks under the couch for what cut her --
          
               -- a small FURNITURE NAIL sticks out underneath.

                         How did you get up there?

               She gathers up the vacuum and heads up to the SECOND FLOOR
               HALLWAY. There's a nearby door, closed (the FRONT ROOM), and
               an open door at the end (the REAR ROOM).
          
               As she looks for an outlet, she hears a SCRATCHING SOUND.
          
               Karen stands there for a moment, listening.    Silence.
          
               Then she walks towards the open door at the end of the hall.
          
          
          17   INT. THE HOUSE - REAR ROOM - DUSK                            17
          
               Karen steps inside. MOVING BOXES are stacked against the
               wall, next to a desk. It's an unfinished room.
          
               She listens.   No scratching.   Nothing unusual here.   Except --
          
               Karen notices a lone object sitting on an otherwise empty
               shelf. It's a BLACK CERAMIC CAT. Facing the wall. Strange.
          
               And then Karen hears the SCRATCHING SOUND again.
          
          18                                                                18
               INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DUSK
               Karen steps into the hallway and listens.   There it is again,
               and this time there's no doubt --
          
               The sounds are coming from the room by the stairs.
          
               Karen walks to the door. She pauses, disturbed by the eerie
               sounds from inside. Then she reaches for the doorknob.
          
               THUD. THUD. Karen hesitates. The strange rhythmic THUDDING
               continues, coming from beyond the door.
          
                                   KAREN
                             (nervous:)
                         Hello?
          
               Karen takes a breath.   And turns the doorknob.
          
          19                                                                19
               INT. THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DUSK
               The sounds immediately stop as Karen enters the MASTER
               BEDROOM. It's dark, thick blinds covering the windows. A
               frosted window, overlooking the foyer, isn't helping much.
          
               She stands there for a moment, listening.   Silence.
          
               Then --
          
                                        Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     12.
          
          
          
               SCRATCH SCRATCH. Startled, she gasps and turns towards THE
               CLOSED CLOSET DOORS. That's where the sound is coming from.
          
               And then she notices something strange about the closet door:
          
               It's been sealed shut with duct tape.
          
               The SCRATCHING quickens, as if sensing a presence nearby.
          
               And then there's a muffled MEOW.   There's a cat in there?
          
               Karen pulls off the duct tape. She reaches for the door
               handle, slowly sliding it open a crack and peering inside --
          
               The closet seems empty, except for a large BOOK on a shelf.
               Karen reaches inside and picks it up.
          
               Then she sees, in the darkened far corner of the closet, a
               SMALL BLACK CAT. It's sitting on something, watching her.
          
               Karen slides the door the rest of the way open --
          
               -- revealing A YOUNG JAPANESE BOY (age 7) sitting in the
               corner, staring at Karen. The cat is curled up on his lap.
          
               Startled, Karen drops the book and falls backwards.
          
          20                                                                20
               INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
               Karen is on her cell phone:
          
                                   KAREN (INTO PHONE)
                         Yes, he was shut in a closet!
                         There was tape around the -- No,
                         they're not home yet. I don't
                         know, Emma hasn't said a word to me
                         -- He's still upstairs -- yes, I'm
                         sure he's Japanese -- But -- Yes,
                         alright, Alex. Just please get
                         here as soon as you can.
          
               Karen hangs up, putting the phone down on the kitchen table.
               She leans against the counter, exasperated.
          
               Then her attention turns to THE BOOK she found in the closet.
          
               Karen can't resist.   She opens it.
          
               THE BOOK is a large journal, filled with elegant Japanese
               writing. Karen flips through it, stopping on --
          
                                        Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        13.
          
          
          
               A PHOTOGRAPH.   A handsome young man, smiling at the camera.
          
               We recognize him.   It's PETER, from the opening scene.
          
          
          21   INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                             21
          
               Karen walks to the front door, reaching out to unlock it --
          
               -- but she pauses, realizing something.
          
               She reaches into her pocket, pulling out THE PHOTO she found.
               It only takes a second to verify --
          
               -- THE BOY in the photo is the one she found in the closet.
          
               Karen lowers the photo, bewildered.    Then she looks up,
               startled by --
          
               THE BOY. He's kneeling on the second floor landing above,
               watching her through the bars of the metal railing. Creepy.
          
               Karen takes a step forward, forcing a smile.
          
                                   KAREN (IN JAPANESE)
                         Hello there.
          
                                              Really creepy.
               The boy just stares at her.
                                   KAREN (IN JAPANESE)
                         My name is Karen. What's yours?
          
                                    THE BOY
                         Toshio.
          
               Before she can respond --
          
               RING! RING!   The phone in the next room startles her.
          
          22                                                                 22
               INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
               Karen enters the room as the ANSWERING MACHINE picks up, the
               voices of a happy couple on the GREETING (in English):
          
                                   MATTHEW & JENNIFER (ON MACHINE)
                         "Konnichiwa! Matt and Jennifer
                         aren't around, leave a message."
          
                                   SUSAN (ON MACHINE)
                         "Hey, guys, it's Susan. Matt, are
                         you there? Pick up...
                                   (MORE)
          
                                        Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       14.
          
                                    SUSAN (ON MACHINE) (cont'd)
                          Okay, well, I'm leaving work now so
                          you can try my cell, or just call
                          me at home later."
          
               The caller pauses. Karen steps closer to the phone base,
               curious, listening:
          
                                    SUSAN (ON MACHINE)
                          "I just wanted to make sure Mom is
                          okay. Yesterday was... a bit
                          weird, and -- I'm just a little
                          worried."
          
               Karen, reluctant but realizing she should pick up, reaches
               for the phone...
          
               ...but the PHONE BASE is empty.   The cordless is missing.
          
               As Karen tries to figure out how to answer with the base:
          
                                    SUSAN (ON MACHINE)
                          "Listen, just give me a call when
                          you can, okay?"
          
               CLICK.   Too late -- the caller hangs up.
          
               Silence returns to the room... but not completely.     Karen
               hears the soft sound of WHISPERING from nearby.
          
               Beyond her, we see a PALE FACE (KAYAKO) pressed against the
               frosted window of the sliding door of the TATAMI ROOM.
          
               The face pulls away from the glass just before Karen turns
               towards it. But the sound of WHISPERING continues.
          
               As she slowly walks to the door, we can make out some words:
          
                                    EMMA (O.S.)
                          ...I've told them over and over...
                          I've told them over and over...
          
               Karen listens for a moment, then slides the door open.
          
          23   INT. THE HOUSE - TATAMI ROOM - NIGHT                           23
          
               It's very dark in the room -- the lights have been turned
               off. Emma, sitting up in bed, turns towards Karen.
          
                                    KAREN
                          Emma, who were you talking to?
          
                                       Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        15.
          
          
          
               That's when Karen notices THE INDENTATION in the mattress,
               across from where Emma is sitting. Where someone else would
               be, if the old woman was having a conversation.
          
               Emma looks up at Karen with pleading eyes.
          
                                   EMMA
                         I just want her to leave me alone.
          
               Karen sits down next to her.
          
                                   KAREN
                         You should get some rest, Emma.
          
               She helps Emma lie back --
          
               -- but as the old woman's eyes move to the ceiling, they
               suddenly grow wide, her mouth opening in fear --
          
               -- Karen follows her gaze, looking up --
          
               -- and she SCREAMS, falling off the mattress, backing away --
          
               A MURKY BLACKNESS is lowering from the ceiling. Formless at
               first, but flowing and shifting... like a FIGURE draped with
               black silk. Drifting down until the shadowy "head" is only
               inches from Emma's terrified face.
          
               And then the "head" slowly turns, rotating towards Karen.
          
               In the midst of the blackness are TWO DISEMBODIED EYES.
               Filled with an intense rage. Focused directly on Karen.
          
               Off Karen's NERVE-SHATTERING SCREAM, we...
          
                                                              CUT TO BLACK.

               MATTHEW and his wife JENNIFER are in bed. He sleeps soundly,
               she doesn't. She's staring at the ceiling, listening to --
          
               -- SOUNDS coming in through the open bedroom door. Someone
               moving downstairs, fumbling around, bumping into things.
          
               Jennifer, frustrated, lets out a sigh.

               Matthew comes downstairs, dressed in a business suit.    He
               pauses to pick up some of the RUBBISH on the stairs.

               Jennifer watches the last drops of coffee fall into the pot.
               She pours herself a mug, takes a big sip. Looks exhausted.
          
               Matthew enters, surprised to see her.
          
                                       MATTHEW
                          You're up?
          
                                       JENNIFER
                          Mmmmmm.
          
               Matthew glances into the back room through another sliding
               door -- the windows on this one are clear, not frosted like
               the living room.
          
               HIS POV:   Emma is asleep on her mattress.
          
                                    MATTHEW
                          I wonder if Mom's okay. She's been
                          sleeping ever since we got here.
          
                                    JENNIFER
                          Not at night.
          
               Matthew turns to her, surprised.
          
                                    JENNIFER
                          I told you, Matthew, you can sleep
                          through anything.
          
               Matthew comes over, kisses her.
          
                                    MATTHEW
                          I'm sorry, sweetheart. It was
                          probably just the move -- I'm sure
                          she'll get back on schedule.
          
               Jennifer nods, not convinced.
          
                                    MATTHEW
                          You seen my travel mug?
          
                                    JENNIFER
                          I didn't unpack it yet.
          
               Matthew kneels down next to a pair of MOVING BOXES in the
               corner -- `KITCHEN' written on the side. He explores it.

                              MATTHEW
                    Maybe you should say something to
                    the helper, what's her name?
          
                                 JENNIFER
                    Yoko.
          
                              MATTHEW
                    Who knows? Maybe there's something
                    she can suggest.
          
                                 JENNIFER
                    Yeah.     Maybe.
          
          He finds his travel mug, wrapped in the sports section of an
          American newspaper. Matthew scans it as he fills his mug.
          
                              MATTHEW
                    I miss seeing this every morning.
          No response from his wife. He turns to see Jennifer looking
          down at Emma through the window.
          
          Matthew walks over, puts an arm around her.
          
                              MATTHEW
                    Hey, kiddo. You okay?
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I went for a walk yesterday. Just
                    to explore. I got lost and
                    couldn't find anyone who could
                    speak English, who could help me.
                    I felt so... stupid.
          
                              MATTHEW
                    This will get easier soon, for Mom,
                    for all of us. I promise.
          
          She turns to him.
          
                                 JENNIFER
                    Or else?
          
                              MATTHEW
                    Or else I'll tell the company it's
                    just not working out, and that
                    we're going back to the States with
                    or without my old job. They can
                    get someone else to crunch their
                    numbers.
          
          This makes Jennifer feel better.

                         give it a good try, okay Jen?

               The door opens and Matthew walks outside, stopping to look at
               a familiar BICYCLE, leaning against the house near the door.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         Is this Yoko's bike?
          
                                   JENNIFER
                         I think so.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         It's been here all night.
          
               Matthew rolls the bike from the porch to the gate, leaning it
               against the wall (where we saw it earlier).
          
               He turns back to Jennifer, giving her a kiss.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         I'll probably be home late, maybe
                         around nine or so.
          
               Jennifer gives him a look.
          
                                   JENNIFER
                         I knew you'd forget.
          
               Matthew pauses, looks back blankly.    Jennifer just smiles.
          
                                   JENNIFER
                         Dinner, your sister?    At seven?
          
                                    MATTHEW
                         Oh yeah.   Right.
          
                                   JENNIFER
                         You were going to cook.

                         usually run long.
          
               Jennifer rolls her eyes.

               She goes back inside, closes the door.

               Jennifer stands by a cart, looking pale under the stark
               fluorescent lighting. She also looks shell-shocked.
          
               HER POV: before her is a WALL OF JAPANESE PRODUCTS. Barely
               a lick of English on any of the brightly-colored packages.
          
               Jennifer is, in a word, clueless. She looks around for
               assistance -- but she's lost in a whirl of Japanese faces.
          
               She tentatively reaches towards a bowl-shaped package.
               Studies the Japanese writing.
          
               Stealing a glance around her, she quietly tears open a corner
               of the bowl. Peeks inside. Sniffs it. She smiles.

               CLOSE ON the same package, a microwaveable soup bowl, now
               open with a spoon sticking out of it. Resting, with a glass
               of water, atop the kotatsu table.
          
               PAN TO REVEAL a pair of feet on the lip of a MOVING BOX next
               to the table. It's Jennifer, asleep on the couch.
          
               A CLATTERING sound wakes her, followed by the sound of
               FOOTSTEPS running away. We PULL BACK as Jennifer sees her
               bowl, and the glass next to it, have been knocked over.
          
               She sits up, looking into the TATAMI ROOM. Emma sits on the
               edge of her mattress, staring blankly at her.
          
               Jennifer gets up, sternly walks over.

                         If you need something, all you have
                         to do is say so --
          
               She stops short as she sees...
          
               FOOTPRINTS. Formed from the broth, and noodles, of her
               spilled soup. They're the footprints of a child.
          
               And they lead away from the back room, down the main hallway.

               Jennifer follows the DAMP FOOTPRINTS. They're getting
               lighter, and cease altogether in the foyer.
          
               She stands there for a moment, bewildered. Then she tenses,
               as if sensing she's being watched. She slowly turns to see --
          
               -- A BLACK CAT. Sitting on the first landing of the stairs.
               Staring at her with bright yellow eyes.
          
               As Jennifer takes a step towards it --
          
               TWO CHILD'S HANDS reach around the corner, and pick up the
               cat, pulling it out of view.
          
               Jennifer freezes.
          
                                    JENNIFER
                          Who's -- who's there?
          
               No response. She walks up the stairs and looks around the
               corner. Nothing there.
          
               She takes a deep breath, and starts to climb.

               INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY
               Reaching the top, Jennifer catches a glimpse of a familiar
               BOY running into the FRONT ROOM.
          
               She slowly walks towards the open door -- we can't see inside
               the room from the hallway. But she pauses as she hears --
          
               THUD.   THUD.   The same rhythmic thumping that Karen heard.
          
               After a moment, Jennifer steps inside the room, disappearing
               from our sight.
          
               We hear her suddenly draw a GASP.
          
               A beat. As we DRIFT CLOSER to the doorway, we notice
               something strange: the room appears to be growing darker.
               A SHARP BREATHING can be heard from inside... quick, panicked
               gulps of air. Growing faster.
          
               Just as we reach the doorway, the harsh breathing stops.

                            wrap things up.
          
               He leaves his briefcase by the door and turns to the hall --
          
               -- noticing the house is completely DARK.

               Matthew turns on the lights. The room has reverted to its
               messy state, even worse than before.
          
               He looks down at A PICTURE, formerly hanging on the wall, now
               lying on the ground. The glass is broken.
          
                                      MATTHEW
                            What the hell? --
          
               He quickly goes to the BACK ROOM. Emma sits on the edge of
               her bed, dazed and staring. In the darkness.
          
                                       MATTHEW
                            Mom?   Are you alright?
          
               No answer.    He kneels down next to her.
          
                                      MATTHEW
                            Where's Jennifer, Mom?
          
               Still nothing.      He surveys the mess in the room.   Angrily:
          
                                      MATTHEW
                            Did Yoko come today, Mom?
                            Remember? The pretty girl?
          
               He gets to his feet, looking at the SPILLED SOUP in the
               living room, now hardened and crusty.

               Matthew stands in the doorway of the dark room.   He tries the
               light switch. Nothing happens.

               He slowly enters, feeling his way through the room. We can
               barely make him out in the darkness... we see the shape of
               THE BED by a window...
          
               Matthew feels his way to a table next to the bed.   Switches
               on a small lamp --
          
               -- JENNIFER IS RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. Lying in bed, staring wide-
               eyed at the ceiling. Matthew, startled, falls backwards.
          
                                     MATTHEW
                         Jennifer?    What is it --
          
               Matthew rushes to her, shaking her. She's unresponsive. The
               only sign she's alive is that HER FEARFUL EYES slowly fix on
               him. Her mouth opens, as if she's trying to speak.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         What's wrong? What happened???
          
               She tries harder to form words, but can only produce a CROAK.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         I'll... I'll call an ambulance...
          
          36                                                              36
               INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
               Matthew runs into the kitchen grabbing A LARGE BOOK on one of
               the moving boxes. The Japanese equivalent of a YELLOW PAGES.
          
               He whips it open -- hardly a word of English in it.

               A stack of BOOKS sit on the very top of a tall bookshelf.
               Scissors and a roll of DUCT TAPE rest atop them.
          
               Matthew pushes everything aside to get at a JAPANESE/ENGLISH
               DICTIONARY underneath. The DUCT TAPE falls to the floor.
          
               He tears across the room to THE PHONE BASE -- but the
               cordless phone is missing.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         Dammit!
          
          
          38   INT. THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT                          38
          
               Matthew re-enters, out of breath. He sits next to Jennifer,
               who hasn't moved. Puts a hand on her chest to make sure
               she's still breathing. She is.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         Jesus Christ...
          
               He looks through the dictionary, finding the word he needs:
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         `Ambulance'... "kyukyusha".
          
               Then he quickly rips open the Yellow Pages --
          
               -- seeing, in plain English, `EMERGENCY' on the first page.
               Below that: `FIRE/AMBULANCE -- DIAL 119'.
          
               He drops the book and reaches across the bed for a phone, on
               a table at the far side --
          
               -- THE BOY (TOSHIO) stands up, between Matthew and the phone.
          
               But he looks different from before: his skin is discolored,
               his lips and eyes are ringed and sullen.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         Who are you? What -- what are you
                         doing here?
          
               Toshio makes a STRANGE SOUND. Looks at Jennifer, then turns
               to Matthew, SNARLING at him like a CAT.
          
               Matthew, shocked, falls backwards off the bed, hitting the
               table with the lamp. It drops to the ground --

               -- and TOSHIO'S SHADOW, cast by the fallen light, begins to
               STRETCH AND GROW across the ceiling. The shadow creeps over
               Jennifer, shifting and coming towards Matthew --
          
               -- Matthew grabs the lamp.    He reaches it, holding it up --
          
               At first, it looks like both Jennifer and Toshio have
               disappeared. But then --
          
               -- Jennifer, suddenly back on the bed, SITS UPRIGHT, jerkily,
               as if she's been yanked up and forward. Her mouth is wide
               and gasping --
          
               -- and then she falls back onto the bed.     Dead.
          
               Matthew, stunned, backs away from the bed, against the
               closet. Terrified, he doesn't notice --
          
               -- the THUD THUD sound growing around him.     Then --
          
               -- TOSHIO'S HEAD comes into frame behind him. Matthew hears
               a GROWLING SOUND and turns, seeing Toshio right there! --

               The DOORBELL rings.   Then a few more times.
          
               SUSAN (American, late 20s) enters, with two bottles of wine.
          
                                     SUSAN
                         Hello?
          
               She kicks off her shoes.
          
                                   SUSAN
                         You guys in the kitchen?

               INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
               Susan walks in, puts the wine on the table.     Looks around.
          
                                   SUSAN
                             (calling out:)
                         I thought you guys were gonna cook!
          
               She goes into the BACK ROOM.    Sits next to Emma.
          
                                     SUSAN
                         Hi, Mom.    How are you feeling?
          
               Emma turns to her with her usual vacant look.

               Twisting a corkscrew into a wine bottle, Susan leans into the
               foyer, yelling upstairs:
          
                                   SUSAN
                         I'll give you guys one minute to
                         finish whatever you're doing up
                         there and get your butts down here.
          
               As she heads back towards the kitchen, we CRANE UP to see --
          
               MATTHEW. He's walking down the second floor hall. He looks
               different: the expression on his face is troubled, occupied.
          
               And he's dragging his dead wife's body.   By the hair.
          
               He pulls her inside the REAR ROOM -- the doorway looks more
               imposing, more ominous, than before. It's dark and
               malevolent, the threshold to a secret that won't stay buried.
          
               We CRANE BACK DOWN to see Susan in the kitchen.   She's poured
               a glass of wine and sighs impatiently.
          
               She walks back down the hall into the foyer.
          
                                   SUSAN
                         I mean it, guys.
          
               Silence from upstairs.   Shaking her head:
          
                                   SUSAN
                         Well, I warned you. Prepare to be
                         emotionally scarred.
          
               She starts up the stairs and turns the first corner --
          
               -- MATTHEW is sitting there, hands on his knees, looking
               harried. Susan YELPS.
          
                                    SUSAN
                         Matthew!   Don't scare me like that!
          
               He's shaking slightly.   His eyes drift up to hers.
          
                                   SUSAN
                         What's going on?   Where's Jennifer?

                              MATTHEW
                    She went out. Something came up.
          
                              SUSAN
                    I hope she's not long.    I'm
                    absolutely starving.
          
          Matthew looks back down at his feet.      Susan misreads:
          
                              SUSAN
                    I knew it. You guys forgot to go
                    shopping, didn't you?
          
          Matthew abruptly stands.    Looming over his sister.
          
                                 MATTHEW
                    I'm sorry.     This is a bad time.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Are you okay? What's going on?
          
                              MATTHEW
                    You should go.
          
          He moves forward, right into her. His momentum pushes Susan
          back into the foyer. She holds onto his shirt:
          
                              SUSAN
                    Did something happen?    What's --
          
          Matthew's hands suddenly TIGHTEN ON HER SHOULDERS. His eyes
          grow wide, filled with anger, as he whispers fiercely --
          
                              MATTHEW
                    She doesn't love me... she never
                    loved me...
          
          Susan watches as he repeats himself, over and over.      Growing
          scared, she finally SHAKES HIM.
          
                              SUSAN
                    What are you talking about?
          
          Matthew slowly looks up.    Malice on his face.
          
          He steps forward.   Susan backs away.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Stop it, Matthew.
          
                              MATTHEW
                    Leave me alone.

                         GO AWAY!!!
          
               Susan fumbles with the front door. She gets it open and runs
               out just before Matthew reaches her.
          
               ON MATTHEW: he stands there, head tilted down, for a moment.
               Then he straightens. Slowly closes the front door.
          
               Matthew heads back upstairs. He reaches the second floor and
               opens the door to the rear bedroom.
          
               The room beyond is dark. But A DARK FIGURE is visible,
               standing in the far corner, facing Matthew.
          
               He steps inside, and the door slowly swings shut behind him.

               EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY
               It's an overcast afternoon.  Swollen clouds hang low over
               The House. It looks a bit more imposing than usual.
          
               THE MAILBOX is adorned with the Japanese equivalent of a "For
               Sale" sign -- weather-worn, and looks like it's been there
               for years.
          
               SUZUKI (30s, Japanese), a Real Estate agent, waits by the
               gate. Then he notices something. Waves, and smiles.
          
               It's SUSAN, approaching with MATTHEW, JENNIFER and EMMA.
          
               Susan shakes Suzuki's hand and they exchange a greeting in
               Japanese. She turns to her brother.
          
                                   SUSAN
                         This is Suzuki-san, he's the Real
                         Estate broker.
          
               Suzuki bows at Matthew and Jennifer, says something.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         What did he say?
          
                                   SUSAN
                         He said: "welcome to Tokyo". And
                         that you must be very important to
                         your company for them to rent this
                         place for you.

               Everyone enters, checking the place out. Suzuki and Susan
               slip off their shoes. As Matthew steps into the foyer:
          
                                   SUSAN
                         Your shoes.
          
                                     MATTHEW
                         Oh.    Right.
          
               He kneels down, untying his shoes.   Jennifer looks perplexed.
          
                                   JENNIFER
                         Even in our own house?
          
                                   SUSAN
                         Even in your own house.
          
               Suzuki smiles as Matthew and Jennifer take off their shoes.
               Susan says something to him in Japanese and he laughs. They
               walk down the hall, and Matthew and Jennifer follow.

               INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
               Suzuki opens the blinds, letting some light into the place.
               It's not helping much -- it's still pretty dreary.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         Isn't the layout great? Wait `till
                         you see the back room. It's
                         perfect for Mom -- she won't have
                         to deal with the stairs.
          
               Jennifer follows him through the room.   She doesn't look
               quite as enthusiastic.
          
               Matthew slides open the door leading to the TATAMI ROOM.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         Her bed won't be here until next
                         week, but we can put the mattress
                         on the floor. What do you think?
          
               Jennifer warms a bit.   The wooden room is beautiful.
          
               Susan asks Suzuki a question in Japanese, and he responds.

                          Where's Mom?
          
                We slowly CRANE UP to the SECOND FLOOR HALL, moving towards
                the REAR ROOM at the end. The door is ajar.

                Susan comes up the stairs, worried.
          
                                     SUSAN
                          Mom?   Where are you?

                Susan looks inside -- Emma isn't there. She's about to leave
                when something catches her attention. She walks to
          
                THE CLOSET. The door is open. Susan kneels down, looking at
                something inside it. She picks it up --
          
                -- it's the CERAMIC CAT Karen found earlier. As Susan
                examines it, she notices something on the wall of the closet
                (which we don't see). Her face softens, and she smiles.
          
                                    MATTHEW (O.S.)

                Susan stands and walks out of the room. But we stay in the
                closet, PANNING TO REVEAL the closet wall. It's covered with
                BLACK CRAYON, low to the ground, the work of a child. The
                images are dozens of BLACK CATS.

               Emma stands in the dead center of the empty bedroom.
          
               Looking directly up at the ceiling.
          
               Susan enters, placing the ceramic cat on THE SHELF where
               Karen found it earlier. Except Susan faces it INTO THE ROOM.
          
                                   SUSAN
                         C'mon, Mom. You know what the
                         doctor said about stairs.
          
               She takes Emma's hand, but the old woman doesn't move.
          
               Matthew and Jennifer enter, worried.
          
                                     MATTHEW

               Everyone follows her gaze to the ceiling.   Only Emma has the
               unmistakable look of dread on her face.

               Suzuki walks from the kitchen into the hallway, giving the
               place one final look-over.
          
               He pauses by the open bathroom door.   Looks inside.

               Suzuki enters, looking at THE TUB:    filled to the brim.
          
               After a moment, Suzuki kneels down next to the bathtub.     He
               pulls the thin CHAIN connected to the rubber stopper --
          
               -- but the end of the chain comes out of the water.      Hmmm.
               It's not connected after all.
          
               Suzuki eyes the plug at the bottom of the tub.
          
               Then he takes off his jacket.   Rolls up his shirt sleeve.
          
               And reaches into the water for the rubber stopper.
          
               It's just out of reach.
          
               He rolls up his sleeve a little more.   Reaches deeper --
          
               -- suddenly there's a BURST OF SOUND: a dull THUMPING,
               something THRASHING in water, the SCREAMING of a YOUNG BOY,
               voice MUFFLED by water --
          
               -- Suzuki recoils as water SPLASHES UP around him --
          
               -- he falls away from the tub in horror, landing on his butt.
          
               THE BATHTUB: Filled to the brim.     Still and silent.    Not so
               much as a ripple on the surface.
          
               That couldn't have just been his imagination, could it?
          
               As he slowly stands, he sees something out of the corner of
               his eye --
          
               -- a DEAD CAT, bloody and torn, in the corner of the room.

                As Suzuki backs away from it, eyes widening in horror, he's
                startled by --
          
                MATTHEW, standing in the doorway.   Beaming at him.
          
                                    MATTHEW
                          It's perfect. We'll take it.
          
                Suzuki looks back to the corner.    There's no dead cat.
          
                A RINGING SOUND comes into focus -- the BEEPING of a phone,
                waiting for someone to pick up and make the connection...

                It's after-hours in this office space: CUBICLES fill the
                center, surrounded by glass-windowed OFFICES. The glittering
                lights of the Tokyo cityscape beyond show a hell of a view.
          
                One light still burns in an office towards the end --
          
                -- SUSAN'S OFFICE. She's working late. She wears a phone
                headset while she types lines of code into her computer.
          
                No one's answering.   A familiar answering machine picks up:

                          you there? Pick up... Okay, well,

                          later.
          
                She pauses.   Leans back, away from the keyboard.

                Susan walks through the hallway. She hears a strange
                scraping sound -- it sounds as though something is being
                dragged.
          
                Susan turns around, but the hallway looks normal. Is it just
                her imagination?
          
                The sound starts again, coming closer. Susan gets scared and
                opens the door to the emergency stairwell beside her.

                INT. STAIRWELL - 10TH FLOOR - NIGHT
                The hallway is chilly -- Susan shivers. She's about to start
                walking down when she looks up, noticing THE LIGHTS at the
                top floor FLICKERING.
          
                A wind suddenly blows through the center of the stairwell
                with an eerie ROAR.
          
                Susan looks disconcerted as she starts walking down...
          
                Then we hear the SCRAPING SOUND again. Startled, Susan
                pauses and looks down, over the railing.
          
                There's nothing there -- but the sound continues, growing
                louder, like something is moving up towards her.
          
                                    SUSAN
                              (calling out:)
                          Is anybody there?
          
                Just then, the lights on the top floor finally GO OUT.
          
                Susan's breath catches in her throat as she looks up --
          
                The lights on the next floor go out. And the next. The
                darkness above growing closer with each darkening floor.
          
                Susan nervously looks back down -- the SCRAPING is even
                closer. And then, for an instant, she sees A SKINNY PALE
                HAND on the railing two floors down.
          
                Terrified, Susan starts to back up -- but stops as she
                realizes that the darkness from above is almost upon her.

                Then Susan sees A FINGERTIP of the hand at the corner of the
                floor where she stands, and A HEAD COVERED WITH BLACK HAIR
                slowly crawling up on the wall.
          
                Susan's mouth opens in a silent screen. With nowhere to
                escape, she opens the same door and rushes back into the

                 -- but her lucky RABBIT'S FOOT gets caught on the door latch.
                 Panicking, Susan struggles to free herself --
          
                 Through the crack, she sees the darkness continuing to come
                 down. The lights on Susan's floor FLICKER.
          
                 Susan looks up to see A PALE BOY on the landing to the higher
                 floor. The SAME BOY is also standing on the landing of each
                 floor above. They're all staring down at Susan.
          
                 Susan screams as she desperately tries to yank her chain
                 free... and then she sees THE PALE HAND clutching her
                 rabbit's foot!
          
                 The door shuts, and Susan falls backwards into the hallway.
          
                 She jumps to her feet and runs down the hall.

                 A cramped room. Susan stands in the doorway, animatedly
                 talking to a young SECURITY GUARD sitting at a desk lined
                 with VIDEO MONITORS. She's speaking rapidly, and shaking:
          
                                     SUSAN (IN JAPANESE)
                           In the stairs... there was...
                           something... a strange person...
                           all the lights were going out...
          
                 The Guard doesn't understand her -- in her panic, Susan's
                 MISPRONOUNCING HER WORDS, and she knows it.
          
                 Susan takes a breath, frustrated and frightened.
          
                                     SUSAN
                               (pleading, in English)
                           Please. Help me.
          
                 The Guard stands, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder.
          
                                     GUARD (IN JAPANESE)
                           I'll take a look. Wait here.
          
                 The Guard leaves.   Susan doesn't look thrilled to be alone.

                 Holding a flashlight, the Guard walks down the hallway,
                 checking the doors.

                Susan takes a breath and sits down, trying to relax. It's
                obvious that she feels safer, here in the Security Room.
          
                Then she notices movement on one of the SECURITY MONITORS --
          
                ON THE SCREEN: -- the GUARD continues down the 10TH FLOOR
                HALL, stopping at the door to the stairwell.
          
                Susan leans toward the monitor for a better view.
          
                ON THE SCREEN: the Guard opens the stairwell door and leans
                inside, checking it out.
          
                ON SUSAN:   her eyes are glued to the screen.   Waiting.
          
                ON THE SCREEN: the Guard, finding nothing out of the
                ordinary, closes the door and continues on down the hall.
          
                SUSAN leans back, exhaling.    Relieved.
          
                Then the video CRACKLES with a sudden quick burst of static.
          
                And Susan GASPS, sitting upright, as she sees --
          
                ON THE SCREEN:   the stairwell door OPENS AGAIN.   And then --
          
                -- something DARK moves out of the stairwell, entering the
                hallway.
          
                ON SUSAN: she recoils from the screen in horror, unable to
                tear her gaze away. Her mouth opens in a silent scream, her
                eyes widening as she watches --
          
                -- and then she finds the strength to get to her feet.

               A shifting wash of colors flood the taxi: the NEON LIGHTS of

               Susan rushes through the front doors, clutching her purse
               strap with both hands. Shaken, just wanting to get home.
          
               She runs to the elevator and jabs the button for her floor.

               through the window of every floor she passes --
          
               Toshio. He's standing CLOSER TO THE WINDOW with each floor.
               Until finally, he's RIGHT NEXT TO THE GLASS --
          
               The elevator stops at her floor:    no little boy this time.

               She chances a look over her shoulder as she puts the key in

               Susan enters. She takes a long, deep breath. Safe at home.
               She sits at her kitchen table, laying her purse down.
          
               Her eyes go to the BROKEN CHAIN still hanging from the strap,
               with some rabbit's foot fur lodged in the links.
          
               Susan's home phone RINGS, and she jumps.    She stares at it

               She presses a button on the phone, and is about to hang up --
          
               Almost immediately there's a LOUD KNOCK at her door. She
               gets to her feet, surprised. How did he get up so fast?
          
               Susan goes to the door and looks through the peephole.
          
               HER POV: Matthew's face, distorted by the fish-eye glass.
               He's looking into the peephole, with a sneer on his face.
          
               Susan opens the door.

                         this is not cool --
          
               She catches her breath.   THERE'S NO ONE THERE.
          
               Then the phone emits the THROATY CROAKING sound.   Quickly
               growing louder and LOUDER...
          
               Susan cries out and drops the phone. It BREAKS OPEN on the

               Otherwise, the hallway is empty.

                Susan enters, turning off her cell phone and unplugging the
                bedroom phone from the wall.
          
                Then she retreats to the safety of her bed, eyes on --
          
                THE APARTMENT DOOR, next to the kitchen.    Silence.
          
                Susan's breathing slows. But she looks around the room,
                still anxious -- it's too quiet in here. Her panic builds.
                But she's alone in the room, isn't she?
          
                As we MOVE IN on Susan, the room starts to become quieter.
                The SOUND OF TRAFFIC from outside, the HUMMING REFRIGERATOR
                in the kitchen... everything fades to a stifling silence.
          
                And Susan notices, all right.    Her breath, now suddenly loud,
                catches in her throat.
          
                A long moment of silence.   Then --
          
                -- DRIP.   DRIP.
          
                It's coming from the KITCHEN SINK.
          
                Susan stares at it.   She finally stands, and --

                -- slowly walks into THE KITCHEN. She reaches out and turns
                the faucet handle. Tightens it. The dripping stops.
          
                Relieved, Susan turns away --
          
                -- DRIP.   DRIP.   It begins again.   Louder, more intense.
          
                Scared, Susan turns back to the sink. Water is now GUSHING
                OUT from the faucet, filling up a bowl in the sink.
          
                She slowly reaches out a hand and turns the faucet, as
                tightly as she can manage --
          
                -- tighter... tighter... straining with the effort..
          
                Until the water stops.   Only then does she let go --
          
                -- just then, a CHILD'S PALE HAND quietly rises to the
                surface from water in the bowl, and starts VIOLENTLY
                SPLASHING the surface.

                She lies down, shivering, pulling the quilt to her chin.      A
                final retreat.
          
                                    SUSAN
                          Please... stop it...
          
                The SPLASHING SOUNDS in the kitchen continue for a while.
                Then, it suddenly stops.
          
                Susan is so terrified that she almost faints.
          
                Then her breathing stops.   Her eyes widen.
          
                Her hand reaches up under her pillow, feeling around --
          
                -- and she comes out with HER LUCKY RABBIT'S FOOT.
          
                The one she left behind in the stairwell.
          
                Susan suddenly CRIES OUT, her head tilting back, her body
                abruptly going stiff. We soon see why:
          
                A LUMP begins to rise at the foot of the bed. A big one.
                Moving slowly up Susan's body. Reaching the edge of the
                quilt, which slowly rises --
          
                -- revealing a QUICK FLASH of the PALE FACE OF THE JAPANESE
                WOMAN WITH LONG DARK HAIR on top of her!
          
                Susan SCREAMS, and is abruptly pulled under the covers --

               The knocking has stopped.    Silence.
          
               Then Karen's cell phone suddenly LIGHTS UP, ringing.
          
               It rings four times, then goes to voice mail.

               A new SOUND breaks the silence: movement outside. Crunching
               footsteps on gravel, someone brushing past tree limbs.
          
               A SHADOW falls over the window.   A face looks inside --
          
               -- it's ALEX, Karen's boss. He walks away from the window
               and continues down the side of the house --
          
               -- we TRACK down the hallway, past the bathroom, through the
               kitchen, following his progress into --
          
               THE BACK ROOM: Alex is visible through the sliding door
               leading to the back porch. He peers inside.
          
               HIS POV: A FIGURE covered head-to-toe in a white sheet lies
               on the mattress. Unmoving.
          
               Alex tries the sliding door -- it's open.     He steps inside.
          
                                     ALEX
                         Karen?
          
               Silence greets him.   He stares down at the figure in the bed.
          
               Alex licks his lips, nervous.   Finally walks to the mattress,
               kneeling down next to it.
          
               Raises a hand and grabs the sheet.      Raises it over the head --
          
               -- it's Emma. As we last saw her, eyes on the ceiling, mouth
               and eyes wide open in fear.
          
               But now it's clear, from the tache noire in the eyes, the
               blanched skin, the rigidity of her body: she's dead.
          
               Alex falls back onto his butt, staring at Emma.     He pulls
               himself away from the corpse --
          
               -- and freezes.    There's something right behind him.
               He whirls around --
          
               -- it's KAREN.    In the corner, looking pale and dazed.

               Two POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE are parked out front.
          
               An UNMARKED CAR pulls up, and DETECTIVE NAKAGAWA (40s) exits
               the passenger side. He looks up at The House with dread.
          
               The driver, DETECTIVE IGARASHI (30s), moves next to him.
          
                                   IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                         I can handle this myself, you know.
                         It's just a routine call. I don't
                         know why you wanted to come.
          
               He turns to Nakagawa, awaiting a response. He doesn't get
               one. Nakagawa just stares up at The House.

               INT. THE HOUSE - LATER
               The house feels completely different: all the interior
               lights are on, a few POLICE OFFICERS mill about, two EMTs
               wheel EMMA'S BODY out the front door on a gurney.
          
               Alex sits at the kitchen table, frazzled.   He turns to --
          
               -- KAREN. She's sitting in the living room, wrapped in a
               blanket, being attended to by a FEMALE NURSE and speaking
               with Nakagawa and Igarashi, who is taking notes on a pad.
          
               Karen says something and the Detective looks over at Alex.
               Then he speaks to the Nurse, who helps Karen to her feet.
          
               Nakagawa and Igarashi enter the kitchen.    In perfect English:
          
                                   NAKAGAWA
                         I am Detective Nakagawa. This is
                         Detective Igarashi, my assistant.
          
                                   ALEX
                         Is Karen okay?

                    tonight, under evaluation.
          
          He hands Alex a wedding picture of MATTHEW AND JENNIFER.

                    I met them when they came to
                    register. It's standard procedure,
                    though the visits were arranged by
                    his employer. He works at --

                    did not show up for work today.
          
          Something about this gives Alex pause. Nakagawa speaks
          briefly to Igarashi in Japanese, then hands Alex a card.
          
                              NAKAGAWA

               They pause in the hallway for a moment. Then Nakagawa walks
               into the rear room (Matthew's office). The BEEPING is close.
          
               He stands there, in the center of the room, listening.
          
               Then he looks up, at the ceiling.    Everyone follows suit.

               And right next to it are FOUR LONG GROOVES in the ceiling.

               Something like fingernails.
          
               Nakagawa leans out, looking at Igarashi.
          
                                    NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                          I need your flashlight.

               INT. ATTIC - NIGHT
          
               A shaft of light from the flashlight through the open attic
               access cuts through the thick darkness.
          
               Nakagawa appears, pulling himself up into the attic.     He
               swings his flashlight slowly around the room.
          
               Igarashi comes up next to Nakagawa just as the Detective's
               flashlight stops on something.
          
               A beat as they exchange an uneasy look.
          
               Then Nakagawa and Igarashi crawl through the darkness towards
               the far corner of the space.
          
               Two bodies are tucked into the corner.    MATTHEW AND JENNIFER.

                         God!
          
               Nakagawa sits in front of the bodies, examining them.
          
                                   IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                         What the hell... what is going on?
          
               Nakagawa sees the beeping CORDLESS PHONE a few feet away.
          
               SOMETHING next to it attracts Nakagawa's interest. We can't
               see what it is, but there's some DEEP RED in it, and
               something very WHITE --
          
                                   IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                         What is that?
          
               -- Nakagawa's eyes widen as he realizes what he's looking at.
          
          76                                                                 76
               EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT
               The POLICE CARS outside have attracted a small crowd.   The
               TWO BODIES are being loaded into a POLICE VAN.
          
               Nakagawa stands with THE CORONER. The CORONER'S ASSISTANT,
               wearing a face mask and rubber gloves, approaches. He holds
               something small, wrapped in a bloody white sheet.
          
               The Coroner slowly unfolds the sheet. We can't see what he's
               looking at -- but it elicits quite a reaction.
          
                                   CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                         Who does this belong to?
          
                                   NAKAGAWA   (IN JAPANESE)
                         We don't know.
          
               The Coroner quickly re-covers the object.
          
                                   CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                         I can use the blood to help
                         identify the person.
          
               As the Coroner and his assistant walk away:
          
                                   NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                         Is it possible that someone could
                         live without... that?
          
               The Coroner turns back, his face pale.

                Nakagawa turns away to see Igarashi approaching, talking into
                a cell phone. He looks disturbed. As he hangs up:
          
                                    IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                          Someone just reported another
                          death. It's not in our district...
                          but I think we should check it out.
          
                Nakagawa realizes something's troubling his partner.
          
                                       NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                          Why?

                          The cause of death is not clear...
                          but it is the man who sold them
                          this house.

                EXT. TOKYO STREET - DAY
                CLOSE ON the spinning wheels of a bicycle.      A familiar one.
          
                The pedals are being pumped by a beautiful young Japanese
                woman -- this is YOKO (early 20s).
          
                Yoko turns, riding down a small side street.      It ends, and
                she rounds a corner stopping in front of --

                Yoko opens the gate and walks her bike to the front door,
                leaning it against the wall nearby (exactly where we saw
                Matthew bump into it earlier).
          
                She rings the door buzzer. Waits. She seems to have
                expected this: she pulls a KEY from her pocket, with a
                plastic LABEL on it.

                Yoko steps inside. She instinctively slips off her shoes.
                She calls out, in decent English:
          
                                    YOKO
                          Hi, excuse me?
          
                There's a small ENVELOPE with YOKO'S NAME resting on a small
                table by the door. She takes it, opens it.

                         Emma?   It's Yoko.   I'm coming in.
          
          
          79   INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                           79
          
               The house is the least "moved-into" that we've seen so far:
               although the main furniture is in place, MOVING BOXES are
               stacked in every room, in various stages of unpacking.
          
               But there's also an unusual amount of mess in the house -- a
               disarray, much like the opening sequence, that isn't exactly
               related to moving in.
          
               Yoko surveys the room, dismayed by the mess.
          
               Then she sees EMMA at the far end of the living room, her
               back to Yoko. She's looking down at something in her hands.
          
                                     YOKO
                         Hi, Emma.    It's good to see you
                         again.
          
               Emma turns. Looks blankly at Yoko, who approaches.
               Realizing the woman doesn't remember her:
          
                                   YOKO
                         My name is Yoko.
          
               The old woman still gives no sign of recognition.   Yoko
               gently takes her arm.
          
                                   YOKO
                         You should be in bed --
          
               Then she sees what Emma was looking at: the roll of DUCT
               TAPE. She's cut her finger on the serrated cutting blade.
          
                                   YOKO (IN JAPANESE)
                         You shouldn't be playing with this!
          
               Shaking her head, Yoko takes the duct tape and looks around
               for a place where Emma can't get at it --
          
               -- she puts the tape ON THE STACK OF BOOKS at the top of the
               bookshelf, next to the scissors (where Matthew found them).

                From the entrance, we see Yoko come out of the kitchen
                holding a tray with a teapot and cup.
          
                She walks into the BACK ROOM, looking down at Emma's bed.
                The old woman must be asleep: Yoko gently lays down the
                tray, quietly steps out of the room and slides the door shut.
          
                Then Yoko moves through the LIVING ROOM to the PHONE BASE --
          
                -- she picks up THE CORDLESS, finally where it belongs.
          
                Yoko dials a number as she walks into THE ENTRANCE HALL.     She
                begins a conversation (in Japanese) as she looks at the
                scattered rubbish on the ground, shaking her head.
          
                She climbs up to the SECOND FLOOR, pausing to kneel and pick
                up some pieces of crumpled paper, chatting all the while.
          
                THUD. THUD. Yoko pauses, turning towards the open door to
                the front room. The rhythmic THUMPING continues.

                The room is a mess. The bed is unmade, clothes are strewn on
                the floor. Looks like a storm swept through it.
          
                Yoko stands in the doorway, listening for the THUMPING
                sounds. But they've stopped.
          
                She finishes her call and hangs up. Sighs. She sticks the
                cordless phone into her pocket and starts to clean the room.
          
                As Yoko straightens the bedspread, she hears something.
                Pauses. And we hear it too --
          
                -- a familiar THROATY CROAKING SOUND.   Quiet and muffled.

                 Yoko, a bit unnerved by the strange sound, pulls a small MP3
                 player and headphones from her pocket. She puts them on, and
                 goes back to work.

                 Yoko backs into the hallway, humming along to the music.
                 Preoccupied, she doesn't notice as --
          
                 The DOOR TO THE REAR ROOM, at the end of the dark hall behind
                 her, SLOWLY SWINGS OPEN.
          
                 Yoko turns and walks down the hall towards it.

                 Yoko enters the room, which is also a mess. The MOVING BOXES
                 are tumbled about the small room. She sighs.
          
                 Then she notices the CERAMIC CAT on the shelf, FACING HER
                 (where Susan left it).   Apparently she's not a big fan of
                 felines: she uneasily turns it to FACE THE WALL instead.
          
                 Yoko turns back to the room, staring to stack the moving
                 boxes (the way we saw them before). As she does --
          
                 -- she pauses again. The music in her headphones starts
                 PHASING, digital noise creeping in...
          
                 Yoko takes off the headphones.   Stares at them.
          
                 And then there's another CROAKING SOUND.   From close by.
          
                 Yoko draws a breath, quickly looking up --
          
                 -- AT THE CEILING, directly above her.   That's where the
                 horrible sound is coming from.
          
                 Freaked out, Yoko backs away, and opens the bedroom door --

                 The skylights above, which were previously filled with
                 sunlight, are now completely opaque.
          
                 Yoko stands in the doorway, scared, afraid to step into the
                 darkness. Then she looks down --

          86   INT. THE HOUSE - REAR ROOM - DAY                              86
          
               Yoko stumbles back into the room.   Her eyes fixed on --
          
               -- THE DOORWAY: the creeping darkness is now coming in
               around all sides, not just the bottom.
          
               Yoko backs up to the bed, still clutching the CORDLESS PHONE.
          
               She looks back at the door, suddenly CRYING OUT --
          
                                        Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04         50.
          
          
          
               -- A BLACK CAT sits in the doorway. Tail wrapped around
               itself, sitting perfectly still, like a statue. Staring at
               Yoko with its yellow eyes. Something unnatural about it.
          
               Yoko backs away towards the closet.   Nowhere to go.
          
               The cat suddenly HISSES AT HER --
          
               -- and that's all Yoko can take.    In a panic, she opens the
               closet door, ducks inside.
          
          
          87   INT. CLOSET - DAY                                              87
          
               Yoko slams the door shut, pulling herself up onto a raised
               shelf. Breathing hard, looking down at --
          
               -- the crack under the door.   The light is beginning to dim.
          
               Yoko presses back into the closet, trapped.
          
               The closet is starting to get dark.   Quickly.
          
               Yoko looks around desperately.   Looking up, she sees --
          
               -- THE ATTIC PANEL above her is wide open.
          
               Caught between a rock and a hard place.   Yoko decides:
          
               She shakily stands on the shelf and reaches up to pull
               herself into the attic.
          
          88                                                                  88
               INT. ATTIC - DAY
               Yoko's head appears. Then her shoulders.     She looks around,
               but can't see a thing in the darkness.
          
               She's about to pull herself all the way up --
          
               -- when she hears the THROATY CROAKING SOUND.
          
               Coming from the darkness.
          
               Yoko stiffens, her breath catching in her throat.
          
               ANOTHER POV: we're at the far end of the attic, suddenly and
               rapidly RACING FORWARD TOWARDS YOKO...
          
               ON YOKO:   something brushes her face.   Long, black hair.
          
               There's a head, just inches from hers.    Almost nose-to-nose.

               Yoko is paralyzed with fear, eyes wide.   A long beat.
          
               Then she reaches into her pocket, pulling out a LIGHTER.
          
               Yoko raises it and flicks the wheel --
          
               -- we get a glimpse of a PALE FACE, surrounded by long black
               hair, eyes wide and mouth open, the THROATY SOUND suddenly
               increasing in pitch and volume --
          
               -- as the face moves forward --
          
                                                             CUT TO BLACK.

               Karen slowly wakes up in bed.    As her eyes clear, she sees --
          
               DOUG. He sits on the edge of the bed, slightly slumped, his
               back to her.
          
               He slowly turns -- and a relieved smile crosses his face.     He
               moves closer, and reaches out a hand.
          
                                      DOUG
                         It's okay.     I've got you.
          
               Karen nods, lacing her fingers in his. But her eyes are
               glazed and unfocused -- she's exhausted.
          
                                    DOUG
                         Your boss told me what happened.
                         I'm sorry.
          
               She turns away, the memory bothering her.    Doug takes her
               hand, massaging her fingers, worried.
          
                                   DOUG
                         I talked to your teachers. They
                         said you can take as much time as
                         you need. We could go to Kyoto for
                         a weekend, see those temples you're
                         always talking about.
          
               Karen tries to smile back, but her heart's not in it.
          
                                   KAREN
                         Running away won't help.

                    DOUG
          There's nothing to run away from,
          Kat. No one blames you for what
          happened.

                              KAREN
                    I'm not even sure what did happen.
          
                              DOUG
                    You went to help someone who was,
                    quite simply, beyond help.
          
                              KAREN
                    No, that's not what I mean...
          
          She trails off, trying to remember.   Doug waits.
          
                              KAREN
                    That house. There was something...
          
          Doug sees her frustration, and tenderly brushes a hair from
          her face.
          
                              DOUG
                    Don't beat yourself up searching
                    for a greater truth, Kat. An old
                    woman passed away in her sleep.
                    It's sad, but that's all it is --
          
                              KAREN
                    Is that how they said she died?
          
                              DOUG
                    I'm sorry this happened to you.
                    But maybe, in a way, it will help
                    you later. Death is an unfortunate
                    but integral part of your future
                    career. There's no avoiding it.
                    Maybe now you'll be more... ready
                    for it.
          
                              KAREN
                    I don't think I'll ever be ready
                    for something like that.
          
          She turns away. Doug wraps an arm around her.   Karen leans
          into him, and he strokes her hair.

          The moment is broken by a soft KNOCK. Detective Nakagawa
          stands in the doorway, holding a thick FILE.
          
                               NAKAGAWA
                    I'm sorry to disturb you, Miss
                    Davies. I was wondering if you
                    could answer some additional
                    questions?
          
          Doug stands, intercepting Nakagawa.   He sticks out a hand.
          
                                DOUG
                    I'm Doug.    Karen's boyfriend.
          
          Nakagawa nods. Fixes Doug with a blank stare.   Taking the
          hint, Doug turns to Karen.
          
                              DOUG
                    You up for this?
          
                              KAREN
                        (nodding:)
                    Why don't you find out when I can
                    check out of here.

          Reluctantly, Doug kisses her brow, then exits. Nakagawa
          pulls a chair up to the bed and sits, putting the file on a
          small table.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    How are you feeling?
          
                               KAREN
                    Okay.   Tired.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    You are an exchange student?
                        (Karen nods:)
                    And you have been volunteering at
                    the Health Center for...?
          
                              KAREN
                    Three months. I needed a social
                    welfare credit.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    You said this was the first time
                    you'd been in that house?
          
                               KAREN
                    Yes.
          
          She notices Nakagawa isn't taking notes. He seems somewhat
          uncomfortable, as if he's building to something:
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    About the Japanese boy you said you
                    saw there --
          
                              KAREN
                    Did you find him?
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    No, not yet. You said the boy had
                    been taped into the closet?
          
                              KAREN
                    Yes, that's right. He was...
                    holding a cat. A black cat.
                        (remembering:)
                    There was a book in the closet,
                    too. I think it was a journal.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    Did it belong to the boy?

          I don't think so. I think it
          belonged to a woman.

          Nakagawa looks up.   Karen tries to explain:
          
                              KAREN
                    The writing. It looked feminine.

                              KAREN
                    I left it on the kitchen table.
          
          Nakagawa frowns, scribbles a note.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    I didn't see any book on the table.
                    Perhaps someone moved it. Did you
                    speak with the boy after you opened
                    the closet?
          
          She thinks, recalling:
          
                              KAREN
                    I asked him his name.   He said
                    `Toshio'.
          
          Nakagawa immediately tenses. A long beat. He can see how
          exhausted Karen is. But something's troubling him:
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    One more question, please.
          
          He slowly reaches into his pocket and pulls out THE PHOTO
          Karen found, and taped together. He shows it to her.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    We found this in the room where...
          
          Karen looks at the picture.
          
                              KAREN
                    This is him. This is the boy.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    Are you certain?
          
                               KAREN
                    Yes.   Positive.
          
          Nakagawa stares down at the picture in his hands.
          
          And Karen notices -- Nakagawa's hands are shaking.
          
                              KAREN
                    Detective Nakagawa?
          
          He looks up at her, a faraway look in his eyes.
          
                              KAREN
                    The whole time I was in that house,
                    I felt something was... wrong.

          From the expression on Nakagawa's face, she's onto something.
          
                              KAREN
                    What happened there?
          
          Nakagawa holds Karen's gaze for a moment. Even in her
          exhausted state, it's clear -- she's as frightened as he is.

                                   NAKAGAWA
                         The bodies of the son and daughter-
                         in-law of the woman you were caring
                         for were found in the attic.
          
               Karen just stares at him, stunned.
          
                                   NAKAGAWA
                         It seems that the son killed his
                         wife, and then himself --
          
               There's a KNOCK on the door. Igarashi stands in the doorway.
               He speaks to Nakagawa in Japanese.
          
                                   NAKAGAWA
                             (to Karen)
                         Please excuse me for a moment.
          
               Nakagawa puts the photo down and steps into the hallway and
               closes the door, but not all the way. Karen watches and
               listens through the crack:

               INT. HOSPIAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT
               IN THE HALLWAY:   the men speak with hushed voices.
          
                                   IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                         We checked the apartment of Susan,
                         the sister. She wasn't there...
          
               He trails off, hesitating.
          
                                     NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                         Yes?
          
                                   IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                         The chain lock had been drawn from
                         the inside. And the deadbolt. But
                         we found no one in the apartment.
          
               Nakagawa takes this in.
          
                                   NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                         Get the surveillance tapes from the
                         office building.
          
               Igarashi nods.    But doesn't move.   After a moment, quietly:
          
                                   IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                         They were the first family to live
                         in that house since the incident
                         three years ago --
          
                                        Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        56.
          
          
          
               Nakagawa's harsh look silences him. Then the Detective
               turns, noticing KAREN watching them. He pulls the door shut.

               Nakagawa's stern voice is muffled by the closed door.    Karen
               sits back in bed, disturbed.
          
               Then her attention turns to THE FILE on the table.
          
               She considers.   Then reaches for it.   Opens it.
          
               It's a POLICE REPORT, in Japanese.
          
               Karen scans it, and turns the page.     She draws a breath --
          
               -- it's a photo of THE HOUSE. Cordoned off with police tape.
               An ambulance out front. Like the scene she just left...
          
               ...only the picture is dated three years ago.
          
               THREE DETECTIVES are visible beyond the open front door,
               conferring in the entryway.
          
               The photo of the house is attached to a POLICE REPORT, with
               THREE PICTURES. A stern-looking Japanese man (TAKEO), a
               somber woman (KAYAKO), and a YOUNG BOY we know very well --
          
               Karen makes the connection. She picks up the taped-up photo
               and compares it to the file... the boy and his father are the
               same as in the newspaper.
          
               Karen gently touches the "missing" face of KAYAKO -- then her
               eyes move to the picture of THE BOY.
          
               Her eyes widen as she reads THE JAPANESE TEXT under his face:
          
                                     KAREN

               INT. NURSING CARE CENTER - NIGHT
               The place is quiet, completely deserted.    Except for --
          
               -- Alex. He's behind his desk in the reception area, staring
               off into space. Alex finally glances up at a clock -- it's
               almost ten o'clock.
          
               He gets up, turns off his computer, switches off the lights,
               and walks around the reception desk towards --
          
                                    Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     57.
          
          
          
          THE FRONT DOORS. He hits a final light switch and is almost
          to the exit, when --
          
          -- he suddenly SLIPS. Almost falls.    Saves himself by
          throwing a hand up against the wall.
          
          He looks down.    What the hell did he slip on?
          
          A pool of liquid. Right by the front doors, where the ladder
          stood earlier. It's too dark to make out what the fluid is.
          
          Alex looks down at HIS HAND -- it's covered in the liquid.
          And there's a dark HANDPRINT where he grabbed the wall.
          
          HIS POV: a trail of FOOTPRINTS lead from the pool of liquid,
          around the base of the stairs.
          
          His eyes on his dirtied hand, Alex slowly reaches for the
          nearby light switch. The overheads come on --
          
          -- the liquid is deep red.   Blood.
          
          Alex looks across the room. Shaking, he starts to walk
          forward, following the footsteps.
          
          He pauses at the bottom of the stairs, seeing --
          
          -- the BLOOD TRAIL has stopped.   Right by the bottom step.
          
          Alex looks up the staircase.   No blood.
          
          After a moment, Alex starts to walk up.    As he reaches the
          first landing --
          
          He freezes.   Sensing something behind him.   He turns to see --
          
          YOKO. Head lowered, clothing is torn and bloody. She's
          slowly climbing up the steps, but she's MOVING JERKILY, like
          a marionette, her limbs making a strange CREAKING as if
          tendons and muscles are being pushed to their limits.
          
          And there's BLOOD DRIPPING DOWN, splattering on her shoes.
          
                                ALEX
                    Yoko?
          
          She keeps moving, straining, climbing... towards him.

                          What... What happened, Yoko?
          
               Now she finally stops, two steps away.    A long beat.
          
                                    ALEX
                          Say something, please...
          
               Yoko slowly raises her head towards him --
          
               -- the lower half of her face is missing. Her jawbone has
               been ripped out, her tongue hanging limply on her chest.
          
               Alex stumbles backwards... and his foot lands right in a
               puddle of blood. His legs fly out from under him and he
               CRACKS HIS HEAD AGAINST THE GROUND.
          
               HIS POV: everything goes blurry, and canted 90 degrees.       But
               it looks like there's A FIGURE standing in the hallway,
               watching the scene...
          
               ...a small boy holding a black cat...
          
               Dazed, Alex plants a hand on the ground and pulls himself
               into a seating position --
          
               -- and coming face-to-face with YOKO, kneeling down directly
               in front of him. Her bloody tongue dripping, lolling...
          
               ON ALEX:   eyes wide, he opens his mouth to scream --
          
                                                              HARD CUT TO:

               Nakagawa sits at the desk. Exhausted, dark circles under his
               eyes, he's staring down at --
          
               THE FILE on his desk.   As if he's afraid to even open it.
          
               But he does. He flips through the photos, pausing on that of
               TOSHIO, but continuing on to THE BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO of The
               House from three years ago (the one Karen saw), with the
               THREE DETECTIVES.
          
               Nakagawa turns to a FRAMED PICTURE on his desk -- it's
               YOUNGER NAKAGAWA at a bar with THREE FAMILIAR DETECTIVES.
               They're off-duty, grinning at the camera. Buddies.
          
               The two photographs share THE SAME THREE DETECTIVES.

               As Nakagawa looks at the crime scene photo, he realizes
               something. He slowly stands, in shock, trembling.
          
               The phone RINGS, startling him.
          
               Nakagawa walks over, picks up the phone.
          
                                      NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                         Hello?
          
               He listens.
          
               His face goes blank.    He slowly lowers the phone.

               The CORONER sits on a stool, staring at the floor. TWO
               BODIES lie under bloody white sheets on two STEEL TABLES.
               Between them is a small cart -- a bloody cloth on top.
          
               Nakagawa and Igarashi enter. The Coroner stands, nervous.
               He walks to one of the tables and pulls back the sheet.
          
                                   NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                         Have you determined a cause of
                         death?
          
                                   CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                         Not yet. The blood on his body --
                         isn't his. It belongs to her.
          
               He points to the other table.    But doesn't look at it.

                       I don't understand. He killed
                       Yoko, before he died?
          
          The Coroner shakes his head. Nakagawa looks to Igarashi,
          then walks up to the second body, pulling back the sheet.
          
          IT'S YOKO.    Still missing her jawbone.
          
          Nakagawa and Igarashi stare down at her in disbelief.
          
          The Coroner walks to the small table, removing the cloth.
          Yoko's JAWBONE is underneath it.
          
                                 CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                       The jawbone you found in the attic
                       yesterday with the American couple
                       belongs to this girl. I estimate
                       it was -- removed -- from her body
                       two or three days ago.
          
                                 IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                       But I thought you said her body was
                       found with this man, tonight.
          The Coroner nods.    Eyes on his shoes.
          
                                 NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                       Then how did she get from the house
                       to the Health Center?                                
          
          The Coroner, lost in his imagination, answers quietly:
          
                                 CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                       I have no idea.
          
          A beat.   Nakagawa walks to the jawbone.   Stares at it.
          
                                 NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                       She survived for two days without
                       this?
          
                                 CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                       It would seem so.

                       How is that possible?
          
          The Coroner looks up at him, his face pale.

                 Doug sits on the bed, next to a DRESSING CURTAIN. Karen's
                 silhouette is visible behind it, pulling on her clothes.
          
                 He watches the curtain for a beat, concerned.     Then:
          
                                     DOUG
                           I got us a guidebook to Kyoto. I
                           thought maybe we'd leave tomorrow --
          
                 The curtain suddenly SLIDES BACK.    Karen, dressed, stares at
                 him. She looks angry.
          
                                     KAREN
                           Why didn't you tell me?
          
                                     DOUG
                           Tell you what?
          
                                     KAREN
                           About the bodies they found in the
                           attic.
          
                                     DOUG
                           You were recovering from a shock.
                           I didn't want to --
          
                 Karen turns away, picking up her backpack and slinging it.
                 She walks past him, disappointed, and leaves the room.
          
                                     DOUG
                           Karen -- wait --
          
                 He quickly grabs his coat and bag.
          
          100a                                                                100a
                 INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY
                 Karen paces down the hall towards a RECEPTION AREA.       Doug
                 catches up with her, turning her towards him.
          
                                     DOUG
                           Look, I'm sorry. I was just
                           worried about you, and -- I know
                           you, Karen.
          
                 Karen turns to him.   A sober look on her face.

                              KAREN
                    The same thing happened three years
                    ago, Doug. To a Japanese family,
                    who lived in that house. They were
                    all found dead.
          
          Doug studies her for a moment.
          
                               DOUG
                    So you think the events are
                    connected?
          
                              KAREN
                    How would you explain it?
          
          She watches Doug as he thinks.   Carefully.
          
                              DOUG
                    Okay. How about this: the
                    American family knew about what had
                    happened there before, and this
                    knowledge subconsciously caused
                    them to repeat the same events.
          
          Karen gives Doug a skeptical look.
          
                              DOUG
                    It's exactly how superstitions
                    survive: if you walk under a
                    ladder and think uh-oh, you're in
                    for some bad luck, sure enough,
                    what do you know? You trip over --
          
                              KAREN
                        (heard it before:)
                    -- trip over the curb and sprain
                    your ankle.
          
                              DOUG
                    Makes sense, right?
          
          Karen stops walking.   Considering something.

                              KAREN
                    Okay. Then explain this: when I
                    went to that house, I didn't know
                    anything about its past. But yet I
                    still saw...
          
          She hesitates, realizing she's said too much.
          
                                DOUG
                    Saw what?    Karen?
          
                              KAREN
                    Emma and I were alone in that room,
                    but -- there was something else
                    there. I'm sure of it.
          
                              DOUG
                    You watched a woman die, Kat.
                    That's a horrible thing to
                    experience. I can't imagine how
                    you must feel. But sometimes the
                    mind tries to cope with terrible
                    things in a way that distorts what
                    actually occurred.
          
          Karen's eyes never leave his.   Softly, but firmly:
          
                              KAREN
                    You might be right, Doug. But I
                    know what I saw.
                        (then, faltering:)
                    I think I know what I saw...
          
          After a moment, Doug pulls her into a hug.
          
                              DOUG
                    You just need to rest. We'll get
                    you home, get a good night's sleep.
          
                                KAREN
                    Yeah.
          
          But her eyes speak differently. She covers it well, stepping
          back and glancing over at the reception desk:
          
                              KAREN
                    You've got class, and I'm sure I
                    only have to fill out a few forms
                    or something --
          
                                DOUG
                    You sure?

          He kisses her, then exits. He pauses at the front doors to
          give her a little wave. She smiles... but the smile droops
          as soon as he's out of sight.
          
          After a moment, she turns and walks to the front desk.

                Karen sits at her computer desk.   She looks exhausted.
          
                Online, Karen pulls up the home page for The Japan Times, an
                English-language newspaper.
          
                She types Toshio's full name into a SEARCH window.
          
                A LIST of links appear, filling the screen. Karen scans
                them. Tries one. It's not what she's looking for.
          
                She re-enters Toshio's name along with a year -- `2001'.
          
                Only ONE LINK appears.   The word `MURDERED' in the headline.
          
                                         Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      64.
          
          
          
                Karen clicks it.   The article fills the screen.
          
                As Karen reads it, we catch glimpses of names -- `Toshio',
                `Kayako', `Takeo'. And an ominous phrase: "MURDER/SUICIDE".
          
                Karen clicks a link marked `IMAGE'. A scanned picture of the
                newspaper appears -- the article is on the front page, with
                familiar photos of Toshio, Kayako and Takeo.
          
                But then Karen's eyes drift to another picture at the bottom
                of the page --
          
                -- PETER. She quickly recognizes him from the picture she
                found in the journal. His name is printed below the photo.
                A picture of Peter and Maria's CONDO BUILDING is next to it.
          
                She looks at the headline:   "AMERICAN ENGLISH TEACHER THROWS
                SELF FROM BUILDING".
          
                Karen scans the article, thinking.   Then she looks up at --
          
                -- TOSHIO'S PICTURE.
          
                                                                DISSOLVE TO:

                INT. POLICE STATION - NAKAGAWA'S OFFICE - NIGHT
                Nakagawa is looking at the same picture, in his file.
          
                OFFICER #1 appears in the hall.   Knocks gently on the door.
          
                                     OFFICER #1 (IN JAPANESE)
                           This just came in. It's the
                           surveillance video you requested.
          
                It takes a moment for Nakagawa to snap out of it.
          
                He finally nods, takes the tape. He opens the envelope and
                looks at the cassette. Like he doesn't want to watch it.
          
                Then he turns to a TV/VCR combo and inserts the tape.
          
                ON THE SCREEN: the 10TH FLOOR HALLWAY from Susan's office
                building, and the door leading to the stairwell.
          
                A beat.   The image FLICKERS for a moment.
          
                Then the door suddenly bursts open and Susan, terrified, runs
                from the stairwell and down the hall.
          
                ON NAKAGAWA:   he fast-forwards the video.   Until --

                ON SCREEN: -- the SECURITY GUARD appears in the hallway.        As
                Susan saw earlier, he opens the door to the stairwell and
                looks inside. Then he closes the door and continues o.s.
          
                ON NAKAGAWA:   he reaches forward to turn off the video --
          
                ON SCREEN:   -- but then the video CRACKLES with a quick burst
                of static.   And the door to the stairwell opens again.
          
                ON NAKAGAWA: he's watching, entranced, terrified.      He can
                hardly believe what he's seeing --
          
                ON SCREEN: -- A DARK FIGURE EMERGES FROM THE STAIRWELL.    It's
                the shape of a woman with long hair --
          
                -- but the figure is BLURRY AND SHIFTING, as if the black
                shadow has loosely compacted itself into the form of a human.
          
                NAKAGAWA watches, breathless, as THE FIGURE slowly enters the
                hallway, passing by, underneath the camera.
          
                The image stops flickering.    An empty hallway now.   A beat.
          
                Nakagawa, his hand shaking, reaches forward, about to turn
                off the television set, when --
          
                DARKNESS SUDDENLY OVERTAKES THE SCREEN, rising up from the
                bottom until everything is dark. A strange HUMMING RATTLE
                comes from the speakers, and the image JITTERS madly.
          
                Nakagawa leans forward, right up to the screen, trying to
                make out an image in the swirling blackness --
          
                Two eyes open, staring at Nakagawa.
                Terrified, Nakagawa stands and turns away, closing his eyes.
          
                And when he finds the strength to look back --
          
                -- THE EYES are still there.
          
                Locked onto him, even though he's moved.
          
                Unflinching.   Unblinking.

                 He opens the door.   Nothing but yawning darkness inside.
          
                 Nakagawa picks up TWO HEAVY OBJECTS, one in each hand, and,
                 ducking under the police tape, enters the house.

                 Nakagawa puts the two heavy objects by the front door and
                 closes it. Now we can see what they are --
          
                 -- GASOLINE CANS.    Two gallons each.   Full.
          
                 Nakagawa catches his breath. Then he reaches for the lid of
                 one of the cans, starting to unscrew it. His hands are
                 shaking, and the gasoline SPLASHES AROUND inside --
          
                 -- but then there's ANOTHER SPLASHING SOUND.     From nearby.
          
                 Nakagawa freezes.    The splashing continues.    His eyes go to --
          
                 THE BATHROOM DOOR. It's closed. The SPLASHING is coming
                 from inside, accompanied by a series of THUDS. The sounds of
                 a small child, STRUGGLING...
          
                 Nakagawa fearfully reaches for the door handle --
          
          106a                                                               106a
                 INT. THE HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
                 Nakagawa's eyes widen as the door swings open.     He sees --
          
                 A YOUNG BOY kneeling by the edge of the tub, overflowing with
                 water. His head hangs below the surface.
          
                 Nakagawa immediately drops to the boy, lifting his lifeless
                 head from the water. It's TOSHIO. He's dead. Drowned.
          
                 Before Nakagawa can understand what's happening, the boy's
                 eyes SUDDENLY OPEN, fixing on Nakagawa --
          
                 -- and then a PALE HAND grabs Nakagawa's head from behind and
                 roughly pushes it into the water, holding him under.
          
                 Nakagawa's LEGS flail and kick as he struggles, his SCREAMING
                 muffled by the water. But finally, his legs become still.

                 THE WALL by Karen's computer desk is now covered with WEBPAGE

                 KAYAKO and TAKEO; MATTHEW and JENNIFER; PETER; and

                 In the center of it all is a picture of The House.
          
                 ON THE DESK is a PRINT-OUT: the newspaper article about
                 Peter's death, with the photo of his CONDO. Below the photo,
                 Karen has written the number `224'.
          
                 We hear the sound of RUNNING WATER -- it's the shower.   We
                 drift away from the desk and towards the bathroom...

                 Karen is in the shower. She stands there, glassy-eyed, as
                 the water runs over her. She's looking at --
          
                 -- HER REFLECTION in the mirror. It fogs up, obscuring the
                 view. This snaps Karen out of her trance.
          
                 She rinses her hair and squeezes some shampoo into her hand.
                 Starts a nice lather.
          
                 FROM BEHIND: Karen works the shampoo into her scalp.   But,
                 as she does, we see something...
          
                 ... A PALE HAND BURIED UNDER HER HAIR, as if someone is
                 behind her, with a hand on her head.
          
                 Karen's fingers brush the hand.   She CRIES OUT and turns --
          
                 -- there's no one there.   She's alone.

                There's the sound of the front door UNLOCKING and Doug
                enters, carrying a bag. He closes the door behind him and
                walks in, turning the corner --
          
                -- finding Karen, looking a bit dazed, standing right there.
                He's startled, but quickly recovers:
          
                                    DOUG
                          I come bearing gifts.
          
                Karen smiles weakly. She takes the bag and enters the
                kitchen. He watches her go, worried. Then he notices --
          
                HER DESK. Doug walks over, looking at the printouts she's
                taped to the wall. And the photo of The House in the center.
          
                Bewildered, he sits down, leaning forward and taking a good
                look. His eyes stop on the picture of TOSHIO.
          
                Doug turns to see Karen staring at him from the kitchen.
                It's an awkward moment: he's concerned, but doesn't know
                what to say. And neither does Karen.
          
                Finally she approaches, looking at Toshio's picture:

                     That's the boy who was there
                     yesterday. In that house. But
                     this boy, he's --
          
          Her voice trembles, her fear showing through.
          
                               KAREN
                     -- he's supposed to be dead.
          
          A beat.   Karen's eyes plead with Doug.
          
                               KAREN
                     I saw him, Doug. I talked to him.
                     He told me his name. A boy who was
                     killed by his father three years
                     ago told me his name.
          
          Doug looks away, shaking his head.
          
                               KAREN
                     You don't believe me.
          
                               DOUG
                     How can I believe you, Karen?
          
          Karen's face darkens.   Before she can retort --
          
          -- the phone RINGS. As Karen walks across the room to answer
          it, Doug starts reading the newspaper article.
          
                               KAREN (INTO PHONE)
                     Hello?
          
          She listens.   Her face slowly drops.
          
                               KAREN
                         (almost a whisper:)
                     What?
          
          She numbly lowers the phone.   Doug turns to her, seeing that
          something's very wrong.
          
          Snapping to life, Karen walks to the desk, picking up the
          photo of Peter and Maria's condo and a map of Tokyo.
          
          Doug puts a hand on her shoulder.    She finally looks at him.
          
                               KAREN
                     Alex and Yoko are dead.
          
          Doug, surprised, doesn't know what to say.   Karen doesn't
          give him a chance to figure it out:

                    There's something wrong with that
                    house, Doug. Something really bad.
                        (re: Peter's photo)
                    The boy in that house, he had a
                    photo of this man. He died on that
                    same day three years ago. I need
                    to talk to his wife... widow. If I
                    can find out what happened, or
                    if... maybe --

                    Maybe, what?
          
          Karen pulls away, making for the door.   Doug follows.

          reaches out and touches Doug tenderly.

                    I love you. But I have to go.
          
          She leaves.
          
          Doug, troubled, turns back to the desk.
          
          He looks up at the wall, tracing a finger over the photo of
          The House. Beneath it, is the address...

                against a cloudy, bleak sky.
          
                Karen stands before it, staring up at it.
          
                Then she walks to the intercom and looks at the directory,
                finds `M. Kirk'. She activates the intercom and dials the
                number. It rings a few times, and then a voice picks up:

                          ask you a few questions.
          
                A long beat.   Karen stares at the intercom.
          
                                      KAREN

                When Maria's voice comes back through the intercom, she
                sounds different, shaken:
          
                                    MARIA (INTERCOM)
                          Leave me alone.

          116a   INT. PETER & MARIA'S APARTMENT - DAY                       116a
          
                 The front door opens. MARIA (early 30s) has changed from
                 when we first saw her -- she wears a revealing outfit, and
                 her natural beauty now smolders beneath the surface.
          
                 She regards Karen warily.
          
                                     MARIA
                           I'm late for work.
          
                                     KAREN
                           I just need a couple minutes.
          
                 Maria finally steps aside, letting Karen in.
          
                 The APARTMENT is small, and completely unkempt.    The kitchen
                 is a mess, clothes lie everywhere.
          
                                     MARIA
                               (sarcastic:)
                           Make yourself at home.
          
                 Karen looks for a place to sit.    She decides to stand.
          
                 Maria sizes her up.   A beat.   Then:
          
                                       MARIA
                           Well?
          
                                     KAREN
                           Your husband, Peter.    Three years
                           ago he...
          
                 She trails off, in delicate territory.
          
                                       MARIA
                           He what?
          
                                     KAREN
                           He killed himself.
          
                 Maria eyes her blankly. Then she turns to look at something
                 o.s. Karen follows her gaze --
          
                 -- to the open door of THE BEDROOM.     And THE WINDOW beyond.

                              KAREN
                        (almost ashamed:)
                    I'm... sorry.
          
          Maria turns back to her, sadness on her face.   Then:
          
                                 MARIA
                    Thank you.
          
          Maria reaches for a pack of cigarettes.   Lights one.   Offers
          them to Karen. She shakes her head.
          
                              MARIA
                    How did you know Peter?
          
                                 KAREN
                    I didn't.
          
                              MARIA
                    Then what are you doing here?
          
                              KAREN
                    I think there's a connection
                    between your husband's death and
                    something that happened to me.
          
                              MARIA
                    What happened to you?
          
                              KAREN
                    It's... hard to explain.
          
          Maria takes a drag from her cigarette.    Waiting.
          
                              KAREN
                    Look, I know this sounds strange,
                    but... I don't think your husband
                    wanted to die.
          
                              MARIA
                        (even:)
                    Then why would he throw himself out
                    a window?
          
          Karen struggles to find the answer.
          
                              MARIA
                    Let me guess: `hard to explain'?
          
          Karen nods.   Maria's brave face slips.   She turns away.

                              MARIA
                    I put all this behind me. I don't
                    want to open it back up again.
          
                              KAREN
                    If that's true, then why are you
                    still here in Japan?
          
          Maria turns back.   She only looks defensive for a moment.
          
                              MARIA
                    Because I can't leave. I tried.
                    But I couldn't. Not without...
          
          Maria speaks softly, forming words she's never spoken aloud:
          
                              MARIA
                    He usually didn't wake up before
                    me. But that morning, he did. He
                    made coffee for us. Then he sat
                    there and waited for me to wake up.
                    And when I did, he looked me right
                    in the eye. And then he jumped.
                    The night before we'd been talking
                    about having children together...
          
          She wipes away the tears in her eyes.
          
                              KAREN
                    Did you know a woman named Kayako?
          
                                 MARIA
                    No.
          
                                 KAREN
                    Did Peter?
          
                              MARIA
                    I don't think so.
          
          Maria turns away, growing tense.
          
                              KAREN
                    Maybe it was someone he worked
                    with?
          
                              MARIA
                    Look. I've had the police up here,
                    I talked with Detectives, I even
                    hired a P.I.--

                              MARIA (cont'd)
                    I don't know what you're going
                    through, or what you think you know
                    about my husband. But I don't have
                    any answers. I'm sorry.
          
          She turns back to Karen -- to find the young woman sitting
          slumped on the edge of a sofa, tears in her eyes.
          
          Maria softens as Karen looks up at her, pleading:
          
                             KAREN
                    Please. I don't know what else to
                    do. Please help me.

                 Maria reaches up to a high shelf. She moves a few things
                 aside to get to TWO SHOEBOXES buried towards the rear.
          
          
          118    OMITTED                                                     118

                 Maria re-enters the room, laying the shoeboxes on a table.
          
                                     MARIA
                           This is all his stuff from school.
          
                 She stares at the boxes, afraid to open them. Karen sits
                 down and gently removes the lid of one of them.
          
                 THE BOX contains stacks of PHOTOGRAPHS and notes. Karen
                 removes a pile of photos and starts looking through it.
          
                 After a moment, Maria sits down next to her. She opens the
                 other box and pulls out another stack of photos.
          
                 She looks at the first one, sadness crossing her face.
          
                                     MARIA
                           This was our first date.
          
                 She shows Karen THE TOP PHOTO: a "self-portrait" of Peter
                 and Maria in a park lined with blooming cherry trees.
          
                 The pain returns, and she puts the picture away.
          
                 Karen works through her own pile: she's looking at pictures
                 of Peter from his University days.
          
                 Her eyes widen as she sees --
          
                 Kayako. She looks young and alive... but yet somehow sullen
                 and withdrawn, as if she feels she doesn't belong there.
          
                 She's with a group of fellow students. PETER is in the
                 group, although he and Kayako aren't next to one another.
          
                 Karen turns to the next picture -- it's a graduation party.
          
                 Kayako is in this one too: standing to the side, watching
                 PETER AND MARIA as they give a goofy grin to the camera.

          As Karen flips through them, a definite pattern emerges --
          
          -- Kayako is in practically every picture.
          
          And in most, she's not smiling at the camera.    Rather, she's
          staring at Peter.
          
                               KAREN
                        (under her breath:)
                    Oh my God.
          
                               MARIA
                    What?   Did you find something?
          
          We move to THE GROUP PHOTO. Peter with Maria, surrounded by
          classmates. Kayako off to the side, her eyes on Peter.

                The same GROUP PHOTO is in a frame on Peter's desk.
          
                Peter stands behind the desk, using a small mirror to knot
                his tie. His open door reads: `DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH'.
          
                A CO-WORKER (20s, Japanese) enters with a stack of mail.
          
                                    PETER
                          Happy Monday.
          
                                    CO-WORKER
                          Yeah, right. Here's your mail.
          
                He hands it to Peter. On the top is a small BLUE ENVELOPE.
                The name in the return address is `Kayako'.

                                     CO-WORKER
                           Another one, huh?
          
                 Peter shakes his head, looking distastefully at the letter.
          
                                     PETER
                           I don't even know her. She says I
                           used to tutor her, but I don't know
                           who the hell she is.
          
                 The co-worker shrugs and leaves.    Disturbed, Peter fingers
                 the blue envelope.
          
                 His eyes go to one of his desk drawers.    He slides it open.
          
                 More BLUE ENVELOPES are inside.    All from `KAYAKO'.
          
                 Peter's face darkens.   He dumps the letters into a trash can.

                 EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY
                 Peter stands in front of The House.
          
                 He glances down at the BLUE ENVELOPE in his hand. He stuffs
                 it in his pocket, unsure about what he's going to do.
          
                 Then he opens the gate and goes in, walking to the front
                 door. Knocks. Silence from inside. He rings the bell.
                 Waits. No one comes. He's about to leave --
          
                 But then he hears something from around the side of the
                 house. It sounded like a muffled SPLASH of water.

                 Peter peers around the side of the house, a narrow walkway
                 lined with bushes and trees. It's quiet.
          
                                      PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                           Hello?   Excuse me?
          
                 After a moment, Peter decides to check it out. As he steps
                 around a bush, he suddenly stops, surprised to see --
          
                 PETER'S POV: two ARMS hang from a window at the side of the
                 house. They look disembodied, mottled and bruised.

          It takes Peter a moment to recover.   He slowly walks over.

                A familiar BOY is inside -- it's TOSHIO. His glazed and
                staring eyes don't seem to notice Peter, standing right in
                front of him.
          
                                     PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                          Hello.
          
                No reaction. There's definitely something wrong with this
                boy. Peter looks beyond him, into the dark house.
          
                                    PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                          My name is Peter. I'm here to see
                          your mother. Is she home?
          
                The boy slowly straightens. His eyes focus on Peter. Then
                he FALLS BACKWARDS. Startled, Peter tries to see inside:
          
                                     PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                          Hey!   Are you okay??? Hello???
          
                Peter quickly goes back to the front door.   Tries the handle -
                - it's unlocked. He opens the door.

                INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY
                Peter steps inside, unsure about entering uninvited.
          
                                    PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                              (calling out)
                          Hello? Excuse me. I'm coming in.
          
                His concern for the boy wins out. He kicks off his shoes,
                and quickly walks to the open bathroom door.

                Peter enters, finding Toshio lying on the floor. He must
                have been standing on the edge of a TUB by the window.

                          Are you alright?
          
                As Peter helps the boy to his feet, he glances at the
                bathtub. It's filled, literally to the brim, with water.
          
          
          124   INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                             124
          
                Peter holds Toshio's hand as he leads him back to a couch in
                the living room.
          
                                    PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                          Are you alone? Where are your
                          parents?
          
                The boy sits in the couch, slumped over, still looking dazed.
          
                Peter studies him, looking at the ugly BRUISES on his arms
                and legs. There's also a big one around his neck.
          
                                    PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                          What happened to you?
          
                Peter reaches out to lift Toshio's chin, but he FLINCHES,
                pulling backwards. His eyes manage to focus on Peter.
          
                Then the boy looks away.    Lowers his head.   A long beat.
          
                Peter's worried. This really doesn't look good.     He scans
                the messy room, eyes falling on something.
          
                He reaches down and picks up PIECES OF A PHOTOGRAPH, lying
                next to a broken frame -- they've been crumpled into a ball.
          
                ON THE PHOTO: Peter unfolds the pieces and rearranges them.
                We've seen this picture before --
          
                -- a FAMILY PORTRAIT. TOSHIO, holding a cute BLACK CAT.
                Standing with his mother and father -- KAYAKO and TAKEO.
                They're all beaming at the camera, a perfect, happy family.
          
                Except that the mother's face has been torn out.
          
                Then there's a muffled MEOW.    Peter looks over at the window.
                Did that come from outside?
          
                Another MEOW.   Peter walks to the window, looking out.
          
                FROM OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN: a worried look crosses Peter's
                face as the MEOW becomes more of a GROWL, as if in warning.
                He looks outside, but can't see anything --

                -- but we see, over Peter's shoulder, that TOSHIO is now
                LOOKING DIRECTLY AT HIM, eyes wide --
          
                -- the MEOWING emitting from his wide open mouth --

                Karen enters quickly, going up to the front desk.
          
                OFFICER #2, filling out paperwork, doesn't look up.
          
                                    KAREN (IN JAPANESE)
                          Excuse me, I need to speak with
                          Detective Nakagawa.
          
                Officer #2 looks up at her.   Blankly.
          
                                    KAREN (IN JAPANESE)
                          It's an emergency.
          
                                    OFFICER #2 (IN JAPANESE)
                          One moment.
          
                Officer #2 walks to the end of the desk, where two more
                OFFICERS speak in hushed tones with DETECTIVE AOKI.
          
                Officer #2 interrupts their conversation. And they all look
                over at Karen. A beat. Then Detective Aoki approaches.
          
                                    AOKI (IN ENGLISH)
                          You are asking for Detective
                          Nakagawa?

                          Yes, I have important information
                          for him about a case...
          
                She looks around. Everyone is watching her. The mood is
                decidedly grim. She can tell something's up.
          
                                    AOKI
                          Detective Nakagawa is not here
                          right now. Can you tell me what
                          case this is regarding?
          
                There's something behind the Detective's words.

                          Can I speak with him?

                Aoki exchanges a look with the officers.
          
                                    AOKI
                          Can you tell me your name, please?
          
                Karen looks at the somber faces in the quiet station.     She
                backs away from the desk as the realization sinks in.
          
                                    KAREN
                          They're dead, aren't they?
          
                Karen turns and runs for the exit.
          
                                    AOKI
                          Miss, wait please --
          
                But she's long gone.

                A reading light on the computer desk provides the only
                illumination in the dark apartment.
          
                Karen enters, standing in the doorway for a moment.     Shell-
                shocked. As she slides off her coat:
          
                                       KAREN
                          Doug?

          No answer. She slowly walks to the bedroom and looks inside.
          He's not there. This seems to worsen Karen's mood.
          
                                     Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       84.
          
          
          
          Karen looks down at a NOTEPAD. She's written THREE JAPANESE
          NAMES. The detectives in charge of the case three years ago.
          
          They all have red lines drawn through them.
          
          Then we PAN UP to see that these are the last names on a
          longer list. We recognize the other names: MATTHEW,
          JENNIFER, and EMMA WILLIAMS; YOKO and ALEX; NAKAGAWA and
          IGARASHI. Everyone who's been in The House.
          
          Everyone who died.   All the names have been CROSSED OUT --
          
          -- except `Nakagawa' and `Igarashi'.    Karen picks up a red
          pen and draws a line through them.
          
          Then we see one final name at the bottom:
          
          `Me.'   Now the only one not crossed out.   The only one left.
          
          Karen puts down her pen.    Then she looks up at --
          
          -- THE WALL, where's she's taped all the pictures and
          articles in a circle.
          
          Karen realizes something.    She reaches for the lamp, and
          turns it closer --
          
          -- the picture in the middle of the "spider's web" is gone.
          
          The photo of The House.
          
          Karen draws a breath. Then, out of the corner of her eye,
          she sees something she hadn't noticed before --
          
          -- a faint red FLASHING from a small table by the kitchen.
          
          She slowly stands. Walks over to it. The flashing red light
          is barely visible on her face, as she looks down at --
          
          -- HER ANSWERING MACHINE.    The message light is blinking.
          
          `1 MESSAGE'.
          
          She reaches out a shaky finger and presses `PLAY'.

                     "Hey, Karen. It's me. I just

                  Karen presses the STOP button.
          
                  She stands there for a moment, in the near-darkness.

                            Hello?
          
                  As he takes a step forward his foot bumps THE GAS CANS, still
                  sitting by the front door.
          
                  He's confused -- and then he gets a good idea.   He tosses his
                  cigarette outside and closes the front door.

                 Doug walks through the living room, glancing inside the small
                 KITCHEN, then he slides open the door to the TATAMI ROOM.
          
                 He winces as his eyes meet the STAINED MATTRESS.

                 Doug re-enters the entryway, looking back up to the second
                 floor. He starts up.

                 Doug walks to the FRONT ROOM door and opens it. He leans
                 inside, trying to let his eyes adjust to the dark.
          
                 Then he walks down the hall to the REAR ROOM.   Does the same.
                 Nothing but darkness beyond.
          
                 Doug closes the door and turns away from it, wondering why
                 he's here, what he's looking for.
          
                 He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his cell phone.
                 Speed-dials Karen's number. As he raises it to his ear --
          
                 -- he doesn't notice the door to the rear room SLOWLY
                 SWINGING OPEN BEHIND HIM --

                 Karen runs towards us, breathless, stopping as she reaches --
          
                 -- THE HOUSE.   Looming over her.    Waiting.
          
                 She only hesitates a moment before running inside.

                 Karen enters, calling out:
          
                                      KAREN
                           Doug!   Where are you???
          
                 A MUFFLED SOUND from upstairs.    A voice.
          
                                      KAREN
                           Doug???
          
                 Karen immediately runs up the stairs to --
          
                 THE SECOND FLOOR. Before she reaches the top of the stairs,
                 Karen suddenly realizes:
          
                 THE VOICE she's hearing isn't Doug's.
          
                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                           Hey, Maria, it's me. Yeah, I'm
                           still at school...
          
                 Karen slowly looks up to see --
          
                                         Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        87.
          
          
          
                -- PETER. She recognizes him immediately.    He's standing in
                the hallway, talking on his cell phone.
          
                                    PETER (INTO PHONE)
                          ...I know, I'm sorry -- these staff
                          meetings always run over -- maybe
                          another ten minutes or so -- okay,
                          I'll be home soon -- I love you
                          too.
          
                He hangs up.   Leans against the wall.   Looking into --
          
                THE FRONT BEDROOM. Karen gasps as she sees TOSHIO through
                the open door. He's sitting on the ground, making drawings
                of BLACK CATS. This is his bedroom.
          
                                    PETER
                              (under his breath)
                          Guess your mom's late, huh?
          
                Then Toshio suddenly looks up.   Right at Karen.
          
                Following Toshio's gaze, Peter quickly turns to face Karen.
                But even though she's right there, he doesn't see her:
          
                She's seeing something that happened three years ago.
          
                As if sensing her presence, Peter walks right to the edge of
                the stairs, looking down. Then:
          
                A RUSTLING SOUND comes from the dark hallway. Peter turns
                towards the REAR BEDROOM at the end of the hall.
          
          129                                                                129
                INT. THE HOUSE - REAR BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
                Peter stands in the doorway, looking into the MASTER BEDROOM
                of Toshio's parents. His attention is drawn to something
                near the door --
          
                -- a DESK. It's got a computer, some files.     Someone's
                personal work space.
          
                Peter steps to the desk. He picks up A STACK OF PHOTOGRAPHS.
                Family pictures: with father (TAKEO), mother (KAYAKO), and
                son (TOSHIO), holding his black CAT.
          
                KAYAKO'S FACE has been torn out of every one.
          
                Peter notices something underneath the pile of photos -- a
                familiar JOURNAL. The same one Karen found in the closet.
                He opens it.
          
                                   Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        88.
          
          
          
          HIS POV: it's a journal Kayako kept. As Peter flips through
          it, KAYAKO'S VOICE speaks the words...
          
          ...and even though it's mostly Japanese, there's one word we
          recognize, that she's written repeatedly --
          
          -- "Peter". It's been written over and over, in both English
          and Japanese, as if she couldn't get enough of seeing it.
          
          Past the early pages Karen saw, THE WRITING becomes more
          manic, the delicate script becoming a frantic scrawl,
          KAYAKO'S VOICE becomes more desperate and pleading.
          
          Taped on the final page is A PHOTO: PETER with a group of
          his University friends, at a party. Kayako has scribbled
          hearts around his head, and SCRATCHED OUT the other faces.
          
          A bloody THUMBPRINT distorts Peter's face.   It's still wet.
          
          Peter slams the book shut and drops it. As he does, a
          PHOTOGRAPH falls out from inside, landing right-side up.
          
          THE PHOTO is of PETER at a college party, talking with MARIA.
          It's clear they're having a great time with one another...
          
          ...but the photo is TORN IN HALF, splitting Maria's face.
          And KAYAKO is visible between them, sadly and stoically
          watching Peter, strands of hair falling down her face.
          
          Peter and Karen both reach to pick up the photo at the same
          time -- and they BUMP SHOULDERS. Karen falls backwards,
          against the wall.
          
          In disbelief, Peter looks around wildly. He reaches out a
          tentative hand, feeling around... Karen moves out of the way.
          She can't understand how this could be happening.
          
          As Peter is about to stand back up, SOMETHING small flutters
          down from above, landing on the floor in front of him.
          
          It's KAYAKO'S FACE.   One of the missing pieces from the torn-
          out photographs.
          
          Peter slowly looks up to see --
          
          -- ALL THE MISSING KAYAKO FACES have been pinned to the
          closet door. Many of the pins go through HER EYES.
          
          And that's when Peter and Karen hear THE FLIES.   Buzzing
          anxiously. Sounds like there's a lot of them.
          
          It's coming from THE CLOSET.   Just behind the torn-out faces.

          Karen watches, terrified, as Peter reaches out a hand --
          
          -- and slides the door open.
          
          He immediately recoils.    A terrible stench inside.
          
          The BUZZING of the flies is louder.    Coming from above.
          
          Peter pulls a book of matches from his pocket.    Lights one.
          
          And looks up.
          
          HIS POV:   the attic panel is slightly open.
          
          Peter reaches up to open it fully --
          
          -- AND THE UPPER HALF OF KAYAKO swings down.
          
          She's been wrapped in plastic sheeting, mottled splotches of
          blood on the inside. Her neck hangs at an odd angle.

                Peter backs away in horror --
          
          
          130   INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT               130
          
                Peter backs into the hallway, breathing hard.
          
                Then a familiar sound reaches our ears:   THUD.   THUD.   THUD.
          
                It's coming from Toshio's room. And it's the same rhythmic
                THUDDING we've heard coming from this room before.
          
                Peter wrenches his gaze from the horrific sight and heads
                quickly down the hall (with Karen following him):
          
                                     PETER
                          Toshio!   We have to --
          
                He stops short at the door, as he sees --
          
                -- TAKEO, Toshio's father. Eyes rolled back in his head,
                tongue swollen and lolling from his blue lips.
          
                He's dead -- he's hanging from the ceiling by BLACK HAIR that
                seems to cover its entire surface. Kayako's hair.
          
                TOSHIO, now back to his "dead" appearance, playfully swings
                the body. Takeo's feet THUD rhythmically against the wall.
          
                                    KAREN
                          Oh my God...
          
                Peter doesn't stay to see any more.   He runs.
          
          131                                                               131
                INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
          
                Peter tears down the stairs and runs for the front door,
                passing a mirror --
          
                -- he freezes. He saw SOMETHING in the reflection as he
                passed. Something wrong.
                He takes a step back and looks --
          
                -- it's not his reflection in the mirror.   It's KAYAKO.
          
                Peter stares at the image in disbelief. Then he notices
                TOSHIO standing next to Kayako, looking up at her.

          As Peter slowly turns to look down, a small PALE HAND slips
          into his own. Peter jerks backward in shock as --

          -- KAYAKO running down the steps, TAKEO chasing her, tackling
          her before she can reach the door... sitting on top of her,
          he wraps his hands around her neck...

          -- TAKEO in THE ATTIC, stuffing KAYAKO and TOSHIO, both very
          dead, wrapped in plastic sheeting, into a corner...

          ARM... her lifeless eyes focusing on Takeo's as she CROAKS...
          Takeo's eyes go wide with fear... and TOSHIO suddenly reaches
          from his plastic grave, grabbing Takeo's other arm...
          
          BACK TO THE PRESENT:
          
          We PAN FROM Peter to THE REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR --
          
          It's not the pale, frightening Kayako anymore. Rather:     a
          beautiful, young Kayako with eyes filled with sorrow.
          
          We PAN BACK to see KAREN standing there, instead of Peter.
          
          Karen slumps to the ground in front of the mirror, the
          revelation taking everything out of her.
          
          A beat.   Then:
                    That came from upstairs.
          THUMP.
          Karen looks up as the sound continues. We PAN OVER towards
          the stairs as A DRAGGING sound moves across the ceiling.
          Accompanied by a strange SCRAPING, like plastic.
          
                                KAREN
                      No more... please, no more...
          
          She suddenly freezes, sensing something next to her. We see
          it now, as she turns her head, almost hidden in the darkness--

          -- a PALE FACE in the darkened hallway, staring up at the
          ceiling. Eyes wide and rolled back, mouth yawning open in
          abject terror --
          
          -- it's DOUG'S BODY. He lies on his back, his top half
          sticking out from a niche by the stairwell. It's been right
          next to her all along.
          
                               KAREN

          Karen takes Doug into her arms as the SOUNDS continue above,
          growing closer. But it's no use -- he's dead.
          
          And now there's a new sound, moving down the stairs. A
          familiar THROATY CROAKING SOUND, along with a strange
          SKITTERING, like the world's biggest cockroach.
          
          Karen turns to the staircase to see --
          
          -- KAYAKO, crawling down the stairs. Still wrapped in the
          plastic sheeting, she moves like a wounded animal, neck
          hanging limply, struggling to pull herself forward --
          
          -- her eyes locked on Karen, CROAKING horribly --
          
          Karen sorrow turns to abject terror. She tries to lift
          Doug's body and pull it to the front door. It's too heavy.
          
          And KAYAKO is getting closer.
          
          Sobbing, Karen drops Doug and falls back against the front
          door, bumping into --
          
          THE GAS CANS. The one Nakagawa unscrewed TIPS OVER, spilling
          gasoline into the entryway.
          
          As Doug's arm flops to the floor, his outstretched HAND lands
          next to Karen. She sees something clenched in his fingers --
          
          -- his ZIPPO LIGHTER.
          
          Realization dawns over Karen as she feels the liquid spilling
          onto her hands. The odor is unmistakable.
          
          Karen immediately reaches forward, trying to loosen Doug's
          grip on the lighter as --
          
          -- Kayako reaches the bottom of the stairs. Her broken neck
          makes a horrific CRACKING as she swivels to face Karen.
          
          Karen finally gets the lighter. She pushes back against the
          door with legs too numb to stand. Her eyes drift up to see --
          
                                 Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     91A.
          
          
          
          -- TOSHIO, watching from the railing above, as before, his
          cold eyes locked on hers.
          
          Karen grabs another can, and spins the lid until it pops off.
          She tips it onto the floor, spilling more gas.
          
                                             Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     92.
          
          
          
                 Kayako doesn't seem to care. She crawls over Doug's body and
                 pulls herself through the gasoline, slowly, drawing
                 inexorably closer --
          
                 Karen drops the empty gas can and opens DOUG'S LIGHTER.
          
                 She flicks it.   Nothing.
          
                 Karen tries the lighter again.     And again.   Nothing.
          
                 Kayako reaches out, blood dripping from her gaping mouth --
          
                 The lighter CATCHES.
          
                 Karen flails with her free arm and opens the front door --
          
                 -- just as Kayako GRABS HER ANKLE.
          
                 Karen reaches outside, anchoring a hand to the door frame --
          
                 -- but she can't pull herself free, as --
          
                 -- Kayako pulls herself closer, her CROAKING intensifying --
          
                 -- resigned, Karen slowly lowers the flame to the gas can --
          
                 -- and ignites the gas!     There's a sudden BRIGHT FLASH that
                 overtakes the screen --
          
                                                                 FADE TO WHITE:

                 EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT
                 The flashing lights of POLICE CARS wash over the formerly
                 quiet neighborhood, illuminating --
          
                                          Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04    93.
          
          
          
                 KAREN. She's lying on a gurney, regaining consciousness.
                 Japanese EMTS are speaking to her as she's being loaded into
                 the back of an ambulance.
          
                 KAREN'S POV: the blurry forms of FIREMEN rush by in slow
                 motion. Everything is dizzy and incoherent...
          
                 Karen tries to sit up -- but a YOUNG EMT lays a gentle hand
                 on her arm, deftly sliding a needle under her skin. The
                 sedative takes hold almost immediately.
          
                 Karen sinks back into the gurney, her eyes rolling back in
                 her head. She's fading fast.
          
          
          132b   INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT                                  132b
          
                 The EMTs secure the gurney inside and close the doors. Karen
                 fights the drug, but its grip is inevitable: she finally
                 gives up, sliding into a medicated sleep.
          
                 We slowly MOVE IN on her face, until it fills the screen.
          
                 Then...
          
          132c                                                           132c
                 INT. AMBULANCE - DAY
                 ...the light CHANGES. Darkness becomes morning sunlight
                 spilling across Karen's face. The tranquil sound of birds
                 CHIRPING surrounds us. But it sounds like a distant echo.
          
                 Karen's eyelids flutter. She opens her eyes and sits up, now
                 wide awake -- but peaceful and calm.
          
                 She gently swings her legs from the gurney and walks to the
                 window, confused by the daylight. She looks out to see --
          
          132d                                                           132d
                 EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY
                 It's the most beautiful we've ever seen it.   A lush
                 springtime bloom fills the trees and bushes around the place.
          
                 VOICES off-screen (Japanese) are audible, getting closer --
          
                                 Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       93A.
          
          
          
          ON KAREN, as she is surprised to see...
          
          KAYAKO. Beautiful and meek. She's smiling, walking hand-in-
          hand with TAKEO. A happy couple.
          
          As they reach the front door and go inside, Kayako turns back
          to the front gate. She smiles and gestures, "come on".
          
          And then TOSHIO walks forward, through the gate.   His
          attention is on a tiny BLACK KITTEN in his arms.
          
          At the door, Toshio turns to look back over his shoulder --
          
          -- DIRECTLY AT KAREN. They hold each other's gaze for a
          moment, as if he somehow sees her in the ambulance.
          
          Then Kayako gestures to Toshio, and he turns away, entering
          The House and closing the door.
          
                                                      CUT TO BLACK.

Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers - by Daniel Farrands





 HALLOWEEN 6
THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS 

 
DARKNESS fills the SCREEN.  SUPERIMPOSE:

October 30, 1995

DEAD SILENCE for what seems like an eternity, followed by a 
startling, bone-chilling SCREAM as we

FADE IN:

INT. DUNGEON - TUNNELS - NIGHT (DISTORTED)

The agonizing SCREAMS continue as we MOVE rapidly through a 
labyrinth of winding underground tunnels.  Glowing torches light 
the way.  Blurry, indistinct silhouettes of grim FIGURES wearing 
black-cowled robes flash along the dank, craggy walls.

As we BLAST around dark corners, we realize we are looking from 
the P.O.V. of a SCREAMING young woman being pushed forward on a 
gurney.  Plunging deeper into this hellish maze.

A door is SLAMMED.  Wooden.  Heavy.  Muffling the SCREAMS.

Spurs CLANK on a pair of silver-tipped cowboy boots as a 
MYSTERIOUS STRANGER steps into VIEW.  Long black duster.  
Widebrimmed fedora.  Lit cigarette dangling between gloved 
fingers.

INT. BIRTHING CHAMBER - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

A rat scampers from a hole, foraging in the muck of a rotted 
rack.  A white sheet, saturated with blood, covers the parted legs 
of JAMIE LLOYD, now 16, cheeks flushed with perspiration.
		
		JAMIE
	Oh, God, it's coming!  It's coming!

MARY, a young midwife, rushes in with a bowl of hot water.  Jamie 
lurches, knocking the bowl out of the girl's hands; it SHATTERS on 
the floor.
		
		JAMIE
	   (continuing)
	Mary, mother of God, please make it stop!

Mary's face is frozen in horror.  Jamie's SCREAMS build to an 
unnerving crescendo.  The paiin too much for her to bear.
			
			     FLASH CUT TO:

Lurid SHOCK CUTS from the previous "Halloween" entries -- a 
surrealistic blend of IMAGES and VOICES -- as Jamie relives her 
terrifying childhood ordeal:
		
		LOOMIS (V.O.)
	... Ten years ago he tried to kill Laurie 
	Strode ...

A)   LAURIE STRODE (Jamie Lee Curtis) twists and squirms as she is 
     strangled mercilessly in the hands of the murderous SHAPE.
		
		LOOMIS (V.O.)
	... Now he wants her daughter.

B)   Trapped in her bedroom, 10-YEAR-OLD JAMIE (Danielle Harris) 
     struggles to open the door.  She flings it open.  The Shape is 
     standing there, knife poised to kill!
		
		LOOMIS (V.O.)
	Michael Myers is here to kill that little girl 
	and anyone else who gets in his way!

C)   RACHEL (Ellie Cornell) dies in anguish as the Shape plunges a 
     pair of scissors through her chest.  TINA (Wendy Kaplan) dives 
     right into the path of the Shape's knife.  "Jamie, run!!!"

D)   Jamie sinks to her knees behind the fallen Shape, taking its 
     hand in her own.  CLOSE ON the Shape's hand.  Fingers flexing to 
     life.  A grotesque BRAND on its wrist -- an inverted isocsceles 
     triangle that will come to be known as the mark of THORN.

E)   BLINDING EXPLOSION rips through cinderblock.  A jail cell blown 
     to oblivion.  FIRESTORM rages.  The MYSTERIOUS STRANGER appears, 
     opening fire with a SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE.

Pitiful wails of death.  OFFICERS writhing in pools of blood.  In 
the aftermath of this carnage stands YOUNG JAMIE.
			
			     FLASH CUT TO:

INT. CHAMBER - NIGHT (SAME)

Jamie struggles against her bonds.  Pushing.  SCREAMING.  Lapsing 
in and out of consciousness during the excruciating pangs of 
labor.  Haunted by low, moaning VOICES.  CHANTING.
			
			     FLASH CUT TO:

EXT. POLICE STATION - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT (NEW FOOTAGE)

RESUME Jamie, filled with repidation as she staggers through the 
smoke-filled cell into a darkened, drizzly alleyway.

JAMIE'S P.O.V.

Beyond the clearing wisps of smoke, THREE FIGURES wearing black 
ski masks usher THE SHAPE -- arms and legs shackled in heavy 
chains -- into the back of a white van.

BACK TO SCENE

Mutely terrified, Jamie backs away -- into the arms of another 
figure, obscured by smokescreen:  the Mysterious Stranger!

Jamie's scream is cut off as the Stranger descends upon her like 
the Angel of Death.

A cigarette arcs throug the darkness like a tiny flare.  Crushed 
under the boot of the Stranger.

A moment later, Jamie is shoved into the front seat of the van.  
Doors SLAM.  Tires SCREECH over wet pavement.

THE ENTIRE PRECINCT EXPLODES IN A HUGE CONFLAGRATION!
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

INT. CHAMBER - NIGHT

A SLAP and the first cry of the newborn BABY.  Jamie sobs 
uncontrollably, the straps preventing her from reaching him.
		
		JAMIE
	Please ... give him to me ...

The infant is wrapped in black swaddling.  The wooden door CREAKS 
open.  Jamie's eyes fill with horror as the shadow of the Stranger 
fills the room.  Standing at the threshold.  Waiting to receive 
the child.
		
		JAMIE
	   (continuing)
	No, please ... my baby!

The dark sentinels march out in somber procession, ignoring her 
desperate pleas.  Torches lighting the way.
		
		JAMIE
	   (continuing)
	Damn you!!  Damn you all to hell!!!

Jamie's heartrending SHRIEKS are cut off by the cold sound of the 
SLAMMING DOOR.
			
			     FADE TO BLACK.

MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

A diaphanous column rises, a ghostly, slow-motion cylinder of 
flame that BURNS through the SCREEN to form the MAIN TITLE:
			
			HALLOWEEN 6

The OPENING CREDITS are BRANDED against the BLACK SCREEN by an 
invisible, kenetic force, interspersed with a SERIES OF CUTS:

Jamie's baby is lain upon a primitive altar.  Ringed by eleven 
stones engraved with cryptic markings.

Hooded, faceless figures.  Torches held aloft.  Disembodied 
VOICES.  Whispering.  Invoking a dark spell.

MARY, the young midwife, peers around a corner.  Eyes glazed with 
horror.  Watching.  Spying.

The newborn SCREAMS.  The flattened blade of a dagger smears a 
triangular symbol in blood over the baby's torso.

We MOVE IN on this symbol, capturing it in FREEZE FRAME.  It burns 
off into fiery cinders, disintegrating into DARKNESS.

Silence.  Then a startling CLAP OF THUNDER as we
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

A SIGN POST

standing askew in a matted patch of lawn.  WIND and RAIN.  INTENSE 
FLASH of LIGHTNING illuminates:

"For Sale By Strode Realty - SOLD"

EXT/INT. MYERS HOUSE - SUBJECTIVE P.O.V.

MOVE along a trail of drowning toys -- baseball, Power Rangers, a 
deck of Pogs -- TOWARD a weather-beaten porch.  Leftover gallons 
of Sears Best.  Brushes soaking in turpentine.  A dozen or so 2 x 
2s l;ined up to replace a row of broken railing slats.

P.O.V. LOOKS UP to the tall, brooding edifice.  Address reads:  45 
Lampkin Lane.  Fresh coat of white paint over old clapboard.  New 
shutters on the narrow windows.  A jack-o'-lantern grins behind 
filmy curtains.  The Myers house.

Despite its recent face-lift, it looks just as foreboding as it 
did in "Halloween I."

P.O.V. stalks down the side of the house, around to the back 
door.  Opens it and quietly MOVES inside.

P.O.V. MOVES across the darkened kitchen.  A drawer is opened.  
LIGHTNING reveals a large butcher knife being withdrawn.

P.O.V. glides past the living room -- a few boxes, furniture to be 
arranged -- and MOVES swiftly UP a long flight of stairs.

Down the long, dark hallway ... through a door.  A bedroom.  
P.O.V. FINDS 6-year-old DANNY STRODE ... tossing and turning in 
the throes of a nightmare.

An ear-splitting THUNDER CRASH causes the boy to bolt upright in 
bed, looking right into the P.O.V.  Sweating.  Shaking.  
Petrified.

DANNY'S P.O.V.

The THUNDER seems to ROAR from the ferocious jaws of T-REX -- a 
24" scale model posing on a shelf among an army of Jurassic 
monsters.  Seemingly brought to life by the ELECTRICAL STORM.

FOLLOW DANNY

as he leaps out of bed and pads across polished wooden floors into 
the hallway.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  With the next THUNDER CRASH 
comes a startling, barely intelligible VOICE.
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)
	Danny ...

Danny freezes.  Slowly turns.

DANNY'S POV

An ominous shadow at the end of the hall, illuminated by 
LIGHTNING.  Long duster and brimmed hat.  The Stranger!  In his 
outstretched hand, the gleaming butcher knife!
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)
	Kill for him!

BACK TO SCENE

Danny screams!  THUNDER CRASHES HELLISHLY.  Lights flash on.  
Doors fly open.  Suddenly Danny is swept up in the protective arms 
of his mother, KARA, 22.
		
		KARA
	Danny!

The little boy holds onto her for dear life.  Crying 
hysterically.  Eyes clenched tightly.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing)
	Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
		
		DANNY
	The voice man!  He's here!

Kara looks in the direction he's pointing.  In the light there's 
just an antique coat rack -- "dressed" in a hat, rain jacket and 
old silver-tipped umbrella.
		
		KARA
	Danny, no one's there.

Danny dares to look -- but now only cries harder.

Kara carries Danny back to his room, averting the steely-eyed gaze 
of her father, JOHN STRODE, staunch, late 40s, wearing boxer 
shorts and a well-worn undershirt.
		
		JOHN
	Some of us have to get some sleep around 
	here.  What's with that kid?

Kara ignores him as her mother, DEBRA, careworn face with 
compassionate eyes, tries to lend a hand.
		
		DEBRA
	Let me take him for you, Kara.
		
		KARA
	It's all right, Mom.  Go back to bed.

Debra sighs resignedly.  TIM, 18, stocky and streetwise, wearing 
torn red sweat pants and "Ice-T" t-shirt, casually replaces his 
Walkman headphones and returns to his room.

INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (A FEW MINUTES LATER)

Kara opens the closet and switches on the light.  Satisfying Danny 
that it's empty, she breaks into her perfunctory routine.
		
		KARA
	Stay away monters, stay away ghouls. Stay away 
	from Danny.  You jerks know the rules. 
	   (crossing to Danny's bed)
	Better?

Danny giggles as his pretty young mother tucks him in.
		
		DANNY
	Mommy, when can we go home?

Kara sighs.  They've been through this one before.
		
		KARA
	Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new 
	house.  At least while I'm in college.  
	Remember our deal.
		
		DANNY
	The kids at school said this is a haunted 
	house -- that a bad man used to live here.
		
		KARA
	They did, did they?  Since when did we start 
	listening to the kids at school?
		
		DANNY
	But I've seen him!
		
		KARA
	You've been watching too much TV.
		
		DANNY
	He says things.  Bad things.
		
		KARA
	Like what?

Danny is afraid to tell her.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing)
	If you mean the things Grandpa says sometimes, 
	ignore him.  Once he gets to know you he'll 
	come around ... Let the bad things you hear 
	slide right off your back.

Kara tousles his blond hair and kisses his forehead.  Then she 
goes to the closet, just about to turn out the light --
		
		DANNY
	   (sitting up; panicked)
	No, Mom -- keep it on!
		
		KARA
	Okay ... But just for tonight.

Kara adjusts the closet door, causing one of Danny's school 
drawings to fly off the wall.  She picks it up on her way out.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing)
	Good-night, Danny.

Kara softly closes the door.  Danny lies awake, blankets drawn up 
to his chin, eyes wide.  Still very much afraid.

INT. KARA'S ROOM (CONTINUOUS)

Kara yawns, removes her glasses and rubs her eyes, setting Danny's 
drawing on a pile of open books.  Cliffs Notes and Diet Coke 
cans.  Telltale signs of a late-night cram session.

Adjusting the dial on her FM/alarm clock, Kara begins to move 
about the little room, slipping out of her clothes as the 
subtly-seductive voice of a WOMAN comes over the radio:
		
		WOMAN (V.O.)
	I know this sounds crazy, Harry, but I love 
	him.  I write to him every week. I think I 
	even want to have his child --

The woman is cut off by the nasally, steel-trap voice of HARRY 
SIMMS, talk radio's most popular man of controversy:
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Let me get this straight, Debi.  Now you're 
	saying that not only does this guy get you 
	sexually aroused, but now you want to bear his 
	offspring?!

Wearing only her bra and panties, Kara moves to a full-length 
mirror and lets down her long, flaxen hair.  Beneath her studious 
exterior, she is quite attractive:  delicate features with an 
enviable, naturally-toned figure.
		
		WOMAN (V.O.)
	Deep down, he's just like you and me. He just 
	needs someone to understand him.  Someone to 
	love him.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	You're talking about one of this nation's most 
	notorious serial killers like he belongs in 
	some kind of Est seminar!  What planet have 
	you been on, lady?  Michael Myers has been 
	dead for six years!

A CLICK as the woman is abruptly DISCONNECTED.

Kara suddenly whirls around, startled by a FLASH of something -- a 
face -- in the mirror!

Drawn to the window behind her, she rubs off rainy mist and peers 
outside.

KARA'S P.O.V.

of the large Victorian frame house directly across the street.  
Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals the shadow of a man standing in 
the uppermost window -- looking right at her!

ANGLE ON KARA

Frightened, her eyes lock on Danny's drawing.  A child's 
scribbling in red Crayon:  The triangular symbol of Thorn!

EXT. MYERS HOUSE / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE

Kara draws the priscilla curtains over the window as we PULL BACK 
through the pouring RAIN ... toward the house across the street.  
An ornate sign on the front door reads:

"Blankenship House - Rooms Available"

CRANE UP toward the window where the shadowy figure stands.  An 
insidious CRASH OF THUNDER as we PUSH through the window.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

A macabre display of old newspaper headlines, arranged 
helterskelter on a wall:  "HALLOWEEN KILLS ESCAPES FROM ASYLUM."  
"HORROR IN HADDONFIELD:  MICHAEL MYERS CLAIMS 16 LIVES."  "REIGN 
OF TERROR ENDS AS MYERS PERISHES IN VIGILANTE EXPLOSION."

Harry Simms BOOMS over a state-of-the-art HiFi system.  A cassette 
tape RECORDS the continuing broadcast.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Now we've got someone who claims he's actually 
	seen Michael Myers.  Does this whacko caller 
	have a name?

Staring out the window at the Myers house, TOMMY DOYLE, a 
strapping 25-year-old with reddish brown hair and intense eyes, 
cradles a cordless phone.
		
		TOMMY
	My name's Tommy.  I was only eight- years-old 
	when I saw him.  But I was lucky.  I survived.

Tommy paces nervously around his sparsely-furnished attic 
apartment.  Classic horror movie one-sheets and mint first edition 
comic books share wall space with a chilling array of guns, 
knives, and survivalist weapons.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Sounds like you're a candidate for 
	electroshock therapy, Tommy.  Don't tell me 
	after all this time you still believe Myers is 
	alive?!

Tommy pauses, mesmerized by one of the newspaper clippings.
		
		TOMMY
	Michael's work isn't finished in Haddonfield.  
	Now it's just a matter of time before he comes 
	home to kill again.  But this time I'll be 
	ready.

MOVE IN TIGHT on the headline, frail and yellowed by age:  
"November 1, 1978.  TOMMY DOYLE SURVIVES BABYSITTER BLOODBATH."  
Directly beneath this:  "November 3, 1989.  JAMIE LLOYD FEARED 
DEAD IN POLICE STATION MASSACRE."

CLOSE ON a photograph of young Jamie and
			
			     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DUNGEON - CHAMBER - NIGHT

Jamie remains strapped to the table, wrapped in bloody sheets.  
Eyes closed.  Deathly still.  Suddenly an urgent, WHISPERING VOICE 
pierces the darkness:
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)
	Jamie?  Jamie?!

Jamie startles awake to see the midwife frantically releasing her 
straps.
		
		MARY
	Come with me if you want to save your baby.

Jamie can't believe her eyes.  Mary opens a threadbare knapsack -- 
revealing the baby inside!

A soul-shuddering RUMBLE echoes throughout the cavern.  Jamie 
leaps up, eyes wide with fear, sensing the evil presence.
		
		JAMIE
	Oh, God ... He's coming!
		
		MARY
	We've got to move.  Now!

Pulsing with adrenaline, Jamie harnesses the knapsack over her 
shoulders and follows Mary out into the tunnels.

TUNNEL GATE

Chains GRIND over rusted pulleys.  A massive iron gate rises, 
revealing a pair of filthy work boots.  Legs planted in bold 
stance as a tall, ominous shape begins to emerge.

ANOTHER TUNNEL

The terrified midwife leads Jamie with her baby on a breathless 
flight through the winding network of tunnels.  Haunted by the 
ECHOING SOUNDS of the rising gate.

STALKING P.O.V. - THROUGH TUNNELS

Gliding forward into the hollow catacombs.  Slow by determined.  
Sensing the way.

ANOTHER PART OF THE TUNNELS

Reaching a corner, Mary stops and sends Jamie off in the opposite 
direction.
		
		MARY
	There!  It's that way!
		
		JAMIE
	No --
		
		MARY
	Save your baby -- go now!

Jamie runs, disappearing down the dark tunnel.  Mary quickly 
removes her shoes and tears off, now SILENT.

STALKING P.O.V.

surges around a corner.  FINDS Mary.  MOVES IN on her.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Mary turns in small circles.  Fear mounting as she falters into 
darkness.  Heavy, labored BREATHING fills the tunnel.

A mask -- the pale, neutral features of a man weirdly distorted by 
the rubber -- materialized out of the void right behind her.  THE 
SHAPE!

Mary turns, about to scream when the Shape lunges out, lifts her 
up by the nape of the neck and SLAMS her forehead into a large 
metal SPIKE jutting out from the cavern wall!

Leaving her impaled like a fish on a hook, the Shape resumes its 
relentless pursuit.  Eerie under the lighted torches.

END OF TUNNEL

Jamie runs frantically.  Methodical, heavy FOOTSTEPS behind her.  
She chances a look behind.  The Shape is coming!

Jamie vaults up a dark stairwell.  A trap door above.  It won't 
budge.  Jamie frantically POUNDS against the hatch.

The Shape mounts the stairs!

Strength fueled by sheer desperation, Jamie forces the door open.  
Tumbles onto muddy ground.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Jamie drags herself out of the hole and half-runs, half-stumbles 
with her baby through an ugly, charred forest.  Sharp branches 
whip at her face.  RAIN falls.  LIGHTNING streaks across the sky.

As if hell-spawned, the Shape emerges from the underground chamber 
and trudges forward, bold and unstoppable.

Jamie tumbles into a gully, nearly dropping the knapsack.  She 
picks herself up, hands groping at rain-sopped earth.  The Shape 
is right behind her!

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT (SAME)

A slap-happy, overweight MOTORIST sips coffee from a 7-11 cup, 
straining to see the road through falling rain and fogged-up 
glasses.  Harry Simms keeps him mindlessly occupied.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Next up is Dwayne.  What's on your feeble 
	excuse for a mind, "Dwayne?"

The Motorisft lets out a hardy GUFFAW, spilling his coffee.
		
		MOTORIST
	Shit!

Fingers burning, he searches the glove compartment for a napkin.
		
		DWAYNE (V.O.)
	I'd just like to say that I listen to your 
	show every night, Harry.  I think you're the 
	best.  I can't tell you how excited we are 
	that you'll be paying a visit to our little 
	town tomorrow night.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Do you have a point to make here, Dwayne, or 
	should I just keep practicing my wrist 
	exercises?
		
		DWAYNE
	   (chortles)
	Harry, you're too much.  I'd just like to say 
	that I understand how things have changed in 
	the 90's.  Gays in the military, cut off your 
	husband's do- jigger, become a national hero.  
	But I just can't see any sense in bringing 
	Halloween back to Haddonfield.

The Motorist looks up.  Eyes go wide with panic.  Startled GASP.

P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD

Jamie stands in the middle of the road, SCREAMING bloody-murder.

EXT. WOODED ROAD / INT. PICKUP TRUCK (SAME)

Tires SCREECH.  The pickup stops on a dime.  The Motorist just 
sits there, mouth agape as the shrieking girl throws open the door 
and clambers into the passenger seat.
		
		JAMIE
	Drive!  Goddamnit, drive!

Through his side-view mirror, the unsuspecting Motorist sees the 
outline of a quickly-approaching man.  Unrolling his window, he 
rubbernecks a look outside.
		
		MOTORIST
	Hey, what do you think you're --

CRUNCHING BONE and TEARING FLESH as the Shape's hands shoot 
through the window, twisting the man's head off his shoulders!

Jamie SCREAMS!  Lunges for the steering wheel.  Slams her foot 
down hard on the gas.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The pickup bullets forward, fishtailing up the road, never slowing 
down as the driver's door flies open, dumping the motorists's 
headless bulk into a muddy ditch.

INT. PICKUP (SAME)

Jamie drives.  Checks to see that her baby is safe.  Then lets out 
a PRIMAL SCREAM.  A hysterical release of fear and rage, drowned 
out by the squabble of VOICES over the radio:
		
		MALE CALLER #2 (V.O.)
	You're coming here for this Halloween fair -- 
	it's all just a game -- a publicity stunt for 
	you, isn't it Harry?  These kids -- they're 
	not old enough to remember what Myers did 
	here. They look up to you.  Now you're just 
	asking for trouble.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	You people really get me.  What are they 
	putting in the water in that town?
			
			     CUT TO:

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

LIGHTNING FLASHES and RAIN pelts the windows of a bucolic cabin.  
This is a man's retreat and has been for years.  Dark wood, worn 
leather, a few tastefully-chosen antiques.  Floor-to-floor ceiling 
shelves containing a myriad of books and an impressive display of 
awards and degrees, all bearing the name:  SAMUEL J. LOOMIS, Ph.D.

After a STATION IDENTIFICATION, "The Harry Simms Show" resumes, 
tinny-voiced CALLERS blaring over a handsomely-restored 1928 
Bremer-Tully.
		
		MALE CALLER #3 (V.O.)
	All these fanatics aside, Harry, I'd 
	personally like to thank whoever did the 
	masked one in.  Saved us tax-payers a lot of 
	money in the long run.
		
		FEMALE CALLER #3 (V.O.)
	Yeah, that sucker's been dead for six years.  
	It's about time they had a Halloween revival 
	in this town.  Now my kids can stop driving me 
	crazy!

MOVE IN behind a bald, sharp-featured man, hunched over a can as 
he reminisces over a collection of framed photographs -- memories 
of his wife and children.
		
		MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.)
	What happened to that psychiatrist of his?  
	Loomis, I think was his name.  I heard the old 
	quack was dead.

Turning at the mention of his name is DR. LOOMIS himself, wearing 
spectacles, a comfortable sweater and his trademark goatee.  For 
the first time ever, we actually see him smile.  The burn scars on 
his face have all but faded away.  Last traces of the horrid past.
		
		LOOMIS
	Not dead.  Just very much retired.

Loomis hobbles to the desk and finishes cutting out a newspaper 
article.  As he arranges the strips of paper in a leather-bound 
scrapbook, a sudden KNOCK at the door gives him a startle.

EXT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

An ominous FIGURE, clad in hat and trench coat, stands beneath the 
glowing porch light, silhouetted in the pouring RAIN.

Loomis opens the door, eyes straining in the semi-darkness, trying 
to identify his unexpected visitor.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (sudden recognition)
	What the devil?!  Come in -- come in!

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Shuffling inside, dripping with rain, DR. TERENCE WYNN, a 
well-dressed gentleman in his 50s, removes his hat and coat, 
quickly making himself at home by the crackling fire.
		
		WYNN
	Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a 
	sign for five miles on that road!
		
		LOOMIS
	That's the whole idea of living in the 
	country.  I thrive on the seclusion.

Wynn heads for the kitchen, rummaging through cabinets and drawers 
as Loomis dutifully wipes up his muddy trail.
		
		WYNN (O.S.)
	Don't tell me that the reviled Rasputin of 
	Smith's Grove has grown complacent in his 
	golden years.  I don't buy it for a single 
	second, Dr. Loomis.

Loomis immediately senses that Wynn has an angle.
		
		LOOMIS
	And in all these years, I've never known you 
	to make house calls, Dr. Wynn.  Especially at 
	this hour ...

Wynn returns with a bottle of Irish whiskey and two shot glasses.  
Thrusts one in Loomis's hand and begins to pour.
		
		WYNN
	Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not 
	to second-guess the motives of my fellow man.  
	Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar 
	is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink 
	is just a drink.
		
		LOOMIS
	I hope you didn't come all the way out here in 
	this storm just to quote Freud.
		
		WYNN
	As always, your keen powers of perception 
	astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to 
	celebrate. 
	   (raising his glass)
	After thirty-two years as Psychiatric 
	Administrator, guess who has been named 
	Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
		
		LOOMIS
	But surely Rogers isn't --
		
		WYNN
	Retiring.

Loomis is abruptly stunned and delighted by the news.
		
		LOOMIS
	Why -- congratulations!  I can think of no one 
	better suited for the position.

The two old sparring partners drink to the occasion.  But Wynn's 
angle soon comes to the helm.
		
		WYNN
	Of course, I need a new Administrator. Someone 
	who can bring new life -- and some old blood, 
	if you'll pardon the expression -- back to our 
	program ...

Loomis prepares himself for the bomb.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	We need you, Dr. Loomis.
		
		LOOMIS
	You should know that it's not wise to play 
	Halloween pranks on me.
		
		WYNN
	You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things 
	haven't been the same since you left.  I'm 
	recruiting the best psychiatric team in the 
	country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change 
	to finally make a difference.

Loomis scratches his head and settles down into his comfortable 
easy chair, amused at the irony of Wynn's speech.
		
		LOOMIS
	Even after my stroke six years ago they 
	practically had to hold a gun to my head to 
	get me to retire.  Now things have changed.  
	I've changed.  The ghosts have been buried.  
	Why on earth would I want to dig them up 
	again?

Loomis finally looks over at Wynn, surprised to find him standing 
at the desk, looking through his scrap book.
		
		WYNN
	Seems to me there's at least one ghost that's 
	still lurking in your closet.

We follow Wynn's gaze down toward the open page.  A blazing 
tabloid headline:  "MICHAEL MYERS - DEAD OR ALIVE?"
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Jamie's getaway truck ROARS around a bend, tearing up a deserted 
stretch of highway.  The STORM rages.

INT. PICKUP (CONTINUOUS)

Jamie strains to see as she drives through sheets of RAIN.  Bone 
weary, fighting panic, holding one hand steady against the wheel, 
the other on the CRYING infant.
		
		JAMIE
	God ... Help us, please ...

Something up ahead.  Jamie's face fills with expectancy.

JAMIE'S P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

A lighted sign appears out of the darkness.  Glowing salvation.  
Familiar red-white-and-blue logo.  "GREYHOUND."

EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

The pickup drives into the glow of orange vapor lights.  SKIDS to 
a stop in a deserted parking lot.  Jamie staggers out, cradling 
the knapsack as she runs toward the old depot.

INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

Jamie blasts through double glass doors.  But the bus station is 
devoid of life.  Empty benches.  Blank ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE 
signboard.  The low hum of vending machines.

Jamie moves toward the ticket counter.  A handwritten sign left by 
the attendant:  "BACK IN 20."

Shivering, holding her baby, Jamie enters an old-fashioned phone 
booth.  Picks up the receiver and immediately dials 911.
		
		VOICE (V.O.)
	You have reached Haddonfield Emergency 
	Services.  Due to severe weather conditions, 
	all circuits are momentarily busy.  If this is 
	not an emergency, please dial directly ...

Jamie slams the phone down in terrified frustration.  Suddenly she 
becomes aware of the radio program.  Piped in over ancient 
loudspeakers:

		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	For anyone who gives a flying circus, this is 
	Harry Simms -- the light in your night, the 
	love of your loins -- and I want to hear from 
	more of you bogeyman believers out there.  So 
	give me your best shot at 1-800-878-7274. 
	That's 1-800-URTRASH!

The STATION IDENTIFICATION cuts in.  Jamie picks up the receiver and 
frantically dials the number.

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

Wynn doesn't give up the sales pitch even as Loomis leads him to the 
door.  The radio program still squawking in the b.g.
		
		WYNN
	But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, 
	you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
		
		LOOMIS
	Please try to understand, Terence. I've already 
	made up my mind.

As Wynn continues to talk, his voice trailing off into nothingness, 
Loomis's attention is diverted to the VOICES on the radio.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	So they're trying to kill you and your baby.  
	Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be 
	Rosemary.
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	   (intense whisper)
	No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming 
	for me and my baby.

Loomis's eyes widen; a man possessed.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's 
	coming?
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	It's ... Michael ... 
	   (releasing)
	... Michael Myers!

Loomis staggers.  A lifetime of nightmares coming back to haunt him 
all at once.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME)

PRESS IN TIGHT ON TOMMY in bed.  Listening through headphones.  
Sitting upright.  Thunderstruck.
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	Somebody help me!  Dr. Loomis, are you out 
	there?  Can you hear me?

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

Wynn watches with rapt attention as Loomis unlocks his safe and 
withdraws a metal case.  He pops it open, revealing his trusted .357 
Magnum and a box of cartridges.

INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT (SAME)

A bus has arrived.  The ATTENDANT returns to his post.  Jamie hangs 
up the phone, filled with trepidation as PASSENGERS file inside.  A 
strung-out ROCKER.  A pair of stern-faced NUNS.  A PRETTY TEENAGER 
greeted in the loving arms of her BOYFRIEND.

Just as she is about to step out of the phone booth, a TALL MAN, 
back turned, wearing a hat and black trench coat, moves to stand 
outside the booth!  Jamie freezes.

Securing her baby in the knapsack, Jamie throws open the door.  
Suddenly the Tall Man steps in her path!
		
		TALL MAN
	Are you all right, young lady?

Shaking uncontrollably, Jamie shrinks away.  Backing down a narrow 
hall through the door marked "LADIES ROOM."

INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT (SAME)

Water runs into a grimy basin.  Unable to contain her tears, she 
washes the newborn.  Takes a roll of paper towels and tries to rub 
the triangular blood mark off his chest.

Suddenly the lights go out.  Jamie gasps.  Clutching her baby, she 
turns off the faucet and melts into the darkness.

The door CREAKS open.  FOOTSTEPS echo inside.

JAMIE

has locked herself inside one of the stalls.  Heart pounding.  The 
FOOTSTEPS grow louder.  Jamie's eyes dart frantically.

STALKING P.O.V.

MOVING methodically past the row of stalls, pushing open each door, 
revealing that they are all empty.  A CRASH from the last stall.  
P.O.V. moves toward it.  RUSTLING and MOVEMENT inside.

A HAND pushes on the door.  An open window above the toilet.  Jamie 
is gone!

EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Jamie trembles off a stack of crates piled beneath the window and 
dashes around the side of the depot.

Suddenly the bus ROARS by, sending up a muddy wave as it pulls out, 
disappearing down the highway.

Jamie moves swiftly across the parking lot, clutching the knapsack.  
She throws open the door of the pickup and jumps into the driver's 
seat.

INT. PICKUP - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Slapping down the locks, Jamie thrusts the key into the ignition.  
The engine REVS to life.  She guns it, peeling out of the parking 
lot.  Back toward the highway.

She drives on, suppressing her tears, stealing glances at the 
knapsack bunched up on the passenger's seat.  Then she turns and 
looks forward with concentrated attention.

JAMIE'S P.O.V.

A sign looms ahead:  "Haddonfield Memorial Hospital - 10 Mi."

BACK TO SCENE

Jamie sighs with relief, steadying the wheel just as --

HIGHBEAMS flash on right behind her, a juggernaut roaring out of 
blackness!  Jamie's eyes flood with terror.

JAMIE'S P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

The grill of a familiar white van shoots forward, SLAMMING violently 
against the pickup's rear bumper.

JAMIE

is jolted forward in her seat.  Holding on the wheel with a 
white-knuckle grip as she's repeatedly hit from behind.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The unseen madman noses forward, veering sharply over the double 
yellow line, scraping sides with the truck.

Headlights sear a path through the night, locked in neck-and-neck 
profile.  SPARKS flashing at 70-miles-per-hour.

The van forces Jamie onto the shoulder.  It leaves the road, tearing 
branches from trees.  Jamie SCREAMING.

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH - THE CHASE

A quick-cut MONTAGE, events ticking out in fractions of a second 
like a nightmare:

The pickup springboards over a gulch and slams down hard, tires 
spinning in waves of mud, careening through a vast field.  A 
pumpking patch.

The van reappears in a glare of headlights.  Its engine screaming 
with fire-breathing rage.

The pickup puts on a furious burst of speed.  Eating up pumpkins and 
spinning out chunks of splattering seeds and pulp.

The van bears down hard, slingshotting across the field, whizzing 
past the pickup, cutting right in front of it.

INT. PICKUP

Something heavy is thrown from the back of the van right through the 
windshield!

Glass EXPLODES!  Jamie SCREAMS, hands going up instinctively to 
protect her face.  Swerving wildly out of control.

She looks to see a sprawling, mutilated corpse on top of her.  Wide, 
cold, lifeless eyes -- Mary!
		
		JAMIE
	No!!!

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH (CONTINUOUS)

The pickup rockets at breakneck speed toward the edge of the field.  
Suddenly --

JAMIE'S P.O.V.

The Shape stands in the field, tall and unmoving, white mask glowing 
hideously in the rush of oncoming headlights.

BACK TO SCENE

The truck plows into the Shape, dragging it under, SLAMMING headlong 
into the trunk of a huge oak tree.

Everything is abruptly and shockingly silent.  Like a phantom in the 
night, the van is gone.  The Shape nowhere to be seen.

Steam billows from the pickup, engine TICKING, a heap of shattered 
glass and mangled steel.  Pinned against the base of the tree is a 
shape in human form -- a scarecrow!

MOVE IN on Jamie, face-down against the steering wheel.  Coughing on 
the noxious fumes, she stirs back to life.  Slowly, painfully, she 
shoulders the door.  Falls onto the ground.

A SPARK ignites.  BLINDING FLASH as the gas tank EXPLODES, setting 
the truck ablaze.  Jamie turns, her face a frozen rictus of horror.  
Debris rains down on her.

Suddenly a grim shadow rises from the field.  The Shape -- wielding 
an enormous butcher knife!

Jamie rolls onto her back, SCREAMING.
		
		JAMIE
	No -- NO!!!

Suddenly the knife plunges down and lands with a terrible THUD.

INT. PICKUP

The knapsack catches fire ... but inside there is no baby.  Only a 
roll of paper towels from the bus depot.

THE SCARECROW

burns; mocking Jamie with its grinning, hand-painted face.
			
			     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

THE SHAPE

looks at us, white mask scintillating against blinding rays of 
SUNLIGHT.  Rivulets of blood drip off a large carving knife.

PULLING BACK, we see it is a life-sized, knife-wielding effigy of 
Michael Myers, sitting astride the "For Sale by Strode Realty" 
sign.  Stage blood spells out the words:  "He's coming!"

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

John Strode looks up with disgust as he inspects the grim monument 
that's been left on his front lawn during the night.  Puffing on a 
cigarette, wearing slippers and a flimsy bath robe, John raises a 
large axe.

A group of neighborhood KIDS -- some dressed in Halloween 
costumes -- stand a safe distance away.  Gathered on the sidewalk.  
Gawking, whispering, tittering.

John angrily swings the axe into the signpost.  The kids jump with a 
collective start.
		
		JOHN
	Enough ... 
	   (one CHOP)
	... of this ... 
	   (two CHOPS)
	... Michael Myers ... 
	   (timber)
	... shit!

Suddenly the sign crashes down -- and "Michael Myers" with it.  The 
kids huddle.  John turns on them, brandishing the axe.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing)
	You stinkin' kids got three seconds to get the 
	hell off my property!  One, two --

That's all it takes.  The kids scatter, tripping over one another as 
they tear off down the black.

Satisfied with himself, John stubs out his cigarette and hauls the 
sign and its now-headless rider to the trash.

Then he trudges up the porch steps, dropping the axe as he enters 
the house.  Uttering oaths under his breath.

BOOM UP over the surrounding neighborheed.  SUPERIMPOSE:

"Haddonfield, Illinois.  Halloween."

Last night's storm has given way to an incredibly bright and 
picturesque morning.  CHILDREN pour out of their homes, bursting 
with excitement, dressed in colorful costumes.

Even the Myers house, with its trimmed hedges and fresh coat of 
paint, somehow manages to look invite.

A white van slowly rolls up the street.  WKNB logo, streamers and a 
large orange banner proclaiming:  "HADDONFIELD JUNIOR COLLEGE 
HARVEST FAIRE '95 - See Harry Simms Live - October 31."  A 
now-familiar voice booms over loudspeaker:
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	This is Hard Harry Simms harping on ya from the 
	Big Apple.  Tonight's the night and the place 
	to be is the First Annual Harvest Faire.  So 
	come on out of your broom closets, 'Fielders, 
	and bogey the night away with me.
		
		MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.)
	Harry, I just won first prize for ugliest 
	costume!  Guess who I'm dressed as.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Your mother?
		
		MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.)
	No, man -- You!!!

EXT. SANITARIUM - MORNING

A car bearing an official state emblem stops outside an imposing 
curtain of security gates.  A large sign reads:  "SMITH'S GROVE - 
WARREN COUNTY SANITARIUM."

A hand reaches out and waves a plastic key card in front of an 
infrared scanner.  Surveillance cameras perched on the walls.

As the gate yawns open and the car drives through, we SEE the asylum 
in the distance -- the entire perimeter bounded by woods and barbed 
wire fences.

INT. WYNN'S CAR (CONTINUOUS)

Wynn drives.  Loomis in the passenger seat, fueling his own 
anxieties.
		
		LOOMIS
	It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was 
	Jamie.  Calling for me.
		
		WYNN
	You don't know that for sure.  It could have 
	been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
		
		LOOMIS
	It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew 
	she would one day.  And whatever has brought 
	her back has brought Michael back as well.
		
		WYNN
	After six years?  Sam, she died with him in 
	that explosion after the --
		
		LOOMIS
	That's what someone wants us to believe, but I 
	tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I 
	sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did 
	all those years as I watched him.  Sitting 
	behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing 
	stronger. 
	   (off Wynn's silence)
	As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't 
	go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your 
	help to stop him.

Wynn stares.  Loomis's words fall on him like a death sentence.

INT. SANITARIUM - RECEPTION AREA (SAME)

Gold insignia on mahogany doors:  "TERENCE WYNN - CHIEF OF STAFF."

Wynn and Loomis stride through a plush reception area.  DAWN, an 
attractive, high-energy secretary, keeps pace, taking notes, handing 
Wynn his briefcase, phone messages, etc.
		
		WYNN
	Cancel all my appointments.  Get Dr. Loomis 
	anything he needs -- files, tests, records of 
	every treatment ever administered to a former 
	patient of ours -- Michael Myers.
		
		DAWN
	   (stunned)
	Michael Myers?

Wynn stops abruptly before heading out the door.
		
		WYNN
	That's right.  We think there's a very good 
	chance he might still be alive.

Loomis acknowledges Wynn's silent understanding.

CORRIDOR

Wynn and Loomis move along a sterile white corridor.  Wynn uses his 
key card to BUZZ them through a series of metal security cages.  A 
retinue of DOCTORS and NURSES fall in behind.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on 
	our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We 
	go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours. 
	   (beat)
	If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
		
		LOOMIS
	Or what's left of him.

They cut down a sub-passageway and out a fire exit.

EXT. SANITARIUM - LANDING FIELD (CONTINUOUS)

Loomis and Wynn dash across a windswept field where a Smith's Grove 
medical transport helicopter awaits them.  The deafening WHINE of 
spinning rotors as a TECHNICIAN refuels.

The doctors step inside.  The doors close and the helicopter lifts 
off, rising high above the cluster of the white coats below.
			
			     CUT TO:

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

A blender whips up a revolting concoction of chocolate Yoo-Hoo, 
banana yogurt and chewy Gummi-worms as Tim, wearing Levi's baggies 
and a "Harry Simms Kicks Ass" T-shirt, raps on the phone.
		
		TIM
	Bro', I knew Harry when we lived in the city.  
	Don't worry -- he'll be there. We've got 
	everything arranged.  Get with me tonight at 
	the fair and I'll hook you up.  Peace.

Tim hangs up, guzzling down his shake as Debra navigates around him, 
setting out the breakfast dishes as Kara tries to study.

John, dressed in what might be a respectable business suit if it fit 
him better, mutters grumpily as he pours himself a cup of coffee.
		
		JOHN
	Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed 
	them ...
		
		DEBRA
	Relax, John.  They were just kids.
		
		JOHN
	Kids are what's ruining this country. 
	Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn 
	respect.

Tim lets out a huge BELCH as he finishes drinking his breakfast.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing)
	See what I'm talkin' about?
		
		DEBRA
	You'll never pass that exam on an empty 
	stomach, Kara.

Debra snatches the book out of Kara's hands.
		
		DEBRA
	   (continuing; reading)
	Cognitive Therapy and Emotional Disorders?  
	What are they teaching in college these days?  
	The art of going crazy?
		
		KARA
	   (indignant)
	It's called psychology, Mom.  Living in this 
	house is what's driving me crazy.
		
		JOHN
	Who the hell told you to come live here in the 
	first place?

Kara rises, collects her books, trying to avoid a confrontation.
		
		KARA
	I'd better get Danny to school.
		
		JOHN
	She don't show her face for five years, then 
	expects us to roll out the red carpet.  You 
	think going to college is gonna make up for 
	your mistakes, girl?
		
		DEBRA
	John, please don't --
		
		TIM
	Yo', just lay off her, Dad.

Suddenly Danny runs in, showing off in his dinosaur costume.  
ROARING loudly.  Startling John.
		
		JOHN
	What the fuck --

Kara immediately seizes Danny's hand and ushers him toward the back 
door.
		
		KARA
	Let's go, Danny.
		
		DEBRA
	Kara, wait.  John.  Can't we all just sit 
	down?  Try to be a family for once?
		
		KARA
	I'm sorry, Mom.

Debra reaches into her purse and hands Kara a couple of dollars.
		
		JOHN
	That's it, Debra, keep slipping her the cash.  
	While you're at it, why don't you just give her 
	all our goddamn money?!

John explodes, dumping the entire contents of her purse onto the 
floor.  Debra recoils.  Kara steps in.  Danny is terrified.
		
		KARA
	Stay away from her, you bastard.
		
		JOHN
	   (re Danny)
	I only see one bastard in this house.

Kara flies at him with Medea-like rage.  John instantly grabs her by 
the neck and shoves her violently against the counter.
		
		TIM
	Dad!  Let her go!
		
		DEBRA
	John!  Stop it!  Stop it!

Danny looks outside.  Frozen in horror.  A VOICE whispers.
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
	Kill him, Danny ... Kill him ...

Danny moves across the kitchen.  Mesmerized.  Through the screen 
door, the Shape can be seen standing in the back yard.

Kara's eyes bulge as John squeezes her throat.  Choking her.
		
		JOHN
	You ever raise your hand to me again, I'll kill 
	you, you understand?

John looks down to see the tip of a butcher knife pointed at his 
groin.  Danny is holding it -- his eyes dark, emotionless.  Ever so 
slowly, John releases Kara.  Debra and Tim watch in horrified 
astonishment.

Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the back door.  Kara dives toward 
Danny.  The knife clatters to the floor as she picks him up, grabs 
her book bag and hurtles outside.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - BACK YARD (CONTINUOUS)

BETH, 19, very "retro," cute in the waifish sense -- milky white 
skin, two-tone hair and a dangling nose ring --is nearly bowled off 
the back porch as Kara and Danny fly out the door.
		
		BETH
	Make way for the Hardin County Express. 
	   (following them across the yard)
	Hey, where's Tim?  We're supposed to go over 
	the list of events for tonight --

Beth is taken aback when she sees the bruise on Kara's neck.
		
		BETH
	   (continuing)
	He do that to you?
		
		KARA
	Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the 
	Strode house.
		
		BETH
	Pig.  What the hell happened this time?

Suddenly Tim jumps out from behind a clothesline, locking his arms 
around Beth, attacking her with kisses.
		
		BETH
	   (continuing)
	Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
		
		TIM
	Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to 
	organnize this friggin' fair? It's only 
	Halloween.

Beth shoves the clipboard at him, a champion of her cause.
		
		BETH
	How many times o I have to tell you? It's not 
	about Halloween.  It's about being political.  
	There are too many people with corn-cobs up 
	their ass in this town telling us what we can 
	and can't do.  If we want change, it's up to us 
	to set an example.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN (SAME)

Debra is on the floor, stifling her tears, putting things back in 
her purse.  John stares coldly out the window.
		
		JOHN
	I want her and that kid out of here tonight.

Debra rises, facing him scornfully.
		
		DEBRA
	I thought inheriting your father's house ... 
	the business ... moving out here might change 
	things.  But you're still the same, John. 
	   (with finality)
	Kara has come home, and I'll be damned if I let 
	you turn her away again.

Debra storms off.  John bores holes into her with his eyes.

EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (SAME)

Tim lifts Danny into the back seat of Beth's convertible VW Bug -- 
plastered with "Greenpeace" and "This is Your Brain on Drugs" bumper 
stickers.  Kara and Beth in front.
		
		TIM
	Whatever happened to women in back?
		
		BETH
	Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.

Pulling away from the curb, Beth honks at MRS. BLANKENSHIP, at least 
80, owner of the student boarding house across the street.
		
		BETH
	   (continuing)
	See you tonight, Mrs. Blankenship!

The old woman just stares forward.  A gardem hose in hand as she 
waters a garden of long-dead flowers.

Kara shields her eyes, distracted, looking up at the old Victorian 
house.

KARA'S P.O.V.

Beth drives down a shady, tree-lined avenue, unaware of the white 
van that is following them.
		
		KARA
	Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall 
	from you?
		
		BETH
	Why?  You interested?
		
		KARA
	No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window.  
	Watching me.
		
		BETH
	You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale 
	he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary 
	shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed 
	up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably 
	just lonely.

Tim leans forward, ravaging Beth's neck.
		
		TIM
	Or horny.
		
		KARA
	Tim, do you always have to act like such an 
	asshole?
		
		TIM
	Only when you're around to dump on ... Hey, 
	chill, sis.  I'm just doggin' ya.

Suddenly the van ROARS by and cuts them off.  Beth lays on the 
HORN.  Slams on the brakes.  Narrowly avoiding a collision.
		
		BETH
	Speed kills, asshole!

Suddenly the van swerves around to face the VW head on.  For a 
breathless moment the van and the VW sit at opposite ends of the 
intersection.  Idling.  A tense stand-off.
		
		KARA
	Who is that ...

Kara strains to get a look at the van's driver.  A momentary glimpse 
of a pale white face behind the wheel.
		
		BETH
	   (bravely)
	I've got my pepper spray.

Danny sits frozen in the back seat.  Suddenly the van shoots 
forward, tires SCREAMING.  Startled GASPS.  The van turns off 
sharply at the last second, SCREECHING down the next block.
		
		TIM
	   (relieved)
	Happy fuckin' Halloween.
		
		BETH
	Someone's trying to scare us out of having this 
	fair ... and it's not gonna work.

Beth drives on, grimly determined.  Kara looks back at Danny.  He 
returns her frightened gaze.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Tommy paces in his cramped apartment.  Dark circles under his eyes.  
A remote control in hand, reviewing his recording of last night's 
Harry Simms broadcast:
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	So they're trying to kill you and your baby.  
	Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be 
	Rosemary.
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming 
	for me and my baby.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's 
	coming?
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!

Frustrated, Tommy plays it again.  Adjusts the speed.  Tries to make 
out something else in the b.g.  Jamie's voice comes through.  Slow.  
Eerie.
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	   (continuing; slowed)
	It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!

Another VOICE, distant and distorted, filters up behind hers.
		
		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	Bus 611 from Russellville now arriving.

Tommy quickly stops the tape, throws on his worn leather bomber 
jacket and bolts straight out the door.

MOVE IN on a pair of old newspaper clippings left on the floor.  
Headlines read:  "November 5, 1989.  JAMIE LLOYD STILL MISSING."  
"November 19, 1989.  MYERS' NIECE PRESUMED DEAD."
			
			     DISSOLVE TO:

INT. FORD EXPLORER / EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - MORNING

Tommy drives like a bat out of hell.  The "Greyhound" sign looms 
ahead.

EXT. BUS DEPOT - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

The Explorer pulls up to the depot.  Tommy makes a beeline for the 
entrance, cowboy boots splashing through rain puddles.

INT. BUS DEPOT (CONTINUOUS)

Tommy wades his way through a small crowd up to the ticket booth.  A 
cross-eyed ATTENDANT greets him.
		
		ATTENDANT
	Can I help you, sir?
		
		TOMMY
	Can you tell me if a bus arrived from 
	Russellville last night?

The Attendant checks her roster.
		
		ATTENDANT
	Sure did.  About seven hours ago.  You lookin' 
	for someone --
		
		TOMMY
	   (walking away)
	Thank you.

The Attendant eyes Tommy suspiciously as he enters the phone booth 
in the corner.  Inside, he picks up the receiver and pretends to 
dial a number.  Makes a cursory inspection.

TOMMY'S P.O.V. - PHONE BOOTH

On the floor, tiny droplets of what appear to be blood form a dotted 
trail out the door.

TOMMY

follows the crimson path around the corner down a dim hallway, 
stopping at the door marked "Ladies Room."  Checking first to make 
sure the coast is clear, he steps furtively inside.

INT. LADIES' ROOM (CONTINUOUS)

Tommy walks past the sink.  Water drips into the filthy basin.  He 
touches something inside, rubs it on his fingers -- blood.

Tommy whirls, startled by a sudden NOISE.  Muffled, indistinct.  
Like CRYING.  Tommy gathers his courage as he slowly moves past the 
long row of empty stalls.  The CRIES grow louder as he reaches the 
final stall.  Jamie's escape route -- the window -- still wide open.

A hole in the wall behind the toilet.  Tommy reaches in, his hands 
locking onto something.  Shock and amazement overcome him when he 
lifts out a baby -- Jamie's baby.
		
		TOMMY
	Jesus ...

The helpless newborn kicks and CRIES, the triangular symbol of Thorn 
still caked in blood over his tiny torso.

SUBJECTIVE P.O.V.

Someone partially opens the door, peering in from the hallway as 
Tommy removes his jacket and bundles the baby inside.
		
		TOMMY
	Okay, little guy.  You're okay.

BACK TO SCENE

A CREAK.  Tommy looks up.  The door slowly closes.

DEPOT HALLWAY

Tommy looks into shadowy stillness.  No one there.  Hiding the baby, 
cradling his jacket, he hurries through the crowd and slinks out the 
door marked ENTRANCE.
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

HELICOPTER P.O.V.

The SOUND of THWACKING BLADES as we FLY past a winding rural highway 
over a dense grove of oak trees -- massive, ancient guardians of the 
sprawling pumpkin patch that lies beyond.

As we circle the field, red-and-blue gum machines -- police cars, 
fire engines and ambulances -- can be seen through gauzy veils of 
rising BLACK SMOKE, dissipating with the strong WIND.

Charred in the ground, three intersecting lines stretch a hundred 
feet across the plan to form a vivid geoglyphic.  The symbol of 
Thorn.
		
		HELICOPTER PILOT (V.O.)
	   (filtered)
	Chopper One to Smith's Grove.  We've got a 
	visual.  Approximately ten miles due east of 
	Haddonfield.

INT. HELICOPTER (CONTINUOUS)

Loomis surveys the crash site with morbid fascination.  Wynn, 
wearing headphones, shouts over the noise.
		
		WYNN
	   (pointing)
	What is that?
		
		LOOMIS
	It's a sign.  He's come home.

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

The helicopter lands, windmilling gusts of ashen earth.  Loomis and 
Wynn jump out, ducking past the spinning blades.

We FOLLOW them through EMERGENCY CREWS and a few CURIOSITY-SEEKERS 
toward the center of attention.  A charred body is lifted from the 
eviscerated, flame-blackened pikcup truck.

A few feet away, a team of PARAMEDICS work frantically around 
another body, hidden among a cluster of pumpkins.

Loomis surges forward, at once halted by an armed DEPUTY.

		DEPUTY
	Sir, you'll have to step back.
		
		LOOMIS
	Please.  I need to see the sheriff.
		
		WYNN
	Official business.

Wynn flashes his badge.  The Deputy gives them a vexed glance.
		
		DEPUTY
	Wait here.

Loomis's eyes flicker with nervous anticipation.  The Deputy 
whispers something to SHERIFF JIM HOLDT, a brooding giant of a man 
who dons a Stetson, holstered .44 Special and steel-toed boots that 
give new meaning to the term "bad ass."

Even Loomis steps back as the sheriff lumbers toward them.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (extends his hand)
	You must be Sheriff Holdt.

Holdt responds by stubbing out his Marlboro at Loomis's foot.
		
		HOLDT
	As a matter of fact, I am.  And I take it 
	you're the infamous Dr. Loomis.
		
		LOOMIS
	I'd like to introduce you to Terence Wynn, the 
	Chief of Staff at --
		
		HOLDT
	Smith's Grove.  They told me you'd be coming.  
	Now I suggest you fly right on back to your 
	crackpot asylum.  You people got no business in 
	my town.
		
		LOOMIS
	Michael Myers is my business.

Holdt towers above him.
		
		HOLDT
	I want you to listen and listen good, Loomis.  
	Things have been quiet for six years and that's 
	the way they're gonna stay.  The last thing we 
	need is you spouting off your ghost stories.

As usual, Loomis isn't easily intimidated.
		
		LOOMIS
	I suppose it was a ghost that did all this.  A 
	ghost who called the radio station last night.  
	Maybe that same ghost is lying over there right 
	now.

Holdt fumes, ready to boil when --
		
		DEPUTY
	Sheriff!  She's alive!

Holdt and Loomis wade through the crush of paramedics, running 
alongside the stretcher being whisked toward an ambulance.

A large knife extruding from a girl's stomach, packed under sterile 
gauze.  Skin pasty-white.  Lips blue from shock.
		
		LOOMIS
	Dear God ... Jamie!
			
			     CUT TO:

EXT. HADDONFIELD JUNIOR COLLEGE - PARKING LOT - MORNING

Beth's car pulls into the parking lot of a picturesque, impeccably 
landscaped campus, speckled with colorful leaves.  A buzz of 
excitement fills the autumn air.

Tim and Beth are surprised to see a small crowd -- camped out in 
sleeping bags, holding "We Love to Hate Harry" signs.
		
		TIM
	Yo, check it out.  They've been lining up all 
	night just to see Harry. 
	   (to Kara)
	You lose your mind in that thing, Kara?

Kara is nervously rifling through her enormous book bag.
		
		KARA
	I can't find my term paper.
		
		TIM
	So copy someone else's.  I do it all the time.  
	Works primo.

Armed with her clipboard, Beth is assailed by her COMMITTEE.  
Inundating her with QUESTIONS.
		
		BETH
	Give us victory or give us death.  See you 
	tonight, Kara!

Tim and Beth are swept away.  A large sheet of paper falls out of 
Kara's bag.  She picks it up, startled by what she sees.

KARA'S P.O.V. - THE DRAWING

Crayola figures of Grandma, Grandpa, Uncle Tim, and Mommy.  Knives 
piercing them.  Blood dripping.  Mouths screaming.  A black shadow 
figure bearing the word "THORN."

On the flip side, the drawing she found last night.  Danny's 
scribbling of the odd triangular symbol.

BACK TO SCENE

The horrifying images send chills up Kara's spine.
		
		KARA
	Thorn ...

Lost in grim reverie, Kara walks on, oblivious to the activity all 
around her ...

A banner hangs from the eaves of the library:  "HADDONFIELD JR. 
COLLEGE - FIRST ANNUAL HARVEST FAIRE."

Tim and Beth supervise as preparations for tonight's event get 
underway.

STUDENT VOLUNTEERS nailing together booths, hanging decorations.  A 
half-assembled Ferris wheel, a merry-go-round, an ominous-looking 
House of Horrors.

Rounding the corner onto the quiet path behind the library, Kara 
suddenly finds herself alone.  WIND whips at her hair.  She glances 
over her shoulder, as if sensing a presence.

KARA'S P.O.V.

No one is there.  Just the rustling of leaves on the ground.

ANGLE ON KARA

Walking off in the distance.  Suddenly the Shape steps shockingly 
into FRAME, watching her disappear around the corner.
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

INT. HADDONFIELD MEMORIAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

Doors BLAST open.  The stretcher holding Jamie is pushed through, 
Loomis right beside her.  Wynn follows, trying to stop him.  A 
SHOCK-TRAUMA unit swarms in.  No time to lose.
		
		PARAMEDIC
	Penetrating abdominal trauma.  Massive blood 
	loss.  We've given her two units of O-negative 
	stat and dextran.  BP sixty.  Pulse one-twenty 
	... Somehow she pulled through out there all 
	night!

DR. BONHAM, the ER resident, peels off the sheet, exposing a dark 
sea of blood around the enormous knife still jutting from Jamie's 
stomach.  Bonham stares, incredulous.
		
		DR. BONHAM
	How can this girl still be alive?! Type and 
	cross-match for another six units!  Get a CT 
	scan and move her into surgery. 
	   (re Loomis and Wynn)
	And get them out of here!

ORDERLIES move in.  Loomis won't release Jamie's hand.
		
		WYNN
	Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
		
		LOOMIS
	I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live.  
	You have to.

HOSPITAL ENTRANCE / ADMITTANCE DESK

Pneumatic doors fly open.  Tommy bursts through, holding the baby in 
his jacket.  PATIENTS and COPS everywhere.  He hones in on the NURSE 
behind the admittance desk.
		
		TOMMY
	I need to see a doctor.
		
		NURSE
	What seems to be the problem?
		
		TOMMY
	I-it's a baby -- my baby.  There's been -- been 
	an accident.
		
		NURSE
	What kind of an accident?
		
		TOMMY
	   (explodes)
	Just get me a doctor right now!

ADJACENT HALLWAY

Wynn and Loomis skirt past a line of SECURITY GUARDS.
		
		WYNN
	There's nothing more you can do for her.

The shrill sound of Wynn's beeper.  He clicks it.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	I'll be right back.

Wynn disappears around the corner.  Loomis wanders off alone.
		
		TOMMY (O.S.)
	Dr. Loomis!

Loomis reacts, taken aback by the frantic young man bounding toward 
him.
		
		LOOMIS
	Yes?
		
		TOMMY
	Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard 
	her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
		
		LOOMIS
	I'm sorry, but do I know you --
		
		TOMMY
	I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- 
	Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me 
	that night --

Loomis suddenly recognizes him.  It's been a very long time.
		
		LOOMIS
	Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
		
		TOMMY
	Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael 
	Myers come home?

Loomis pulls Tommy aside into an empty alcove.
		
		LOOMIS
	What do you know about Michael?
		
		TOMMY
	I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they 
	want us to believe he's dead.  But I know.  
	I've always known.
		
		LOOMIS
	Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie 
	Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She 
	is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
		
		TOMMY
	   (gravely)
	No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.

Tommy hesitates.  Loomis's eyes are drawn enigmatically to the 
infant in Tommy's arms.
		
		TOMMY
	   (continuing; startled realization)
	Oh, God -- his cousins.  The Strodes. They're 
	living in the Myers house!

Loomis's face flls with horror.  Tommy sees the Admittance Nurse, 
flanked by a pair of security guards, walking his way.
		
		TOMMY
	   (continuing)
	I gotta go.

Tommy bolts toward the exit.  Loomis tries to stop him.
		
		LOOMIS
	Tommy, wait!

But he is gone.  A hand taps Loomis's shoulder; he reels.  Wynn.
		
		WYNN
	There you are.  Who was that boy?
		
		LOOMIS
	An old friend.

Darkness fills Loomis's countenance as we
			
			     CUT TO:

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - DAY

We peer OVER THE SHOULDER of the Shape, standing across the street.  
Watching Debra, in jeans and a rumpled sweatshirt, collecting 
left-over painting supplies from the front porch.

Debra starts to open the CREAKY screen door when she notices the axe 
John had used earlier.  Clumsily picks it up and slides it through 
the top of the crate she is holding.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER (CONTINUOUS)

Laden with her heavy load, Debra nudges the door shut with her 
foot.  Then crosses to another door -- the cellar door.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Debra, silhouetted at the top of the stairs, hits a light switch; a 
naked bulb springs to life.  Slowly she descends the rickety 
staircase.

The basement, pitch dark save for a spear of sunlight shooting 
through an elevated window, is overrun with cobwebs, rusted tools 
and broken bicycle parts.  A clunker of a washing machine RATTLES in 
the corner.

Debra makes space for the crate in a storage cabinet.  Suddenly the 
washing machine stops.  Nonplissed, she moves toward it.  Lifts the 
lid.  The bed sheets inside are sopping wet.

Opening the electrical fuse box, she flicks a switch back and forth 
a few times -- but the washing machine doesn't respond.
		
		DEBRA
	Great.

Frustrated, Debra looks down to see a large puddle of water forming 
on the floor.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER (SAME)

Debra hauls a laundry basket upstairs, filled with wet sheets.  She 
turns, startled.  The front door is standing wide open.

Just as she goes to shut it, a man steps out from the living room 
behind her.  She gasps, dropping the basket; it's Loomis.
		
		LOOMIS
	I'm very sorry, Mrs. Strode.

Debra shudders at the sight of the beguiling, wide-eyed man.
		
		LOOMIS

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - DAY

The SOUND of JANGLING KEYS.  A door UNLOCKING.  Tommy scrambles in, 
the baby iin one arm, a bag of groceries under the other.

With a single swipe, he clears away the junk on his futin, then 
carefully lays down the CRYING infant.  He digs through the bag:  
Baby Wipes.  Diapers.  Formula.  Bottles.
		
		TOMMY
	Shhh.  Okay, okay, Kyle.  You like that name?  
	Yeah, I think it suits you.

Quickly he scans the directions on the formula.  Pours the liquid 
into a bottle, nukes it in the microwave, then returns to the 
business at hand.

Tommy grimaces at the mess inside his leather bomber.  The baby 
CRIES harder.

	 This is worse for me than it is for you.

Armed with Baby Wipe and a diaper, Tommy goes to work.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SAME)

Mrs. Blankenship traverses the hall outside Tommy's apartment.  The

Tommy finishes securing the diaper.  The baby in his arms, he tests 
the formula's temperature and feeds him.  The infant sucks

The other kids make way as Danny takes the empty spot on the

FOYER / LIVING ROOM

Debra drags the suitcase downstairs.  Lets out a horrified gasp.  
The crate she had previously stored in the cellar is now sitting in 
the center of the hallway ...

The axe that had been sticking out of it earlier is now missing!

The telephone RINGS.  Eyes riveted to the crate, Debra backs away 
down the hall.  Into the living room.  Picks up the phone.

A startling, intensely whispering VOICE:

Rides assembled.  Paper witches hang from broomsticks.  Goblins lurk 
behind syrofoam gravestones.

Kara waves at Beth in the distance, making last-minute 
preparations.  Student volunteers scurrying in every which 
direction.  Donning costumes.

A ducking for apples booth.  Homebaked goodies set out on picnic 
tables.  Long rows of pumpkins lined up for a jack-o'-lantern 
carving contest.

The centerpiece of all this is a huge, magnificently decorated 
HALLOWEEN TREE.  Tim and a gaggle of WORKERS stream up ladders, 
stringing lights, hoisting up colorful bunting filled with mounds of 
candy.

As Kara walks along, her hair being tossed about in the brisk WIND, 
she becomes aware of the magical, almost out of time quality that 
seems to hang in the air.

KIDS already pouring out of their homes, some accompanied by 
PARENTS, others joining groups of friends.

Kara ambles up the walk of the Myers house, shoes clapping up the 
porch steps as she digs the keys out of her overstuffed bag.

Unbolting the door, she finds that it's secured with the 
chain-lock.  Kara pushes on it, calling inside.

Nothing.  Kara moves into the foyer.  Her mother's suitcase still

A sudden CRASH from upstairs.  Kara jerks the door closed and looks

Someone sitting on the edge of Danny's bed.  A man.  His back

Kara stares at the intruder in horrified disbelief.

The man watching over Danny turns toward Kara.  It's Tommy.

	I-I'm your neighbor from across the street.  My

Panicked, Kara makes a wall of herself between Tommy and Danny.  The

Danny finally looks up, exasperated.

Her arm injected with a sedative.  Eyes lolling.  Succumbing.

JAMIE'S P.O.V. - MOVING (DREAM SEQUENCE)

Even more DISTORTED now, images swirling at random.  Cold, staring

homes wearing COSTUMES, joining a growing procession along the 
peaceful streets of Haddonfield.

A large group of PROTESTORS carry PICKET SIGNS in front of the 
campus gates.  Rallying against the celebration.

Haddonfield's finest out in full force, squad cars sweeping

Tinted windows make it impossible to see inside.

	That's what worries me.

Tim and Beth move into the fair, with all its noise and colorful 
movement.

ANOTHER ANGLE

KIDS waving signs and T-shirts.  Throwing themselves at the 
windows.  Frenzied CLAMORING.  Harry-mania abound.

The WKNB van parks parallel to the steps of the library, adorned 
with HAREM GIRLS and a large golden throne.  The side door opens.  A 
red carpet is rolled out.

A tall, imposing figure emerges from the van and walks up the 
steps.  Spurs CLANKING on black boots.  "Jesse James" style duster.  
Hat cocked slightly.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Hellllo, Haddonfield!!!

The crowd turns in a mass of confusion.  Standing above them, waving 
from a microphone, is HARRY.  Dark sunglasses.  Gaunt, glacial 
features and an outrageous mane of black hair.

Suddenly Harry throws open his duster -- flashing them -- revealing 
that he has nothing on beneath except his boots and a pair of bright 
orange boxer shorts that say "HAPPY HALLOWEEN."

The kids go insane.

ANGLE ON LOOMIS

Making his way through the teeming crowd.  Walkie-talkie in hand.  
The helicopter zooms overhead.  Wynn's voice squawks over garbled 
RADIO CHATTER.  Conducting a surveillance by air.

Suddenly Loomis is waylaid by a giant wall of a man -- Sheriff 
Holdt.  Loomis meets his fiery gaze.

	I'm warning you, Loomis -- stay out of my way.  
	You may have had free reign when Ben Meeker was 
	sheriff, God rest his soul, but I'm in charge

Carrying the CRYING baby, Tommy leads Kara and Danny into the lobby

paintings.  Wall-to-wall Tiffany lamps.

Mrs. Blankenship sits behind the front desk, oblivious to the 
GRINDING and SCREAMING on the television as "The Texas Chain Saw 
Massacre" reaches its horrific climax on the annual Horrorthon.

As usual, the senile old woman doesn't reply.

	Do you mind telling me what this is all about?

Tommy ushers Kara and Danny up the stairs.  Mrs. Blankenship stares 
at the boy -- the kind of stare that would send most kids running 
for their moms.  But Danny is undaunted.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT (CONTINUOUS)

The door opens.  Kara is repulsed by the sight of Tommy's musty, 
unkempt apartment.

	You can't expect us to stay here --

Tommy adjusts the blinds on the window looking out on the Myers 
house.
		
		TOMMY
	I want you to watch your house.  You can see 
	everything from this window.

Kara glares, reminded of last night.
		
		KARA
	Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I 
	supposed to be looking for?
		
		TOMMY
	Him.

Tommy flashes a newspaper article in front of her.  One we've seen 
eariler:  "MICHAEL MYERS - DEAD OF ALIVE?"

The baby's SCREAMS are verging on overload.  Tommy dashes to the 
recessed kitchen area and heats up another bottle.

As Kara reads, Danny tugs at his mother's blouse.
		
		DANNY
	Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun 
	stuff!

Danny plods off.  Kara hands Tommy a nipple for the bottle.  Their

	Shhh.  It's okay, Kyle.  Just give me one 
	more -- 
	   (the microwave BEEPS)
	-- second.  There you go, big guy.

Kara looks on as Tommy attempts to feed the baby.  Despite his 
clumsiness, she's undeniably moved.

Behind them, Danny's imagination kicks into high gear as he drives a 
Power Ranger over an invisible race track.  On the floor.  Across 
the windowsill.  Glancing across the street.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - THE MYERS HOUSE

Standing below on the front lawn is the Shape, silhouetted under a 
moonlit tree.  Looking right at Danny.

BACK TO SCENE

Danny backs away, terrified.  Tommy and Kara are too concerned with 
the baby to notice.
		
		TOMMY
	God, what's wrong with him?

	Here.  Let me try.

Tommy gingerly hands the baby over to her.  Instantaneously, Kyle's 
CRIES subside.

	There.  All it takes is a mother's touch.

For one fleeting moment, Tommy and Kara find themselves smiling at 
one another.  Unaware as Danny glides silently out the door.  
Tommy's expression darkens once again.  A man possessed.
		
		TOMMY
	Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know.  
	Now I'm afraid he could be next.
		
		KARA
	Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
		
		TOMMY
	Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family. 
	   (reaching toward Kyle)
	Here.  Look at this.

Tommy opens the baby's quilt, revealing the blood mark smeared over 
his torso.  Kara's face registers terrified recognition.
		
		TOMMY
	   (continuing)
	It was there when I found him this morning.  It 
	looks like some kind of letter or number or --
		
		KARA
	It's a rune ... Thorn.

INT. JAMIE'S HOSPITAL ROOM / HALLWAY - NIGHT

POLICE on the scene.  A crying NURSE gives a statement.  A CRIME 
SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER snapps photographs as Jamie's bloody corpse is 
covered over with a white sheet.

Loomis stands frozen in horror.  Tears in his eyes.
		
		LOOMIS
	Jamie ... I failed you again.  I never should 
	have left you.

He spins, pouncing on Sheriff Holdt.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (continuing)
	Now will you do something?!  How many more 
	innocent people have to die?!

Wynn restrains him.  Pulls him away.  The sheriff doesn't budge.
		
		WYNN
	Don't do this to yourself, Sam.  Let's go.  
	Come on.

Wynn ushers Loomis out of the room.  Holdt stares apathetically.

HALLWAY (CONTINUOUS)

Wynn tries to calm Loomis down.  Jamie's doctor approaches.
		
		DR. BONHAM
	Dr. Loomis?
		
		WYNN
	What is it?
		
		DR. BONHAM
	I'm very sorry ...
		
		LOOMIS
	You let it get to her.  How could you?
		
		DR. BONHAM
	Dr. Loomis, there's something else you should 
	know.  During surgery, we discovered that 
	Jamie's uterus was hemorrhaging.  We found 
	this. 
	   (displays a small vital)
	It's placental fluid.
		
		LOOMIS
	God in heaven.  You don't tell me she was --
		
		DR. BONHAM
	I estimate she gave birth no more than a few 
	hours before the attack.
		
		WYNN
	Then where's her baby?

Jamie's covered body is wheeled out past them.  Loomis regards Wynn 
with a look of abject fear.
		
		LOOMIS
	I think I may already know ...

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT (SAME)

CLOSE ON a chapter heading.  "Thorn - The Devil's Rune."  Beneath 
it, a bold depiction of the familiar Thorn triangle.

PULL BACK to REVEAL Tommy poring over the old library book.  Kara 
paces, rocking the baby, feeding him with the bottle.
		
		KARA
	Runes were a kind of early alphabet that 
	originated in Northern Europe thousands of 
	years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of 
	stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, 
	Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults 
	used them in blood rituals to portend future 
	events and invoke magic.
		
		TOMMY
	Black magic ... 
	   (reads)
	'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause 
	sickness, famine and death. Translated 
	literally, it was the name of a demon spirit 
	that delivered human sacrifices ... on the 
	Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
		
		KARA
	Halloween.
		
		TOMMY
	'When applied directly to another person, Thorn 
	could be used to call upon them confusion and 
	destruction -- to literally visit them with the 
	Devil.'

Tommy jumps up, frantically moving around the apartment, collecting 
his jacket, his keys -- a gun.
		
		KARA
	   (terrified)
	Where are you going?
		
		TOMMY
	To find the rest of your family before Michael 
	Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling 
	him.

An ominous CLICK as Tommy loads a cartridge into his gun.  He bolts 
toward the door.  Finds it standing wide open.  Kara freezes, 
noticing for the first time that Danny is missing.
		
		KARA
	Oh, God -- Where's Danny? Kara flies down the 
	hall, the baby in her arms.  Tommy moves out 
	right behind her.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY (CONTINUOUS)

Kara and Tommy barrel downstairs, searching frantically.
		
		KARA
	Danny?!  Danny!
		
		TOMMY
	Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy 
	who came in with me and --

They find Mrs. Blankenship and Danny sitting side by side, watching 
the Horrorthon.  A bowl of popcorn between them.
		
		KARA
	   (grabs him)
	Danny, don't ever walk off without telling me 
	where you're going!

Danny looks at her.  A blank, hollow stare.  The old woman's eyes 
glitter madly.
		
		MRS. BLANKENSHIP
	The voice.  He hears the voice.  Just like the 
	other little boy who used to live in that 
	house.

Tommy throws on his jacket and opens the front door.
		
		TOMMY
	Take the kids upstairs, lock the door and wait 
	for me. 
	   (beat)
	And Kara, whatever you do -- don't go back to 
	your house.

Kara watches fearfully as Tommy heads out the door.  Leaving her 
alone with the children.

EXT. HOUSES / STREET - NIGHT

Wind MOANS.  Dead leaves blow across the WINDY lane as Tommy flies 
down the path of the Blankenship house and hops into his Explorer.  
The Shape suddenly RISES INTO FRAME.  Watching him peel off down the 
block.  Taillights disappearing.

A moment later, another car rambles up the street, swerving 
erratically into the driveway of the Myers house.

The Shape watches.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

The car parks.  Sits in silence.  Suddenly the driver's side door 
opens, emblazoned with the "Strode Realty" emblem.

John spills out, collar unbuttoned, tie dangling.  Picking himself 
up, he staggers out of the garage.  Laughing.  Singing.
		
		JOHN
	... Pretty woman, walking down the street ... 
	Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

FOLLOW John's circuitous route across the front lawn, stumbling over 
one of Danny's toys on his way up the porch steps.
		
		JOHN
	Damn kid ... this is my house ...

John fumbles wth his key, estimates the location of the lock.  He 
turns the knob -- but the door's jammed.  Chain-locked.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing)
	What the fuck ... 
	   (yelling inside)
	... Debra, open this goddamn door before I 
	break it down!  You got to three ... 
	   (no response)
	... One ... Two ... 
	   (still no response)
	... Two and a half ...

John slams his weight against the door.  It doesn't budge.

Grumbling, John totters off the porch, trying to hold himself 
steady.  Skirting along the side of the house.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN (CONTINUOUS)

John sways in through the back door and flicks on a light.  Strains 
for lucidity.  No one in the kitchen.
		
		JOHN
	Debra -- I'm home!

No answer.  John shrugs and moves to the stove.  Opens the lid on a 
pasta cooker.  Nothing inside.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing; mutters)
	Work all day and not even any supper ...

Frustrated, John opens the freezer and removes a frozen dinner.  
Tears open the box and pops it in the microwave.  Then he flounders 
down the dark alley, knocking picture frames awry.

LIVING ROOM / FOYER

Darkness, save for a glowing jack-o'-lantern.  John stands there, 
listing.  Bewildered.

Then he switches on a lamp, kicks off his shoes and crashes onto his 
lumpy old recliner.
		
		JOHN
	All right ... You can all come out now ...

Still no reply.  John sneers, flicks on the television with the 
remote control and settles back into his chair.

INSERT - TELEVISION

A scene from another horror movie.  A boy shreds his pumpkin mask as 
a mass of beetles and snakes pour out of his skull.

BACK TO SCENE
		
		JOHN
	What is this shit?

Disgusted, he switches channels to the local NEWS.  A shrill BEEP 
from the kitchen startles him.  The microwave.

KITCHEN

John waddles to a drawer and removes a set of utensils.  Then he 
reaches for the microwave, opens it.  But his dinner is gone.

Spinning around, he sees the piping hot entree already sitting out 
on the kitchen table.  John double-takes, mentally retracing his 
steps.  Shrugs.

FOLLOW JOHN

as he picks up his tray and plods back down the hall.  Suddenly he 
trips over something -- the suitcase Debra had packed earlier, 
sitting smack-dead in the center of the hall.
		
		JOHN
	So this is the game you wanna play. Fine.  Go 
	ahead.  Keep it up all night ...

LIVING ROOM

John settles back into his chair and begins to eat ravenously.  
SCREAMS from the television.  He reacts.

INSERT - TELEVISION

Someone has switched it back to the horror movie.  A 
COMPUTER-GENERATED PUMPKIN causes more masked heads to EXPLODE.

BACK TO SCENE

John shakes the remote.  Out of the corner of his eye, he catches a 
shadowy figure darting by in the darkened foyer.
		
		JOHN
	Is that you, you little brat?  Danny?!

John rises, about to go for him when suddenly the power cuts out -- 
and the entire house is plunged into blackness.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing)
	When I get my hands on you, kid, you're gonna 
	wish you were never born!

John pulls a rechargeable flashlight from the wall and goes to the 
cellar door.  It stands open.  An invitation to enter.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing)
	Oh, I'm scared.  I'm really scared.

With that, John steps down into the basement.

INT. CELLAR (CONTINUOUS)

John tentatively descends the stairs.  Barefoot.  The flashlight 
beam preceding his every step.  A RUMBLING below.

The cellar is lit only by a shaft of moonlight cutting through the 
single dusty window.  John probes around, shining the flashlight 
over cobwebs, boxes -- the puddle of water at his feet.  Now 
flooding the entire floor.

John SLOSHES through the water toward the washing machine -- which 
is running at full tact.
		
		JOHN
	What the hell --

He opens the washer lid and lifts out a water-logged sheet.  It 
drips red onto the white appliance -- blood.

John backs away, loses his footing, and slips in the water -- 
landing right at the Shape's feet.  John SCREAMS as the Shape grabs 
him by the neck, lifts him off the floor with one hand, then carries 
him across the basement and SLAMS him brutally against the open fuse 
box.

The Shape's free hand lifts an enormous butcher knife.  A loud WHAP 
as it's driven to the hilt into John's chest, through the fuse box.  
Sparks wain from the wall.  Electricity courses through John's 
writing body.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE (SAME)

Lights flash on and off in the windows.  Suddenly the entire house 
is plunged into darkness.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR (SAME)

John's toes curl.  The skin around where the knife penetrates 
FRIES.  The Shape steps back, head tilted, BREATHING steadily, 
curiously observing John's hanging, lifeless body.

EXT. HARVEST FAIR - NIGHT

Tommy grabs the ticket he's just paid for, hands it to an ATTENDANT 
and moves through the turnstiles amid a steady stream of REVELLERS.

Loud MUSIC, the aroma of apple cider and pumpkin pie fills the air.  
Boots selling food and crafts.  Children carving jack-o'-lanterns.  
Parents beaming with pride.

Trendy co-eds playing games.  Ducking for apples.  Shooting 
pumpkin-faced balloons with water pistols.

EXT. LIBRARY STEPS

Tim and Beth sit on either side of Harry as he interviews them 
during a live BROADCAST.  A large crowd gathered below.
		
		HARRY SIMMS
	   (into mike)
	I'm here with Tim and Beth -- the organizers of 
	tonight's event.  How does it feel knowing 
	you've finally pulled Halloween out of the 
	closet?
		
		TIM
	   (into mike)
	Yo, Harry, it's great!  And having you here 
	with us is dope.  Totally raw. You're the 
	ultimate juice!
		
		HARRY SIMMS
	I'll remember that the next time my wife tells 
	me I didn't make her climax.
		
		BETH
	   (impassioned)
	What Tim means is that we've taken a firm stand 
	against censorship.  Not only for Haddonfield, 
	but for every town in the nation.  Our 
	generation will not let the powers-that-be 
	control our minds, dictate what clothes we 
	wear, what music we listen to, or what holidays 
	we celebrate.

Beth's rousing speech is met by gales of enthusiastic CHEERS.
		
		HARRY
	   (off-handedly)
	Have you ever considered running for public 
	office?

EXT. HADDONFIELD STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

The distant SOUNDS of the celebration are carried on the wings of 
the WIND.  Howling through dark, empty streets.  Rows of deserted 
houses.  Not a soul in sight.  Preternatural stillness.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - NIGHT

Kara looks nervously out a window, then walks into the parlor where 
she finds Danny sitting in the dark, glued to the Horrorthon.  
Flames CRACKLE in the fireplace, casting weird shadows.

Mrs. Blankenship sits in a wooden rocker, cradling the infant, 
humming a lullaby.

If we look closely enough, behind her in the window we can see the 
hazy shadow of the Shape looking in.
		
		KARA
	Mrs. Blankenship, what did you mean about the 
	little boy who used to live across the street?

The old woman doesn't seem to hear her.  Lost in her own world.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing; insistent)
	Mrs. Blankenship, please.  This is important!

Mrs. Blankenship looks up sharply, startling Kara.
		
		MRS. BLANKENSHIP
	He heard the voice.  Same as your boy hears.
		
		KARA
	What voice?  What are you talking about?
		
		MRS. BLANKENSHIP
	The voice that spoke to Michael Myers. The one 
	that told him to kill his family.

Kara stares at her, numbed.  She gazes over at Danny, his eyes 
riveted  -- not to the TV screen.  Looking past it.  Across the 
street at the Myers house.  The haunting VOICE whispers to him.
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
	I'm coming for you, Danny ... I'm coming.

EXT. HARVEST FAIR - NIGHT

Tim and Beth ride high atop the Ferris wheel.  Their smiling faces 
aglow in a dizzying whirlwind of LIGHTS.  DARK CLOUDS are gathering 
in the sky, covering the moon and stars.  A light RAIN begins to 
fall.

ANGLE ON TOMMY

Walking, searching, hunting.  Past a large tent where children are 
gathering.  A sign reads:  COSTUME PAGEANT.

Tommy reacts to a terrified SCREAM.  Just a couple of teenage BOYS 
pulling an innocuously fightened GIRL onto another ride.

THE STRANGER

walks steadily past the bright lights of the Ferris wheel.

TOMMY

pushes through a dense crowd.  Suddenly he bumps shoulders with the 
Stranger.  More people pass.  There was something very sinister 
about that man.

Tommy turns to look again, eyes widening in terror.

TOMMY'S P.O.V. - STRANGER'S WRIST

Branded with the mark of Thorn!

TOMMY

removes his gun.  Flows through the crowd like a vengeful wraith.

People see the gun in his hand and back away.  Tommy surges 
forward.  The Stranger walks faster.  Gaining ground.  Toward the 
Halloween tree.

WORKERS hauling wheelbarrows loaded with jack-o'-lanterns cross his 
path.  Tommy stumbles, pumpkins spilling out all around him.

The Stranger is getting away!  Tommy picks himself up, raises the 
gun and begins FIRING shots into the air.  People SCREAM, scattering 
like insects, ducking for cover.
		
		TOMMY
	Stop that man!  Stop him!!!

Tommy races through the horrified crowd.  The Stranger keeps moving, 
never once looking back.

Suddenly SIRENS.  Squad cars converge.  Sheriff Holdt and a slew of 
OFFICERS surround Tommy.  Weapons trained.
		
		HOLDT
	Throw down the gun!  Now!!!

Tommy drops the gun.  Puts his arms up in surrender.  The cops swarm 
in, taking him.
		
		TOMMY
	Stop that man!  He's the one!

ANGLE ON FERRIS WHEEL

Beth and Tim exit the ride and follow the crowd toward the flashing 
LIGHTS of the police cruisers.
		
		TIM
	Who's gettin' busted?

Beth is stunned to see Tommy being searched spread-eagle over the 
sheriff's car.
		
		BETH
	Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
		
		TIM
	Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my 
	sister?
		
		BETH
	   (worried)
	Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd 
	better go home and check on them. There's 
	nothing else for us to do here.
		
		TIM
	But they're gonna light the tree in a few 
	minutes --
		
		BETH
	   (suggestively)
	We can light our own tree at home.

She brushes against Tim's crotch and saunters away.  Tim glances 
back at Tommy, then follows her like a hungry puppy.

	Mikey Myers from across the street.  That's 
	when the voice told him what to do.  Same as 
	his great- grandfather.
		
		KARA
	His what?!
		
		MRS. BLANKENSHIP
	Eighteen-ninety-five.  A hundred years ago to 
	this night.  All Hallows Eve. Murdered his 
	family in that very same house.  Then the 
	townspeople burned him alive.  Our mother 
	always told us when we were children, 'Don't go 
	near the Myers house.'  We never did.

The Stranger glides unnoticed among a large crowd gathered for the 
lighting of the Halloween tree.  People putting up umbrellas.  A 
STORM fast approaching.

Hundreds of anxious kids stand beneath the oak tree with open bags 
and pillow cases, waiting for the candy to drop on them.

STALKING P.O.V

MOVING behind the tree where a long-haired figure stands in the 
darkness.  Waiting to make a presentation.

HARRY

turns, sensing a presence.  A knife shoots out of the darkness, 
jabbing him right between the legs.

TOMMY

is shoved into the back of the squad car.  Suddenly Loomis appears.  
Prevailing upon the sheriff.
		
		LOOMIS
	Wait!  This boy is being placed in my custody.

Tommy looks out, stunned.
		
		HOLDT
	What are you trying to pull now, Loomis?
		
		LOOMIS
	Uncuff him!  This is a matter of life or death.
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

HARRY

The knife is lifted straight up, splitting his torso in two, eyes 
bugging with shock.  He slumps to the ground in a huge pool of 
blood.
			
			     CUT BACK TO:

TOMMY AND LOOMIS

The sheriff uncuffs Tommy and shoves him out of the car.
		
		HOLDT
	You'd better as fuck have an explanation for 
	this, Doctor.

Loomis begins to usher Tommy through the gaping crowd.
		
		TOMMY
	Dr. Loomis, there's something you should 
	know --

Tommy is prodded forward by Loomis's .357.
		
		LOOMIS
	I know enough already.  Just shut your mouth 
	and take me to that baby.

They move swiftly through the gaping crowd.

ANGLE ON TREE

A growing murmur of concern spreads.  "Where's Harry?"  The children are 
becoming impatient, and the impending STORM isn't doing much to calm 
anyone's nerves.  Harry's people are at a loss to explain their star's 
whereabouts.

ANGLE ON LOOMIS AND TOMMY

On the fringes of the crowd.  Walking away.

"Oohs" and "ahhs" as the tree suddenly comes to life with thousands of 
orange lights.  From the boughs of the tree, ropes are pulled.  Bunting 
tears open, dropping hails of CANDY on the SHRIEKING kids.

Tommy glances back.  His eyes drawn to something.  Grotesque and misshapen.  In the 
tree.
		
		TOMMY
	Oh my God --

ANGLE ON TREE

Kids of all ages scurry around the stage, laughing and screaming as a 
rainbow of candy RAINS down on them.  Diving for it.  Fighting over it.  
Scooping it up in big handfuls.

ANGLE ON TOMMY AND LOOMIS

Tommy instantly breaks away and tears back through the crowd.
		
		LOOMIS
	Tommy!

Loomis goes for him.  Sheriff Holdt sees what is happening and 
flies toward them in pursuit.

ANGLE ON TREE

A BALLERINA looks down at her white pillow case in horrified 
astonishment.  Her hands painted red as she reaches inside.  All 
of her candy is covered with blood!

The other kids back away in revulsion -- the entire stage begins 
to drip with blood!

The adults don't seem to notice what is happening, more concerned 
with the sudden burst of POURING RAIN.

Tommy pushes his way through the crowd, SCREAMING.
		
		TOMMY
	Get them out of there!  Get out!!!

Sheriff Holdt tries to intercept Tommy just as he leaps up onto 
the stage, pushing kids out of the way.

Parents' faces register shock when they see their children running 
toward them, SCREAMING hysterically, soaked with blood.

Loomis sees what Tommy sees.  Words cannot convey the horror in his 
eyes.

Just then, a BOLT OF LIGHTNING ignites the tree.  SPARKS flash.  
Tiny pumpkin lights EXPLODE in a startling chain reaction.

Tommy helps the last of the kids off the stage when something falls 
from the gnarled branches:  a dangling, rotating, wrapped-up thing.  
The mutilated remains of Harry Simms!

Horrified, Tommy dashes headlong off the stage.  Runs with Loomis 
with the trampling crowd.

Struck dumb with terror, Holdt looks out upon the mass destruction.  
The bloody corpse hanging from the tree.  People running, SCREAMING, 
carrying their children toward the exits.

EXT. CAMPUS PARKING LOT (SAME)

Bumper to bumper cars.  Horns BLARING.  Women SCREAMING.  Men SHOUTING.  
Children CRYING.  Pandemonium.

Loomis and Tommy appear out of this jumble of confusion.  More people 
running along the sidewalks.
		
		TOMMY
	Oh, God -- Kara!!!

A car SCREECHES to a halt as Tommy barrels across the street.  Loomis 
right behind him.  Running toward home.

Once again, terror reigns in Haddonfield, Illinois.

KARA'S P.O.V. - THE MYERS HOUSE

Dark and foreboding.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  Beth's car parked in 
front.

ANGLE ON KARA

She stares at the car, puzzled.  Quickly she moves away from the 
window, heads out the door.

HALLWAY

She KNOCKS loudly on the door across the hall.  A sign that reads:  
"Beth's Place."
		
		KARA
	Beth, are you in there?

She knocks again.  No response.  Another CLAP OF THUNDER.  Kara 
shudders, quickly returns to Tommy's apartment and locks the door.

Tim nuzzles his face in Beth's chest.  She's feeling apprehensive.

	What if your parents come home?

	Then they can watch.

Laughing, they heard up the stairs, kissing, fondling each other.  
Slowly we PULL BACK into the foyer.  THUNDER and LIGHTNING CLASH, 
revealing the Shape, knife held at ready.  Watching.

	Answer what?
		
		BETH
	   (fends him off)
	What if it's Kara?

Frustrated, Tim jumps off the bed and stomps into the bathroom, 
taking a candle with him.

	Fine.  You answer it.  I'll make friends with my soap on a

Tim slams the door.  Beth deliberates her move, then goes to pick

BATHROOM - SHOWER (CONTINUOUS)

A lighted candle flickers.  Tim waits for the running shower to 
warm up as he does a bare-ass jig over to the sink.

Rinsing off his tooth brush, he elbows out a circle of steam from 
the mirror.  He gasps.  The Shape is standing right behind him!

Before he can react, Tim's head is yanked backwards.  The chilling 
SNAP of his neck is punctuated by a CRASH OF THUNDER.

Kara's mouth suddenly drops open.  Her mind snaps into sensory overload.  
She can see the Shape walking up behind Beth!  Raising a gleaming 
butcher knife!
		
		KARA
	Beth, look out!  There's someone in the room!  He's right 
	behind you!

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM

Beth drops the phone, eyes bulging as the Shape plunges the knife 
into her back.  She falls, CRASHING against the vanity.

Beth SCREAMS unholy terror.  But the Shape isn't through.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara stands frozen in pure horror, hearing and seeing her friend's 
vicious murder.

Her eyes shoot down.  A little blond-haired boy is walking steadily 
across the street toward the Myers house.

No, it can't be true.  Kara wheels around.  Danny is gone.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW

Danny can be seen below walking toward the house as Beth's 
blood-gurgling SCREAMS fill the room.  The knife repeatedly, 
mercilessly SLASHING down at her.

EXT. STREET / MYERS HOUSE - NIGHT

Kara bolts out of the Blankenship house and races across the street, 
chasing after Danny through RAIN and LIGHTNING.
		
		KARA
	Danny, no!!!

KARA'S P.O.V. - FOLLOWING DANNY

He glides up the porch steps and slips through the front door of the 
Myers house.  Disappearing inside.

KARA

shoots across the lawn.  Up the porch steps.  Right behind him.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER

Kara dives through the front door.  THUNDER shatters the house.  
Everything is frighteningly dark.  Shockingly quiet.

Inch by inch, she makes her way inside.  Eyes wide.  Savage.  
Shaking uncontrollably.  A CRASHING SOUND behind her.  She jumps out 
of her skin.  Just the door SLAMMING shut in the WIND.
		
		KARA
	   (the faintest whisper)
	Danny?

She advances into the hall.  Old floorboards CREAK beneath her feet.  
SOUNDS up ahead.  FOOTSTEPS.

Kara looks up.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  Danny is nearing the top of the 
stairs!

Instinct propels her up the stairs after him.  Then suddenly she stops 
dead.  Reason taking over.  And she turns back.

Picks up a fireplace poker sitting in the corner.  Then she heads back 
up the stairs.  Mind-blown with horror.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Kara reaches the top of the staircase, looking down the dark hallway.  
Summoning all of her courage, she moves forward.

Suddenly Danny darts out from the adjacent hall and disappears inside 
his bedroom -- a fleeting, ghostly image.  Kara startles.  Follows him 
inside.

DANNY'S BEDROOM

Danny stands in a corner.  LIGHTNING illuminates his toy dinosaurs.  
Kara goes to him, takes his hand.  He resists her.
		
		KARA
	   (intense whisper)
	Come on ... Danny, please.

She picks him up, carries him toward the door.  LUMBERING FOOTSTEPS.  
Kara stands paralyzed in the doorway as the Shape stalks down the hall.  
Eyes probing.  Walking right past them.

DANNY'S BEDROOM

Kara slips silently back into the room, carrying Danny through the 
bathroom.  Adjoining on the opposite side into

KARA'S ROOM

LIGHTNING CRACKLES.  The walls are covered with blood.  Kara stumbles 
over something on the floor.  Cranes her neck to look down.

Beth's bloody, mangled remains at her feet.

Shock waves send Kara reeling backwards against the open bathroom door.  
Hanging on a hook is Tim's naked body, eyes open, staring at her in a 
horrified rictus of death.

Kara SCREAMS.  Drops Danny.  Quickly covers her mouth.  Realizing that 
she's given them away.

Suddenly the bedroom door tears open, buckling off its hinges.  The 
Shape bulldozes in, wielding its huge butcher knife!
		
		KARA
	Danny, run!!!

Danny ducks into the hall, evading the Shape's lurching hands.

DANNY

careens down the stairs.  THUNDER RAGES.

KARA

brandishes the fireplace poker at the killer.  The Shape moves in, 
backing her through the bathroom ... into Danny's room.  Suddenly 
she SLAMS the door on the Shape.

Kara tears off into the hallway.  Turns.  Waiting for the Shape to 
appear.  It doesn't.

Kara vacillates down the hall.  Jumping at every sound.  Training her 
weapon at things unseen.  SLAMMING doors along the way, sealing off 
every passageway as she tries to find her way through the impenetrable 
dark tunnel.

Suddenly something CRASHES down from above.  Kara's mother, strung up on 
a bloody sheet, dangling upside-down from the trap door in the ceiling! 
The axe still protruding from her chest.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Kara SCREAMS, shrinking away from the gruesome sight, faltering through 
the blackened doorway behind her.  An unbearable moment of tension as we 
think the Shape's mask will be there.

Suddenly the Shape shoots up directly in front of her!  Tearing the 
dangling corpse from the sheet, dislodging the axe from Debra's chest 
with a repulsive SQUISH.

Kara wheels toward the stairs.  The Shape advances.  Swings the axe.  
Misses her by inches.  Kara ducks, lurches behind the Shape.  Swings 
the fireplace poker with everything she's got.  CRACKING it full-force 
over the back of the Shape's head.

The Shape breaks through the banister and plunges off the landing, 
SLAMMING hard onto the floor below.

Terrified, Kara chances a look down.  The Shape doesn't move.

EXT. STREET / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - NIGHT (SAME)

Tommy's Explorer skids to a stop outside the boarding house.  Loomis and 
Tommy fly up the front path.  Tommy glances back at the blackened Myers 
house for a moment, then follows Loomis inside.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY (SAME)

Kara barrels off the stairs.  Moves cautiously past the Shape.  Sprawled 
face-up in the middle of the hall.

LIVING ROOM

Kara searches for Danny, keeping her eyes trained on the Shape.  The 
little boy appears in the doorway directly across the hall.

The Shape lying in between them.
		
		KARA
	Danny, come to Mommy.

Danny shakes his head.  Too frightened to move.

HALLWAY / FOYER

Ever so slowly, Kara moves toward the threshold.  Hefting the fireplace 
poker, she steps right over the Shape.

Instantly she snatches Danny up in her arms.  Takes one step forward when 
suddenly --
		
		DANNY
	Mommy!!!

The Shape springs up, twisting Kara's ankle.  She falls, splaying forward.  
The Shape claws at her leg.  Kara fights back, kicking herself free of the 
vice-like grip.

Scrambling to her feet, Kara rockets Danny through the foyer to the front 
door -- desperately trying to escape from this real-life house of horrors 
-- only to find that it is locked.

The Shape rises, gleaming butcher knife in hand.

Kara twists the deadbolt, but someone's secured the chain lock!  Too late 
to remove it.  The Shape is right behind them.

Only one way to go.  The cellar.  Kara shoves Danny through.

INT. CELLAR (CONTINUOUS)

Kara and Danny clatter down the rickety stairs and SPLASH across the flooded 
basement floor.

A soul-shuddering POUNDING on the door above.

Kara ushers Danny toward the elevated window.

The cellar door EXPLODES, the Shape's hand breaking through, splintering 
the wood as if it were paper.

Kara HEARS the Shape moving rapidly down the stairs.  Lifts Danny up the 
wall toward the window.  But it's not a wall -- it's John's electrocuted 
body, propped inside a storage cabinet!

Danny SHRIEKS, staring into John's lifeless eyes.  Kara pushes him up.  
Danny reaches for the lock.  Just an inch away.

Kara can't lift him any higher.  The Shape is coming!

Danny hoists himself up just enough to twist the lock.  He pushes the 
window open and clambers outside.

Kara scrambles up old pressboard shelves.  They break under her weight; 
she topples back to the floor.

The Shape wades toward her.  Reaching up for the window.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - BASEMENT WINDOW

Danny watches his mother struggle to climb out of the crypt.
		
		KARA
	Danny, help me!

Kara's hand reaches toward him.  Danny makes no movement.
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
	Come to me, Danny ... Come to me.

Danny obediently turns and starts to walk away.
		
		KARA
	Danny!!!

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR

Kara's foot falls on the handle of the knife jutting from her father's 
chest.  Uses it to springboard herself half-way through the window.  
Clawing at wet grass.

The Shape's hand shoots out of the darkness below, grabbing at her legs.  
Kara writhes, kicking and SCREAMING.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR WINDOW

Kara grabs chunks of mud as she is pulled back through the window.  The 
Shape yanks hard.  Kara catches herself on the window frame.  Quickly 
losing her grip.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR

The knife swipes downward, swiping her ankle.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR WINDOW

Kara reacts to the searing pain, releasing her grip on the window frame.  
Suddenly Danny appears, locking onto her collar, pulling her clear in one 
massive heave.

Kara shuffles across the ground and picks herself up.  Grabs Danny's hand 
and runs full-tilt around the side of the house.

EXT. STREET / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE

CAMERA FOLLOWS their frenzied flight across the street.  Past Tommy's 
Explorer.  Kara limping.  Danny surging toward the Blankenship house.  Kara 
SCREAMS, pounding frantically on the door.
		
		KARA
	Please!  Open the door!

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Tommy and Loomis have turned the apartment upside-down.
		
		TOMMY
	The baby -- where's the baby?!

Suddenly they HEAR Kara's frantic pleas outside.  Tommy bolts out the door.
Loomis right behind him.

EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

Kara POUNDS furiously.
		
		KARA
	Please!  Somebody help us!

Danny huddles beside her, peering out across the street.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - MYERS HOUSE

The Shape trudges boldly down the porch steps -- knife in hand!

BACK TO SCENE

Kara sees the Shape -- walking slowly and deliberately toward them.  Her 
SCREAMS become even more intense.
		
		KARA
	Help us please!!!

The Shape closes in.  At the last second, Tommy throws open the door.  Kara 
and Danny tumble inside.  Into his arms.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY / PARLOR (CONTINUOUS)

Loomis slams and deadbolts the door.
		
		LOOMIS
	Get them upstairs.  Now!

Kara pounds against Tommy's chest.  Hysterical.
		
		KARA
	Where's the baby?!
		
		TOMMY
	He's gone.

Kara holds Danny close to her side, backing away in horror as Tommy and 
Loomis go around the parlor, securing the doors and windows.  THUNDER RIPS 
through the darkened room.
		
		TOMMY
	   (continuing)
	Who else knew I had the baby?!
		
		LOOMIS
	No one.
		
		TOMMY
	No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
		
		LOOMIS
	Only me -- 
	   (dark realization)
	-- and Dr. Wynn.

Suddenly the window behind Kara EXPLODES.  She SCREAMS, recoiling.  Then 
the window in front of her.  HANDS reach through.  Tommy shoves her out of 
the way.

ANOTHER HAND shoots through the stained glass window in the front door, 
twists open the lock.

Danny races across the lobby and up the stairs.

Robed figures fill the doorways.  Climbing through windows.  Moving inside 
the house.  Surrounding Loomis.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (continuing)
	Wynn!!!

The robed figures descend on Loomis.  Drops his .357.  Tommy lurches for it, 
to no avail.  Loomis's SCREAM fills the darkness like a fever dream.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (continuing)
	Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
		
		TOMMY
	No!!!

Tommy backpedals up the stairs.  Kara pulling him along as the cloaked 
figures glow toward them.  Daggers raised.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Kara reacts to the SOUND of Danny's VOICE.
		
		DANNY
	Mommy!  Please help me!

Kara rushes through darkness to find him.
		
		KARA
	Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
		
		TOMMY
	Kara, no!

Kara trips and falls.  A pair of silver-tipped black boots planted in 
bold stance.  Slowly she looks up the long duster, the cigarette in the 
gloved hand of the nefarious Stranger -- Dr. Wynn!  Danny stands by his 
side, staring dispassionately.
		
		KARA
	Danny, no ... please ...

Kara picks herself up, shaking her head in unmitigated fear, staggering 
back down the hallway.

She turns to see the black figures overtaking Tommy.  His SCREAMS 
swallowed by hollow darkness.

Alone, Kara careens through another doorway into

TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara slams the door, turns in desperate circles.

Stepping out from behind the door is Mrs. Blankenship -- the baby bundled 
in her arms!
		
		KARA
	Mrs. Blankenship -- Oh, God -- Hurry. We have to --

As Kara reaches for the baby, the old woman raises a dagger.  Her eyes 
burning.  Her wrist branded with the mark of Thorn!

Kara SCREAMS.  The old woman opens the door, allowing the figures to 
enter the room.  Daggers drawn.  CHANTING a dark invocation.

The coven forces Kara backwards.  Nowhere to run.  Nowhere to hide.

Suddenly Kara makes a decision -- and takes a running leap toward the 
window!

EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

Defenestrating herself, Kara SCREAMS, tumbling through the air, bouncing 
off the porch overhang before plunging to the front lawn below.  A 
thousand grass fragments raining down on her.

KARA

lies on her back, eyes close, hands folded over her chest in silent 
repose.  She doesn't move.

THE HOUSE

is still.  Unearthly silence fills the cold October night.
			
			     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

KARA'S P.O.V. - DISTORTED - INT. TUNNELS

A ring of faceless figures move in, completely surrounding her.

Suddenly the feeling of RAPID MOVEMENT.  Glowing torchlight flickers 
across dank walls.

KARA

is being pushed forward on a gurney.  Strapped down.  SCREAMING for God's 
mercy.

TOMMY

is wheeled through another tunnel.  His face a mass of bloody cuts and 
bruises.  His eyes glazed over, trying to find focus.  SLAMMING into 
darkness.

EXT. SANITARIUM - NIGHT

LIGHTNING illuminates the cold, forbidding asylum.  The white van pulls up 
to the security gate.  Headlights illuminate the sign:  "SMITH'S GROVE - 
WARREN COUNTY SANITARIUM."

The main gate cranks open.  The van pulls through.

THE VAN

pulls to a stop near the main building.  The door slides open and Danny 
steps out, surrounded by Smith's Grove staff wearing white jackets.  
Leading him toward the entrance.

LANDING FIELD

The helicopter touches down.  Wynn ducks out, moving in long, even strides 
toward the building.

INT. SANITARIUM CORRIDOR - NIGHT

FOLLOW Wynn through the series of security cages, using his key card to 
BUZZ through.  White coats bringing up the rear.

Through tall mahogany doors, they cross purposefully into the adjacent wing.

EXECUTIVE RECEPTION AREA

Dawn, Wynn's efficient secretary, rises with a congenial smile.
		
		DAWN
	Good evening, Dr. Wynn.  Your -- appointment is waiting 
	inside.

Wynn picks up his messages, then heads straight into the office.  Dawn 
resumes her typing.  Something eerie in her grin.

INT. WYNN'S OFFICE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Wynn and his staff file inside.  Removing his hat and duster, he walks over 
to where Loomis is seated -- shackled to a chair, a bloody slash across 
his forehead.

Seeing this, Wynn snaps angrily at two burly GUARDS.
		
		WYNN
	What is this all about?  Remove those!

The guards comply.  Loomis rubs his aching wrists, glowering.
		
		LOOMIS
	Where's the child?
		
		WYNN
	Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday 
	happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. 
	Somehow I knew you still had it in you.

Loomis sees his .357 resting atop Wynn's desk -- only inches away.  Wynn's 
hand covers it, slips it inside the top drawer.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know 
	how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your 
	upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I 
	felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth. 
	   (gestures to his staff)
	After all, you're the only one around here who's still in 
	the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell 
	you, but you've really given me no other choice.
		
		LOOMIS
	This is madness, Wynn.
		
		WYNN
	Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way 
	things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by 
	your own reality to see. 
	   (beat)
	But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in 
	many ways. 
	   (smiles)
	You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog.  
	Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his 
	work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last 
	time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible 
	time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
		
		LOOMIS
	It was you.
		
		WYNN
	   (lights a cigarette)
	Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
		
		LOOMIS
	Why did you take Jamie?
		
		WYNN
	She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her 
	veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I 
	incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has 
	served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
		
		LOOMIS
	Jamie's baby ...
		
		WYNN
	There you go trying to make sense again. 
	   (grimly entranced)
	It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations.  
	As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
		
		LOOMIS
	Samhain.
		
		WYNN
	And I'm its deliverer. 
	   (slams his key card on the desk)
	Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it.  
	Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.

Loomis shudders, rocked by these revelations.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	I know you have more questions, my friend, and there's so 
	much more for you to try to make sense of.

Loomis is hoisted out of his chair and led out of the office.  Wynn and 
his white coats flow out behind him.

INT. CELL - NIGHT

A tight, damp, claustrophobic space.  Tommy is strapped upright to a crude 
metal rack, not unlike the one Jamie was bound to the night before.

Feverishly he rubs his wrists against a jagged metal edge, cutting through 
skin, wearing away his bonds.  Breaking through.

INT. TUNNELS - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

A group of white coats, led by Wynn, usher Loomis off an old service 
elevator, leading him through the dark passageway.  Wynn turns around, 
surveying the tunnel.  As he walks on, we SEE something fall from his back 
pocket.

As they disappear down another tunnel, a wooden door slowly CREAKS open.  
Tommy appears, cautiously stepping out into the catacombs.  Edging along 
the dank, torch-lit walls.  WIND MOANS.  Rats scamper past his feet.

Wynn has dropped his security key card.  Tommy swipes it.

INT. CATWALK (SAME)

Loomis is led across a narrow precipice overlooking a filthy prison cell.  
The Shape lies inside.  Dormant.

Wynn stares down hypnotically at his most prized possession.  Michael Myers.
		
		WYNN
	Look at him.  So silent, yet so deadly. He moves when I 
	tell him to.  Act on my impulses.  Feels what I feel.

Wynn demonstrates.  Loomis looks on, spellbound.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Michael -- Rise.

Below, the Shape slowly rises.  Wynn takes out his trusted switchblade.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Michael -- Pain.

Wynn cuts his hand.  The Shape grabs his own hand in agony.  Wynn smiles, 
sucking the bleeding gash.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Michael -- Kill.

Suddenly Wynn whirls around, throwing Dawn -- his faithful secretary -- 
inside the Shape's pit.  Wynn watches with hideous delight as her horrified 
SCREAMS trail away into blood-gurgling SILENCE.

Loomis closes his eyes in anguish.
		
		LOOMIS
	You've created a monster.
		
		WYNN
	Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.

Wynn carries on without remorse.  Loomis is brutally shoved forward.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	We're not the only ones, you know. There are many 
	believers -- generous contributors to our church.  You'd be 
	amazed to know how far it reaches.

INT. CATACOMBS - STORAGE BUNKER

A metal door BUZZES open.  Tommy makes his way furtively inside, 
pocketing the key card.

A storage room filled with sawdust and wooden crates.  Tommy pries one of 
them open.  Eyes widening in startled disbelief.

A small arsenal of automatic rifles and ammunition inside.
		
		TOMMY
	Holy shit ...

Tommy lifts a rifle, awed by its devastating lines, then slams in a 
cartridge and bolts out the door.  Back into the tunnels.

INT. CEREMONIAL ROOM - NIGHT

A large, amber-hued chamber.  The CHANTING coven forms a circle around a 
primitive stone altar where Kara is tied down, wearing a white gown, her 
head adorned with a wreath of mistletoe.

A wooden symbol of Thorn, like an inverted crucifix, hangs in a place of 
reverence.

Behind the altar, the Shape stands in its cell.  Waiting.

Loomis is led inside.  Wynn glides through this macabre gathering, up to 
the altar.  Looming over the terrified Kara.

The CHANTING continues as Wynn dons a magnificent ceremonial robe.  At 
Wynn's gesture, there is SILENCE.  The worshippers offer an obedient 
response, removing their hoods, baring the mark of Thorn on their wrists.

We recognize many of the faces in the congregation.  Wynn's staff.  Dr. 
Bonham.  Mrs. Blankenship.  The cross-eyed attendant from the bus depot.  
People from all walks of life.

Faces glazed with sadistic rapture.
		
		WYNN
	   (prophetically)
	Behind, Disciples of Thorn!  The final sign!  The birth of 
	the heretic child, delivered unto us on the eve of our 
	great Feast of the Sun ... as I have foreseen it.

Jamie's baby is carried forth, CRYING as it is lain inside a baptismal urn 
beside Kara.  Ringed by candles and a circle of stones -- eleven in all -- 
etched with symbolic runes.

INT. TUNNELS

Letting the rifle guide him, Tommy makes his way through the tunnels.  
Toward the sound of MUFFLED CHANTING up ahead.

CEREMONIAL ROOM

The coven CHANTS its invocation.  Wynn draws a magic circle around the 
infant with blood from a silver chalice.  Then he inscribes a pentagram in 
the air with an ornate dagger.
		
		WYNN
	Spirits and powers of the flame, attend and witness this 
	ritual.  Bear our gifts to Thorn.  Open us to the path of 
	Darkness.  By these runes transform us. Open our eyes and 
	show us the Chosen One to whom we offer this sacrifice of 
	Innocent Blood.

Suddenly Danny is issued forth up to the altar.  His eyes dark, lifeless 
pools.  Kara struggles against her bonds.
		
		KARA
	Danny!!!

Loomis lurches forward.  Halted by massive, restraining hands.

CATWALK

Tommy moves cautiously along the narrow wooden lip, looking down upon the 
evil ritual.  Startled by the SOUND of rusted chains.  Pulleys CRANKING.  
The Shape's cell being opened.

CEREMONIAL ROOM

The Shape emerges from its cell and slowly walks forward.  Strangely calm.  
Hypnotized.  Looming above Kara.  She lets out a SCREAM of unbridled terror 
as he raises a gleaming dagger.

Wynn stands behind Danny.  Places the dagger in his hand and holds it aloft.
Above the baby.
		
		WYNN
	Strong and fierce Thorn, Thundered, by thy hammer we summon 
	thee and offer this sacrifice of innocent blood.  Let thy 
	Darkness descend on your son. Danny.  Lord of the Dead.

Danny drifts into the dark spell, holding the dagger above the SCREAMING 
infant.  Wynn speaks in the ominous WHISPERING VOICE:
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Kill for him, Danny ... Kill for him.

Kara cries, appealing to the boy inside of Michael.
		
		KARA
	Michael, please.  You can make him stop.  You remember, 
	don't you?

The Shape stares hard at her through the sockets of its mask.  Listening.  
Reminded of his mother.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing)
	Remember what he did to you that night. What his voice told 
	you to do.  You can stop it, Michael.  Stop the voice 
	forever.

Danny's eyes flash like fire.  The CHANTING is insidious.
		
		WYNN
	Kill him, Danny.  Kill him!
		
		KARA
	Danny, don't listen!  The voice isn't real!

Danny turns sharply, seeing his mother.  Suddenly terrified.
		
		WYNN
	Kill him, Danny!  You feel the rage inside!  You are Thorn!

Suddenly Danny drops the dagger.  Wynn flies at him, SCREAMING like an 
enraged beast.  The Shape raises its dagger and plunges it -- into Wynn!

Wynn's eyes go wide with shock.  The Shape lurches empathetically.  Wynn 
staggers, yanks the blade from his stomach.

RAPID-FIRE GUNSHOTS rip through the chamber as Tommy lets loose a barrage 
of bullets from above.  Taking out several coven members, the rest scattering,
retreating into the tunnels.

Loomis dives Danny a split second before he through Kara's bonds with the 
dagger.

Kara springs toward the baby as the room is ripped apart by GUNFIRE.  The 
altar decimated.  Candles falling.  Setting the room ablaze.

Wynn releases the supports which suspend the catwalk.  Wooden girders CRASH 
down from the ceiling.  Tommy pitches to the floor, dropping the rifle.

The Shape staggers, trying to get to its feet.  Slowly.  Painfully.  Flames 
lapping at its back.

Loomis crawls toward the rifle.  Grabs it.  Rises just as Wynn seizes Danny, 
a dagger at his throat.  Pulling him away.
		
		LOOMIS
	No!!!
		
		WYNN
	Stay away, Sam.
		
		LOOMIS
	Leave the boy.  Take me.

Loomis slowly places the rifle down in front of Wynn.  Surrendering himself.

Tommy drags himself toward Kara and the baby.  Paralyzed with horror as they try to 
anticipate Wynn's move.
		
		WYNN
	   (smiles trenchantly)
	Good-bye, Dr. Loomis.

Loomis turns.  Gasps in startled reflex.  The Shape rises up behind him, 
swiping the dagger across his chest!

Wynn retreats and flies through a doorway with Danny.
		
		DANNY
	Mommy!!!
		
		KARA
	Danny!!!

Tommy and Kara race across the flame-engulfed room, reaching the door just 
as it SLAMS shut.  Cutting them off.

The Shape, the trail of flames growing on its back, hurls Loomis over the 
crushed altar.

Tommy sees Loomis writhing on the floor, about to go for him when --

The Shape turns on them!  Tommy stands in front of Kara and the baby, 
backing away, propelling them out into the tunnels.

The Shape walks forward in fevered pursuit, all but consumed by fire.

TUNNELS

Tommy, Kara and Danny race deep into the heart of the tunnel maze.

LOOMIS

painfully crawls away.
		
		LOOMIS
	Die, Michael.  In the name of God, die!

END OF TUNNEL

Tommy, Kara and Danny reach the tunnel end.  Kara pounds frantically on the 
elevator panel.  A DEAFENING ROAR -- the SOUND of fire as the Shape sweeps 
toward them.

THE SHAPE

glides steadily through the tunnels.  A walking pillar of flame.  Undaunted.  
Unstoppable.  Hell-spawned.

END OF TUNNEL

Finally the doors open.  Kara and Tommy barrel inside.  Mashing buttons until 
the doors close -- a millisecond before the Shape reaches them.

INT. ELEVATOR

Kara cradles the baby.  Tommy waits anxiously as the old elevator MOANS and 
GRINDS toward ground level.  The doors open.

INT. SANITARIUM CORRIDOR

They barrel off the elevator and race down a long corridor.
		
		TOMMY
	This way!

Tommy leads her toward an exit sign.  Behind them, the elevator doors close. 
The indicator light shows it moving down.

They reach a dead end.  The row of coded security cages.
		
		KARA
	What now?!
		
		TOMMY
	   (realization)
	Wait a minute ...

He reaches into his pocket -- withdrawing Wynn's key card!

Suddenly the elevator doors open.  FIRE GUSTS.  The Shape emerges, totally 
engulfed in flame.  The emergency sprinklers are activated.  Dousing the 
flames as it walks after them.

Tommy panics, runs the key card.  The gate BUZZES open.  They run through.  
The Shape's hands lurch through the bars, missing Kara by inches.

They race toward the next gate.  The gate behind them opens, and the Shape 
walks through!

Tommy runs the card again.  The gate BUZZES.  They slam it -- one step 
ahead of the Shape.

The third and final gate.  Tommy tries the card.  Nothing!
		
		KARA
	Come on!
		
		TOMMY
	   (tries it again)
	It's not working!

The Shape moves through the last gate.  Inside the cage with them!
		
		TOMMY
	   (continuing)
	Someone's controlling it!

INT. WYNN'S OFFICE (SAME)

Standing behind his computer, observing them on the security monitors, Dr. 
Wynn jams the card's access code.  Then he grabs his satchel and strides 
quickly out of the office.  Pulling Danny with him.

On the screens, we can SEE the Shape approaching.  Kara's SCREAM can almost 
be heard on the silent monitor.

INT. SECURITY CAGE (SAME)

Kara SCREAMS as the Shape rakes Tommy against the cage.  Kara cowers in the 
corner, protecting the baby.

EXT. SANITARIUM - FIELD - NIGHT (SAME)

Wynn races with Danny across the field toward the waiting helicopter.  
Getting ready for take-off as they duck inside.

INT. SECURITY CAGE

The Shape slams Tommy's head against the bars; he slumps to the floor.  Then 
turns its murderous attention on Kara and the baby.

INT. WYNN'S OFFICE

A hand reaches into the top desk drawer, removes the .357 and FIRES an entire 
round into the security console.  Destroying it.

The man holding the gun is Loomis.

INT. SECURITY CAGE

The door BUZZES open.  Kara drags Tommy and the baby out.  Slamming the door 
shut on the Shape.  Trapping it inside.

The Shape lurches against the bars in wild paroxysms.

EXT. SANITARIUM - LANDING FIELD

Tommy comes to as he races with Kara and the baby across the windswept field.  
Suddenly they stop dead, watching in horror as the helicopter lifts off.

Kara stands paralyzed with shock, looking skyward.  The helicopter disappears 
into the gloom-filled night.

Tommy drags Kara in another direction.  A vehicle parked nearby.  The white 
van.

INT. VAN (SAME)

Kara lifts the baby inside.  Tommy flops down in the driver's seat.  Face 
bruised and bloody.  A key in the ignition.

Kara holds Jamie's baby.  Tears falling.
		
		KARA
	How will we ever find him?

Tommy's gaze terrifies her.  He starts the engine and tears off toward the 
sanitarium gate.

Kara looks down at the baby, then stares numbly forward.

In the back of the van, we can SEE the the Shape's white mask.  Glowing in 
the darkness.  Emerging.

Kara and Tommy drive on, unaware.  And that, for now, is how we leave them.
			
			     FADE OUT.

ROLL FINAL CREDITS
DARKNESS fills the SCREEN.  SUPERIMPOSE:

October 30, 1995

DEAD SILENCE for what seems like an eternity, followed by a 
startling, bone-chilling SCREAM as we

FADE IN:

INT. DUNGEON - TUNNELS - NIGHT (DISTORTED)

The agonizing SCREAMS continue as we MOVE rapidly through a 
labyrinth of winding underground tunnels.  Glowing torches light 
the way.  Blurry, indistinct silhouettes of grim FIGURES wearing 
black-cowled robes flash along the dank, craggy walls.

As we BLAST around dark corners, we realize we are looking from 
the P.O.V. of a SCREAMING young woman being pushed forward on a 
gurney.  Plunging deeper into this hellish maze.

A door is SLAMMED.  Wooden.  Heavy.  Muffling the SCREAMS.

Spurs CLANK on a pair of silver-tipped cowboy boots as a 
MYSTERIOUS STRANGER steps into VIEW.  Long black duster.  
Widebrimmed fedora.  Lit cigarette dangling between gloved 
fingers.

INT. BIRTHING CHAMBER - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

A rat scampers from a hole, foraging in the muck of a rotted 
rack.  A white sheet, saturated with blood, covers the parted legs 
of JAMIE LLOYD, now 16, cheeks flushed with perspiration.
		
		JAMIE
	Oh, God, it's coming!  It's coming!

MARY, a young midwife, rushes in with a bowl of hot water.  Jamie 
lurches, knocking the bowl out of the girl's hands; it SHATTERS on 
the floor.
		
		JAMIE
	   (continuing)
	Mary, mother of God, please make it stop!

Mary's face is frozen in horror.  Jamie's SCREAMS build to an 
unnerving crescendo.  The paiin too much for her to bear.
			
			     FLASH CUT TO:

Lurid SHOCK CUTS from the previous "Halloween" entries -- a 
surrealistic blend of IMAGES and VOICES -- as Jamie relives her 
terrifying childhood ordeal:
		
		LOOMIS (V.O.)
	... Ten years ago he tried to kill Laurie 
	Strode ...

A)   LAURIE STRODE (Jamie Lee Curtis) twists and squirms as she is 
     strangled mercilessly in the hands of the murderous SHAPE.
		
		LOOMIS (V.O.)
	... Now he wants her daughter.

B)   Trapped in her bedroom, 10-YEAR-OLD JAMIE (Danielle Harris) 
     struggles to open the door.  She flings it open.  The Shape is 
     standing there, knife poised to kill!
		
		LOOMIS (V.O.)
	Michael Myers is here to kill that little girl 
	and anyone else who gets in his way!

C)   RACHEL (Ellie Cornell) dies in anguish as the Shape plunges a 
     pair of scissors through her chest.  TINA (Wendy Kaplan) dives 
     right into the path of the Shape's knife.  "Jamie, run!!!"

D)   Jamie sinks to her knees behind the fallen Shape, taking its 
     hand in her own.  CLOSE ON the Shape's hand.  Fingers flexing to 
     life.  A grotesque BRAND on its wrist -- an inverted isocsceles 
     triangle that will come to be known as the mark of THORN.

E)   BLINDING EXPLOSION rips through cinderblock.  A jail cell blown 
     to oblivion.  FIRESTORM rages.  The MYSTERIOUS STRANGER appears, 
     opening fire with a SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE.

Pitiful wails of death.  OFFICERS writhing in pools of blood.  In 
the aftermath of this carnage stands YOUNG JAMIE.
			
			     FLASH CUT TO:

INT. CHAMBER - NIGHT (SAME)

Jamie struggles against her bonds.  Pushing.  SCREAMING.  Lapsing 
in and out of consciousness during the excruciating pangs of 
labor.  Haunted by low, moaning VOICES.  CHANTING.
			
			     FLASH CUT TO:

EXT. POLICE STATION - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT (NEW FOOTAGE)

RESUME Jamie, filled with repidation as she staggers through the 
smoke-filled cell into a darkened, drizzly alleyway.

JAMIE'S P.O.V.

Beyond the clearing wisps of smoke, THREE FIGURES wearing black 
ski masks usher THE SHAPE -- arms and legs shackled in heavy 
chains -- into the back of a white van.

BACK TO SCENE

Mutely terrified, Jamie backs away -- into the arms of another 
figure, obscured by smokescreen:  the Mysterious Stranger!

Jamie's scream is cut off as the Stranger descends upon her like 
the Angel of Death.

A cigarette arcs throug the darkness like a tiny flare.  Crushed 
under the boot of the Stranger.

A moment later, Jamie is shoved into the front seat of the van.  
Doors SLAM.  Tires SCREECH over wet pavement.

THE ENTIRE PRECINCT EXPLODES IN A HUGE CONFLAGRATION!
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

INT. CHAMBER - NIGHT

A SLAP and the first cry of the newborn BABY.  Jamie sobs 
uncontrollably, the straps preventing her from reaching him.
		
		JAMIE
	Please ... give him to me ...

The infant is wrapped in black swaddling.  The wooden door CREAKS 
open.  Jamie's eyes fill with horror as the shadow of the Stranger 
fills the room.  Standing at the threshold.  Waiting to receive 
the child.
		
		JAMIE
	   (continuing)
	No, please ... my baby!

The dark sentinels march out in somber procession, ignoring her 
desperate pleas.  Torches lighting the way.
		
		JAMIE
	   (continuing)
	Damn you!!  Damn you all to hell!!!

Jamie's heartrending SHRIEKS are cut off by the cold sound of the 
SLAMMING DOOR.
			
			     FADE TO BLACK.

MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

A diaphanous column rises, a ghostly, slow-motion cylinder of 
flame that BURNS through the SCREEN to form the MAIN TITLE:
			
			HALLOWEEN 6

The OPENING CREDITS are BRANDED against the BLACK SCREEN by an 
invisible, kenetic force, interspersed with a SERIES OF CUTS:

Jamie's baby is lain upon a primitive altar.  Ringed by eleven 
stones engraved with cryptic markings.

Hooded, faceless figures.  Torches held aloft.  Disembodied 
VOICES.  Whispering.  Invoking a dark spell.

MARY, the young midwife, peers around a corner.  Eyes glazed with 
horror.  Watching.  Spying.

The newborn SCREAMS.  The flattened blade of a dagger smears a 
triangular symbol in blood over the baby's torso.

We MOVE IN on this symbol, capturing it in FREEZE FRAME.  It burns 
off into fiery cinders, disintegrating into DARKNESS.

Silence.  Then a startling CLAP OF THUNDER as we
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

A SIGN POST

standing askew in a matted patch of lawn.  WIND and RAIN.  INTENSE 
FLASH of LIGHTNING illuminates:

"For Sale By Strode Realty - SOLD"

EXT/INT. MYERS HOUSE - SUBJECTIVE P.O.V.

MOVE along a trail of drowning toys -- baseball, Power Rangers, a 
deck of Pogs -- TOWARD a weather-beaten porch.  Leftover gallons 
of Sears Best.  Brushes soaking in turpentine.  A dozen or so 2 x 
2s l;ined up to replace a row of broken railing slats.

P.O.V. LOOKS UP to the tall, brooding edifice.  Address reads:  45 
Lampkin Lane.  Fresh coat of white paint over old clapboard.  New 
shutters on the narrow windows.  A jack-o'-lantern grins behind 
filmy curtains.  The Myers house.

Despite its recent face-lift, it looks just as foreboding as it 
did in "Halloween I."

P.O.V. stalks down the side of the house, around to the back 
door.  Opens it and quietly MOVES inside.

P.O.V. MOVES across the darkened kitchen.  A drawer is opened.  
LIGHTNING reveals a large butcher knife being withdrawn.

P.O.V. glides past the living room -- a few boxes, furniture to be 
arranged -- and MOVES swiftly UP a long flight of stairs.

Down the long, dark hallway ... through a door.  A bedroom.  
P.O.V. FINDS 6-year-old DANNY STRODE ... tossing and turning in 
the throes of a nightmare.

An ear-splitting THUNDER CRASH causes the boy to bolt upright in 
bed, looking right into the P.O.V.  Sweating.  Shaking.  
Petrified.

DANNY'S P.O.V.

The THUNDER seems to ROAR from the ferocious jaws of T-REX -- a 
24" scale model posing on a shelf among an army of Jurassic 
monsters.  Seemingly brought to life by the ELECTRICAL STORM.

FOLLOW DANNY

as he leaps out of bed and pads across polished wooden floors into 
the hallway.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  With the next THUNDER CRASH 
comes a startling, barely intelligible VOICE.
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)
	Danny ...

Danny freezes.  Slowly turns.

DANNY'S POV

An ominous shadow at the end of the hall, illuminated by 
LIGHTNING.  Long duster and brimmed hat.  The Stranger!  In his 
outstretched hand, the gleaming butcher knife!
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)
	Kill for him!

BACK TO SCENE

Danny screams!  THUNDER CRASHES HELLISHLY.  Lights flash on.  
Doors fly open.  Suddenly Danny is swept up in the protective arms 
of his mother, KARA, 22.
		
		KARA
	Danny!

The little boy holds onto her for dear life.  Crying 
hysterically.  Eyes clenched tightly.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing)
	Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
		
		DANNY
	The voice man!  He's here!

Kara looks in the direction he's pointing.  In the light there's 
just an antique coat rack -- "dressed" in a hat, rain jacket and 
old silver-tipped umbrella.
		
		KARA
	Danny, no one's there.

Danny dares to look -- but now only cries harder.

Kara carries Danny back to his room, averting the steely-eyed gaze 
of her father, JOHN STRODE, staunch, late 40s, wearing boxer 
shorts and a well-worn undershirt.
		
		JOHN
	Some of us have to get some sleep around 
	here.  What's with that kid?

Kara ignores him as her mother, DEBRA, careworn face with 
compassionate eyes, tries to lend a hand.
		
		DEBRA
	Let me take him for you, Kara.
		
		KARA
	It's all right, Mom.  Go back to bed.

Debra sighs resignedly.  TIM, 18, stocky and streetwise, wearing 
torn red sweat pants and "Ice-T" t-shirt, casually replaces his 
Walkman headphones and returns to his room.

INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (A FEW MINUTES LATER)

Kara opens the closet and switches on the light.  Satisfying Danny 
that it's empty, she breaks into her perfunctory routine.
		
		KARA
	Stay away monters, stay away ghouls. Stay away 
	from Danny.  You jerks know the rules. 
	   (crossing to Danny's bed)
	Better?

Danny giggles as his pretty young mother tucks him in.
		
		DANNY
	Mommy, when can we go home?

Kara sighs.  They've been through this one before.
		
		KARA
	Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new 
	house.  At least while I'm in college.  
	Remember our deal.
		
		DANNY
	The kids at school said this is a haunted 
	house -- that a bad man used to live here.
		
		KARA
	They did, did they?  Since when did we start 
	listening to the kids at school?
		
		DANNY
	But I've seen him!
		
		KARA
	You've been watching too much TV.
		
		DANNY
	He says things.  Bad things.
		
		KARA
	Like what?

Danny is afraid to tell her.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing)
	If you mean the things Grandpa says sometimes, 
	ignore him.  Once he gets to know you he'll 
	come around ... Let the bad things you hear 
	slide right off your back.

Kara tousles his blond hair and kisses his forehead.  Then she 
goes to the closet, just about to turn out the light --
		
		DANNY
	   (sitting up; panicked)
	No, Mom -- keep it on!
		
		KARA
	Okay ... But just for tonight.

Kara adjusts the closet door, causing one of Danny's school 
drawings to fly off the wall.  She picks it up on her way out.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing)
	Good-night, Danny.

Kara softly closes the door.  Danny lies awake, blankets drawn up 
to his chin, eyes wide.  Still very much afraid.

INT. KARA'S ROOM (CONTINUOUS)

Kara yawns, removes her glasses and rubs her eyes, setting Danny's 
drawing on a pile of open books.  Cliffs Notes and Diet Coke 
cans.  Telltale signs of a late-night cram session.

Adjusting the dial on her FM/alarm clock, Kara begins to move 
about the little room, slipping out of her clothes as the 
subtly-seductive voice of a WOMAN comes over the radio:
		
		WOMAN (V.O.)
	I know this sounds crazy, Harry, but I love 
	him.  I write to him every week. I think I 
	even want to have his child --

The woman is cut off by the nasally, steel-trap voice of HARRY 
SIMMS, talk radio's most popular man of controversy:
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Let me get this straight, Debi.  Now you're 
	saying that not only does this guy get you 
	sexually aroused, but now you want to bear his 
	offspring?!

Wearing only her bra and panties, Kara moves to a full-length 
mirror and lets down her long, flaxen hair.  Beneath her studious 
exterior, she is quite attractive:  delicate features with an 
enviable, naturally-toned figure.
		
		WOMAN (V.O.)
	Deep down, he's just like you and me. He just 
	needs someone to understand him.  Someone to 
	love him.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	You're talking about one of this nation's most 
	notorious serial killers like he belongs in 
	some kind of Est seminar!  What planet have 
	you been on, lady?  Michael Myers has been 
	dead for six years!

A CLICK as the woman is abruptly DISCONNECTED.

Kara suddenly whirls around, startled by a FLASH of something -- a 
face -- in the mirror!

Drawn to the window behind her, she rubs off rainy mist and peers 
outside.

KARA'S P.O.V.

of the large Victorian frame house directly across the street.  
Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals the shadow of a man standing in 
the uppermost window -- looking right at her!

ANGLE ON KARA

Frightened, her eyes lock on Danny's drawing.  A child's 
scribbling in red Crayon:  The triangular symbol of Thorn!

EXT. MYERS HOUSE / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE

Kara draws the priscilla curtains over the window as we PULL BACK 
through the pouring RAIN ... toward the house across the street.  
An ornate sign on the front door reads:

"Blankenship House - Rooms Available"

CRANE UP toward the window where the shadowy figure stands.  An 
insidious CRASH OF THUNDER as we PUSH through the window.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

A macabre display of old newspaper headlines, arranged 
helterskelter on a wall:  "HALLOWEEN KILLS ESCAPES FROM ASYLUM."  
"HORROR IN HADDONFIELD:  MICHAEL MYERS CLAIMS 16 LIVES."  "REIGN 
OF TERROR ENDS AS MYERS PERISHES IN VIGILANTE EXPLOSION."

Harry Simms BOOMS over a state-of-the-art HiFi system.  A cassette 
tape RECORDS the continuing broadcast.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Now we've got someone who claims he's actually 
	seen Michael Myers.  Does this whacko caller 
	have a name?

Staring out the window at the Myers house, TOMMY DOYLE, a 
strapping 25-year-old with reddish brown hair and intense eyes, 
cradles a cordless phone.
		
		TOMMY
	My name's Tommy.  I was only eight- years-old 
	when I saw him.  But I was lucky.  I survived.

Tommy paces nervously around his sparsely-furnished attic 
apartment.  Classic horror movie one-sheets and mint first edition 
comic books share wall space with a chilling array of guns, 
knives, and survivalist weapons.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Sounds like you're a candidate for 
	electroshock therapy, Tommy.  Don't tell me 
	after all this time you still believe Myers is 
	alive?!

Tommy pauses, mesmerized by one of the newspaper clippings.
		
		TOMMY
	Michael's work isn't finished in Haddonfield.  
	Now it's just a matter of time before he comes 
	home to kill again.  But this time I'll be 
	ready.

MOVE IN TIGHT on the headline, frail and yellowed by age:  
"November 1, 1978.  TOMMY DOYLE SURVIVES BABYSITTER BLOODBATH."  
Directly beneath this:  "November 3, 1989.  JAMIE LLOYD FEARED 
DEAD IN POLICE STATION MASSACRE."

CLOSE ON a photograph of young Jamie and
			
			     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DUNGEON - CHAMBER - NIGHT

Jamie remains strapped to the table, wrapped in bloody sheets.  
Eyes closed.  Deathly still.  Suddenly an urgent, WHISPERING VOICE 
pierces the darkness:
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)
	Jamie?  Jamie?!

Jamie startles awake to see the midwife frantically releasing her 
straps.
		
		MARY
	Come with me if you want to save your baby.

Jamie can't believe her eyes.  Mary opens a threadbare knapsack -- 
revealing the baby inside!

A soul-shuddering RUMBLE echoes throughout the cavern.  Jamie 
leaps up, eyes wide with fear, sensing the evil presence.
		
		JAMIE
	Oh, God ... He's coming!
		
		MARY
	We've got to move.  Now!

Pulsing with adrenaline, Jamie harnesses the knapsack over her 
shoulders and follows Mary out into the tunnels.

TUNNEL GATE

Chains GRIND over rusted pulleys.  A massive iron gate rises, 
revealing a pair of filthy work boots.  Legs planted in bold 
stance as a tall, ominous shape begins to emerge.

ANOTHER TUNNEL

The terrified midwife leads Jamie with her baby on a breathless 
flight through the winding network of tunnels.  Haunted by the 
ECHOING SOUNDS of the rising gate.

STALKING P.O.V. - THROUGH TUNNELS

Gliding forward into the hollow catacombs.  Slow by determined.  
Sensing the way.

ANOTHER PART OF THE TUNNELS

Reaching a corner, Mary stops and sends Jamie off in the opposite 
direction.
		
		MARY
	There!  It's that way!
		
		JAMIE
	No --
		
		MARY
	Save your baby -- go now!

Jamie runs, disappearing down the dark tunnel.  Mary quickly 
removes her shoes and tears off, now SILENT.

STALKING P.O.V.

surges around a corner.  FINDS Mary.  MOVES IN on her.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Mary turns in small circles.  Fear mounting as she falters into 
darkness.  Heavy, labored BREATHING fills the tunnel.

A mask -- the pale, neutral features of a man weirdly distorted by 
the rubber -- materialized out of the void right behind her.  THE 
SHAPE!

Mary turns, about to scream when the Shape lunges out, lifts her 
up by the nape of the neck and SLAMS her forehead into a large 
metal SPIKE jutting out from the cavern wall!

Leaving her impaled like a fish on a hook, the Shape resumes its 
relentless pursuit.  Eerie under the lighted torches.

END OF TUNNEL

Jamie runs frantically.  Methodical, heavy FOOTSTEPS behind her.  
She chances a look behind.  The Shape is coming!

Jamie vaults up a dark stairwell.  A trap door above.  It won't 
budge.  Jamie frantically POUNDS against the hatch.

The Shape mounts the stairs!

Strength fueled by sheer desperation, Jamie forces the door open.  
Tumbles onto muddy ground.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Jamie drags herself out of the hole and half-runs, half-stumbles 
with her baby through an ugly, charred forest.  Sharp branches 
whip at her face.  RAIN falls.  LIGHTNING streaks across the sky.

As if hell-spawned, the Shape emerges from the underground chamber 
and trudges forward, bold and unstoppable.

Jamie tumbles into a gully, nearly dropping the knapsack.  She 
picks herself up, hands groping at rain-sopped earth.  The Shape 
is right behind her!

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT (SAME)

A slap-happy, overweight MOTORIST sips coffee from a 7-11 cup, 
straining to see the road through falling rain and fogged-up 
glasses.  Harry Simms keeps him mindlessly occupied.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Next up is Dwayne.  What's on your feeble 
	excuse for a mind, "Dwayne?"

The Motorisft lets out a hardy GUFFAW, spilling his coffee.
		
		MOTORIST
	Shit!

Fingers burning, he searches the glove compartment for a napkin.
		
		DWAYNE (V.O.)
	I'd just like to say that I listen to your 
	show every night, Harry.  I think you're the 
	best.  I can't tell you how excited we are 
	that you'll be paying a visit to our little 
	town tomorrow night.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Do you have a point to make here, Dwayne, or 
	should I just keep practicing my wrist 
	exercises?
		
		DWAYNE
	   (chortles)
	Harry, you're too much.  I'd just like to say 
	that I understand how things have changed in 
	the 90's.  Gays in the military, cut off your 
	husband's do- jigger, become a national hero.  
	But I just can't see any sense in bringing 
	Halloween back to Haddonfield.

The Motorist looks up.  Eyes go wide with panic.  Startled GASP.

P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD

Jamie stands in the middle of the road, SCREAMING bloody-murder.

EXT. WOODED ROAD / INT. PICKUP TRUCK (SAME)

Tires SCREECH.  The pickup stops on a dime.  The Motorist just 
sits there, mouth agape as the shrieking girl throws open the door 
and clambers into the passenger seat.
		
		JAMIE
	Drive!  Goddamnit, drive!

Through his side-view mirror, the unsuspecting Motorist sees the 
outline of a quickly-approaching man.  Unrolling his window, he 
rubbernecks a look outside.
		
		MOTORIST
	Hey, what do you think you're --

CRUNCHING BONE and TEARING FLESH as the Shape's hands shoot 
through the window, twisting the man's head off his shoulders!

Jamie SCREAMS!  Lunges for the steering wheel.  Slams her foot 
down hard on the gas.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The pickup bullets forward, fishtailing up the road, never slowing 
down as the driver's door flies open, dumping the motorists's 
headless bulk into a muddy ditch.

INT. PICKUP (SAME)

Jamie drives.  Checks to see that her baby is safe.  Then lets out 
a PRIMAL SCREAM.  A hysterical release of fear and rage, drowned 
out by the squabble of VOICES over the radio:
		
		MALE CALLER #2 (V.O.)
	You're coming here for this Halloween fair -- 
	it's all just a game -- a publicity stunt for 
	you, isn't it Harry?  These kids -- they're 
	not old enough to remember what Myers did 
	here. They look up to you.  Now you're just 
	asking for trouble.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	You people really get me.  What are they 
	putting in the water in that town?
			
			     CUT TO:

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

LIGHTNING FLASHES and RAIN pelts the windows of a bucolic cabin.  
This is a man's retreat and has been for years.  Dark wood, worn 
leather, a few tastefully-chosen antiques.  Floor-to-floor ceiling 
shelves containing a myriad of books and an impressive display of 
awards and degrees, all bearing the name:  SAMUEL J. LOOMIS, Ph.D.

After a STATION IDENTIFICATION, "The Harry Simms Show" resumes, 
tinny-voiced CALLERS blaring over a handsomely-restored 1928 
Bremer-Tully.
		
		MALE CALLER #3 (V.O.)
	All these fanatics aside, Harry, I'd 
	personally like to thank whoever did the 
	masked one in.  Saved us tax-payers a lot of 
	money in the long run.
		
		FEMALE CALLER #3 (V.O.)
	Yeah, that sucker's been dead for six years.  
	It's about time they had a Halloween revival 
	in this town.  Now my kids can stop driving me 
	crazy!

MOVE IN behind a bald, sharp-featured man, hunched over a can as 
he reminisces over a collection of framed photographs -- memories 
of his wife and children.
		
		MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.)
	What happened to that psychiatrist of his?  
	Loomis, I think was his name.  I heard the old 
	quack was dead.

Turning at the mention of his name is DR. LOOMIS himself, wearing 
spectacles, a comfortable sweater and his trademark goatee.  For 
the first time ever, we actually see him smile.  The burn scars on 
his face have all but faded away.  Last traces of the horrid past.
		
		LOOMIS
	Not dead.  Just very much retired.

Loomis hobbles to the desk and finishes cutting out a newspaper 
article.  As he arranges the strips of paper in a leather-bound 
scrapbook, a sudden KNOCK at the door gives him a startle.

EXT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

An ominous FIGURE, clad in hat and trench coat, stands beneath the 
glowing porch light, silhouetted in the pouring RAIN.

Loomis opens the door, eyes straining in the semi-darkness, trying 
to identify his unexpected visitor.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (sudden recognition)
	What the devil?!  Come in -- come in!

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Shuffling inside, dripping with rain, DR. TERENCE WYNN, a 
well-dressed gentleman in his 50s, removes his hat and coat, 
quickly making himself at home by the crackling fire.
		
		WYNN
	Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a 
	sign for five miles on that road!
		
		LOOMIS
	That's the whole idea of living in the 
	country.  I thrive on the seclusion.

Wynn heads for the kitchen, rummaging through cabinets and drawers 
as Loomis dutifully wipes up his muddy trail.
		
		WYNN (O.S.)
	Don't tell me that the reviled Rasputin of 
	Smith's Grove has grown complacent in his 
	golden years.  I don't buy it for a single 
	second, Dr. Loomis.

Loomis immediately senses that Wynn has an angle.
		
		LOOMIS
	And in all these years, I've never known you 
	to make house calls, Dr. Wynn.  Especially at 
	this hour ...

Wynn returns with a bottle of Irish whiskey and two shot glasses.  
Thrusts one in Loomis's hand and begins to pour.
		
		WYNN
	Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not 
	to second-guess the motives of my fellow man.  
	Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar 
	is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink 
	is just a drink.
		
		LOOMIS
	I hope you didn't come all the way out here in 
	this storm just to quote Freud.
		
		WYNN
	As always, your keen powers of perception 
	astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to 
	celebrate. 
	   (raising his glass)
	After thirty-two years as Psychiatric 
	Administrator, guess who has been named 
	Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
		
		LOOMIS
	But surely Rogers isn't --
		
		WYNN
	Retiring.

Loomis is abruptly stunned and delighted by the news.
		
		LOOMIS
	Why -- congratulations!  I can think of no one 
	better suited for the position.

The two old sparring partners drink to the occasion.  But Wynn's 
angle soon comes to the helm.
		
		WYNN
	Of course, I need a new Administrator. Someone 
	who can bring new life -- and some old blood, 
	if you'll pardon the expression -- back to our 
	program ...

Loomis prepares himself for the bomb.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	We need you, Dr. Loomis.
		
		LOOMIS
	You should know that it's not wise to play 
	Halloween pranks on me.
		
		WYNN
	You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things 
	haven't been the same since you left.  I'm 
	recruiting the best psychiatric team in the 
	country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change 
	to finally make a difference.

Loomis scratches his head and settles down into his comfortable 
easy chair, amused at the irony of Wynn's speech.
		
		LOOMIS
	Even after my stroke six years ago they 
	practically had to hold a gun to my head to 
	get me to retire.  Now things have changed.  
	I've changed.  The ghosts have been buried.  
	Why on earth would I want to dig them up 
	again?

Loomis finally looks over at Wynn, surprised to find him standing 
at the desk, looking through his scrap book.
		
		WYNN
	Seems to me there's at least one ghost that's 
	still lurking in your closet.

We follow Wynn's gaze down toward the open page.  A blazing 
tabloid headline:  "MICHAEL MYERS - DEAD OR ALIVE?"
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Jamie's getaway truck ROARS around a bend, tearing up a deserted 
stretch of highway.  The STORM rages.

INT. PICKUP (CONTINUOUS)

Jamie strains to see as she drives through sheets of RAIN.  Bone 
weary, fighting panic, holding one hand steady against the wheel, 
the other on the CRYING infant.
		
		JAMIE
	God ... Help us, please ...

Something up ahead.  Jamie's face fills with expectancy.

JAMIE'S P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

A lighted sign appears out of the darkness.  Glowing salvation.  
Familiar red-white-and-blue logo.  "GREYHOUND."

EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

The pickup drives into the glow of orange vapor lights.  SKIDS to 
a stop in a deserted parking lot.  Jamie staggers out, cradling 
the knapsack as she runs toward the old depot.

INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

Jamie blasts through double glass doors.  But the bus station is 
devoid of life.  Empty benches.  Blank ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE 
signboard.  The low hum of vending machines.

Jamie moves toward the ticket counter.  A handwritten sign left by 
the attendant:  "BACK IN 20."

Shivering, holding her baby, Jamie enters an old-fashioned phone 
booth.  Picks up the receiver and immediately dials 911.
		
		VOICE (V.O.)
	You have reached Haddonfield Emergency 
	Services.  Due to severe weather conditions, 
	all circuits are momentarily busy.  If this is 
	not an emergency, please dial directly ...

Jamie slams the phone down in terrified frustration.  Suddenly she 
becomes aware of the radio program.  Piped in over ancient 
loudspeakers:

		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	For anyone who gives a flying circus, this is 
	Harry Simms -- the light in your night, the 
	love of your loins -- and I want to hear from 
	more of you bogeyman believers out there.  So 
	give me your best shot at 1-800-878-7274. 
	That's 1-800-URTRASH!

The STATION IDENTIFICATION cuts in.  Jamie picks up the receiver and 
frantically dials the number.

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

Wynn doesn't give up the sales pitch even as Loomis leads him to the 
door.  The radio program still squawking in the b.g.
		
		WYNN
	But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, 
	you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
		
		LOOMIS
	Please try to understand, Terence. I've already 
	made up my mind.

As Wynn continues to talk, his voice trailing off into nothingness, 
Loomis's attention is diverted to the VOICES on the radio.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	So they're trying to kill you and your baby.  
	Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be 
	Rosemary.
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	   (intense whisper)
	No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming 
	for me and my baby.

Loomis's eyes widen; a man possessed.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's 
	coming?
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	It's ... Michael ... 
	   (releasing)
	... Michael Myers!

Loomis staggers.  A lifetime of nightmares coming back to haunt him 
all at once.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME)

PRESS IN TIGHT ON TOMMY in bed.  Listening through headphones.  
Sitting upright.  Thunderstruck.
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	Somebody help me!  Dr. Loomis, are you out 
	there?  Can you hear me?

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

Wynn watches with rapt attention as Loomis unlocks his safe and 
withdraws a metal case.  He pops it open, revealing his trusted .357 
Magnum and a box of cartridges.

INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT (SAME)

A bus has arrived.  The ATTENDANT returns to his post.  Jamie hangs 
up the phone, filled with trepidation as PASSENGERS file inside.  A 
strung-out ROCKER.  A pair of stern-faced NUNS.  A PRETTY TEENAGER 
greeted in the loving arms of her BOYFRIEND.

Just as she is about to step out of the phone booth, a TALL MAN, 
back turned, wearing a hat and black trench coat, moves to stand 
outside the booth!  Jamie freezes.

Securing her baby in the knapsack, Jamie throws open the door.  
Suddenly the Tall Man steps in her path!
		
		TALL MAN
	Are you all right, young lady?

Shaking uncontrollably, Jamie shrinks away.  Backing down a narrow 
hall through the door marked "LADIES ROOM."

INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT (SAME)

Water runs into a grimy basin.  Unable to contain her tears, she 
washes the newborn.  Takes a roll of paper towels and tries to rub 
the triangular blood mark off his chest.

Suddenly the lights go out.  Jamie gasps.  Clutching her baby, she 
turns off the faucet and melts into the darkness.

The door CREAKS open.  FOOTSTEPS echo inside.

JAMIE

has locked herself inside one of the stalls.  Heart pounding.  The 
FOOTSTEPS grow louder.  Jamie's eyes dart frantically.

STALKING P.O.V.

MOVING methodically past the row of stalls, pushing open each door, 
revealing that they are all empty.  A CRASH from the last stall.  
P.O.V. moves toward it.  RUSTLING and MOVEMENT inside.

A HAND pushes on the door.  An open window above the toilet.  Jamie 
is gone!

EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Jamie trembles off a stack of crates piled beneath the window and 
dashes around the side of the depot.

Suddenly the bus ROARS by, sending up a muddy wave as it pulls out, 
disappearing down the highway.

Jamie moves swiftly across the parking lot, clutching the knapsack.  
She throws open the door of the pickup and jumps into the driver's 
seat.

INT. PICKUP - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Slapping down the locks, Jamie thrusts the key into the ignition.  
The engine REVS to life.  She guns it, peeling out of the parking 
lot.  Back toward the highway.

She drives on, suppressing her tears, stealing glances at the 
knapsack bunched up on the passenger's seat.  Then she turns and 
looks forward with concentrated attention.

JAMIE'S P.O.V.

A sign looms ahead:  "Haddonfield Memorial Hospital - 10 Mi."

BACK TO SCENE

Jamie sighs with relief, steadying the wheel just as --

HIGHBEAMS flash on right behind her, a juggernaut roaring out of 
blackness!  Jamie's eyes flood with terror.

JAMIE'S P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

The grill of a familiar white van shoots forward, SLAMMING violently 
against the pickup's rear bumper.

JAMIE

is jolted forward in her seat.  Holding on the wheel with a 
white-knuckle grip as she's repeatedly hit from behind.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The unseen madman noses forward, veering sharply over the double 
yellow line, scraping sides with the truck.

Headlights sear a path through the night, locked in neck-and-neck 
profile.  SPARKS flashing at 70-miles-per-hour.

The van forces Jamie onto the shoulder.  It leaves the road, tearing 
branches from trees.  Jamie SCREAMING.

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH - THE CHASE

A quick-cut MONTAGE, events ticking out in fractions of a second 
like a nightmare:

The pickup springboards over a gulch and slams down hard, tires 
spinning in waves of mud, careening through a vast field.  A 
pumpking patch.

The van reappears in a glare of headlights.  Its engine screaming 
with fire-breathing rage.

The pickup puts on a furious burst of speed.  Eating up pumpkins and 
spinning out chunks of splattering seeds and pulp.

The van bears down hard, slingshotting across the field, whizzing 
past the pickup, cutting right in front of it.

INT. PICKUP

Something heavy is thrown from the back of the van right through the 
windshield!

Glass EXPLODES!  Jamie SCREAMS, hands going up instinctively to 
protect her face.  Swerving wildly out of control.

She looks to see a sprawling, mutilated corpse on top of her.  Wide, 
cold, lifeless eyes -- Mary!
		
		JAMIE
	No!!!

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH (CONTINUOUS)

The pickup rockets at breakneck speed toward the edge of the field.  
Suddenly --

JAMIE'S P.O.V.

The Shape stands in the field, tall and unmoving, white mask glowing 
hideously in the rush of oncoming headlights.

BACK TO SCENE

The truck plows into the Shape, dragging it under, SLAMMING headlong 
into the trunk of a huge oak tree.

Everything is abruptly and shockingly silent.  Like a phantom in the 
night, the van is gone.  The Shape nowhere to be seen.

Steam billows from the pickup, engine TICKING, a heap of shattered 
glass and mangled steel.  Pinned against the base of the tree is a 
shape in human form -- a scarecrow!

MOVE IN on Jamie, face-down against the steering wheel.  Coughing on 
the noxious fumes, she stirs back to life.  Slowly, painfully, she 
shoulders the door.  Falls onto the ground.

A SPARK ignites.  BLINDING FLASH as the gas tank EXPLODES, setting 
the truck ablaze.  Jamie turns, her face a frozen rictus of horror.  
Debris rains down on her.

Suddenly a grim shadow rises from the field.  The Shape -- wielding 
an enormous butcher knife!

Jamie rolls onto her back, SCREAMING.
		
		JAMIE
	No -- NO!!!

Suddenly the knife plunges down and lands with a terrible THUD.

INT. PICKUP

The knapsack catches fire ... but inside there is no baby.  Only a 
roll of paper towels from the bus depot.

THE SCARECROW

burns; mocking Jamie with its grinning, hand-painted face.
			
			     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

THE SHAPE

looks at us, white mask scintillating against blinding rays of 
SUNLIGHT.  Rivulets of blood drip off a large carving knife.

PULLING BACK, we see it is a life-sized, knife-wielding effigy of 
Michael Myers, sitting astride the "For Sale by Strode Realty" 
sign.  Stage blood spells out the words:  "He's coming!"

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

John Strode looks up with disgust as he inspects the grim monument 
that's been left on his front lawn during the night.  Puffing on a 
cigarette, wearing slippers and a flimsy bath robe, John raises a 
large axe.

A group of neighborhood KIDS -- some dressed in Halloween 
costumes -- stand a safe distance away.  Gathered on the sidewalk.  
Gawking, whispering, tittering.

John angrily swings the axe into the signpost.  The kids jump with a 
collective start.
		
		JOHN
	Enough ... 
	   (one CHOP)
	... of this ... 
	   (two CHOPS)
	... Michael Myers ... 
	   (timber)
	... shit!

Suddenly the sign crashes down -- and "Michael Myers" with it.  The 
kids huddle.  John turns on them, brandishing the axe.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing)
	You stinkin' kids got three seconds to get the 
	hell off my property!  One, two --

That's all it takes.  The kids scatter, tripping over one another as 
they tear off down the black.

Satisfied with himself, John stubs out his cigarette and hauls the 
sign and its now-headless rider to the trash.

Then he trudges up the porch steps, dropping the axe as he enters 
the house.  Uttering oaths under his breath.

BOOM UP over the surrounding neighborheed.  SUPERIMPOSE:

"Haddonfield, Illinois.  Halloween."

Last night's storm has given way to an incredibly bright and 
picturesque morning.  CHILDREN pour out of their homes, bursting 
with excitement, dressed in colorful costumes.

Even the Myers house, with its trimmed hedges and fresh coat of 
paint, somehow manages to look invite.

A white van slowly rolls up the street.  WKNB logo, streamers and a 
large orange banner proclaiming:  "HADDONFIELD JUNIOR COLLEGE 
HARVEST FAIRE '95 - See Harry Simms Live - October 31."  A 
now-familiar voice booms over loudspeaker:
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	This is Hard Harry Simms harping on ya from the 
	Big Apple.  Tonight's the night and the place 
	to be is the First Annual Harvest Faire.  So 
	come on out of your broom closets, 'Fielders, 
	and bogey the night away with me.
		
		MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.)
	Harry, I just won first prize for ugliest 
	costume!  Guess who I'm dressed as.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Your mother?
		
		MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.)
	No, man -- You!!!

EXT. SANITARIUM - MORNING

A car bearing an official state emblem stops outside an imposing 
curtain of security gates.  A large sign reads:  "SMITH'S GROVE - 
WARREN COUNTY SANITARIUM."

A hand reaches out and waves a plastic key card in front of an 
infrared scanner.  Surveillance cameras perched on the walls.

As the gate yawns open and the car drives through, we SEE the asylum 
in the distance -- the entire perimeter bounded by woods and barbed 
wire fences.

INT. WYNN'S CAR (CONTINUOUS)

Wynn drives.  Loomis in the passenger seat, fueling his own 
anxieties.
		
		LOOMIS
	It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was 
	Jamie.  Calling for me.
		
		WYNN
	You don't know that for sure.  It could have 
	been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
		
		LOOMIS
	It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew 
	she would one day.  And whatever has brought 
	her back has brought Michael back as well.
		
		WYNN
	After six years?  Sam, she died with him in 
	that explosion after the --
		
		LOOMIS
	That's what someone wants us to believe, but I 
	tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I 
	sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did 
	all those years as I watched him.  Sitting 
	behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing 
	stronger. 
	   (off Wynn's silence)
	As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't 
	go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your 
	help to stop him.

Wynn stares.  Loomis's words fall on him like a death sentence.

INT. SANITARIUM - RECEPTION AREA (SAME)

Gold insignia on mahogany doors:  "TERENCE WYNN - CHIEF OF STAFF."

Wynn and Loomis stride through a plush reception area.  DAWN, an 
attractive, high-energy secretary, keeps pace, taking notes, handing 
Wynn his briefcase, phone messages, etc.
		
		WYNN
	Cancel all my appointments.  Get Dr. Loomis 
	anything he needs -- files, tests, records of 
	every treatment ever administered to a former 
	patient of ours -- Michael Myers.
		
		DAWN
	   (stunned)
	Michael Myers?

Wynn stops abruptly before heading out the door.
		
		WYNN
	That's right.  We think there's a very good 
	chance he might still be alive.

Loomis acknowledges Wynn's silent understanding.

CORRIDOR

Wynn and Loomis move along a sterile white corridor.  Wynn uses his 
key card to BUZZ them through a series of metal security cages.  A 
retinue of DOCTORS and NURSES fall in behind.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on 
	our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We 
	go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours. 
	   (beat)
	If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
		
		LOOMIS
	Or what's left of him.

They cut down a sub-passageway and out a fire exit.

EXT. SANITARIUM - LANDING FIELD (CONTINUOUS)

Loomis and Wynn dash across a windswept field where a Smith's Grove 
medical transport helicopter awaits them.  The deafening WHINE of 
spinning rotors as a TECHNICIAN refuels.

The doctors step inside.  The doors close and the helicopter lifts 
off, rising high above the cluster of the white coats below.
			
			     CUT TO:

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

A blender whips up a revolting concoction of chocolate Yoo-Hoo, 
banana yogurt and chewy Gummi-worms as Tim, wearing Levi's baggies 
and a "Harry Simms Kicks Ass" T-shirt, raps on the phone.
		
		TIM
	Bro', I knew Harry when we lived in the city.  
	Don't worry -- he'll be there. We've got 
	everything arranged.  Get with me tonight at 
	the fair and I'll hook you up.  Peace.

Tim hangs up, guzzling down his shake as Debra navigates around him, 
setting out the breakfast dishes as Kara tries to study.

John, dressed in what might be a respectable business suit if it fit 
him better, mutters grumpily as he pours himself a cup of coffee.
		
		JOHN
	Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed 
	them ...
		
		DEBRA
	Relax, John.  They were just kids.
		
		JOHN
	Kids are what's ruining this country. 
	Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn 
	respect.

Tim lets out a huge BELCH as he finishes drinking his breakfast.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing)
	See what I'm talkin' about?
		
		DEBRA
	You'll never pass that exam on an empty 
	stomach, Kara.

Debra snatches the book out of Kara's hands.
		
		DEBRA
	   (continuing; reading)
	Cognitive Therapy and Emotional Disorders?  
	What are they teaching in college these days?  
	The art of going crazy?
		
		KARA
	   (indignant)
	It's called psychology, Mom.  Living in this 
	house is what's driving me crazy.
		
		JOHN
	Who the hell told you to come live here in the 
	first place?

Kara rises, collects her books, trying to avoid a confrontation.
		
		KARA
	I'd better get Danny to school.
		
		JOHN
	She don't show her face for five years, then 
	expects us to roll out the red carpet.  You 
	think going to college is gonna make up for 
	your mistakes, girl?
		
		DEBRA
	John, please don't --
		
		TIM
	Yo', just lay off her, Dad.

Suddenly Danny runs in, showing off in his dinosaur costume.  
ROARING loudly.  Startling John.
		
		JOHN
	What the fuck --

Kara immediately seizes Danny's hand and ushers him toward the back 
door.
		
		KARA
	Let's go, Danny.
		
		DEBRA
	Kara, wait.  John.  Can't we all just sit 
	down?  Try to be a family for once?
		
		KARA
	I'm sorry, Mom.

Debra reaches into her purse and hands Kara a couple of dollars.
		
		JOHN
	That's it, Debra, keep slipping her the cash.  
	While you're at it, why don't you just give her 
	all our goddamn money?!

John explodes, dumping the entire contents of her purse onto the 
floor.  Debra recoils.  Kara steps in.  Danny is terrified.
		
		KARA
	Stay away from her, you bastard.
		
		JOHN
	   (re Danny)
	I only see one bastard in this house.

Kara flies at him with Medea-like rage.  John instantly grabs her by 
the neck and shoves her violently against the counter.
		
		TIM
	Dad!  Let her go!
		
		DEBRA
	John!  Stop it!  Stop it!

Danny looks outside.  Frozen in horror.  A VOICE whispers.
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
	Kill him, Danny ... Kill him ...

Danny moves across the kitchen.  Mesmerized.  Through the screen 
door, the Shape can be seen standing in the back yard.

Kara's eyes bulge as John squeezes her throat.  Choking her.
		
		JOHN
	You ever raise your hand to me again, I'll kill 
	you, you understand?

John looks down to see the tip of a butcher knife pointed at his 
groin.  Danny is holding it -- his eyes dark, emotionless.  Ever so 
slowly, John releases Kara.  Debra and Tim watch in horrified 
astonishment.

Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the back door.  Kara dives toward 
Danny.  The knife clatters to the floor as she picks him up, grabs 
her book bag and hurtles outside.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - BACK YARD (CONTINUOUS)

BETH, 19, very "retro," cute in the waifish sense -- milky white 
skin, two-tone hair and a dangling nose ring --is nearly bowled off 
the back porch as Kara and Danny fly out the door.
		
		BETH
	Make way for the Hardin County Express. 
	   (following them across the yard)
	Hey, where's Tim?  We're supposed to go over 
	the list of events for tonight --

Beth is taken aback when she sees the bruise on Kara's neck.
		
		BETH
	   (continuing)
	He do that to you?
		
		KARA
	Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the 
	Strode house.
		
		BETH
	Pig.  What the hell happened this time?

Suddenly Tim jumps out from behind a clothesline, locking his arms 
around Beth, attacking her with kisses.
		
		BETH
	   (continuing)
	Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
		
		TIM
	Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to 
	organnize this friggin' fair? It's only 
	Halloween.

Beth shoves the clipboard at him, a champion of her cause.
		
		BETH
	How many times o I have to tell you? It's not 
	about Halloween.  It's about being political.  
	There are too many people with corn-cobs up 
	their ass in this town telling us what we can 
	and can't do.  If we want change, it's up to us 
	to set an example.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN (SAME)

Debra is on the floor, stifling her tears, putting things back in 
her purse.  John stares coldly out the window.
		
		JOHN
	I want her and that kid out of here tonight.

Debra rises, facing him scornfully.
		
		DEBRA
	I thought inheriting your father's house ... 
	the business ... moving out here might change 
	things.  But you're still the same, John. 
	   (with finality)
	Kara has come home, and I'll be damned if I let 
	you turn her away again.

Debra storms off.  John bores holes into her with his eyes.

EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (SAME)

Tim lifts Danny into the back seat of Beth's convertible VW Bug -- 
plastered with "Greenpeace" and "This is Your Brain on Drugs" bumper 
stickers.  Kara and Beth in front.
		
		TIM
	Whatever happened to women in back?
		
		BETH
	Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.

Pulling away from the curb, Beth honks at MRS. BLANKENSHIP, at least 
80, owner of the student boarding house across the street.
		
		BETH
	   (continuing)
	See you tonight, Mrs. Blankenship!

The old woman just stares forward.  A gardem hose in hand as she 
waters a garden of long-dead flowers.

Kara shields her eyes, distracted, looking up at the old Victorian 
house.

KARA'S P.O.V.

Beth drives down a shady, tree-lined avenue, unaware of the white 
van that is following them.
		
		KARA
	Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall 
	from you?
		
		BETH
	Why?  You interested?
		
		KARA
	No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window.  
	Watching me.
		
		BETH
	You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale 
	he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary 
	shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed 
	up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably 
	just lonely.

Tim leans forward, ravaging Beth's neck.
		
		TIM
	Or horny.
		
		KARA
	Tim, do you always have to act like such an 
	asshole?
		
		TIM
	Only when you're around to dump on ... Hey, 
	chill, sis.  I'm just doggin' ya.

Suddenly the van ROARS by and cuts them off.  Beth lays on the 
HORN.  Slams on the brakes.  Narrowly avoiding a collision.
		
		BETH
	Speed kills, asshole!

Suddenly the van swerves around to face the VW head on.  For a 
breathless moment the van and the VW sit at opposite ends of the 
intersection.  Idling.  A tense stand-off.
		
		KARA
	Who is that ...

Kara strains to get a look at the van's driver.  A momentary glimpse 
of a pale white face behind the wheel.
		
		BETH
	   (bravely)
	I've got my pepper spray.

Danny sits frozen in the back seat.  Suddenly the van shoots 
forward, tires SCREAMING.  Startled GASPS.  The van turns off 
sharply at the last second, SCREECHING down the next block.
		
		TIM
	   (relieved)
	Happy fuckin' Halloween.
		
		BETH
	Someone's trying to scare us out of having this 
	fair ... and it's not gonna work.

Beth drives on, grimly determined.  Kara looks back at Danny.  He 
returns her frightened gaze.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Tommy paces in his cramped apartment.  Dark circles under his eyes.  
A remote control in hand, reviewing his recording of last night's 
Harry Simms broadcast:
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	So they're trying to kill you and your baby.  
	Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be 
	Rosemary.
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming 
	for me and my baby.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's 
	coming?
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!

Frustrated, Tommy plays it again.  Adjusts the speed.  Tries to make 
out something else in the b.g.  Jamie's voice comes through.  Slow.  
Eerie.
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	   (continuing; slowed)
	It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!

Another VOICE, distant and distorted, filters up behind hers.
		
		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	Bus 611 from Russellville now arriving.

Tommy quickly stops the tape, throws on his worn leather bomber 
jacket and bolts straight out the door.

MOVE IN on a pair of old newspaper clippings left on the floor.  
Headlines read:  "November 5, 1989.  JAMIE LLOYD STILL MISSING."  
"November 19, 1989.  MYERS' NIECE PRESUMED DEAD."

INT. FORD EXPLORER / EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - MORNING

Tommy drives like a bat out of hell.  The "Greyhound" sign looms 
ahead.

EXT. BUS DEPOT - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

The Explorer pulls up to the depot.  Tommy makes a beeline for the 
entrance, cowboy boots splashing through rain puddles.

INT. BUS DEPOT (CONTINUOUS)

Tommy wades his way through a small crowd up to the ticket booth.  A 
cross-eyed ATTENDANT greets him.
		
		ATTENDANT
	Can I help you, sir?
		
		TOMMY
	Can you tell me if a bus arrived from 
	Russellville last night?

The Attendant checks her roster.
		
		ATTENDANT
	Sure did.  About seven hours ago.  You lookin' 
	for someone --
		
		TOMMY
	   (walking away)
	Thank you.

The Attendant eyes Tommy suspiciously as he enters the phone booth 
in the corner.  Inside, he picks up the receiver and pretends to 
dial a number.  Makes a cursory inspection.

TOMMY'S P.O.V. - PHONE BOOTH

On the floor, tiny droplets of what appear to be blood form a dotted 
trail out the door.

TOMMY

follows the crimson path around the corner down a dim hallway, 
stopping at the door marked "Ladies Room."  Checking first to make 
sure the coast is clear, he steps furtively inside.

INT. LADIES' ROOM (CONTINUOUS)

Tommy walks past the sink.  Water drips into the filthy basin.  He 
touches something inside, rubs it on his fingers -- blood.

Tommy whirls, startled by a sudden NOISE.  Muffled, indistinct.  
Like CRYING.  Tommy gathers his courage as he slowly moves past the 
long row of empty stalls.  The CRIES grow louder as he reaches the 
final stall.  Jamie's escape route -- the window -- still wide open.

A hole in the wall behind the toilet.  Tommy reaches in, his hands 
locking onto something.  Shock and amazement overcome him when he 
lifts out a baby -- Jamie's baby.
		
		TOMMY
	Jesus ...

The helpless newborn kicks and CRIES, the triangular symbol of Thorn 
still caked in blood over his tiny torso.

SUBJECTIVE P.O.V.

Someone partially opens the door, peering in from the hallway as 
Tommy removes his jacket and bundles the baby inside.
		
		TOMMY
	Okay, little guy.  You're okay.

BACK TO SCENE

A CREAK.  Tommy looks up.  The door slowly closes.

DEPOT HALLWAY

Tommy looks into shadowy stillness.  No one there.  Hiding the baby, 
cradling his jacket, he hurries through the crowd and slinks out the 
door marked ENTRANCE.
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

HELICOPTER P.O.V.

The SOUND of THWACKING BLADES as we FLY past a winding rural highway 
over a dense grove of oak trees -- massive, ancient guardians of the 
sprawling pumpkin patch that lies beyond.

As we circle the field, red-and-blue gum machines -- police cars, 
fire engines and ambulances -- can be seen through gauzy veils of 
rising BLACK SMOKE, dissipating with the strong WIND.

Charred in the ground, three intersecting lines stretch a hundred 
feet across the plan to form a vivid geoglyphic.  The symbol of 
Thorn.
		
		HELICOPTER PILOT (V.O.)
	   (filtered)
	Chopper One to Smith's Grove.  We've got a 
	visual.  Approximately ten miles due east of 
	Haddonfield.

INT. HELICOPTER (CONTINUOUS)

Loomis surveys the crash site with morbid fascination.  Wynn, 
wearing headphones, shouts over the noise.
		
		WYNN
	   (pointing)
	What is that?
		
		LOOMIS
	It's a sign.  He's come home.

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

The helicopter lands, windmilling gusts of ashen earth.  Loomis and 
Wynn jump out, ducking past the spinning blades.

We FOLLOW them through EMERGENCY CREWS and a few CURIOSITY-SEEKERS 
toward the center of attention.  A charred body is lifted from the 
eviscerated, flame-blackened pikcup truck.

A few feet away, a team of PARAMEDICS work frantically around 
another body, hidden among a cluster of pumpkins.

Loomis surges forward, at once halted by an armed DEPUTY.

		DEPUTY
	Sir, you'll have to step back.
		
		LOOMIS
	Please.  I need to see the sheriff.
		
		WYNN
	Official business.

Wynn flashes his badge.  The Deputy gives them a vexed glance.
		
		DEPUTY
	Wait here.

Loomis's eyes flicker with nervous anticipation.  The Deputy 
whispers something to SHERIFF JIM HOLDT, a brooding giant of a man 
who dons a Stetson, holstered .44 Special and steel-toed boots that 
give new meaning to the term "bad ass."

Even Loomis steps back as the sheriff lumbers toward them.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (extends his hand)
	You must be Sheriff Holdt.

Holdt responds by stubbing out his Marlboro at Loomis's foot.
		
		HOLDT
	As a matter of fact, I am.  And I take it 
	you're the infamous Dr. Loomis.
		
		LOOMIS
	I'd like to introduce you to Terence Wynn, the 
	Chief of Staff at --
		
		HOLDT
	Smith's Grove.  They told me you'd be coming.  
	Now I suggest you fly right on back to your 
	crackpot asylum.  You people got no business in 
	my town.
		
		LOOMIS
	Michael Myers is my business.

Holdt towers above him.
		
		HOLDT
	I want you to listen and listen good, Loomis.  
	Things have been quiet for six years and that's 
	the way they're gonna stay.  The last thing we 
	need is you spouting off your ghost stories.

As usual, Loomis isn't easily intimidated.
		
		LOOMIS
	I suppose it was a ghost that did all this.  A 
	ghost who called the radio station last night.  
	Maybe that same ghost is lying over there right 
	now.

Holdt fumes, ready to boil when --
		
		DEPUTY
	Sheriff!  She's alive!

Holdt and Loomis wade through the crush of paramedics, running 
alongside the stretcher being whisked toward an ambulance.

A large knife extruding from a girl's stomach, packed under sterile 
gauze.  Skin pasty-white.  Lips blue from shock.
		
		LOOMIS
	Dear God ... Jamie!

EXT. HADDONFIELD JUNIOR COLLEGE - PARKING LOT - MORNING

Beth's car pulls into the parking lot of a picturesque, impeccably 
landscaped campus, speckled with colorful leaves.  A buzz of 
excitement fills the autumn air.

Tim and Beth are surprised to see a small crowd -- camped out in 
sleeping bags, holding "We Love to Hate Harry" signs.
		
		TIM
	Yo, check it out.  They've been lining up all 
	night just to see Harry. 
	   (to Kara)
	You lose your mind in that thing, Kara?

Kara is nervously rifling through her enormous book bag.
		
		KARA
	I can't find my term paper.
		
		TIM
	So copy someone else's.  I do it all the time.  
	Works primo.

Armed with her clipboard, Beth is assailed by her COMMITTEE.  
Inundating her with QUESTIONS.
		
		BETH
	Give us victory or give us death.  See you 
	tonight, Kara!

Tim and Beth are swept away.  A large sheet of paper falls out of 
Kara's bag.  She picks it up, startled by what she sees.

KARA'S P.O.V. - THE DRAWING

Crayola figures of Grandma, Grandpa, Uncle Tim, and Mommy.  Knives 
piercing them.  Blood dripping.  Mouths screaming.  A black shadow 
figure bearing the word "THORN."

On the flip side, the drawing she found last night.  Danny's 
scribbling of the odd triangular symbol.

BACK TO SCENE

The horrifying images send chills up Kara's spine.
		
		KARA
	Thorn ...

Lost in grim reverie, Kara walks on, oblivious to the activity all 
around her ...

A banner hangs from the eaves of the library:  "HADDONFIELD JR. 
COLLEGE - FIRST ANNUAL HARVEST FAIRE."

Tim and Beth supervise as preparations for tonight's event get 
underway.

STUDENT VOLUNTEERS nailing together booths, hanging decorations.  A 
half-assembled Ferris wheel, a merry-go-round, an ominous-looking 
House of Horrors.

Rounding the corner onto the quiet path behind the library, Kara 
suddenly finds herself alone.  WIND whips at her hair.  She glances 
over her shoulder, as if sensing a presence.

KARA'S P.O.V.

No one is there.  Just the rustling of leaves on the ground.

ANGLE ON KARA

Walking off in the distance.  Suddenly the Shape steps shockingly 
into FRAME, watching her disappear around the corner.
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

INT. HADDONFIELD MEMORIAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

Doors BLAST open.  The stretcher holding Jamie is pushed through, 
Loomis right beside her.  Wynn follows, trying to stop him.  A 
SHOCK-TRAUMA unit swarms in.  No time to lose.
		
		PARAMEDIC
	Penetrating abdominal trauma.  Massive blood 
	loss.  We've given her two units of O-negative 
	stat and dextran.  BP sixty.  Pulse one-twenty 
	... Somehow she pulled through out there all 
	night!

DR. BONHAM, the ER resident, peels off the sheet, exposing a dark 
sea of blood around the enormous knife still jutting from Jamie's 
stomach.  Bonham stares, incredulous.
		
		DR. BONHAM
	How can this girl still be alive?! Type and 
	cross-match for another six units!  Get a CT 
	scan and move her into surgery. 
	   (re Loomis and Wynn)
	And get them out of here!

ORDERLIES move in.  Loomis won't release Jamie's hand.
		
		WYNN
	Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
		
		LOOMIS
	I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live.  
	You have to.

HOSPITAL ENTRANCE / ADMITTANCE DESK

Pneumatic doors fly open.  Tommy bursts through, holding the baby in 
his jacket.  PATIENTS and COPS everywhere.  He hones in on the NURSE 
behind the admittance desk.
		
		TOMMY
	I need to see a doctor.
		
		NURSE
	What seems to be the problem?
		
		TOMMY
	I-it's a baby -- my baby.  There's been -- been 
	an accident.
		
		NURSE
	What kind of an accident?
		
		TOMMY
	   (explodes)
	Just get me a doctor right now!

ADJACENT HALLWAY

Wynn and Loomis skirt past a line of SECURITY GUARDS.
		
		WYNN
	There's nothing more you can do for her.

The shrill sound of Wynn's beeper.  He clicks it.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	I'll be right back.

Wynn disappears around the corner.  Loomis wanders off alone.
		
		TOMMY (O.S.)
	Dr. Loomis!

Loomis reacts, taken aback by the frantic young man bounding toward 
him.
		
		LOOMIS
	Yes?
		
		TOMMY
	Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard 
	her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
		
		LOOMIS
	I'm sorry, but do I know you --
		
		TOMMY
	I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- 
	Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me 
	that night --

Loomis suddenly recognizes him.  It's been a very long time.
		
		LOOMIS
	Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
		
		TOMMY
	Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael 
	Myers come home?

Loomis pulls Tommy aside into an empty alcove.
		
		LOOMIS
	What do you know about Michael?
		
		TOMMY
	I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they 
	want us to believe he's dead.  But I know.  
	I've always known.
		
		LOOMIS
	Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie 
	Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She 
	is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
		
		TOMMY
	   (gravely)
	No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.

Tommy hesitates.  Loomis's eyes are drawn enigmatically to the 
infant in Tommy's arms.
		
		TOMMY
	   (continuing; startled realization)
	Oh, God -- his cousins.  The Strodes. They're 
	living in the Myers house!

Loomis's face flls with horror.  Tommy sees the Admittance Nurse, 
flanked by a pair of security guards, walking his way.
		
		TOMMY
	   (continuing)
	I gotta go.

Tommy bolts toward the exit.  Loomis tries to stop him.
		
		LOOMIS
	Tommy, wait!

But he is gone.  A hand taps Loomis's shoulder; he reels.  Wynn.
		
		WYNN
	There you are.  Who was that boy?
		
		LOOMIS
	An old friend.

Darkness fills Loomis's countenance as we

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - DAY

We peer OVER THE SHOULDER of the Shape, standing across the street.  
Watching Debra, in jeans and a rumpled sweatshirt, collecting 
left-over painting supplies from the front porch.

Debra starts to open the CREAKY screen door when she notices the axe 
John had used earlier.  Clumsily picks it up and slides it through 
the top of the crate she is holding.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER (CONTINUOUS)

Laden with her heavy load, Debra nudges the door shut with her 
foot.  Then crosses to another door -- the cellar door.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Debra, silhouetted at the top of the stairs, hits a light switch; a 
naked bulb springs to life.  Slowly she descends the rickety 
staircase.

The basement, pitch dark save for a spear of sunlight shooting 
through an elevated window, is overrun with cobwebs, rusted tools 
and broken bicycle parts.  A clunker of a washing machine RATTLES in 
the corner.

Debra makes space for the crate in a storage cabinet.  Suddenly the 
washing machine stops.  Nonplissed, she moves toward it.  Lifts the 
lid.  The bed sheets inside are sopping wet.

Opening the electrical fuse box, she flicks a switch back and forth 
a few times -- but the washing machine doesn't respond.
		
		DEBRA
	Great.

Frustrated, Debra looks down to see a large puddle of water forming 
on the floor.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER (SAME)

Debra hauls a laundry basket upstairs, filled with wet sheets.  She 
turns, startled.  The front door is standing wide open.

Just as she goes to shut it, a man steps out from the living room 
behind her.  She gasps, dropping the basket; it's Loomis.
		
		LOOMIS
	I'm very sorry, Mrs. Strode.

Debra shudders at the sight of the beguiling, wide-eyed man.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (continuing)
	I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is 
	everything all right in here?
		
		DEBRA
	   (defensively)
	Who are you?
		
		LOOMIS
	I've come to help your family.

Debra steps aside as Loomis walks in right past her.  Holding a 
valuminous file bearing the name "MICHAEL AUDREY MYERS."

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - DAY

The SOUND of JANGLING KEYS.  A door UNLOCKING.  Tommy scrambles in, 
the baby iin one arm, a bag of groceries under the other.

With a single swipe, he clears away the junk on his futin, then 
carefully lays down the CRYING infant.  He digs through the bag:  
Baby Wipes.  Diapers.  Formula.  Bottles.
		
		TOMMY
	Shhh.  Okay, okay, Kyle.  You like that name?  
	Yeah, I think it suits you.

Quickly he scans the directions on the formula.  Pours the liquid 
into a bottle, nukes it in the microwave, then returns to the 
business at hand.

Tommy grimaces at the mess inside his leather bomber.  The baby 
CRIES harder.
		
		TOMMY
	   (continuing)
	 This is worse for me than it is for you.

Armed with Baby Wipe and a diaper, Tommy goes to work.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SAME)

Mrs. Blankenship traverses the hall outside Tommy's apartment.  The 
baby's CRIES; Tommy's GROSSED-OUT GROANS can clearly be heard.  But 
the old woman keeps walking, oblivious to it all.

Tommy finishes securing the diaper.  The baby in his arms, he tests 
the formula's temperature and feeds him.  The infant sucks 
voraciously.  The crying stops.  Tommy rocks him gently.

	Michael Myers was just six-years-old when he 
	stabbed his sister to death in 1963.  Here in 
	this house.  For the next fifteen years, I

The other kids make way as Danny takes the empty spot on the

	What in God's name are you talking about, 
	woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to 
	those damned talk shows?
		
		DEBRA
	I'm getting the children out of here. At least 
	until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I 
	want you to come with us.
		
		JOHN
	   (whispers)
	Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
		
		DEBRA
	You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew.

A CLICK as the line suddenly goes DEAD.

John scowls, opens his lower desk drawer, produces a bottle of JD 
and a small glass.  He blows off dust and begins to pour.
		
		JOHN
	Trick-or-treat to you, too.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - UPSTAIRS (SAME)

CAMERA FOLLOWS Debra in frantic flight from bedroom to bedroom, 
throwing open closets and drawers, filling a suitcase with a night's 
worth of clothes for her family.  She accidentally knocks a family 
portrait off a bureau.  Glass SHATTERS.

FOYER / LIVING ROOM

Debra drags the suitcase downstairs.  Lets out a horrified gasp.  
The crate she had previously stored in the cellar is now sitting in 
the center of the hallway ...

The axe that had been sticking out of it earlier is now missing!

The telephone RINGS.  Eyes riveted to the crate, Debra backs away 
down the hall.  Into the living room.  Picks up the phone.
		
		DEBRA
	Hello?

A startling, intensely whispering VOICE:
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
	We want the child ...

Debra slams down the phone.  Terror paralyzing her.

MUFFLED, HEAVY BREATHING fills the room.
		
		DEBRA
	Oh, God ...

Debra races back into the foyer and struggles with the door.  In her 
panic, she can't release the chain lock.

She turns to see the Shape standing right behind her!  Debra 
SCREAMS.  Breaks for the hall.  Through the kitchen.  Flings open 
the back door.

EXT. BACK YARD - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Debra half-runs, half-stumbles through the endless rows of 
clotheslines.  White sheets twist around her like ghosts in the 
blustering WIND.  She tosses them aside, one after the other.  
Approaching the driveway.  Safety up ahead.

Whipping aside the last sheet, Debra finds herself staring into the 
Shape's death mask.  Her eyes bug.  Too late to scream.  The missing 
axe swings at her like a sledge hammer.  Blood paints the sheets red 
as we
			
			     DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - DUSK

Laden with her book bag, Kara exits the library and heads across the 
campus green.  All around her, the sights and sounds of the 
impending carnival come to life.

Rides assembled.  Paper witches hang from broomsticks.  Goblins lurk 
behind syrofoam gravestones.

Kara waves at Beth in the distance, making last-minute 
preparations.  Student volunteers scurrying in every which 
direction.  Donning costumes.

A ducking for apples booth.  Homebaked goodies set out on picnic 
tables.  Long rows of pumpkins lined up for a jack-o'-lantern 
carving contest.

The centerpiece of all this is a huge, magnificently decorated 
HALLOWEEN TREE.  Tim and a gaggle of WORKERS stream up ladders, 
stringing lights, hoisting up colorful bunting filled with mounds of 
candy.

As Kara walks along, her hair being tossed about in the brisk WIND, 
she becomes aware of the magical, almost out of time quality that 
seems to hang in the air.

EXT. STREET (SAME)

Kara walks past the crows of "Harry-ites" gathered outside the 
campus gates, now extending half-way around the block.

The WKNB van rolls by, exhorting the crowd with the voice of the man 
they've all come to see:
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	It's almost that time, all you kiddies and 
	women with big -- hey, what rhymes with 
	kiddies?  So let's count it down as we get down 
	to the witching hour!

Kara walks on, smiling to herself as the crowd bursts into gales of 
wild, exuberant CHEERS.

EXT. LAMPKIN LANE / MYERS HOUSE - DUSK

The setting sun glows behind the trees, casting long shadows as Kara 
rounds the corner onto her street.

KIDS already pouring out of their homes, some accompanied by 
PARENTS, others joining groups of friends.

Kara ambles up the walk of the Myers house, shoes clapping up the 
porch steps as she digs the keys out of her overstuffed bag.

Unbolting the door, she finds that it's secured with the 
chain-lock.  Kara pushes on it, calling inside.
		
		KARA
	Mom, I'm home ... Hello?

No response.  Puzzled, she steps off the porch and makes her way 
around the side of the house, CAMERA FOLLOWING as she peers into the 
windows along the way.

BACK YARD (CONTINUOUS)

Kara walks along the billowing clotheslines, passing the blank spot 
where the blood-stained sheets were -- and are no longer.

She reaches the back door.  Standing ajar.
		
		KARA
	Mom?

Casting one last glance across the yard, she steps inside.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN (SAME)

Everything in its proper place.  Kara drops her heavy bag on the 
kitchen table and proceeds down the hall.

LIVING ROOM / FOYER - DUSK INTO NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

The room is quickly falling into darkness.  The eeriness almost 
palpable.  Kara advances into the living room, eyes roaming.
		
		KARA
	Mom? ... Danny?

Nothing.  Kara moves into the foyer.  Her mother's suitcase still 
sitting there.  Beyond, the cellar door stands wide open.  Kara 
moves toward it, peering into blackness.

A sudden CRASH from upstairs.  Kara jerks the door closed and looks 
up the deeply-shadowed staircase.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing)
	Mom?  Are you there?

A muffled ROAR.  Kara mounts the staircase.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (CONTINUOUS)

Kara reaches the second floor landing and moves slowly toward the 
door at the end of the hall.  Danny's room.  An orange glow flickers 
around the edges of the closed door.

KARA'S P.O.V.

Her hand grabs the doorknob, turns it.  The door swings open.

DANNY'S BEDROOM

Someone sitting on the edge of Danny's bed.  A man.  His back 
turned.  Dinosaurs ROAR on Sega Genesis.  Danny squatting on the 
floor, engrossed in his game.

Kara stares at the intruder in horrified disbelief.
		
		KARA
	Who the hell are you?

The man watching over Danny turns toward Kara.  It's Tommy.
		
		TOMMY
	I-I'm your neighbor from across the street.  My 
	name's Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.

Panicked, Kara makes a wall of herself between Tommy and Danny.  The 
little boy isn't the least bit fazed.
		
		KARA
	What are you doing with my son? Where's my 
	mother?

Tommy backs off a tick, calmly trying to explain.
		
		TOMMY
	She wasn't here when I brought Danny home 
	from --
		
		KARA
	   (fortissimo)
	Danny, go downstairs -- Now!

Danny finally looks up, exasperated.
		
		DANNY
	Tommy's my new friend.  We've been playing 'til 
	you got home.  He knows all about dinosaurs.

One look at Danny's black eye and Kara goes ballistic.
		
		KARA
	My, God!  What have you done to him?
		
		TOMMY
	I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
		
		KARA
	You stay away from him!

Kara starts to drag Danny away by the arm.  He resists angrily.
		
		DANNY
	It wasn't Tommy!  It was the voice man.

Kara sees Tommy hunkering down in the corner, lifting something out 
of a crate -- a makeship crib.  He turns, his expression very 
grave.  Holding the baby.
		
		TOMMY
	I want you to listen very carefully to 
	everything I'm about to tell you.

Kara's face is a melange of wonder and fear as we
			
			     DISSOLVE TO:


INT. JAMIE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Jamie lies comatose, ensconced in the dim GLOW of monitors.  
Sustained by I.V.s and a breathing apparatus.

MOVE IN on Jamie.  EKG registers rapid heartbeat.  MOVE IN TIGHT on 
her eyes, darting beneath closed lids.

INT. CORRIDOR - DISTORTED VISION (DREAM SEQUENCE)

Blood-chilling SCREAMS as we MOVE rapidly through a BLINDING TUNNEL 
OF LIGHT.  Blurred, indistinct images.  FIGURES wearing long white 
coats flash along sterile walls.

As we BLAST around corners, we realize we are seeing from the P.O.V. 
of a girl being pushed forward on a gurney.  It is Jamie.

Her arm injected with a sedative.  Eyes lolling.  Succumbing.

JAMIE'S P.O.V. - MOVING (DREAM SEQUENCE)

Even more DISTORTED now, images swirling at random.  Cold, staring 
FACES.  Flashing lights on a wall panel:  "3-2-1-B" -- an elevator.  
Going down.  Down.  Beneath the basement level.

The doors open.  The gurney SLAMS out into DARKNESS.  VOICES ECHO.  
Lighted torches flicker on craggy walls.
		
		JAMIE (O.S.)
	Please -- don't let him do this to me.
		
		VOICE (O.S.)
	We're not going to hurt you, Jamie.  He chose 
	you.  Now it's time.

SHAPE'S P.O.V.

Pacing back and forth behind iron bars, agitated, disturbed.  SEEING 
Jamie strapped to a table.  Surrounded by robed figures.  CHANTING.  
Weakly, Jamie reaches out toward the cell.
		
		JAMIE
	Please, Michael ... Help me.

Suddenly a long SHADOW fills the room.  The P.O.V. becomes more 
restless as the Stranger glides toward Jamie and disrobes.  The 
figures close the circle.  Jamie SCREAMS in terror.

The Shape's hands SLAM violently against the iron bars, a horrific 
SHUDDER of metal as we
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

INT. JAMIE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT (SAME)

Jamie's eyes flash open!  A dark shadow fills the room.  The 
Stranger descends on her!

Gloved hand covers Jamie's mouth.  A switchblade FLICKS open.
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)
	Your work is done, Jamie.

The glinting blade SLASHES across Jamie's throat, cutting off her 
soundless scream!

Then the Stranger flows out of the room.  Spurs CLANKING.  Like a 
thief in the night.  The shrill sound of a BEEPER going off as we
			
			     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HADDONFIELD STREETS - NIGHT - SERIES OF SHOTS

The dark blanket of night envelops the little town.  The LIGHTS of 
the fair twinkle in the distance, bright and beckoning.

Families -- men, women and children alike -- turn out from their 
homes wearing COSTUMES, joining a growing procession along the 
peaceful streets of Haddonfield.

A large group of PROTESTORS carry PICKET SIGNS in front of the 
campus gates.  Rallying against the celebration.

Haddonfield's finest out in full force, squad cars sweeping 
alongside a black STRETCH LIMO as it makes its way through town.  
Tinted windows make it impossible to see inside.

EXT. CAMPUS PARKING LOT / HARVEST FAIR ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Tim and Beth, standouts as punk versions of Frankenstein and his 
bride, stride purposefully toward the fair entrance.  Beth is a 
jumble of nerves as she runs down her checklist of events.
		
		BETH
	Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving 
	jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the 
	school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the 
	tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm 
	forgetting something!
		
		TIM
	Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you 
	Harry would be here?

The limo crawls into the parking lot.  A stampede of overzealous 
FANS surge past them.
		
		BETH
	That's what worries me.

Tim and Beth move into the fair, with all its noise and colorful 
movement.

ANOTHER ANGLE

KIDS waving signs and T-shirts.  Throwing themselves at the 
windows.  Frenzied CLAMORING.  Harry-mania abound.

The WKNB van parks parallel to the steps of the library, adorned 
with HAREM GIRLS and a large golden throne.  The side door opens.  A 
red carpet is rolled out.

A tall, imposing figure emerges from the van and walks up the 
steps.  Spurs CLANKING on black boots.  "Jesse James" style duster.  
Hat cocked slightly.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Hellllo, Haddonfield!!!

The crowd turns in a mass of confusion.  Standing above them, waving 
from a microphone, is HARRY.  Dark sunglasses.  Gaunt, glacial 
features and an outrageous mane of black hair.

Suddenly Harry throws open his duster -- flashing them -- revealing 
that he has nothing on beneath except his boots and a pair of bright 
orange boxer shorts that say "HAPPY HALLOWEEN."

The kids go insane.

ANGLE ON LOOMIS

Making his way through the teeming crowd.  Walkie-talkie in hand.  
The helicopter zooms overhead.  Wynn's voice squawks over garbled 
RADIO CHATTER.  Conducting a surveillance by air.
		
		WYNN (V.O.)
	   (filtered)
	There's more people moving eastbound down Old 
	Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (into walkie-talkie)
	Any word on the location of the Strodes?
		
		WYNN (V.O.)
	No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
		
		LOOMIS
	Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on 
	that house.

Suddenly Loomis is waylaid by a giant wall of a man -- Sheriff 
Holdt.  Loomis meets his fiery gaze.
		
		HOLDT
	I'm warning you, Loomis -- stay out of my way.  
	You may have had free reign when Ben Meeker was 
	sheriff, God rest his soul, but I'm in charge 
	now.  And I'm not about to stand by and watch 
	you turn this night into some kind of sadistic 
	witch hunt.
		
		WYNN (V.O.)
	Sam, I just got word from the hospital. You'd 
	better get over there right away.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (into walkie-talkie)
	What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
		
		WYNN (V.O.)
	I'll meet you over there.

Loomis tears off.  Holdt stares brazenly, throwing down his 
cigarette.  Crushes it under his boot and slowly follows him.
			
			     CUT TO:

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY - NIGHT

Carrying the CRYING baby, Tommy leads Kara and Danny into the lobby 
of the vintage boarding home.  Polished wood.  Framed old 
paintings.  Wall-to-wall Tiffany lamps.

Mrs. Blankenship sits behind the front desk, oblivious to the 
GRINDING and SCREAMING on the television as "The Texas Chain Saw 
Massacre" reaches its horrific climax on the annual Horrorthon.
		
		TOMMY
	Quiet around here tonight, huh, Mrs. B.?

As usual, the senile old woman doesn't reply.
		
		KARA
	   (indignantly; to Tommy)
	Do you mind telling me what this is all about?  
	Tim and Beth are waiting for us.

Tommy ushers Kara and Danny up the stairs.  Mrs. Blankenship stares 
at the boy -- the kind of stare that would send most kids running 
for their moms.  But Danny is undaunted.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT (CONTINUOUS)

The door opens.  Kara is repulsed by the sight of Tommy's musty, 
unkempt apartment.
		
		DANNY
	Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
		
		KARA
	   (to Tommy)
	You can't expect us to stay here --

Tommy adjusts the blinds on the window looking out on the Myers 
house.
		
		TOMMY
	I want you to watch your house.  You can see 
	everything from this window.

Kara glares, reminded of last night.
		
		KARA
	Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I 
	supposed to be looking for?
		
		TOMMY
	Him.

Tommy flashes a newspaper article in front of her.  One we've seen 
eariler:  "MICHAEL MYERS - DEAD OF ALIVE?"

The baby's SCREAMS are verging on overload.  Tommy dashes to the 
recessed kitchen area and heats up another bottle.

As Kara reads, Danny tugs at his mother's blouse.
		
		DANNY
	Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun 
	stuff!
		
		KARA
	   (snapping)
	Danny, you're just going to have to wait!

Danny plods off.  Kara hands Tommy a nipple for the bottle.  Their 
eyes lock for a beat.  He takes it.
		
		TOMMY
	Shhh.  It's okay, Kyle.  Just give me one 
	more -- 
	   (the microwave BEEPS)
	-- second.  There you go, big guy.

Kara looks on as Tommy attempts to feed the baby.  Despite his 
clumsiness, she's undeniably moved.

Behind them, Danny's imagination kicks into high gear as he drives a 
Power Ranger over an invisible race track.  On the floor.  Across 
the windowsill.  Glancing across the street.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - THE MYERS HOUSE

Standing below on the front lawn is the Shape, silhouetted under a 
moonlit tree.  Looking right at Danny.

BACK TO SCENE

Danny backs away, terrified.  Tommy and Kara are too concerned with 
the baby to notice.
		
		TOMMY
	God, what's wrong with him?
		
		KARA
	Here.  Let me try.

Tommy gingerly hands the baby over to her.  Instantaneously, Kyle's 
CRIES subside.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing; fawning)
	There.  All it takes is a mother's touch.

For one fleeting moment, Tommy and Kara find themselves smiling at 
one another.  Unaware as Danny glides silently out the door.  
Tommy's expression darkens once again.  A man possessed.
		
		TOMMY
	Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know.  
	Now I'm afraid he could be next.
		
		KARA
	Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
		
		TOMMY
	Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family. 
	   (reaching toward Kyle)
	Here.  Look at this.

Tommy opens the baby's quilt, revealing the blood mark smeared over 
his torso.  Kara's face registers terrified recognition.
		
		TOMMY
	   (continuing)
	It was there when I found him this morning.  It 
	looks like some kind of letter or number or --
		
		KARA
	It's a rune ... Thorn.

INT. JAMIE'S HOSPITAL ROOM / HALLWAY - NIGHT

POLICE on the scene.  A crying NURSE gives a statement.  A CRIME 
SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER snapps photographs as Jamie's bloody corpse is 
covered over with a white sheet.

Loomis stands frozen in horror.  Tears in his eyes.
		
		LOOMIS
	Jamie ... I failed you again.  I never should 
	have left you.

He spins, pouncing on Sheriff Holdt.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (continuing)
	Now will you do something?!  How many more 
	innocent people have to die?!

Wynn restrains him.  Pulls him away.  The sheriff doesn't budge.
		
		WYNN
	Don't do this to yourself, Sam.  Let's go.  
	Come on.

Wynn ushers Loomis out of the room.  Holdt stares apathetically.

HALLWAY (CONTINUOUS)

Wynn tries to calm Loomis down.  Jamie's doctor approaches.
		
		DR. BONHAM
	Dr. Loomis?
		
		WYNN
	What is it?
		
		DR. BONHAM
	I'm very sorry ...
		
		LOOMIS
	You let it get to her.  How could you?
		
		DR. BONHAM
	Dr. Loomis, there's something else you should 
	know.  During surgery, we discovered that 
	Jamie's uterus was hemorrhaging.  We found 
	this. 
	   (displays a small vital)
	It's placental fluid.
		
		LOOMIS
	God in heaven.  You don't tell me she was --
		
		DR. BONHAM
	I estimate she gave birth no more than a few 
	hours before the attack.
		
		WYNN
	Then where's her baby?

Jamie's covered body is wheeled out past them.  Loomis regards Wynn 
with a look of abject fear.
		
		LOOMIS
	I think I may already know ...

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT (SAME)

CLOSE ON a chapter heading.  "Thorn - The Devil's Rune."  Beneath 
it, a bold depiction of the familiar Thorn triangle.

PULL BACK to REVEAL Tommy poring over the old library book.  Kara 
paces, rocking the baby, feeding him with the bottle.
		
		KARA
	Runes were a kind of early alphabet that 
	originated in Northern Europe thousands of 
	years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of 
	stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, 
	Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults 
	used them in blood rituals to portend future 
	events and invoke magic.
		
		TOMMY
	Black magic ... 
	   (reads)
	'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause 
	sickness, famine and death. Translated 
	literally, it was the name of a demon spirit 
	that delivered human sacrifices ... on the 
	Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
		
		KARA
	Halloween.
		
		TOMMY
	'When applied directly to another person, Thorn 
	could be used to call upon them confusion and 
	destruction -- to literally visit them with the 
	Devil.'

Tommy jumps up, frantically moving around the apartment, collecting 
his jacket, his keys -- a gun.
		
		KARA
	   (terrified)
	Where are you going?
		
		TOMMY
	To find the rest of your family before Michael 
	Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling 
	him.

An ominous CLICK as Tommy loads a cartridge into his gun.  He bolts 
toward the door.  Finds it standing wide open.  Kara freezes, 
noticing for the first time that Danny is missing.
		
		KARA
	Oh, God -- Where's Danny? Kara flies down the 
	hall, the baby in her arms.  Tommy moves out 
	right behind her.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY (CONTINUOUS)

Kara and Tommy barrel downstairs, searching frantically.
		
		KARA
	Danny?!  Danny!
		
		TOMMY
	Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy 
	who came in with me and --

They find Mrs. Blankenship and Danny sitting side by side, watching 
the Horrorthon.  A bowl of popcorn between them.
		
		KARA
	   (grabs him)
	Danny, don't ever walk off without telling me 
	where you're going!

Danny looks at her.  A blank, hollow stare.  The old woman's eyes 
glitter madly.
		
		MRS. BLANKENSHIP
	The voice.  He hears the voice.  Just like the 
	other little boy who used to live in that 
	house.

Tommy throws on his jacket and opens the front door.
		
		TOMMY
	Take the kids upstairs, lock the door and wait 
	for me. 
	   (beat)
	And Kara, whatever you do -- don't go back to 
	your house.

Kara watches fearfully as Tommy heads out the door.  Leaving her 
alone with the children.

EXT. HOUSES / STREET - NIGHT

Wind MOANS.  Dead leaves blow across the WINDY lane as Tommy flies 
down the path of the Blankenship house and hops into his Explorer.  
The Shape suddenly RISES INTO FRAME.  Watching him peel off down the 
block.  Taillights disappearing.

A moment later, another car rambles up the street, swerving 
erratically into the driveway of the Myers house.

The Shape watches.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

The car parks.  Sits in silence.  Suddenly the driver's side door 
opens, emblazoned with the "Strode Realty" emblem.

John spills out, collar unbuttoned, tie dangling.  Picking himself 
up, he staggers out of the garage.  Laughing.  Singing.
		
		JOHN
	... Pretty woman, walking down the street ... 
	Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

FOLLOW John's circuitous route across the front lawn, stumbling over 
one of Danny's toys on his way up the porch steps.
		
		JOHN
	Damn kid ... this is my house ...

John fumbles wth his key, estimates the location of the lock.  He 
turns the knob -- but the door's jammed.  Chain-locked.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing)
	What the fuck ... 
	   (yelling inside)
	... Debra, open this goddamn door before I 
	break it down!  You got to three ... 
	   (no response)
	... One ... Two ... 
	   (still no response)
	... Two and a half ...

John slams his weight against the door.  It doesn't budge.

Grumbling, John totters off the porch, trying to hold himself 
steady.  Skirting along the side of the house.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN (CONTINUOUS)

John sways in through the back door and flicks on a light.  Strains 
for lucidity.  No one in the kitchen.
		
		JOHN
	Debra -- I'm home!

No answer.  John shrugs and moves to the stove.  Opens the lid on a 
pasta cooker.  Nothing inside.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing; mutters)
	Work all day and not even any supper ...

Frustrated, John opens the freezer and removes a frozen dinner.  
Tears open the box and pops it in the microwave.  Then he flounders 
down the dark alley, knocking picture frames awry.

LIVING ROOM / FOYER

Darkness, save for a glowing jack-o'-lantern.  John stands there, 
listing.  Bewildered.

Then he switches on a lamp, kicks off his shoes and crashes onto his 
lumpy old recliner.
		
		JOHN
	All right ... You can all come out now ...

Still no reply.  John sneers, flicks on the television with the 
remote control and settles back into his chair.

INSERT - TELEVISION

A scene from another horror movie.  A boy shreds his pumpkin mask as 
a mass of beetles and snakes pour out of his skull.

BACK TO SCENE
		
		JOHN
	What is this shit?

Disgusted, he switches channels to the local NEWS.  A shrill BEEP 
from the kitchen startles him.  The microwave.

KITCHEN

John waddles to a drawer and removes a set of utensils.  Then he 
reaches for the microwave, opens it.  But his dinner is gone.

Spinning around, he sees the piping hot entree already sitting out 
on the kitchen table.  John double-takes, mentally retracing his 
steps.  Shrugs.

FOLLOW JOHN

as he picks up his tray and plods back down the hall.  Suddenly he 
trips over something -- the suitcase Debra had packed earlier, 
sitting smack-dead in the center of the hall.
		
		JOHN
	So this is the game you wanna play. Fine.  Go 
	ahead.  Keep it up all night ...

LIVING ROOM

John settles back into his chair and begins to eat ravenously.  
SCREAMS from the television.  He reacts.

INSERT - TELEVISION

Someone has switched it back to the horror movie.  A 
COMPUTER-GENERATED PUMPKIN causes more masked heads to EXPLODE.

BACK TO SCENE

John shakes the remote.  Out of the corner of his eye, he catches a 
shadowy figure darting by in the darkened foyer.
		
		JOHN
	Is that you, you little brat?  Danny?!

John rises, about to go for him when suddenly the power cuts out -- 
and the entire house is plunged into blackness.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing)
	When I get my hands on you, kid, you're gonna 
	wish you were never born!

John pulls a rechargeable flashlight from the wall and goes to the 
cellar door.  It stands open.  An invitation to enter.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing)
	Oh, I'm scared.  I'm really scared.

With that, John steps down into the basement.

INT. CELLAR (CONTINUOUS)

John tentatively descends the stairs.  Barefoot.  The flashlight 
beam preceding his every step.  A RUMBLING below.

The cellar is lit only by a shaft of moonlight cutting through the 
single dusty window.  John probes around, shining the flashlight 
over cobwebs, boxes -- the puddle of water at his feet.  Now 
flooding the entire floor.

John SLOSHES through the water toward the washing machine -- which 
is running at full tact.
		
		JOHN
	What the hell --

He opens the washer lid and lifts out a water-logged sheet.  It 
drips red onto the white appliance -- blood.

John backs away, loses his footing, and slips in the water -- 
landing right at the Shape's feet.  John SCREAMS as the Shape grabs 
him by the neck, lifts him off the floor with one hand, then carries 
him across the basement and SLAMS him brutally against the open fuse 
box.

The Shape's free hand lifts an enormous butcher knife.  A loud WHAP 
as it's driven to the hilt into John's chest, through the fuse box.  
Sparks wain from the wall.  Electricity courses through John's 
writing body.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE (SAME)

Lights flash on and off in the windows.  Suddenly the entire house 
is plunged into darkness.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR (SAME)

John's toes curl.  The skin around where the knife penetrates 
FRIES.  The Shape steps back, head tilted, BREATHING steadily, 
curiously observing John's hanging, lifeless body.

EXT. HARVEST FAIR - NIGHT

Tommy grabs the ticket he's just paid for, hands it to an ATTENDANT 
and moves through the turnstiles amid a steady stream of REVELLERS.

Loud MUSIC, the aroma of apple cider and pumpkin pie fills the air.  
Boots selling food and crafts.  Children carving jack-o'-lanterns.  
Parents beaming with pride.

Trendy co-eds playing games.  Ducking for apples.  Shooting 
pumpkin-faced balloons with water pistols.

EXT. LIBRARY STEPS

Tim and Beth sit on either side of Harry as he interviews them 
during a live BROADCAST.  A large crowd gathered below.
		
		HARRY SIMMS
	   (into mike)
	I'm here with Tim and Beth -- the organizers of 
	tonight's event.  How does it feel knowing 
	you've finally pulled Halloween out of the 
	closet?
		
		TIM
	   (into mike)
	Yo, Harry, it's great!  And having you here 
	with us is dope.  Totally raw. You're the 
	ultimate juice!
		
		HARRY SIMMS
	I'll remember that the next time my wife tells 
	me I didn't make her climax.
		
		BETH
	   (impassioned)
	What Tim means is that we've taken a firm stand 
	against censorship.  Not only for Haddonfield, 
	but for every town in the nation.  Our 
	generation will not let the powers-that-be 
	control our minds, dictate what clothes we 
	wear, what music we listen to, or what holidays 
	we celebrate.

Beth's rousing speech is met by gales of enthusiastic CHEERS.
		
		HARRY
	   (off-handedly)
	Have you ever considered running for public 
	office?
			
			     CUT TO:

EXT. HADDONFIELD STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

The distant SOUNDS of the celebration are carried on the wings of 
the WIND.  Howling through dark, empty streets.  Rows of deserted 
houses.  Not a soul in sight.  Preternatural stillness.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - NIGHT

Kara looks nervously out a window, then walks into the parlor where 
she finds Danny sitting in the dark, glued to the Horrorthon.  
Flames CRACKLE in the fireplace, casting weird shadows.

Mrs. Blankenship sits in a wooden rocker, cradling the infant, 
humming a lullaby.

If we look closely enough, behind her in the window we can see the 
hazy shadow of the Shape looking in.
		
		KARA
	Mrs. Blankenship, what did you mean about the 
	little boy who used to live across the street?

The old woman doesn't seem to hear her.  Lost in her own world.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing; insistent)
	Mrs. Blankenship, please.  This is important!

Mrs. Blankenship looks up sharply, startling Kara.
		
		MRS. BLANKENSHIP
	He heard the voice.  Same as your boy hears.
		
		KARA
	What voice?  What are you talking about?
		
		MRS. BLANKENSHIP
	The voice that spoke to Michael Myers. The one 
	that told him to kill his family.

Kara stares at her, numbed.  She gazes over at Danny, his eyes 
riveted  -- not to the TV screen.  Looking past it.  Across the 
street at the Myers house.  The haunting VOICE whispers to him.
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
	I'm coming for you, Danny ... I'm coming.

EXT. HARVEST FAIR - NIGHT

Tim and Beth ride high atop the Ferris wheel.  Their smiling faces 
aglow in a dizzying whirlwind of LIGHTS.  DARK CLOUDS are gathering 
in the sky, covering the moon and stars.  A light RAIN begins to 
fall.

ANGLE ON TOMMY

Walking, searching, hunting.  Past a large tent where children are 
gathering.  A sign reads:  COSTUME PAGEANT.

Tommy reacts to a terrified SCREAM.  Just a couple of teenage BOYS 
pulling an innocuously fightened GIRL onto another ride.

THE STRANGER

walks steadily past the bright lights of the Ferris wheel.

TOMMY

pushes through a dense crowd.  Suddenly he bumps shoulders with the 
Stranger.  More people pass.  There was something very sinister 
about that man.

Tommy turns to look again, eyes widening in terror.

TOMMY'S P.O.V. - STRANGER'S WRIST

Branded with the mark of Thorn!

TOMMY

removes his gun.  Flows through the crowd like a vengeful wraith.

People see the gun in his hand and back away.  Tommy surges 
forward.  The Stranger walks faster.  Gaining ground.  Toward the 
Halloween tree.

WORKERS hauling wheelbarrows loaded with jack-o'-lanterns cross his 
path.  Tommy stumbles, pumpkins spilling out all around him.

The Stranger is getting away!  Tommy picks himself up, raises the 
gun and begins FIRING shots into the air.  People SCREAM, scattering 
like insects, ducking for cover.
		
		TOMMY
	Stop that man!  Stop him!!!

Tommy races through the horrified crowd.  The Stranger keeps moving, 
never once looking back.

Suddenly SIRENS.  Squad cars converge.  Sheriff Holdt and a slew of 
OFFICERS surround Tommy.  Weapons trained.
		
		HOLDT
	Throw down the gun!  Now!!!

Tommy drops the gun.  Puts his arms up in surrender.  The cops swarm 
in, taking him.
		
		TOMMY
	Stop that man!  He's the one!

ANGLE ON FERRIS WHEEL

Beth and Tim exit the ride and follow the crowd toward the flashing 
LIGHTS of the police cruisers.
		
		TIM
	Who's gettin' busted?

Beth is stunned to see Tommy being searched spread-eagle over the 
sheriff's car.
		
		BETH
	Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
		
		TIM
	Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my 
	sister?
		
		BETH
	   (worried)
	Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd 
	better go home and check on them. There's 
	nothing else for us to do here.
		
		TIM
	But they're gonna light the tree in a few 
	minutes --
		
		BETH
	   (suggestively)
	We can light our own tree at home.

She brushes against Tim's crotch and saunters away.  Tim glances 
back at Tommy, then follows her like a hungry puppy.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Kara rushes Danny and the baby inside.  The old spinster close at 
her heels.  Releasing her dark secret.
		
		MRS. BLANKENSHIP
	I was baby-sitting for him that night. Little 
	Mikey Myers from across the street.  That's 
	when the voice told him what to do.  Same as 
	his great- grandfather.
		
		KARA
	His what?!
		
		MRS. BLANKENSHIP
	Eighteen-ninety-five.  A hundred years ago to 
	this night.  All Hallows Eve. Murdered his 
	family in that very same house.  Then the 
	townspeople burned him alive.  Our mother 
	always told us when we were children, 'Don't go 
	near the Myers house.'  We never did.

EXT. HARVEST FAIR - NIGHT (SAME)

The Stranger glides unnoticed among a large crowd gathered for the 
lighting of the Halloween tree.  People putting up umbrellas.  A 
STORM fast approaching.

Hundreds of anxious kids stand beneath the oak tree with open bags 
and pillow cases, waiting for the candy to drop on them.

STALKING P.O.V

MOVING behind the tree where a long-haired figure stands in the 
darkness.  Waiting to make a presentation.

HARRY

turns, sensing a presence.  A knife shoots out of the darkness, 
jabbing him right between the legs.
			
			     CUT TO:

TOMMY

is shoved into the back of the squad car.  Suddenly Loomis appears.  
Prevailing upon the sheriff.
		
		LOOMIS
	Wait!  This boy is being placed in my custody.

Tommy looks out, stunned.
		
		HOLDT
	What are you trying to pull now, Loomis?
		
		LOOMIS
	Uncuff him!  This is a matter of life or death.
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

HARRY

The knife is lifted straight up, splitting his torso in two, eyes 
bugging with shock.  He slumps to the ground in a huge pool of 
blood.
			
			     CUT BACK TO:

TOMMY AND LOOMIS

The sheriff uncuffs Tommy and shoves him out of the car.
		
		HOLDT
	You'd better as fuck have an explanation for 
	this, Doctor.

Loomis begins to usher Tommy through the gaping crowd.
		
		TOMMY
	Dr. Loomis, there's something you should 
	know --

Tommy is prodded forward by Loomis's .357.
		
		LOOMIS
	I know enough already.  Just shut your mouth 
	and take me to that baby.

They move swiftly through the gaping crowd.

ANGLE ON TREE

A growing murmur of concern spreads.  "Where's Harry?"  The children are 
becoming impatient, and the impending STORM isn't doing much to calm 
anyone's nerves.  Harry's people are at a loss to explain their star's 
whereabouts.

ANGLE ON LOOMIS AND TOMMY

On the fringes of the crowd.  Walking away.

"Oohs" and "ahhs" as the tree suddenly comes to life with thousands of 
orange lights.  From the boughs of the tree, ropes are pulled.  Bunting 
tears open, dropping hails of CANDY on the SHRIEKING kids.

Tommy glances back.  His eyes drawn to something.  Grotesque and misshapen.  In the 
tree.
		
		TOMMY
	Oh my God --

ANGLE ON TREE

Kids of all ages scurry around the stage, laughing and screaming as a 
rainbow of candy RAINS down on them.  Diving for it.  Fighting over it.  
Scooping it up in big handfuls.

ANGLE ON TOMMY AND LOOMIS

Tommy instantly breaks away and tears back through the crowd.
		
		LOOMIS
	Tommy!

Loomis goes for him.  Sheriff Holdt sees what is happening and 
flies toward them in pursuit.

ANGLE ON TREE

A BALLERINA looks down at her white pillow case in horrified 
astonishment.  Her hands painted red as she reaches inside.  All 
of her candy is covered with blood!

The other kids back away in revulsion -- the entire stage begins 
to drip with blood!

The adults don't seem to notice what is happening, more concerned 
with the sudden burst of POURING RAIN.

Tommy pushes his way through the crowd, SCREAMING.
		
		TOMMY
	Get them out of there!  Get out!!!

Sheriff Holdt tries to intercept Tommy just as he leaps up onto 
the stage, pushing kids out of the way.

Parents' faces register shock when they see their children running 
toward them, SCREAMING hysterically, soaked with blood.

Loomis sees what Tommy sees.  Words cannot convey the horror in his 
eyes.

Just then, a BOLT OF LIGHTNING ignites the tree.  SPARKS flash.  
Tiny pumpkin lights EXPLODE in a startling chain reaction.

Tommy helps the last of the kids off the stage when something falls 
from the gnarled branches:  a dangling, rotating, wrapped-up thing.  
The mutilated remains of Harry Simms!

Horrified, Tommy dashes headlong off the stage.  Runs with Loomis 
with the trampling crowd.

Struck dumb with terror, Holdt looks out upon the mass destruction.  
The bloody corpse hanging from the tree.  People running, SCREAMING, 
carrying their children toward the exits.

EXT. CAMPUS PARKING LOT (SAME)

Bumper to bumper cars.  Horns BLARING.  Women SCREAMING.  Men SHOUTING.  
Children CRYING.  Pandemonium.

Loomis and Tommy appear out of this jumble of confusion.  More people 
running along the sidewalks.
		
		TOMMY
	Oh, God -- Kara!!!

A car SCREECHES to a halt as Tommy barrels across the street.  Loomis 
right behind him.  Running toward home.

Once again, terror reigns in Haddonfield, Illinois.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Kara shivers as she curls up beside Danny on the futon, holding the 
sleeping baby close at her bosom.  THUNDER rattles the old house.
		
		DANNY
	Mommy, I'm scared.
		
		KARA
	There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another 
	storm.  Try to get some sleep.
		
		DANNY
	I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
		
		KARA
	No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
		
		DANNY
	Promise?
		
		KARA
	   (kisses him)
	I promise.

Kara stands up and goes to the window, looking out into the 
pouring RAIN.

KARA'S P.O.V. - THE MYERS HOUSE

Dark and foreboding.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  Beth's car parked in 
front.

ANGLE ON KARA

She stares at the car, puzzled.  Quickly she moves away from the 
window, heads out the door.

HALLWAY

She KNOCKS loudly on the door across the hall.  A sign that reads:  
"Beth's Place."
		
		KARA
	Beth, are you in there?

She knocks again.  No response.  Another CLAP OF THUNDER.  Kara 
shudders, quickly returns to Tommy's apartment and locks the door.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER (CONTINUOUS)

Sounds of PASSION as we FOLLOW a trail of hastily-discarded costume 
pieces across the darkened foyer.  Tim and Beth are on the stairs, 
half-naked, kissing fervently.
		
		BETH
	   (coming up for air)
	Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
		
		TIM
	   (hot and heavy)
	Guess so ...

Tim nuzzles his face in Beth's chest.  She's feeling apprehensive.
		
		BETH
	What if your parents come home?
		
		TIM
	Then they can watch.

Laughing, they heard up the stairs, kissing, fondling each other.  
Slowly we PULL BACK into the foyer.  THUNDER and LIGHTNING CLASH, 
revealing the Shape, knife held at ready.  Watching.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT (SAME)

She picks up the cordless phone, switches on and dials her home 
number.  We HEAR the phone RINGING on the other end.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Beth collapses with Tim onto Kara's bed.  The PHONE RINGS.  Tim 
ignores it, consumed by passion.  Beth sits up nervously.
		
		BETH
	Aren't you gonna answer that?
		
		TIM
	Answer what?
		
		BETH
	   (fends him off)
	What if it's Kara?

Frustrated, Tim jumps off the bed and stomps into the bathroom, 
taking a candle with him.
		
		TIM
	Fine.  You answer it.  I'll make friends with my soap on a 
	rope.

Tim slams the door.  Beth deliberates her move, then goes to pick 
up the phone.
		
		BETH
	   (into phone)
	Hello?

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara is frantic.  Looking out the window at the Myers house.
		
		KARA

	Mom -- Who is this?

	Kara? ... No, this is Beth.

	Is Tim there?
		
		BETH
	He's in the bathroom.

BATHROOM - SHOWER (CONTINUOUS)

A lighted candle flickers.  Tim waits for the running shower to 
warm up as he does a bare-ass jig over to the sink.

Rinsing off his tooth brush, he elbows out a circle of steam from 
the mirror.  He gasps.  The Shape is standing right behind him!

Before he can react, Tim's head is yanked backwards.  The chilling 
SNAP of his neck is punctuated by a CRASH OF THUNDER.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara can SEE Beth on the phone.  Sitting by the window.
		
		KARA
	I'm across the street.  I can see you. Beth, I want you to 
	listen to me.  Get Tim and get out of that house.  Right 
	now.

Unnoticed by Kara, Danny rises and crosses the room.  Drawn toward 
the door by the irascible voice.
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
	Come to me, Danny ... Come to me.

Beth shifts nervously, looking out across the way at Kara.

THUNDER drowns out the sound of the bathroom door CREAKING open.  The 
Shape advances.
		
		BETH
	Kara, what the hell is going on?

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara's mouth suddenly drops open.  Her mind snaps into sensory overload.  
She can see the Shape walking up behind Beth!  Raising a gleaming 
butcher knife!
		
		KARA
	Beth, look out!  There's someone in the room!  He's right 
	behind you!

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM

Beth drops the phone, eyes bulging as the Shape plunges the knife 
into her back.  She falls, CRASHING against the vanity.

Beth SCREAMS unholy terror.  But the Shape isn't through.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara stands frozen in pure horror, hearing and seeing her friend's 
vicious murder.

Her eyes shoot down.  A little blond-haired boy is walking steadily 
across the street toward the Myers house.

No, it can't be true.  Kara wheels around.  Danny is gone.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW

Danny can be seen below walking toward the house as Beth's 
blood-gurgling SCREAMS fill the room.  The knife repeatedly, 
mercilessly SLASHING down at her.

EXT. STREET / MYERS HOUSE - NIGHT

Kara bolts out of the Blankenship house and races across the street, 
chasing after Danny through RAIN and LIGHTNING.
		
		KARA
	Danny, no!!!

KARA'S P.O.V. - FOLLOWING DANNY

He glides up the porch steps and slips through the front door of the 
Myers house.  Disappearing inside.

KARA

shoots across the lawn.  Up the porch steps.  Right behind him.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER

Kara dives through the front door.  THUNDER shatters the house.  
Everything is frighteningly dark.  Shockingly quiet.

Inch by inch, she makes her way inside.  Eyes wide.  Savage.  
Shaking uncontrollably.  A CRASHING SOUND behind her.  She jumps out 
of her skin.  Just the door SLAMMING shut in the WIND.
		
		KARA
	   (the faintest whisper)
	Danny?

She advances into the hall.  Old floorboards CREAK beneath her feet.  
SOUNDS up ahead.  FOOTSTEPS.

Kara looks up.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  Danny is nearing the top of the 
stairs!

Instinct propels her up the stairs after him.  Then suddenly she stops 
dead.  Reason taking over.  And she turns back.

Picks up a fireplace poker sitting in the corner.  Then she heads back 
up the stairs.  Mind-blown with horror.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Kara reaches the top of the staircase, looking down the dark hallway.  
Summoning all of her courage, she moves forward.

Suddenly Danny darts out from the adjacent hall and disappears inside 
his bedroom -- a fleeting, ghostly image.  Kara startles.  Follows him 
inside.

DANNY'S BEDROOM

Danny stands in a corner.  LIGHTNING illuminates his toy dinosaurs.  
Kara goes to him, takes his hand.  He resists her.
		
		KARA
	   (intense whisper)
	Come on ... Danny, please.

She picks him up, carries him toward the door.  LUMBERING FOOTSTEPS.  
Kara stands paralyzed in the doorway as the Shape stalks down the hall.  
Eyes probing.  Walking right past them.

DANNY'S BEDROOM

Kara slips silently back into the room, carrying Danny through the 
bathroom.  Adjoining on the opposite side into

KARA'S ROOM

LIGHTNING CRACKLES.  The walls are covered with blood.  Kara stumbles 
over something on the floor.  Cranes her neck to look down.

Beth's bloody, mangled remains at her feet.

Shock waves send Kara reeling backwards against the open bathroom door.  
Hanging on a hook is Tim's naked body, eyes open, staring at her in a 
horrified rictus of death.

Kara SCREAMS.  Drops Danny.  Quickly covers her mouth.  Realizing that 
she's given them away.

Suddenly the bedroom door tears open, buckling off its hinges.  The 
Shape bulldozes in, wielding its huge butcher knife!
		
		KARA
	Danny, run!!!

Danny ducks into the hall, evading the Shape's lurching hands.

DANNY

careens down the stairs.  THUNDER RAGES.

KARA

brandishes the fireplace poker at the killer.  The Shape moves in, 
backing her through the bathroom ... into Danny's room.  Suddenly 
she SLAMS the door on the Shape.

Kara tears off into the hallway.  Turns.  Waiting for the Shape to 
appear.  It doesn't.

Kara vacillates down the hall.  Jumping at every sound.  Training her 
weapon at things unseen.  SLAMMING doors along the way, sealing off 
every passageway as she tries to find her way through the impenetrable 
dark tunnel.

Suddenly something CRASHES down from above.  Kara's mother, strung up on 
a bloody sheet, dangling upside-down from the trap door in the ceiling! 
The axe still protruding from her chest.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Kara SCREAMS, shrinking away from the gruesome sight, faltering through 
the blackened doorway behind her.  An unbearable moment of tension as we 
think the Shape's mask will be there.

Suddenly the Shape shoots up directly in front of her!  Tearing the 
dangling corpse from the sheet, dislodging the axe from Debra's chest 
with a repulsive SQUISH.

Kara wheels toward the stairs.  The Shape advances.  Swings the axe.  
Misses her by inches.  Kara ducks, lurches behind the Shape.  Swings 
the fireplace poker with everything she's got.  CRACKING it full-force 
over the back of the Shape's head.

The Shape breaks through the banister and plunges off the landing, 
SLAMMING hard onto the floor below.

Terrified, Kara chances a look down.  The Shape doesn't move.

EXT. STREET / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - NIGHT (SAME)

Tommy's Explorer skids to a stop outside the boarding house.  Loomis and 
Tommy fly up the front path.  Tommy glances back at the blackened Myers 
house for a moment, then follows Loomis inside.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY (SAME)

Kara barrels off the stairs.  Moves cautiously past the Shape.  Sprawled 
face-up in the middle of the hall.

LIVING ROOM

Kara searches for Danny, keeping her eyes trained on the Shape.  The 
little boy appears in the doorway directly across the hall.

The Shape lying in between them.
		
		KARA
	Danny, come to Mommy.

Danny shakes his head.  Too frightened to move.

HALLWAY / FOYER

Ever so slowly, Kara moves toward the threshold.  Hefting the fireplace 
poker, she steps right over the Shape.

Instantly she snatches Danny up in her arms.  Takes one step forward when 
suddenly --
		
		DANNY
	Mommy!!!

The Shape springs up, twisting Kara's ankle.  She falls, splaying forward.  
The Shape claws at her leg.  Kara fights back, kicking herself free of the 
vice-like grip.

Scrambling to her feet, Kara rockets Danny through the foyer to the front 
door -- desperately trying to escape from this real-life house of horrors 
-- only to find that it is locked.

The Shape rises, gleaming butcher knife in hand.

Kara twists the deadbolt, but someone's secured the chain lock!  Too late 
to remove it.  The Shape is right behind them.

Only one way to go.  The cellar.  Kara shoves Danny through.

INT. CELLAR (CONTINUOUS)

Kara and Danny clatter down the rickety stairs and SPLASH across the flooded 
basement floor.

A soul-shuddering POUNDING on the door above.

Kara ushers Danny toward the elevated window.

The cellar door EXPLODES, the Shape's hand breaking through, splintering 
the wood as if it were paper.

Kara HEARS the Shape moving rapidly down the stairs.  Lifts Danny up the 
wall toward the window.  But it's not a wall -- it's John's electrocuted 
body, propped inside a storage cabinet!

Danny SHRIEKS, staring into John's lifeless eyes.  Kara pushes him up.  
Danny reaches for the lock.  Just an inch away.

Kara can't lift him any higher.  The Shape is coming!

Danny hoists himself up just enough to twist the lock.  He pushes the 
window open and clambers outside.

Kara scrambles up old pressboard shelves.  They break under her weight; 
she topples back to the floor.

The Shape wades toward her.  Reaching up for the window.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - BASEMENT WINDOW

Danny watches his mother struggle to climb out of the crypt.
		
		KARA
	Danny, help me!

Kara's hand reaches toward him.  Danny makes no movement.

	Come to me, Danny ... Come to me.

Danny obediently turns and starts to walk away.
		
		KARA
	Danny!!!

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR

Kara's foot falls on the handle of the knife jutting from her father's 
chest.  Uses it to springboard herself half-way through the window.  
Clawing at wet grass.

The Shape's hand shoots out of the darkness below, grabbing at her legs.  
Kara writhes, kicking and SCREAMING.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR WINDOW

Kara grabs chunks of mud as she is pulled back through the window.  The 
Shape yanks hard.  Kara catches herself on the window frame.  Quickly 
losing her grip.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR

The knife swipes downward, swiping her ankle.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR WINDOW

Kara reacts to the searing pain, releasing her grip on the window frame.  
Suddenly Danny appears, locking onto her collar, pulling her clear in one 
massive heave.

Kara shuffles across the ground and picks herself up.  Grabs Danny's hand 
and runs full-tilt around the side of the house.

EXT. STREET / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE

CAMERA FOLLOWS their frenzied flight across the street.  Past Tommy's 
Explorer.  Kara limping.  Danny surging toward the Blankenship house.  Kara 
SCREAMS, pounding frantically on the door.

	Please!  Open the door!

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Tommy and Loomis have turned the apartment upside-down.

Loomis right behind him.

Kara POUNDS furiously.

	Please!  Somebody help us!

Danny huddles beside her, peering out across the street.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - MYERS HOUSE

The Shape trudges boldly down the porch steps -- knife in hand!

BACK TO SCENE

Kara sees the Shape -- walking slowly and deliberately toward them.  Her 
SCREAMS become even more intense.
		
		KARA
	Help us please!!!

The Shape closes in.  At the last second, Tommy throws open the door.  Kara 
and Danny tumble inside.  Into his arms.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY / PARLOR (CONTINUOUS)

Loomis slams and deadbolts the door.
		
		LOOMIS
	Get them upstairs.  Now!

Kara pounds against Tommy's chest.  Hysterical.

	Where's the baby?!
		
		TOMMY
	He's gone.

Kara holds Danny close to her side, backing away in horror as Tommy and 
Loomis go around the parlor, securing the doors and windows.  THUNDER RIPS 
through the darkened room.
		
		TOMMY
	   (continuing)
	Who else knew I had the baby?!
		
		LOOMIS
	No one.
		
		TOMMY
	No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
		
		LOOMIS
	Only me -- 
	   (dark realization)
	-- and Dr. Wynn.

Suddenly the window behind Kara EXPLODES.  She SCREAMS, recoiling.  Then 
the window in front of her.  HANDS reach through.  Tommy shoves her out of 
the way.

ANOTHER HAND shoots through the stained glass window in the front door, 
twists open the lock.

Danny races across the lobby and up the stairs.

Robed figures fill the doorways.  Climbing through windows.  Moving inside 
the house.  Surrounding Loomis.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (continuing)
	Wynn!!!

The robed figures descend on Loomis.  Drops his .357.  Tommy lurches for it, 
to no avail.  Loomis's SCREAM fills the darkness like a fever dream.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (continuing)
	Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
		
		TOMMY
	No!!!

Tommy backpedals up the stairs.  Kara pulling him along as the cloaked 
figures glow toward them.  Daggers raised.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Kara reacts to the SOUND of Danny's VOICE.
		
		DANNY
	Mommy!  Please help me!

Kara rushes through darkness to find him.
		
		KARA
	Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
		
		TOMMY
	Kara, no!

Kara trips and falls.  A pair of silver-tipped black boots planted in 
bold stance.  Slowly she looks up the long duster, the cigarette in the 
gloved hand of the nefarious Stranger -- Dr. Wynn!  Danny stands by his 
side, staring dispassionately.
		
		KARA
	Danny, no ... please ...

Kara picks herself up, shaking her head in unmitigated fear, staggering 
back down the hallway.

She turns to see the black figures overtaking Tommy.  His SCREAMS 
swallowed by hollow darkness.

Alone, Kara careens through another doorway into

TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara slams the door, turns in desperate circles.

Stepping out from behind the door is Mrs. Blankenship -- the baby bundled 
in her arms!
		
		KARA
	Mrs. Blankenship -- Oh, God -- Hurry. We have to --

As Kara reaches for the baby, the old woman raises a dagger.  Her eyes 
burning.  Her wrist branded with the mark of Thorn!

Kara SCREAMS.  The old woman opens the door, allowing the figures to 
enter the room.  Daggers drawn.  CHANTING a dark invocation.

The coven forces Kara backwards.  Nowhere to run.  Nowhere to hide.

Suddenly Kara makes a decision -- and takes a running leap toward the 
window!

EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

Defenestrating herself, Kara SCREAMS, tumbling through the air, bouncing 
off the porch overhang before plunging to the front lawn below.  A 
thousand grass fragments raining down on her.

KARA

lies on her back, eyes close, hands folded over her chest in silent 
repose.  She doesn't move.

THE HOUSE

is still.  Unearthly silence fills the cold October night.
			
			     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

KARA'S P.O.V. - DISTORTED - INT. TUNNELS

A ring of faceless figures move in, completely surrounding her.

Suddenly the feeling of RAPID MOVEMENT.  Glowing torchlight flickers 
across dank walls.

KARA

is being pushed forward on a gurney.  Strapped down.  SCREAMING for God's 
mercy.

TOMMY

is wheeled through another tunnel.  His face a mass of bloody cuts and 
bruises.  His eyes glazed over, trying to find focus.  SLAMMING into 
darkness.

EXT. SANITARIUM - NIGHT

LIGHTNING illuminates the cold, forbidding asylum.  The white van pulls up 
to the security gate.  Headlights illuminate the sign:  "SMITH'S GROVE - 
WARREN COUNTY SANITARIUM."

The main gate cranks open.  The van pulls through.

THE VAN

pulls to a stop near the main building.  The door slides open and Danny 
steps out, surrounded by Smith's Grove staff wearing white jackets.  
Leading him toward the entrance.

LANDING FIELD

The helicopter touches down.  Wynn ducks out, moving in long, even strides 
toward the building.

INT. SANITARIUM CORRIDOR - NIGHT

FOLLOW Wynn through the series of security cages, using his key card to 
BUZZ through.  White coats bringing up the rear.

Through tall mahogany doors, they cross purposefully into the adjacent wing.

EXECUTIVE RECEPTION AREA

Dawn, Wynn's efficient secretary, rises with a congenial smile.
		
		DAWN
	Good evening, Dr. Wynn.  Your -- appointment is waiting 
	inside.

Wynn picks up his messages, then heads straight into the office.  Dawn 
resumes her typing.  Something eerie in her grin.

INT. WYNN'S OFFICE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Wynn and his staff file inside.  Removing his hat and duster, he walks over 
to where Loomis is seated -- shackled to a chair, a bloody slash across 
his forehead.

Seeing this, Wynn snaps angrily at two burly GUARDS.
		
		WYNN
	What is this all about?  Remove those!

The guards comply.  Loomis rubs his aching wrists, glowering.
		
		LOOMIS
	Where's the child?
		
		WYNN
	Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday 
	happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. 
	Somehow I knew you still had it in you.

Loomis sees his .357 resting atop Wynn's desk -- only inches away.  Wynn's 
hand covers it, slips it inside the top drawer.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know 
	how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your 
	upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I 
	felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth. 
	   (gestures to his staff)
	After all, you're the only one around here who's still in 
	the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell 
	you, but you've really given me no other choice.
		
		LOOMIS
	This is madness, Wynn.
		
		WYNN
	Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way 
	things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by 
	your own reality to see. 
	   (beat)
	But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in 
	many ways. 
	   (smiles)
	You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog.  
	Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his 
	work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last 
	time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible 
	time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
		
		LOOMIS
	It was you.
		
		WYNN
	   (lights a cigarette)
	Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
		
		LOOMIS
	Why did you take Jamie?
		
		WYNN
	She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her 
	veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I 
	incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has 
	served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
		
		LOOMIS
	Jamie's baby ...
		
		WYNN
	There you go trying to make sense again. 
	   (grimly entranced)
	It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations.  
	As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
		
		LOOMIS
	Samhain.
		
		WYNN
	And I'm its deliverer. 
	   (slams his key card on the desk)
	Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it.  
	Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.

Loomis shudders, rocked by these revelations.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	I know you have more questions, my friend, and there's so 
	much more for you to try to make sense of.

Loomis is hoisted out of his chair and led out of the office.  Wynn and 
his white coats flow out behind him.

INT. CELL - NIGHT

A tight, damp, claustrophobic space.  Tommy is strapped upright to a crude 
metal rack, not unlike the one Jamie was bound to the night before.

Feverishly he rubs his wrists against a jagged metal edge, cutting through 
skin, wearing away his bonds.  Breaking through.

INT. TUNNELS - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

A group of white coats, led by Wynn, usher Loomis off an old service 
elevator, leading him through the dark passageway.  Wynn turns around, 
surveying the tunnel.  As he walks on, we SEE something fall from his back 
pocket.

As they disappear down another tunnel, a wooden door slowly CREAKS open.  
Tommy appears, cautiously stepping out into the catacombs.  Edging along 
the dank, torch-lit walls.  WIND MOANS.  Rats scamper past his feet.

Wynn has dropped his security key card.  Tommy swipes it.

INT. CATWALK (SAME)

Loomis is led across a narrow precipice overlooking a filthy prison cell.  
The Shape lies inside.  Dormant.

Wynn stares down hypnotically at his most prized possession.  Michael Myers.
		
		WYNN
	Look at him.  So silent, yet so deadly. He moves when I 
	tell him to.  Act on my impulses.  Feels what I feel.

Wynn demonstrates.  Loomis looks on, spellbound.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Michael -- Rise.

Below, the Shape slowly rises.  Wynn takes out his trusted switchblade.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Michael -- Pain.

Wynn cuts his hand.  The Shape grabs his own hand in agony.  Wynn smiles, 
sucking the bleeding gash.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Michael -- Kill.

Suddenly Wynn whirls around, throwing Dawn -- his faithful secretary -- 
inside the Shape's pit.  Wynn watches with hideous delight as her horrified 
SCREAMS trail away into blood-gurgling SILENCE.

Loomis closes his eyes in anguish.
		
		LOOMIS
	You've created a monster.
		
		WYNN
	Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.

Wynn carries on without remorse.  Loomis is brutally shoved forward.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	We're not the only ones, you know. There are many 
	believers -- generous contributors to our church.  You'd be 
	amazed to know how far it reaches.

INT. CATACOMBS - STORAGE BUNKER

A metal door BUZZES open.  Tommy makes his way furtively inside, 
pocketing the key card.

A storage room filled with sawdust and wooden crates.  Tommy pries one of 
them open.  Eyes widening in startled disbelief.

A small arsenal of automatic rifles and ammunition inside.
		
		TOMMY
	Holy shit ...

Tommy lifts a rifle, awed by its devastating lines, then slams in a 
cartridge and bolts out the door.  Back into the tunnels.

INT. CEREMONIAL ROOM - NIGHT

A large, amber-hued chamber.  The CHANTING coven forms a circle around a 
primitive stone altar where Kara is tied down, wearing a white gown, her 
head adorned with a wreath of mistletoe.

A wooden symbol of Thorn, like an inverted crucifix, hangs in a place of 
reverence.

Behind the altar, the Shape stands in its cell.  Waiting.

Loomis is led inside.  Wynn glides through this macabre gathering, up to 
the altar.  Looming over the terrified Kara.

The CHANTING continues as Wynn dons a magnificent ceremonial robe.  At 
Wynn's gesture, there is SILENCE.  The worshippers offer an obedient 
response, removing their hoods, baring the mark of Thorn on their wrists.

We recognize many of the faces in the congregation.  Wynn's staff.  Dr. 
Bonham.  Mrs. Blankenship.  The cross-eyed attendant from the bus depot.  
People from all walks of life.

Faces glazed with sadistic rapture.
		
		WYNN
	   (prophetically)
	Behind, Disciples of Thorn!  The final sign!  The birth of 
	the heretic child, delivered unto us on the eve of our 
	great Feast of the Sun ... as I have foreseen it.

Jamie's baby is carried forth, CRYING as it is lain inside a baptismal urn 
beside Kara.  Ringed by candles and a circle of stones -- eleven in all -- 
etched with symbolic runes.

INT. TUNNELS

Letting the rifle guide him, Tommy makes his way through the tunnels.  
Toward the sound of MUFFLED CHANTING up ahead.

CEREMONIAL ROOM

The coven CHANTS its invocation.  Wynn draws a magic circle around the 
infant with blood from a silver chalice.  Then he inscribes a pentagram in 
the air with an ornate dagger.
		
		WYNN
	Spirits and powers of the flame, attend and witness this 
	ritual.  Bear our gifts to Thorn.  Open us to the path of 
	Darkness.  By these runes transform us. Open our eyes and 
	show us the Chosen One to whom we offer this sacrifice of 
	Innocent Blood.

Suddenly Danny is issued forth up to the altar.  His eyes dark, lifeless 
pools.  Kara struggles against her bonds.
		
		KARA
	Danny!!!

Loomis lurches forward.  Halted by massive, restraining hands.

CATWALK

Tommy moves cautiously along the narrow wooden lip, looking down upon the 
evil ritual.  Startled by the SOUND of rusted chains.  Pulleys CRANKING.  
The Shape's cell being opened.

CEREMONIAL ROOM

The Shape emerges from its cell and slowly walks forward.  Strangely calm.  
Hypnotized.  Looming above Kara.  She lets out a SCREAM of unbridled terror 
as he raises a gleaming dagger.

Wynn stands behind Danny.  Places the dagger in his hand and holds it aloft.
Above the baby.
		
		WYNN
	Strong and fierce Thorn, Thundered, by thy hammer we summon 
	thee and offer this sacrifice of innocent blood.  Let thy 
	Darkness descend on your son. Danny.  Lord of the Dead.

Danny drifts into the dark spell, holding the dagger above the SCREAMING 
infant.  Wynn speaks in the ominous WHISPERING VOICE:
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Kill for him, Danny ... Kill for him.

Kara cries, appealing to the boy inside of Michael.
		
		KARA
	Michael, please.  You can make him stop.  You remember, 
	don't you?

The Shape stares hard at her through the sockets of its mask.  Listening.  
Reminded of his mother.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing)
	Remember what he did to you that night. What his voice told 
	you to do.  You can stop it, Michael.  Stop the voice 
	forever.

Danny's eyes flash like fire.  The CHANTING is insidious.
		
		WYNN
	Kill him, Danny.  Kill him!
		
		KARA
	Danny, don't listen!  The voice isn't real!

Danny turns sharply, seeing his mother.  Suddenly terrified.
		
		WYNN
	Kill him, Danny!  You feel the rage inside!  You are Thorn!

Suddenly Danny drops the dagger.  Wynn flies at him, SCREAMING like an 
enraged beast.  The Shape raises its dagger and plunges it -- into Wynn!

Wynn's eyes go wide with shock.  The Shape lurches empathetically.  Wynn 
staggers, yanks the blade from his stomach.

RAPID-FIRE GUNSHOTS rip through the chamber as Tommy lets loose a barrage 
of bullets from above.  Taking out several coven members, the rest scattering,
retreating into the tunnels.

Loomis dives Danny a split second before he through Kara's bonds with the 
dagger.

Kara springs toward the baby as the room is ripped apart by GUNFIRE.  The 
altar decimated.  Candles falling.  Setting the room ablaze.

Wynn releases the supports which suspend the catwalk.  Wooden girders CRASH 
down from the ceiling.  Tommy pitches to the floor, dropping the rifle.

The Shape staggers, trying to get to its feet.  Slowly.  Painfully.  Flames 
lapping at its back.

Loomis crawls toward the rifle.  Grabs it.  Rises just as Wynn seizes Danny, 
a dagger at his throat.  Pulling him away.
		
		LOOMIS
	No!!!
		
		WYNN
	Stay away, Sam.
		
		LOOMIS
	Leave the boy.  Take me.

Loomis slowly places the rifle down in front of Wynn.  Surrendering himself.

Tommy drags himself toward Kara and the baby.  Paralyzed with horror as they try to 
anticipate Wynn's move.
		
		WYNN
	   (smiles trenchantly)
	Good-bye, Dr. Loomis.

Loomis turns.  Gasps in startled reflex.  The Shape rises up behind him, 
swiping the dagger across his chest!

Wynn retreats and flies through a doorway with Danny.
		
		DANNY
	Mommy!!!
		
		KARA
	Danny!!!

Tommy and Kara race across the flame-engulfed room, reaching the door just 
as it SLAMS shut.  Cutting them off.

The Shape, the trail of flames growing on its back, hurls Loomis over the 
crushed altar.

Tommy sees Loomis writhing on the floor, about to go for him when --

The Shape turns on them!  Tommy stands in front of Kara and the baby, 
backing away, propelling them out into the tunnels.

The Shape walks forward in fevered pursuit, all but consumed by fire.

TUNNELS

Tommy, Kara and Danny race deep into the heart of the tunnel maze.

LOOMIS

painfully crawls away.
		
		LOOMIS
	Die, Michael.  In the name of God, die!

END OF TUNNEL

Tommy, Kara and Danny reach the tunnel end.  Kara pounds frantically on the 
elevator panel.  A DEAFENING ROAR -- the SOUND of fire as the Shape sweeps 
toward them.

THE SHAPE

glides steadily through the tunnels.  A walking pillar of flame.  Undaunted.  
Unstoppable.  Hell-spawned.

END OF TUNNEL

Finally the doors open.  Kara and Tommy barrel inside.  Mashing buttons until 
the doors close -- a millisecond before the Shape reaches them.

INT. ELEVATOR

Kara cradles the baby.  Tommy waits anxiously as the old elevator MOANS and 
GRINDS toward ground level.  The doors open.

INT. SANITARIUM CORRIDOR

They barrel off the elevator and race down a long corridor.
		
		TOMMY
	This way!

Tommy leads her toward an exit sign.  Behind them, the elevator doors close. 
The indicator light shows it moving down.

They reach a dead end.  The row of coded security cages.
		
		KARA
	What now?!
		
		TOMMY
	   (realization)
	Wait a minute ...

He reaches into his pocket -- withdrawing Wynn's key card!

Suddenly the elevator doors open.  FIRE GUSTS.  The Shape emerges, totally 
engulfed in flame.  The emergency sprinklers are activated.  Dousing the 
flames as it walks after them.

Tommy panics, runs the key card.  The gate BUZZES open.  They run through.  
The Shape's hands lurch through the bars, missing Kara by inches.

They race toward the next gate.  The gate behind them opens, and the Shape 
walks through!

Tommy runs the card again.  The gate BUZZES.  They slam it -- one step 
ahead of the Shape.

The third and final gate.  Tommy tries the card.  Nothing!
		
		KARA
	Come on!
		
		TOMMY
	   (tries it again)
	It's not working!

The Shape moves through the last gate.  Inside the cage with them!
		
		TOMMY
	   (continuing)
	Someone's controlling it!

INT. WYNN'S OFFICE (SAME)

Standing behind his computer, observing them on the security monitors, Dr. 
Wynn jams the card's access code.  Then he grabs his satchel and strides 
quickly out of the office.  Pulling Danny with him.

On the screens, we can SEE the Shape approaching.  Kara's SCREAM can almost 
be heard on the silent monitor.

INT. SECURITY CAGE (SAME)

Kara SCREAMS as the Shape rakes Tommy against the cage.  Kara cowers in the 
corner, protecting the baby.

EXT. SANITARIUM - FIELD - NIGHT (SAME)

Wynn races with Danny across the field toward the waiting helicopter.  
Getting ready for take-off as they duck inside.

INT. SECURITY CAGE

The Shape slams Tommy's head against the bars; he slumps to the floor.  Then 
turns its murderous attention on Kara and the baby.

INT. WYNN'S OFFICE

A hand reaches into the top desk drawer, removes the .357 and FIRES an entire 
round into the security console.  Destroying it.

The man holding the gun is Loomis.

INT. SECURITY CAGE

The door BUZZES open.  Kara drags Tommy and the baby out.  Slamming the door 
shut on the Shape.  Trapping it inside.

The Shape lurches against the bars in wild paroxysms.

EXT. SANITARIUM - LANDING FIELD

Tommy comes to as he races with Kara and the baby across the windswept field.  
Suddenly they stop dead, watching in horror as the helicopter lifts off.

Kara stands paralyzed with shock, looking skyward.  The helicopter disappears 
into the gloom-filled night.

Tommy drags Kara in another direction.  A vehicle parked nearby.  The white 
van.

INT. VAN (SAME)

Kara lifts the baby inside.  Tommy flops down in the driver's seat.  Face 
bruised and bloody.  A key in the ignition.

Kara holds Jamie's baby.  Tears falling.
		
		KARA
	How will we ever find him?

Tommy's gaze terrifies her.  He starts the engine and tears off toward the 
sanitarium gate.

Kara looks down at the baby, then stares numbly forward.

In the back of the van, we can SEE the the Shape's white mask.  Glowing in 
the darkness.  Emerging.

Kara and Tommy drive on, unaware.  And that, for now, is how we leave them.
			
			     FADE OUT.

                me... do you know...?  That I've Waited
                Too Long...

                          DRUMGO
                ...what? 

                          STARLING 
                I said how's your baby...? 

                          DRUMGO 
                You want to hold him...?

                'bout time you learned... 

     SHE HANDS THE BABY TO STARLING. 

     SHE GOES INTO THE CHILD'S DIAPERBAG AND TAKES OUT A PISTOL,
     AND LEVELS IT AT STARLING, AS SHE MOVES TO LOOK OUT THE
     WINDOW. 

                          DRUMGO (cont'd) 
                ...where's your friends...? 

     SHE MOVES TO STARLING, AND FRISKS HER, AND REMOVES HER
     PISTOL, AND THE TRANSMITTER FROM THE BELT AT HER BACK...

                          STARLING
                Give it up, Evelda.

                          DRUMGO 
                Well, you know my name, honey, but I
                don't know yours... 

                          STARLING
                Give it up. 

                          DRUMGO
                Hey, you know, I never thought of
                that... 

     SHE STARTS GETTING INTO THE NURSES GARB. 

                          DRUMGO (cont'd) 
                Ain't this a picture, though, cause you
                know you ain't the first girl, ever got
                lef, in a position, waiting at the 
                doctor's.  You can't trust men, child,
                don't you know that.... old as you
                are...? 

     SHE WALKS BACK TOWARD STARLING, SCOOPS UP HER CHILD, PEEKS
     OUT THE WINDOW, AND STARTS FOR THE DOOR. 

                          DRUMGO (cont'd) 
                Cause, see, they'll always let you down.
                Terrible thing, to do to an orphan... 

     SHE LEANS BACK TOWARD STARLING, GRABS HER HAIR, AND PULLS HER
     BACK AND KISSES HER ON THE LIPS, AND RETIRES AND EXITS.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS OUT OF THE WINDOW.  AT A CAR, WHICH
     IS IN THE FAR END OF THE PARKING LOT, IT ACCELERATES, AND
     SCREECHES UP TO THE DOOR, AND EVELDA, CARRYING HER CHILD,
     GETS IN TO THE STILL MOVING CAR, WHICH STARTS TO TAKE OFF.

     ANGLE EXT THE MIDWIVES CENTER.

     STARLING, CROUCHING AT THE DOOR, RETRIEVES A BACKUP WEAPON

     SITS ON A LOW CONCRETE DIVIDER.  HOLD.  A VAN PULLS IN. 
     FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER CAR, AND TEN SWAT CLAD COPS PILE OUT,
     AND APPROACH STARLING.

     STARLING SLOWLY LOOKS UP. 

                          STARLING 
                ....where were you...? 
                    (SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH. )

                    (AS SHE HANDS HIM THE SMALL
                     RADIO TRANSMITTER) 
                Yeah, well, you didn't get it cause your
                radio went dead.  The backup plan was,
                17.45, you guys are the Cavalry... 

     SHE GETS UP AND WALKS AWAY FROM THE DOORSTEP, TO A SEDAN,
     WHICH IS PULLING UP.  AS SHE GOES, SHE TAKES OFF THE FAKE
     BELLY SHE HAS BEEN WEARING.

     ANOTHER SWAT AGENT TAKES THE RADIO AND LOOKS AT IT.

                          SECOND SWAT OFFICER 
                ...what'd you do, sweat it out, short 
                out the leads...?  Got a little hot in
                there.....? 

     SHE FLINGS THE FAKE STOMACH AT HIM.

                          SECOND SWAT OFFICER (cont'd) 
                ...what happened to Right to Life...?
                    (HE LAUGHS) 

     STARLING ROUNDS ON HIM, HITS HIM SEVERAL TIMES, AND THROWS
     HIM TO THE GROUND.

                          STARLING 
                What happened to Right to Life?  What 
                happened to right to my life...?  I'm in
                there, carrying the mail for all you 
                drugstore cowboys, si'in in a van playin

                    (THE OFFICER STARTS TO GET UP) 
                You wanna get up, you wanna get up?
                Here I am... 

     TWO FBI TYPES GET OUT OF THE NEWLY ARRIVED SEDAN. 

                          FBI TYPE
                What happened to the girl...? 

                          STARLING 
                    (AS SHE GETS INTO THE SEDAN)
                Get me out of here... 

     INT CONFERENCE ROOM FBI HEADQUARTERS DAY. 

     STARLING IS NOW DRESSED IN A T-SHIRT AND JEANS.  SHE HAS
     CLEANED HERSELF UP.  KRENDLER, A CLEAN-CUT STUDENT COUNCIL
     TYPE AROUND FORTY IS HOLDING FORTH.  AROUND THE CONFERENCE
     TABLE ARE THE FATHERLY JACK CRAWFORD, AND VARIOUS OTHER
     POLITICOS. 

     KRENDLER GESTURES AT THE TABLE, WHICH HOLDS THE BURNT OUT
     RECEIVER, THE FAKE "PREGNANT" STOMACH WORN BY STARLING, 
     AND A PHOTO, HE HOLDS THE PHOTO.  WE SEE IT IS DRUMGO, A
     SURVEILLANCE PHOTO. 

                          KRENDLER 
                And you let her get away. 

                          STARLING 
                Sir, with all due respect.... 

                          CRAWFORD 
                Just a moment.  Starling didn't... 

                          KRENDLER 
                Well, well, well, well, well, she went 
                in there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon.
                Went in there with her gun, Came out,
                without the Felon, without the gun... 

     STARLING STARTS TO SPEAK, AND CRAWFORD STILLS HER. 

                          CRAWFORD 
                I had... one moment, I had an agent in
                there, waiting for backup from... 

                          KRENDLER 
                ...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where 
                is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..? 

                          STARLING
                Sir: 

                          CRAWFORD 
                Shut up, Starling... 

                          STARLING 
                I could have acted on my own.  I was
                told... 

                          CRAWFORD 
                Starling, I've ordered you to shut... 

                          STARLING 
                ..I was instructed that this was a 
                Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the
                Mayor's Special... 

                          KRENDLER 
                You find something objectionable to
                working in partnership with.... 

                          STARLING 
                Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out
                there, dealing with an armed and
                dangerous... 

                          KRENDLER 
                You were given backup....

                          STARLING 
                THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out 
                there... I'm told that the arrest must
                be a joint... 

                          KRENDLER
                I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that. 

                          STARLING 
                And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a 
                Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance
                to Play, that's fine, but... 

                          KRENDLER
                No, I don't get you... 

                          STARLING 
                Due respect, you don't, sir, your 
                precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC
                SWAT, it's alphabet soup, we don't have
                the same Radio Freqs, we don't... 

                          KRENDLER 
                Oh, is this your political position,
                you're opposed to Joint... 

                          STARLING 
                I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow
                Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of 
                took her down in a snap of the fingers--
                But-- I'm out there, and my Rules of 
                Engagement...

                          MAYOR'S REP 
                The Rainbow Coalition, what is that,
                excuse me... 

                          KRENDLER 
                And what are you, our Token Woman? 

                          STARLING 
                I don't mind being the token woman, what 
                I'm suggesting, send me out there with a
                token man... who are these Warriors, 
                ¥our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm
                in the room with a fugitive felon... 

                          CRAWFORD
                Starling...? 

                          STARLING 
                One moment, and they're at the Seven- 
                Eleven.  They botched the fallback plan,
                they... 

                          KRENDLER 
                And, fine, alright, and fine... what are
                youdoing, this whole time? 

                          STARLING 
                Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for
                the Arrival of the Strike Force.
                    {PAUSE) 

                          CRAWFORD

                     MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP)
                Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen... 

                          KRENDLER 
                And how did she get close enough to
                disarm you?

     ANGLE TIGHT ON STARLING, AS SHE BEGINS TO EXIT, MUTTERING.

                          STARLING 
                ...spend some time on the streets.  Ask 
                me then...

                          KRENDLER 
                Thank you, that's not responsive.  How
                did our Miss Drumgo get... 

     ANGLE EXT THE CONFERENCE ROOM.  A CORRIDOR AT FBI HQ.
     VARIOUS MEMORABILIA IN GLASS CASES, GLASS CASES HOLDING

     ESCORTED BY A GUIDE. 

     ONE GOOD-LOOKING MEDITERRANEAN TYPE (PAZZI) TRIES TO LOOK
     AT STARLING AS THE GROUP GOES PAST. 

     ANGLE CU ON PAZZI. 

     WE SEE HIM, AND READ THE NAMETAG.  (C. PAZZI.

     ANGLE, ON THE GROUP AS THEY OPEN THEIR BLUE COURSE STUDY
     GUIDE. 

     STARLING AND CRAWFORD TURN A CORNER.  PAZZI LOOKING AFTER
     THEM, HE THEN, RELUCTANTLY, TURNS AWAY, BACK TO THE GROUP
     HE IS PART OF.

     ANGLE ON STARLING AND CRAWFORD, AS THEY DRAW AWAY FROM THE
     CONFERENCE ROOM GROUP.

                    (SOTTO) 
                ...how'd you let her get that close to 
                you...? 

     IN THE B.G. WE SEE AN AIDE COME UP TO KRENDLER, AND HAND
     HIM A FILE.  STARLING WAVES OFF CRAWFORD'S QUESTION. 

                          CRAWFORD (cont' d) 
                ...how'd she get next to you?

                ...she gave me her baby. 

     KRENDLER, AND THE AID WALK TOWARD CRAWFORD.  THE AIDE
     WHISPERS SOMETHING TO KRENDLER. 

                          KRENDLER
                    (TO CRAWFORD) 
                She threw a punch at a man on the team. 

                          CRAWFORD 
                Well, you know, that happens, on the
                street. 

                          KRENDLER 
                What is that supposed to mean...? 

                          CRAWFORD 
                I think its meaning is clear. 

                          KRENDLER 
                What, you're saying she was overwrought. 

                          CRAWFORD
                That could be. 

                          KRENDLER 
                Because that's understandable, because.
                She blew the raid. 

                          CRAWFORD 
                She was there, alone, sir, she was in a
                burning building, waiting for your folks
                to come through the wall.  And... 

     STARLING STARTS AWAY, IN DISGUST. 

                          KRENDLER 
                One moment, I'm not done with you...
                    (TO CRAWFORD, AS KRENDLER

     THEY GO INTO A HUDDLE, AND STARLING MOVES AWAY, WAITING.
     SHE LOOKS AROUND, AND SHE AND WE DISCOVER SHE IS STANDING
     IN FRONT OF THE "LECHTERIANA" SECTION OF THE FBI DISPLAY.
     THE GUIDE IS ADDRESSING THE VISITING FOREIGN COPS.

     SMALL RAISED BLEACHER SECTION OPENS, AND STARLING COMES IN,

                And, in a gunfight, what just happened 
                to the Big Man?  He's at a disadvantage.
                Inney? 

     HE MOVES TO THE GROUP OF STUDENTS, AND APPROACHES A RATHER
     LARGE YOUNG MAN.

                don't want to shoot me, you just deprived 
                yourself of one of your hands.  You fool,
                I got two hands, you got one.  So: 
                what's the gun good for?  Force?  No. 
                It's good for control.  You can control
                through force, but you can also control

     INT PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE DAY. 

     STARLING IS TALKING TO A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN.

                          WOMAN
                    (PSYCHIATRIST) 
                ..that you went into police work to
                control your rage....

     STARLING STARTS TO LAUGH.

                          STARLING 
                Well, that would be a poor choice,
                wouldn't it... 

                          PSYCHIATRIST
                Tell me why...? 

                          STARLING 
                    (SHAKES HER HEAD, STILL
                     LAUGHING) 
                I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. 
                Because, you know, you can't understand. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST
                Then tell me. 

                          STARLING 
                Well, you know, you know, you know, the
                point is:  I can't tell you.  Cause you 
                haven't been there.  You haven't done it.
                And that's all there is. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST 
                    (PAUSE.  SHE CHECKS HER NOTES) 
                ...and to have done it, means, can mean 
                to accept, not only danger, but 
                betrayal...?

                          STARLING
                ....that's right. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST 
                ..and humiliation?  What is this new 
                job they've...? 

                          STARLING 
                No.  That's right.  That's all part of
                it. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST 
                Then, that being so, why is today 
                special?  Why have you come back to see 
                me?  Is it that new file they gave you? 

                          STARLING
                I don't think so. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST 
                Then what brings you back? 

                          STARLING

                     PLEASE, REVEAL IT)
                I think it is a phrase you used with
                that woman.  You told her you were an
                orphan.

                     HEAD) 
                You used, to your mind, your most 
                private fears.

     STARLING IS DRINKING WITH ARDELIA MAPP, A CONTEMPORARY, AND
     ARDELIA'S BOYFRIEND, JIM.  THERE ARE VARIOUS EMPTY BOTTLES
     IN FRONT OF THEM.

     STARLING IS LOOKING DOWN AT THE FILE WE SAW EARLIER, AND
     SCOWLING. 

     MAPP AND JIM LOOK ON.  A WAITRESS COMES BY. 

                          MAPP 
                You want another drink, honey...? 

                          STARLING 
                I want the same drink.  Cause it did me
                good... but I already drunk it, so,
                barring that, yes, I would like another. 

     THE WAITRESS EXITS. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                B'cause it's one of the few things, in

                Hey, I'm fine.  Whaddizit, you, how's
                your day, our gallant International
                Neighbors...? 

                          MAPP 
                Look what they put her on... 

     SHE TAKES THE FILE FROM STARLING AND HANDS IT TO BRIGHAM.

                          STARLING 
                No, that is code-word material, that's 
                what that is....

     ANGLE ON BRIGHAM AS HE PICKS UP THE FILE. IT CONTAINS A 
     CATALOGUE FROM AN AUCTION HOUSE, AND WE READ:  FROM A
     COLLECTOR:  DRAWINGS AND SKETCHES BY HANNIBAL LECHTER:
     THESE NEVER-BEFORE OFFERED ITEMS WERE ORIGINALLY IN THE HIGH-
     SECURITY CELL OF THE MASS KILLER... (ETC.) 

     AND, BELOW, WE SEE VARIOUS ARCHITECTURAL SKETCHES.

     ANGLE ON STARLING, BRIGHAM, AND SO FORTH.

                          MAPP 
                They got her cleaning out the privvies. 

                          BRIGHAM 
                    (OF THE AUCTION CATALOGUE)
                What does this mean?

                          MAPP
                Slap her wrist, they got her, chasing
                down the auction houses, drawings of
                Mr.Lechter, come up for sale. 

                          BRIGHAM
                Why's she chasing'em down...? 

                          MAPP
                Find out:  is he selling'em, he needs the
                money, o'r'izzey buying them, f'Old Times
                sake... 

                          BRIGHAM 
                That's weak.  The man's long gone, he's
                not coming back, buy up a drawing... 

                          STARLING 
                No, but that is the Will of the 
                Institution.  To instill a proper 
                Probity, Humility, deference, in the 
                prideful Individual.....COULD I, DOES
                ANYONE THINK, HAVE ANOTHER BEER...?

                          STARLING 
                COULD I GET A DRINK,
                    (TO BRIGHAM) 
                N'I don't care, you see, what all they 
                got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' 
                makework, than be doin' pub'l'relations
                with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one Hispanic, one
                Librarian, one Jew, and One from Column
                A, and One from Column...

                     SHE REACHES FOR IT.  SHE
                     LOOKS UP.)
                Thank you.

                          STARLING 
                No, y'know, I never doubted it... 

                          PAZZI 
                You were kind enough, today, to take my
                photograph. 

                          STARLING 
                Well, that's you see, what I am, kind
                and feeling. 

                          MAPP 
                You should get Married.

                          STARLING
                That's what I should do.  Tell me why? 

                          MAPP 
                Because, baby, you're looking to find 
                love in an institution, that's your only
                chance.... 

                          STARLING 
                Yeah, but who would marry friendless
                me...

                          PAZZI 
                But perhaps, there is some, some less
                radical solution. 

                          STARLING 
                I'm sure there is, but my young Friend

                     AND KNOCKS THE FILE OFF OF
                     THE TABLE) 

     ANGLE INS.

     IT FALLS TO THE FLOOR, WE SEE VARIOUS AUCTION CATALOGUES,
     AND AN X-RAY OF A HUMAN HAND.  PAZZI STOOPS AND GATHERS THE
     FILE UP.

     BRIGHAM TAKES THE FILE, AND STARLING TAKES IT FROM HIM.

     ANGLE IN.

     WE SEE A DRAWING OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE A STATUARY.  A 
     LION'S HEAD, THE LION HOLDING A BIRD IN ITS MOUTH.

     ANGLE ON STARLING AS SHE HOLDS THE DRAWING.

                          STARLING 
                ...this one is my favorite.  It has not
                title.  They should call it "fetch,"

                I know it well. 

                          STARLING

                          PAZZI 
                It is a gravestone in the cemetery of
                ______ in my native Florence. 

     MAPP LOOKS AT THE PICTURES IN THE CATALOGUE.

                          MAPP 
                Yeah, we got all sort of "funeray 
                Sculpture," here, I guess they mean

                          STARLING 
                Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as
                I'm sure, that's a "clue"...

                          STARLING 
                I din't solve it, I didn't 'solve it'.  I
                just sat a dance out with him.  Facts,

     STARLING SURREPTITIOUSLY SIGNALS BRIGHAM THAT HE MAY REMOVE PAZZI.

     HE WALKS PAZZI OFF, STUFFING SOME MONEY IN PAZZI'S JACKET
     POCKET. 

     HE LEAVES PAZZI AMONG HIS FOREIGN COHORTS.

     ANGLE ON MAPP, STARLING, AND JIM, AT THEIR TABLE.

                          MAPP 
                Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, 
                you're gonna bump it, every time you
                turn around... but you know what the
                trick is...? 

                          STARLING 
                ...not to turn around. 

     BRIGHAM RETURNS, AND STARTS TO LEAD STARLING, THROUGH THE
     KNOT OF DRUNKEN COPS.

     IN THE BG WE SEE PAZZI, AT HIS TABLE, POINTING OUT 
     STARLING, THEY TURN TO LOOK AT HER, WE SEE ONE OF THE 
     FOREIGN COPS, LEAN OVER TO ASK MORE INFORMATION OF PAZZI, 
     AND, THEN, TURN BACK, TO DO A DOUBLETAKE AT THE RETREATING STARLING. 

     ANGLE 

     ON BRIGHAM, HELPING STARLING.

                          BRIGHAM 
                You want to get married...?

                          STARLING
                I'm not. 

                          BRIGHAM 
                That's what you think... 

     EXT STARLING'S APARTMENT BUILDING NIGHT. 

     BRIGHAM AND STARLING WALKING UP, STARLING SWAYING A LITTLE,
     HE HOLDS OUT HIS HAND FOR THE KEY, AND SHE GIVES IT TO HIM. 

                          STARLING
                ...mos kind... 

     WE HEAR A CAR COMING UP THE STREET BEHIND THEM.

     BRIGHAM OPENS THE DOOR. 

     THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE.  AS 
     STARLING IS ABOUT TO ENTER.  SHE PUSHES BRIGHAM OFF TO THE
     SIDE OF THE DOOR, AND UNHOLSTERS HER PISTOL. 

     BEAT. 

     STARLING LOOKS AT BRIGHAM WHO LOOK UNCOMPREHENDING.  ANOTHER
     CAR IS HEARD COMING UP THE ROAD, AND WE SEE ITS HEADLIGHT 
     SHINE ON AND REFLECT FROM A MIRROR INSIDE STARLING'S DOOR. 

     BRIGHAM LEADS STARLING INTO THE HOUSE. 

     HE CLOSES THE DOOR, AND TAKES HER TO THE SOFA. 

     SHE SITS, AND PICKS UP A PHOTOGRAPH IN AN EASELFRAME FROM THE 
     COFFEETABLE. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                Hey, now, what was I afraid of... I'm 
                shooting at shadows... 

                          BRIGHAM 
                Is that what you're afraid of...? 

     ANGLE INS ON THE PHOTOGRAPH, SHOWS A TALL HANDSOME MAN IN
     WESTERN HAT, WEARING A BADGE, HIS HAND ON THE SHOULDER OF A
     YOUNG BLONDE GIRL.

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE PUTS THE PHOTO DOWN. 

                          STARLING 
                Then you tell me, then. 

                          BRIGHAM

                          STARLING 
                How crazy is that. 

                          BRIGHAM 
                Well, you wanna shoot back, it give you a
                big target...

                How crazy is that....

     ANGLE, INS. ON THE LECHTER FILE, AND THE PHOTO OF HANNIBAL
     LECHTER. 

     WE SEE BRIGHAM PUT IT DOWN ON THE TABLE NEXT TO THE PHOTO.
     HOLD, LIGHTS GO OFF. 

     BEAT.  STARLING'S HAND COMES INTO THE FRAME, SWEEPS THE
     LECHTER PHOTO AND FILE ONTO THE FLOOR, AND REPLACES IT WITH
     THE PHOTO OF THE WESTERN GARBED MAN AND THE LITTLE BLONDE
     GIRL. 

     BEAT. 

     THE LIGHT GOES ON AGAIN. 

     WE SEE STARLING SWING TO A SITTING POSITION ON THE COUCH. 
     SHE SIGHS.  SHE SHAKES HER HEAD TO CLEAR IT, AND SHE PULLS
     THE HANNIBAL FILE TO HER.  SHE PICKS UP A PENCIL, AND A PAIR 
     OF READING GLASSES FROM THE TABLE, AND BEGINS MAKING NOTES
     ON THE FILE. 

     ANGLE INS.

     HANNIBAL LECHTER MATERIAL."

     EXT VIRGINIA HIGHWAY DAY. 

     STARLING'S FBI SEDAN SPEEDING PAST, ON AN EMPTY COUNTRY ROAD.

     THE CAR PULLS OVER ONTO THE SHOULDER.

     ANGLE INT THE CAR. 

     STARLING, TAKING OUT A MAP.  SHE LOOKS AT THE MAP.  LOOKS 
     AROUND.  SHE THROWS THE CAR INTO REVERSE, AND REVERSES
     SEVERAL HUNDRED YARDS QUICKLY. 

     ANGLE INT THE CAR. 

     STARLING LOOKS FROM THE MAP ACROSS THE ROAD.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     A BARELY DISCERNIBLE BREAK IN THE FOLIAGE, BEAT, THEN 
     STARLING' S CAR PULLS ACROSS THE ROAD, AND INTO THE POV AND
     ENTERS THE BREAK. 

     ANGLE EXT THE CAR. 

     EMERGING FROM A THICK WOODS, THE CAR IS HINGED BY THE CAMERA
     ONTO THE PARK OF A COUNTRY ESTATE, THE CAR DISAPPEARS INTO A
     SMALL DIP IN THE LANDSCAPE.

     ANGLE EXT THE CAR, AT A GATEHOUSE, PREVIOUSLY HIDDEN BY THE
     CONTOUR OF THE LAND.  WE SEE A SMALL DECREPIT GATEHOUSE IN
     STONE, AND, BEYOND IT, A FLIMSY AND ANCIENT BARRICADE, AN
     OLD GAMEKEEPER TYPE IN TWEEDS COMES OUT OF THE GUARDHOUSE.
     HE IS CARRYING A MUG OF COFFEE AND HAS A NAPKIN TUCKED INTO
     HIS COLLAR.  HE REMOVES THE NAPKIN AND APPROACHES THE CAR. 

     STARLING FLASHES HER CREDENTIALS TO THE OLD MAN, WHO HOLDS
     A CLIPBOARD. 

                          STARLING 
                Special Agent Clarice Starling, to see
                Mason Verger. 

     THE MAN AMBLES BACK INTO THE GATEHOUSE.

     ANGLE INT THE GATEHOUSE, THE OLD MAN ENTERS, AND CAMERA
     PULLS BACK TO SHOW, IN A ROOM OFF THE MAIN ROOM, THE FIT
     BODYGUARD TYPES, WATCHING STARLING ON A TV MONITOR.  THERE IS
     A RAFT OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT IN THE ROOM, AND A RACK WITH
     SEVERAL ASSAULT RIFLES ON IT.  ONE OF THE GUARDS IS TYPING
     ONTO A COMPUTER TERMINAL.  HE LOOKS AT THE RESULT, AND
     GLANCES UP AT STARLING, ON THE SCREEN, AND NODS "OKAY" TO THE
     OLD MAN.  THE OLD MAN AMBLES OUT TO THE BARRIER, HAVING
     PICKED UP AN OLD CLIPBOARD AT WHICH HE SQUINTS. 

     THEN, SATISFIED, HE RAISES THE BARRIER, AND STARLING'S CAR
     GOES THROUGH.

     EXT A MAGNIFICENT COUNTRY ESTATE HOUSE.

     A POTATOCHIP VAN IS PARKED TO ONE SIDE IN THE WIDE DRIVE.
     AN OLD RETAINER HOLDS OPEN THE DOOR FOR STARLING, AS SHE
     EXITS FROM HER SEDAN, AND HE SHOWS HER INTO A LARGE 
     OPEN MORNING ROOM, IN WHICH WE FIND TWENTY YOUNG CHILDREN
     OF VARIOUS RACES, ROMPING ON A SELECTION OF NEW TOYS. 

     CAMERA TAKES STARLING THROUGH A MODERN KITCHEN, WHERE 
     SEVERAL WHITE UNIFORMED COOKS ARE WORKING HAPPILY, ONE IS
     OPENING A VAST TIN OF POTATOCHIPS.  ONE OF THEM IS REMOVING A
     TRAY OF COOKIES FROM THE OVEN, SEVERAL TYKES WAIT HAPPILY
     NEARBY.  THE COOK WITH THE TRAY OF COOKIES GIVES STARLING
     A WIDE GRIN.

     THE RETAINER TAKES STARLING PAST THE KITCHEN, TO A DOUBLE
     DOOR, WHICH HE OPENS TO REVEAL A CORRIDOR BEYOND, AND A 
     LARGE FIT MAN IN HIS THIRTIES, WEARING AN ORDERLY'S WHITES,
     COMING TOWARD THE CAMERA.

                          CORDELL 
                Agent Starling, would you come with
                me...? 

     CORDELL BOWS TO THE OLD RETAINER, WHO RETIRES.

     CORDELL AND STARLING WALK DOWN THE CORRIDOR.

                          STARLING 
                The children...? 

                          CORDELL 
                ...they're from Baltimore.... 

                          STARLING 
                I've never heard that he... 

                          CORDELL 
                It's not something he wants to 
                publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he
                does. 

     BEAT. 

                          STARLING 
                I won't take much of his time. 

                          CORDELL 
                He's glad to help.  ...it's just a 
                question of his physical condition.  You
                Understand... 

     CAMERA TAKES STARLING DOWN A CORRIDOR LINED WITH
     HUNTINGPRINTS.  AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR AN OLD WOMAN
     SITS IN A WOODEN CHAIR, KNITTING. 

     THEY HAVE STOPPED.  WAITING FOR THE WOMAN TO LOOK UP. 
     STARLING'S GAZE IS DRAWN BY AN OLD, CREWEL-WORK "SAMPLER"
     FRAMED ON THE WALL BY THE OLD WOMAN'S CHAIR.  AND OBVIOUS
     ANTIQUE.  IT READS: 

     "DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY.  DO NOT TRUST TO PROSPERITY."

     ANGLE ON CORDELL AND STARLING, AS STARLING LOOKS AT THE
     SAMPLER, AND THE OLD WOMAN LOOKS UP FROM HER KNITTING. 

     SHE SITS IN FRONT OF A HALF-OPENED DOOR, WHICH WE SEE IS
     THE DOOR TO A LINEN CLOSET.

                          CORDELL (cont'd)
                ...y'get enough breakfast, Rosie...? 

     BEAT.  XCU ON THE OLD WOMAN, AS SHE LOOKS AT STARLING, AND 
     THEN NODS TO CORDELL, AS IF TO SAY, "THAT IS THE CORRECT 
     CODE."

     ANGLE INS.

     HER HAND DROPS TO THE BACK OF THE WOODEN CHAIR, AND PRESSES 
     A BUTTON CONCEALED IN THE LEG.

     ANGLE 

     THE GROUP IN THE CORRIDOR, THE "LINEN CLOSET," OPENS, TO 
     REVEAL, BEYOND IT, WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SURGICAL FACILITY,
     OR HIGH-TECH HOSPITAL ROOM. 

     INT THE HIGHTECH ROOM.

     THERE IS A NURSE, SITTING AT A STATION, MONITORING VARIOUS
     LIFESIGN DISPLAYS.  SHE LOOKS UP BRIEFLY, AS CORDELL AND
     STARLING ENTER . 

                          NURSE
                    (TO CORDELL) 
                Five minutes... 

     CORDELL NODS, AND TAKES STARLING DEEPER INTO THE ROOM.  WE
     BEGIN TO HEAR THE SUSURRUS OF A MECHANICAL BREATHING
     APPARATUS.  CAMERA GOES WITH STARLING INTO THE ROOM, WHERE WE
     SEE A HOSPITAL BED, WITH A SCREEN IN FRONT OF IT, AND 
     VARIOUS TELEVISION DISPLAYS ABOVE IT, ANGLED TO BE SEEN FROM
     THE BED. 

     STARLING APPROACHES THE BED, AND LOOKS DOWN AT THE FIGURE
     IN IT.  WE SEE HER FACE, BUT THE FIGURE IS SCREENED.  THE
     FIGURE, VERGER, SPEAKS BREATH BY BREATH, WITH AN OBVIOUS
     ELECTRONIC ENHANCEMENT.

                          VERGER 
                Aren't they beautiful, Miss Starling... 

     STARLING LOOKS UP AT THE CHILDREN PLAYING.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     ONE OF THE CHILDREN FALLS OFF A SMALL PLASTIC SLIDE, AND 
     CRIES, A NURSE RUNS TO HIM.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                Well, now, you see, one of them's hurt.
                And what will make it better?  Love.
                Isn't that odd.
                    (PAUSE) 
                He think's he's hurt his knee--but the 
                assurance, the assurance, the assurance
                that someone cares  (WHEEZE WHEEZE)
                Suggests the hurt was elsewhere. 

                          STARLING 
                Mr. Verger, thank you for your time. 

                          VERGER 
                For the worst hurt, of course, that 
                which will not heal, is the conviction
                no one cares.

                          STARLING 
                I've come to see you, sir, about an
                Auction... 

     SHE HOLDS UP THE CATALOGUE TO HIM.

     ANGLE INS 

     "DRAWINGS AND MEMORABILIA RELATING TO THE SERIAL KILLER, 
     HANNIBAL LECHTER."

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, AS HE COMES CLOSE, DONNING SURGICAL GLOVES, AND 
     TAKES THE CATALOGUE, AND HOLDS IT TOWARD VERGER. 

                          VERGER
                Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter...
                And have they sent you, once again to
                capture him?  How terrible for you... 

                          STARLING 
                No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why
                do you say how terrible? 

                          VERGER 
                Because we must leave the past in the
                past.  (WHEEZE WHEEZE) 
                    (CORDELL TURNS A PAGE) 
                Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes,
                my own encounter with him...

     CORDELL TURNS THE PAGE QUICKLY. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                No, no.  That's alright.  Yes.  Lechter's
                drawings of me.  Before... and, of 
                course, after... Now:  you are not sent
                to pursue him.  Then your visit baffles
                me. 

                          STARLING 
                Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. 
                Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the
                prison after his escape, have surfaced 
                and are being sold at auction.  Several
                large reserve bids have been placed on
                them.  I have to ask if you've placed
                those bids. 

                          VERGER
                Because? 

                          STARLING 
                Because if it was not you, then, perhaps
                it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim
                his own property. 

                          VERGER 
                And why would you suspect me, of this
                ghoulishness? 

                          STARLING
                Because, sir, you are the only one of his
                victims who lived.  And because you have 
                large resources. 

                          VERGER 
                Large resources, Starling, which I prefer 
                to devote elsewhere....

     STARLING LOOKS UP, AS WE SEE THE IMAGE ON THE TELEVISION 
     CHANGE TO THE CHILDREN EATING THE COOKIES, AND THE IMAGE
     CHANGES AGAIN TO SHOW A SMALL DISPENSARY, AND THE KNEE OF THE
     CHILD WHO FELL BEING BANDAIDED BY A NURSE.
 
                          STARLING
                Due respect, sir... 

     SHE PRODUCES A COPY OF THE WANTED:  HANNIBAL LECHTER POSTER
     WE SAW AT THE FBI. 

                          STARLING (cont'd)
                Due respect, after your, after your... 

                          VERGER
                My encounter. 

                          STARLING 
                Someone offered three million dollars
                bounty on Dr. Lechter's head.
                    (PAUSE) 

                          CORDELL 
                The identity of the person offering the
                bounty was never established. 

                          VERGER 
                Yes, but we know who it was, and I will
                tell you, Agent Starling, what you know
                to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It
                was illegal, and, worse, it was wrong. 
                And I thank God every day that I did not
                compound my sinful life by the stain of
                a murder.  Do you (WHEEZE) Agent
                Starling:  do you know God?
                    (PAUSE) 

                          STARLING
               ...sir...?

                          VERGER 
                Isn't it funny?  You can look on my
                face (WHEEZE WHEEZE) which you would 
                grant me, is the most hideous sight you
                will see in what I hope is a long life. 
                You can look at me.  Which shows (WHEEZE)
                a Strength which must come from strong
                (WHEEZE) strong convictions.  (WHEEZE)
                But you shy when I say the name of
                God. 

     THE NURSE COMES UP, HOLDING THE TAPE OF A LIFESIGNS 
     MACHINE, SHE NODS TO CORDELL AND INDICATES THE MONITORS.

                          NURSE 
                    (TO STARLING)
                ...I'm sorry.. 
                    (MEANING, YOU MUST GO.) 

                          STARLING 
                Yes, then, you're saying that you
                haven't bid upon these drawings.

                          VERGER
                I have not, I would not.  For life
                (WHEEZE) life goes on Starling.  And,
                wait, wait, I wish to talk to you... 
                I'm... (WHEEZE)  (TO THE NURSE, WHO IS 
                TAKING STARLING'S ARM) One moment.  I was
                afflicted, do you see, but my affliction
                was not in my meeting with your Dr.
                Lechter.  I was afflicted before. 
                Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance.
                Do not (WHEEZE) Do not curse God when
                you are humiliated.  Listen to me:
                embrace it, and you embrace life....
                Listen, and you hear the word of
                God... 

     STARLING IS LED AWAY BY THE CONCERNED NURSE.  CORDELL LINGERS
     BEHIND, AT AN UNSEEN BEHEST OF VERGER. 

     THE NURSE STARTS PREPARING A HYPO AT HER STATION.

                          STARLING 
                ...will he be alright...? 

     THE NURSE, DISTRACTED, NODS, AND RETREATS TOWARD VERGER
     WITH THE HYPO.

     CORDELL COMES OUT TO STARLING.

     INT CORRIDOR, COUNTRY HOUSE, DAY.  STARLING AND CORDELL ARE 
     WALKING, BEYOND THEM, WE SEE VARIOUS CHILDREN PLAYING UNDER
     ADULT SUPERVISION.  A CARETAKER TYPE IS HOLDING A SMALL
     GOAT, WHICH THE CHILDREN ARE PLAYING WITH. 

     CORDELL OPENS THE GLASS DOOR, AND HE WALKS STARLING THROUGH
     THE SCENE OF THE CHILDREN AND THE GOAT. 

                          CORDELL 
                Mr. Verger wanted me to give you 
                this... 
                    (HE HANDS HER A SMALL PRINTED CARD) 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE GLANCES AT THE CARD.

     ANGLE INS THE CARD READS:

     "DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY..." 

     SHE GLANCES AT IT, AND, DISMISSIVELY, PUTS IT IN A POCKET.

                          CORDELL (cont'd) 
                And he has asked me to ask you something. 

                          STARLING 
                What would that be? 

                          CORDELL 
                    (PAUSE)
                He... would consider it a favor if he 
                could make a donation.  To a charitable
                institution of your choice.
                    (PAUSE) 

                          STARLING 
                Now, why in the world would he do that? 

                          CORDELL 
                I... think... he was.... he was 
                touched, by your reaction.  To his
                appearance. 

                          STARLING
                What reaction? 

                          CORDELL
                Exactly. 

                          STARLING 
                    (AS SHE HANDS HIM A CARD) 
                Please, I do not... I don't want to 
                trouble him.  But if you or he have any 
                notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...

                          CORDELL 
                Do you know the seller? 

                          STARLING 
                We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records. 

                          CORDELL
                Try Barney Clark.

                          CORDELL 
                He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's
                stay in Prison. 

                          STARLING
                And how would you know that? 

                          CORDELL 
                Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was...
                he made quite a study. 
                    (PAUSE.  STARLING MAKES A NOTE.
                     SHE LOOKS AROUND.) 

                          STARLING 
                You should get the kids a dog... 

                          CORDELL 
                ....I hardly think so... after "The
                Incident"... 

                          STARLING
                No, no, of course not. 

     SHE STARTS TO GET INTO HER CAR. 

                          CORDELL 
                ...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a
                contribution, to the charitable... 

                          STARLING 
                Tell him to give it to an orphanage.

     STARLING CLOSES THE CAR DOOR.

     HOLD.  ON STARLING, WATCHING THE CHILDREN FOR A MOMENT. 
     THEN SHE TAKES THE CARD FROM HER POCKET AND GLANCES AT IT.

     IT READS : 

     "DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY, DO NOT TRUST TO PROSPERITY.
     BE AWARE OF FORTUNE'S HABIT--SHE WILL DO JUST AS SHE
     PLEASES.  NONE OF THIS IS IN YOUR CONTROL.  BE HAPPY.  BE
     KIND.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE STARTS TO PUT THE CAR IN GEAR, PUTTING
     DOWN THE NOTE.  THEN SHE HESITATES, AND BEGINS TO CRY.
     LOWERING HER HEAD, BEYOND HER WE SEE THE POTATOCHIP VAN,
     PARKED IN THE DRIVEWAY, AND THE CHILDREN ROMPING WITH THE
     GOAT. 

     INT PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE DAY. 

     STARLING IS TALKING TO A KINDLY OLDER WOMAN PSYCHIATRIST.

                          PSYCHIATRIST 
                ...that you could ~go beyond the
                institution." 

                          STARLING
                Yes.

                Starling:  They got a x-ray.  They think,
                they might have a lead on Lechter.

                          STARLING
                Yeah, I know. 

     THE AGENT LOOKS AT HER WONDERINGLY, AND, THEN, AS IF SHE
     HAS NOT UNDERSTOOD.

     AS BRIGHAM IS GATHERING HIS STUFF, HE DROPS THE CARD 
     STARLING GAVE HIM, ON THE FILE WHICH WAS STARLING'S.  WE
     READ:  "NONE OF THIS IS IN YOUR CONTROL.  BE HAPPY.  BE
     KIND." AND, AS BRIGHAM'S HANDS COME INTO THE FRAME TO

     THE ITALIAN STEWARDESS IS USHERING FOLKS OFF THE PLANE.  WE
     SEE PAZZI PUTTING ALL HIS PAPERS TOGETHER, AND HE REACHES
     DOWN A FLIGHTBAG FROM THE OVERHEAD, AND JOINS THE LINE OF
     EXITING PASSENGERS.

     ANGLE 

     IN THE JETWAY, AN ARMED SOLDIER, HIS SMG SLUNG IN FRONT OF
     HIM, IS READING AN ITALIAN NEWSPAPER. 

     AS THE JETWAY PULLS UP TO SNUGGLE WITH THE JET, THE SOLDIER
     DROPS THE PAPER ONTO THE STOOL BEFORE HIM, AND COMES TO
     ATTENTION. 

     ANGLE 

     IN THE PLANE, THE STEWARDESS OPENS THE DOOR, THE PASSENGERS
     EXIT, SHE AND PAZZI EXCHANGE A BRIEF, WHISPERED FLIRTATION AS
     HE PASSES.  AS HE MOVES PAST HER, SHE GIVES A SMALL WHOOP IN
     RESPONSE TO SOME CLANDESTINE CARESS OF HIS.

     A WHISPERED CONFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO.

     PLAINCLOTHES COP TYPES, WAITING, AS PAZZI COMES THROUGH
     THEY NOD TO HIM, AND THE GROUP STARTS TO EXIT OUT OF THE

                in his Non-Italian-Hand, a note, from
                Dante Aligheri himself.  Would he
                recognize it, I think not...

                You want the job for your nephew.

                Yes, fine, of course he can read the
                note.  His Italian is admirable, for a
                straniero.  But is he familiar with... 

     ANGLE 

     ON THE MAN, PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN OF WHOM THEY ARE TALKING.

                Institution, which he now graces us with
                his bid to Direct, a note from Guido de
                Cavalcanti.  Would he recognize it, I
                think not. 

     ANGLE ON DR. FELL, STILL SEEN FROM THE REAR, AS HE TAKES A
     SILK SQUARE FROM HIS BREAST POCKET, AND CLEANS HIS HALF-
     GLASSES, THEN FOLDS THEM AND PUTS THEM AND THE SQUARE BACK
     IN HIS POCKET.

                Would you care to address that, Dr.
                Fell...? 

     BEAT.  DR. FELL TURNS TO CAMERA, STILL HOLDING THE NOTE. 

     HE TAKES SEVERAL PACES, TO LOOK AT THE NOTE IN A SHAFT OF
     SUNLIGHT.
 
     HE IS STANDING BESIDE THE STATUE OF JUDITH AND HOLOFERNES. 
     HE NODS AT THE NOTE, AS IF CONFIRMING SOMETHING.  THEN HE 
     LOOKS UP. 

                          DR. FELL 
                Cavalcanti replied publicly to Dante's 
                first sonnet.  Do you know it, Professor
                Sogliato?  I believe it's worth your 
                time:  Listen to the way he makes an
                instrument of the Italian vernacular, 
                which he called the vulgari eloquentia--
                the eloquent voice of the people: 
                Allegro me sembrava amor tenedo/Meo core
                in mano, e ne la braccia avea/Madonna
                involta in un drappa dormedo/Poi la 
                svegliava a d'esto ardeno/Lei paventosa 
                umilmente pascea/Appreso gir lo ne vedea 
                paingendo.  If Dante had written to a 
                Cavalcanti, it would, of course, have 
                been to Andrea, the most literary of his 
                brothers....

                          SOGLIATO
                ...why do you want this job?

                          DR. FELL 
                In the hope, that someday, I should come
                across such a note.  I thank you 
                gentleman for your kind attention, and
                hope you will consider...

                          FELL 
                I never met him.  I knew him only from
                his writings. 

                          PAZZI 
                I know that the officers who first 
                investigated his disappearance searched

                I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but
                clean.  Just dressed--in the middle of 
                the... 

     FELL SHAKES HIS HEAD, ASKING TO HAVE THE QUESTION
     WITHDRAWN.

                               PAZZI
                ...please...

                    (SHRUGS, SMILES) 
                I saw a man, somewhat fatigued.
                Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In
                the middle of the day.
                    (SMILES)
                An old story.  And then I saw the 
                clothing was fresh--therefore:  a man who 
                dressed at home.  And then I remarked
                the new wedding ring.  And so:  the 
                story gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A 
                new, and a beloved wife.  I wish you joy.

                You assemble this, on the instant, from
                these few observations?

                I'm a historian.  It is our task to 
                assemble the seemingly unconnected into 
                the obvious.

                My scar is a war-wound.

                You are a Pazzi of the Pazzim are you
                not? 

                          PAZZI 
                Yes.  How did you know? 

                          FELL 
                You resemble a figure from the Della 
                Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at
                Santa Croce. 

                          PAZZI
                It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John
                the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?

                     PAZZI GOES AFTER HIM.) 

     FELL TURNS TO HIM. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                I wondered that an officer of your 
                exalted rank should come, so late,
                into the case. 

                          PAZZI
                And?  Then? 

                          FELL 
                I wonder no longer.  You were out of the
                country. 

                          PAZZI 
                How could you know? 

                          FELL
                I sense... 
                    (HE TOUCHES HIS NOSE) 
                The faintest whiff of a perfume, whose
                base, whose base, whose base is 
                "Hamamelis" ... it is witch-hazel--such 
                a clean scent.  No, not a European scent.
                I would say it is a scent of the New
                World.  I would say, you have been in
                America.  Have I struck home? 

                          PAZZI 
                You know America? 

                          FELL 
                ...you have brought this perfume... 
                brought this perfume.  Back.  Back from
                America.  To your New Wife...

                     GLANCES DOWN AT PAZZI'S
                     WEDDING RING.) 
                You have given it to her, and some of...
                    (HE SMILES) 
                Some of 'her perfume' has found its way
                back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man,
                indeed. 

     HE BOWS, AND STARTS TO TAKE HIS LEAVE, FROM THE STARTLED
     PAZZI.  PAZZI COMES TO HIS SENSES, AND HANDS A CARD TO FELL.

                You will be the first I call. 

     FELL TURNS TO LEAVE, TURNS BACK, AND TAKES HIS HAND AND,
     GENTLY RUBS IT ON THE LAPEL OF PAZZI'S SUITJACKET, HE THEN,
     DELICATELY, HOLDS THE HAND UNDER HIS NOSE, AND NODS, AS IF
     IN AGREEMENT WITH HIMSELF. 

     HE NODS, AND WALKS OFF INTO A PARK. 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI, WHO LOOKS AFTER FELL.  HE WALKS BACK TOWARD
     THE CAR.  HE TURNS, TO LOOK AFTER FELL, AND WE SEE HE IS
     STANDING BY A LINE OF PEOPLE, A QUEUE, UNDER A BANNER WHICH
     PROCLAIMS, "ATROCIOUS INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE." 

     PAZZI SHAKES HIS HEAD, AS IF TO CLEAR IT, AND STARTS TOWARD
     HIS CAR, WHERE COP ONE OPENS THE OOOR FOR HIM. 

     ANGLE 

     ON FELL, AS CAMERA TAKES HIM INTO THE PARK, WHICH, WE SEE,
     IS A CEMETERY. 

     HE SITS ON A BENCH, AND TAKES OUT HIS SKETCHBOOK, AND BEGINS
     TO DRAW. 

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     A PIECE OF FUNERAY STATUARY, THE LION, HOLDING THE BIRD IN
     HIS MOUTH. 

     ANGLE ON DR. FELL, SKETCHING.  TIGHT. 

     HE SKETCHES, HE RAISES HIS HAND TO HIS NOSE AND INHALES, AND
     NODS AGAIN. 

     ANGLE, FROM THE SIDE, WE NOW SEE THE STATUE AND FELL'S
     DRAWING.  HE IS DRAWING, NOT THE STATUE, BUT A SKETCH OF
     CLARICE STARLING. 

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

     ANGLE 

     STARLING, STANDING AT A BUSSTOP, READING A PAPER.

     ANGLE INS. 

     IN THE PAPER IS SECRETED A PHOTO OF BARNEY, ON FBI XEROX 
     FORM, WITH HIS NAME, AND DESCRIPTION.

     ANGLE 

     STARLING WAITS AT THE BUSSTOP.  BARNEY PASSES IN FRONT OF 
     HER, AND CONTINUES WALKING.  STARLING FOLDS THE PAPER AND
     GOES AFTER HIM. 

     ANGLE 

     RUNDOWN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD, DAY. 

     BARNEY, NOW HOLDING A SMALL BAG OF GROCERIES, CROSSES THE 
     STREET. 

     WE SEE STARLING IN THE BG. 

     BARNEY STOPS, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.  WE SEE HE IS 
     LOOKING UP OVERHEAD.

     ANGLE INS HIS POV. 

     A DOVE, CIRCLING IN THE SKY.

     ANGLE XCU.

     BARNEY LOOKING UP, PUZZLED, AND THEN HE LOOKS DOWN.

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     IN THE ROAD AHEAD, A DEAD DOVE. 

     BARNEY WALKS INTO THE POV, PICKS UP THE DOVE, AND WALKS TO A
     SMALL RATTY VERGE OF PARK.  HE PUTS THE DOVE DOWN, LOVINGLY
     IN THE GRASS, AND WE WATCH, AS THE OTHER DOVE LANDS ON A
     FENCE, NEARBY. 

     BARNEY STARTS TO WALK TOWARD THE LIVE BIRD.

     ANGLE 

     OVER THE BIRD, ONTO BARNEY, WITH STARLING WALKING UP BEHIND 
     HIM. 

     BARNEY HESITATES, HIS BACK STILL TO STARLING.

                          BARNEY 
                Are you attracted by Death?
                    (PAUSE) 
                It is the one great mystery, is it not? 
                Anyone who would say otherwise must be a
                hypocrite.  Don't you think...? 

     HE TURNS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND LOOKS AT HER. 

                          BARNEY (cont'd) 
                ...or are you only attracted by power...
                    (HE CHANGES HIS TACK AND TONE.) 
                How are you, Agent Starling? 

                          STARLING 
                Ah, Barney:  you've got a good mernory. 

                          BARNEY 
                You know why that is?  Because there
                are so few things I need to forget. 
                Would you agree, for the record, that I
                have not been read my rights? 

                          STARLING 
                I have not read you your rights. 

                          BARNEY 
                Would you mind saying that into your
                bag...? 

     STARLING STARTS TO OPEN HER BAG, AND SPEAKS INTO IT.

                          STARLING
                I hereby acknowledge that... 

                          BARNEY 
                And now I have "dociled" you, have I
                not?  By forcing your obedience. 

                          STARLING 
                    (SMILING) 
                Then why did you chose to inform me of
                it...? 

                          BARNEY
                To show... 
                    (PAUSE) 
                in my ability to squander.  What one
                might deem an advantage... that my
                strength is greater than yours... 

                          STARLING 
                Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...? 

                          BARNEY 
                If you'll come down the street I will
                make you a cup of coffee. 

     INT BARNEY'S APARTMENT DAY. 

     AS THEY ENTER, THE APARTMENT WITH MANY DEADBOLTS.  STARLING 
     ENTERS WARILY AND TAKES A SEAT WITH HER BACK TO THE WALL, IN
     THE SMALL STUDIO. 

     AS BARNEY BEGINS MAKING COFFEE.

                          BARNEY 
                You almost took down Evelda Drumgo.

                          STARLING 
                Well.  Word gets around. 

                          BARNEY 
                ...what hindered you...? 

                          STARLING
                It wasn't my day. 

                          BARNEY 
                Perhaps you did not have the support
                you required.

                          STARLING 
                It's a poor workman who blames his tools. 

                          BARNEY
                Or, perhaps... 

                          STARLING 
                ...how are things at the Hospital? 

                          BARNEY 
                It's a growth business. 

                          STARLING
                What have they got you doing? 

                          BARNEY
                Orderly. 

                          STARLING 
                I would have figured you an R.N. by now,
                or, maybe Med School. 

                          BARNEY 
                I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous
                professions. 

                          STARLING 
                    (TAKES OUT A NOTEBOOK) 
                You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in 
                Dr. Lechter's prison ward. 

                          BARNEY 
                Yes, I presumed it was about him. 

                          STARLING 
                ...you... 

                          BARNEY 
                I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did 
                not last with him.  I was privileged to
                enjoy his company during that time. 

                          STARLING 
                    (GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS, AS
                     SHE TAKES OUT A PENCIL.)
                I'm looking for... 

                          BARNEY 
                He said, and these were his words, he 
                valued our time together, because I was
                civil. 

                          STARLING 
                Did you ever think, did you think, after
                he escaped, he would come after you? 

                          BARNEY 
                He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude.
                Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think
                he'd come after you...? 

     STARLING LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW.

     ANGLE HER POV 

     OUT THE WINDOW, SE SEE THE DOVE CIRCLING THE DEAD DOVE ON THE 
     RATTY PIECE OF GRASS.

                          STARLING
                    (TURNING BACK)
                What...? 

                          BARNEY 
                I asked you how you like your coffee...? 
                We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of
                Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world-
                view of the self-delusive. 

                          STARLING 
                We got a bunch of materials, coming up 
                at auction.  Materials which disappeared
                from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he 
                made, his books.

                          BARNEY 
                Yes? 

                          STARLING 
                And I'd like your help, determining
                who's bidding for their purchase. 

                          BARNEY
                Why me? 

                          STARLING 
                Waal, because your selling'em... Two 
                years ago, his annotated Dictionary of
                Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for
                sixteen thousand dollars.
                Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed
                Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like
                an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? 
                Ten, twelve grand? 

                          BARNEY
                ...very good. 

                          STARLING 
                Here's what they want you to do:  we 
                want the rest of the stuff you stole from
                his cell. 

                          BARNEY
                ...why? 

                          STARLING 
                Let's just say they got a passion for
                collectibles... 

                          BARNEY 
                You said "here's what they want you to
                do..."  Why? 

                          STARLING 
                Now, whyn't you help us? 

                          BARNEY 
                That would adversely impact my income. 

                          STARLING 
                Not as much as being jailed for theft of
                Government Property, or for failure to
                pay income tax, on undisclosed income. 

                          BARNEY
                We could skip the Gavotte. 

                          STARLING

                There's one or two freaks, and, for a
                "Pass," I'll rat them out to you...

                          BARNEY 
                You said "here's what they want you
                to do."  Aren't you part of them 
                anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI?
                'No Girl's Allowed,' or what?  Have you
                transgressed...? 

                          STARLING 
                Let's keep it to business, shall we?

                ...why have they stuck you on this silly
                little roust?

                          STARLING 
                And why is it a vacant exercise? 

                          BARNEY 
                Because we both know who's buying the
                Lechteriana. 

                          STARLING
                Who would that be.

                Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it
                mirrors his soul, what an impossible
                injustice.  Can you be free....? 

                          STARLING 
                No, you're wrong about Verger. 

                          BARNEY
                Oh, yes.  He's found Peace. 

                          STARLING 
                Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly
                mistaken.

                mother.  The police found a marijuana 
                cigarette in your home.  You can't see

                ...or perhaps they just don't want you
                anymore.  Could that be?  And, do you 
                know what will happen to Kitty Cat?  When
                you go away.  The police will take her,
                and they'll give her a shot.  With a 
                shiny needle.  They'll give Kitty Cat a
                shot.  And it will hurt her.  And then
                she will die. 

     FRANKLIN TAKES THE TAIL OF HIS SHIRT FROM HIS PANTS AND
     HOLDS IT TO HIS EYES. 

     ANGLE 

     ON VERGER'S BED, AND ON CORDELL BEHIND HIM, GLANCING THROUGH
     A FILE. 

     CORDELL LOOKS UP AT THE WAILING OF FRANKLIN.

                     FACE SCREWING UP IN TERROR AS 
                     THE DETAIL OF VERGER BECOME
                     MORE APPARENT.  HE STOPS
                     MOVING FORWARD.) 
                Do you know how you keep kittycat from
                getting a shot?  Franklin?  No?  Do you
                know.  Then come here... 

     FRANKLIN COMES FORWARD.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                You can keep Kitty Cat from
                getting a shot if... 

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, WHO REACTS TO SOME SIGN FROM VERGER, AND NODS,
     AND TAKES A SMALL PACKAGE FROM A POCKET IN HIS COAT.

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, WHO GIVES THE PACKAGE TO FRANKLIN.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                If you give him this... 

     ANGLE ON FRANKLIN, AS HE LOOKS DOWN AT THE PACKAGE IN HIS
     HANDS. 

     ANGLE INS: 

     IT IS A PACKAGE OF RAT POISON.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN, HOLDING THE POISON, HE LOOKS UP AS VERGER 
     TALKS. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                You can keep her from getting the shot,
                if you give her that rat poison
                yourself... 

     ANGLE, HOLD ON FRANKLIN, WHO BEGINS TO WEEP COPIOUSLY. 

     ANGLE, ON THE VIDEO SCREEN SHOWING FRANKLIN, AS WE HEAR A
     SERVO MOTOR, AND THE SCREEN ZOOMS IN TO SHOW A TEAR. 

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, WHO IS NOW AT A SMALL WETBAR, MIXING VODKA AND
     VERMOUTH AND POURING THEM INTO A MARTINI SHAKER. 

     HE GLANCES OVER, AND NODS. 

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, AS HE PUSHES A BUTTON ON A CONSOLE.  ON THE
     SCREEN OVER VERGER'S BED WE SEE THE NURSE IN THE HALL
     REACT.  SHE PUTS HER PAPERBACK BOOK INTO HER POCKET, AND
     RISES, AND WE SEE HER ENTER VERGER'S ROOM, AND STAND BY
     THE DOOR. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                Goodbye, Franklin. 

     CORDELL WALKS FRANKLIN TO THE DOOR.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                ...remember what we talked about.

     WE HEAR VERGER'S ELECTRONICALLY AMPLIFIED BREATHING BECOME
     EXCITED, AND ON THE LIFESIGNS SCREENS, WE SEE HIS VITAL
     SIGNS BECOME MORE AGITATED, AND THE NURSE, AND CORDELL
     START TOWARD THE BED. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                    (AS HIS BREATHING QUIETS)
                No, I'm fine... 

     WE SEE CORDELL START BACK INTO THE ROOM, AND THEN, AT THE
     SOUND OF VERGER'S VOICE TURN AWAY AGAIN. 

     ANGLE, AT THE DOOR, CORDELL SIGNS TO THE NURSE, AND
     STOOPS TO THE CRYING FRANKLIN. 

     CORDELL TAKES A STERILE PLASTIC BAG FROM HIS POCKET, HE
     REMOVES FROM IT A CLAMP, IN THE JAWS OF WHICH ARE A SMALL
     SQUARE OF COTTON GAUZE.  HE STOOPS TO FRANKLIN, AND
     CAREFULLY TAKES ONE OF FRANKLIN'S TEARS ONTO THE GAUZE.  HE
     NODS TO THE NURSE, WHO EXITS WITH FRANKLIN. 

     HE DISAPPEARS FROM THE SHOT.

     ANGLE ON VERGER.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                ..what have we heard from our friend at
                the FBI...? 

     ANGLE ON CORDELL, AS HE TAKES AN ENVELOPE, AND EXTRACTS A
     XEROX OF AN X-RAY AND PUTS IT ON THE SCREEN, WE SEE IT IS
     THE "BRAZILIAN" X-RAY OF LECHTER'S HAND.  WE SEE AN IMPRINT
     AT THE TOP OF THE X-RAY--THE PATIENTS NAME AND THE LAB
     NAME RIPPED AWAY--ALL THAT REMAINS ARE THE WORDS "...DO
     BRAZIL." 

                          CORDELL 
                Most current information shows the 
                result of an operation for the removal 
                of a sixth digit, the left hand of a man. 

                          VERGER 
                Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter? 

                          CORDELL 
                Not with any certainty we... 

     VERGER'S BREATHING AGAIN BECOMES EXCITABLE.

                          VERGER 
                Why did he come back?

                           CORDELL 
                Our operatives in Brazil have been
                empowered to offer a reward of....

                          VERGER 
                ...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY
                TURN BACK...? 

                          CORDELL
                ...are you alright, sir...? 

                          VERGER 
                HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have
                we Seen it Before. 

                          CORDELL
                Seen what, sir..? 

                          VERGER 
                The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the
                ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why?
                Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT 
                THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS.
                IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. 
                THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As
                Lechter will return back.  You see?  To
                the sight of his oppressor wounded.
                He will return to savage our beloved Miss
                Starling.  Bring me a drink. 

     CORDELL TURNS, BACK TO THE CONSOLE.

     WE SEE CORDELL TURN, AND APPROACH THE BED, HOLDING THE
     MARTINI ON A TRAY. 

     HE PUTS THE TRAY DOWN ON THE BEDTABLE.

     ANGLE INS. 

     WE SEE, ON THE SMALL METAL HOSPITAL TRAY, THE MARTINI SHAKER, 
     THE MARTINI GLASS, AND A SMALL BEAKER, IN WHICH IS THE CLAMP
     WHICH BEARS THE GAUZE PAD WHICH BEARS FRANKLIN'S TEARS.

     CORDELL SHAKES THE SHAKER, POURS IT INTO THE GLASS, AND
     DROPS THE GAUZE PAD INTO IT, AND HANDS IT TO VERGER. 

                          CORDELL
                Your drink, sir. 

                          VERGER 
                It's time to step up the pressure on
                our Sweet Miss Starling.  ...call our 
                friend at the F.B.I.  And, instead of 
                finding Lechter, let's help Him find us. 

     ANGLE 

     ON ONE OF THE VIDEO SCREENS, WE SEE A SHEET LABELLED
     "CONFIDENTIAL FBI NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION."  AND WE SEE, IN 
     VARIOUS SQUARES BELOW, THE DRAWINGS BY LECHTER, THE VARIOUS
     FUNERAY SKETCHES. 

     CAMERA COMES IN ON ONE OF THE MIDDLE, LEFT, WHICH SHOWS THE

                because they are expensive... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                They aren't expensive, you got them
                through your connections.... speaking of
                which: 

                          PAZZI 
                Fine, thank you, but 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                Speaking of which, I want you also to
                get us tickets for the Opera... 

                          PAZZI

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...and that is what you need to expand. 

                          PAZZI 
                I don't understand. 

                          MRS. PAZZI

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                Because it is exclusive... because
                everyone will be here... 

     CAMERA TAKES THEM PAST A SIGN ANNOUNCING "EXHIBITION
     INSTRUMENTS OF ATROCIOUS TORTURE," AND A VELVET ROPE, AND
     VARIOUS WELL DRESSED PEOPLE WAITING TO GET IN. 

     PAZZI WALKS TO THE HEAD OF THE LINE, AND SHOWS HIS TICKETS,
     AND IS ADMITTED. 

     ANGLE INT.  THE EXHIBIT HALL. 

     AN IRON MAIDEN.  A COFFIN SHOWING SPIKES ON ONE SIDE, THE
     OTHER SIDE EMPTY, IS AN IMPROVISED ENTRY TO THE EXHIBIT. 
     PAZZI AND HIS WIFE ENTER, SHE STOPS TO GOSSIP WITH A WELL
     DRESSED COUPLE.

                Mrs. Demetrio, how good to see you... 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI, AS HE DRIFTS AWAY.  WE SEE HIM STARING AT
     VARIOUS THUMBSCREWS, A RACK, A GUILLOTINE.  HE STOOPS TO READ
     A PLACARD.  HIS WIFE COMES UP BEHIND HIM. 

                          MRS. PAZZI (cont'd)
                You see, that is my point. 

                          PAZZI
                ...my love... 

                          MRS. PAZZI

                I am on the track of...

                Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand 
                dollars reward, which you would have to
                split with your team, which, if you get
                it, will not buy me a new watch...
                    (SHE STOPS TO GREET ANOTHER COUPLE) 

                          PAZZI 
                ...what do you expect me to... 

     HE STOPS, AND TURNS AWAY, WHEN HE SEES THAT SHE IS 
     ENGROSSED.  HE IS NOW LOOKING AT A TORTURE WHEEL.  HE 
     STOPS AND LOOKS INTENTLY INTO THE GLOOM OF THE ROPED OFF
     EXHIBIT. 

     ANGLE HIS POV 

     INSIDE THE EXHIBIT, IN A DARK CORNER, THE FIGURE OF A MAN.

     ANGLE XCU ON FELL, LECHTER, IN THE GLOOM, SKETCHING. 

     WE SEE A GOOD SKETCH OF THE WHEEL, ON WHICH HE HAS ADDED
     ARCHITECTURAL NOTES ON ANGLES AND DISTANCES.  HE TURNS,

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     PAZZI, BEYOND THE VELVET ROPE.  PEERING INTENTLY, RETURNING
     FELL'S GLANCE. 

     DOUBLECUTTING:  WE RETURN TO PAZZI, STARING, WE SEE HIM MAKE
     A QUICK ADDENDUM TO THE SKETCH OF THE TORTURE WHEEL.  AND
     THEN RETURN TO PAZZI, LEANING OVER TO PEER MORE CLOSELY
     INTO THE GLOOM. 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                So, the question:  as always, Rinaldo,
                the question is one of mmm... 

     ANGLE 

     ON MRS. PAZZI, AS FELL APPEARS AT THEIR SIDE, SHE TURNS TO
     HIM. 

                          FELL
                Commendatore would you do me the honor of
                introducing me.

                          MRS. PAZZI
                Dr. Fell.  You are not Italian. 

                          FELL 
                Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one
                of the few things in life which study
                and a pleasant attitude can not amend.
                What do you think? 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                And how do we account for the interest
                of such a charming man, an interest in
                Torture? 

                          PAZZI 
                Dr. Fell is studying for his examination
                by the Studiolo. 

                          FELL 
                Indeed I am.  And the connection, 
                between Dante, and, in fact, between 
                your illustrious forebears... if you'd
                come with me, I could show you... 

     HE HOLDS UP THE ROPE, AS TO LEAD THEM BACK INTO THE
     EXHIBIT. 

                          PAZZI
                But the exhibit is closing. 

                          FELL 
                How unfortunate. 

     PAZZI STARTS TO HELP HIS WIFE ON WITH HER WRAP.

                          FELL (cont'd)
                May I...? 

     HE TAKES THE WRAP, AND BEGINS TO DRAPE IT AROUND HER
     SHOULDERS.

     ANGLE EXT THE EXHIBIT.  ON THE STREET, THE CURIOUS ARE
     EXITING. 

     FELL CONCLUDES PUTTING THE WRAP ON MRS. PAZZI.

                What a lovely perfume.  I believe I
                recognize it, do I not...? 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                My husband brought it to me from 
                America. 

                          FELL 
                A wonderful country... 

     AN OLDER MAN CALLS PAZZI AWAY. 

                          MRS. PAZZI
                You know it? 

                          FELL 
                I have had many excellent meals there. 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                And yet, they are not know for their
                cuisine.

                Well, perhaps sometime we... 

     PAZZI REJOINS THE GROUP.

                Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame.
                What a pleasure. 

     HE MOVES AWAY.

                The commissioner is going round the

                          PAZZI 
                No.  Invite us?  No, he simply... 

                          MRS. PAZZI
                Then we cannot go. 

                          PAZZI
                Because...? 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                Because we cannot pay... 

     HE LEADS HER OFF, THE TWO OBVIOUSLY HAVING A FIGHT.

     ANGLE 

     IN THE GLOOM, LECHTER-FELL, LOOKING AT THEM APPRAISINGLY.

     ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND.  BRIGHAM FALL, HIT,

     WALKING INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.  WE HEAR THE SOUND OF
     AN AMBULANCE, AND THE HELO SHOT SHIFTS TO AN AMBULANCE
     SCREAMING AROUND THE CORNER. 

     ANGLE 

     BACK ON THE STREET.  STARLING, HOLDING THE BABY, IS WALKING
     THROUGH THE SCENE OF THE CARNAGE.  SHE SEES BRIGHAM, RAISING 
     HIMSELF TO AN ELBOW, AND HE MOUTHS, "I'M ALRIGHT..."

     STARLING WALKS ON, PAST THE CAR, WITH THE DEAD BODIES. 
     PARAMEDICS COME OUT OF THE STOPPED AMBULANCE, AND ONE OF THEM
     TAKES THE INFANT FROM THE DAZED STARLING.

     STARLING HELPS BRIGHAM TO HIS FEET.  HE STANDS WOOZILY, HE
     BEGINS TO UNBUCKLE THE KEVLAR PROTECTIVE VEST HE WEARS.

     BACKING.  SHE IS ACCOMPANIED BY PAZZI, WHO IS DRAPING HER
     SHOULDERS IN A FURCOAT.

     PAZZI BOWS THIS WAY AND THAT, TO ADMIRING COUPLES, AS THEY

                Can it be that you are lovelier, even,
                than at our last encounter...? 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                My mother told me to ignore the
                blandishments of charming men.

                And how good of you to remember it. 
                Then, this trip, then, is not a return

     PAZZI TRIES TO MANEUVER HIS WIFE AWAY FROM FELL.  CAMERA
     TAKES THEM AROUND A CORNER, TO A "NO PARKING, LOADING ZONE,"
     SIGN, IN WHICH WE SEE A POLICE SEDAN, AND ONE OF PAZZI'S 
     MEN.  HE IS WEARING THE GIMME HAT PAZZI BROUGHT BACK FROM
     THE STATES. 

     ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE LOOKS OVER AT THE DRIVER.

     ANGLE HIS POV.

                          FELL 
                You suggested it was time to get
                something good to eat.

     ANGLE 

     ON FELL, IN THE SHADOWS, AS HE CLOSES THE FRONT DOOR
     SOUNDLESSLY BEHIND HIM.  HE STANDS FOR A MOMENT, LOOKING,
     CAMERA THEN TAKES HIM INTO THE APARTMENT WHERE HE FINDS THE
     KITCHEN. 

     INT THE KITCHEN, FELL TAKES A KNIFE FROM A MAPLE BLOCK, TRIES
     ITS EDGE, REPLACES IT, TAKES OUT A CLEAVER, AND NODS.  HE
     LOOKS ABOVE, AND TAKES DOWN A COPPER SAUCEPAN FROM THE POT
     RACK.  HE OPENS THE REFRIGERATOR, GLANCES BRIEFLY INSIDE,
     AND NODS, IN SATISFACTION, AND CLOSES IT. 

     HE PICKS UP A DISHTOWEL, TRIES IT BETWEEN HIS HANDS, TESTING
     ITS STRENGTH. 

     HE PUTS IT DOWN, DISSATISFIED. 

     HE BEGINS TO PROWL THROUGH THE APARTMENT, HE PASSES ANOTHER
     HALF OPEN DOOR, AND WE SEE PAZZI AND HIS WIFE, HALF GLIMPSED,
     BEYOND, FELL MOVES INTO A SMALL STUDY. 

     ANGLE

     TIE. 

     FELL MOVES TOWARD THE CHAIR, PUTS HIS CLEAVER DOWN ON THE
     DESK, AND TRIES THE TIE BETWEEN HIS HANDS, TESTING HIS
     STRENGTH. 

     HE NODS, SATISFIED, AND PICKS UP THE CLEANER.

     ANGLE INS 

     THE CLEANER, WHICH IS LAYING ON TOP OF THE FILE REGARDING THE 
     DISAPPEARANCE OF DOTTORE FANELLI, BENEATH IT, HALF COVERED,
     IS THE FBI LOGO. 

     WE SEE FELL'S HAND RAISE THE FIRST FILE, TO LOOK AT THE
     SECOND, AND WE READ: "FBI REPORT, THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, ETC,
     OF HANNIBAL LECHTER." 

     ANGLE CU.

     ON FELL, AS HE NODS TO HIMSELF, HE THEN LOOKS DOWN AT
     SOMETHING ELSE. 

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     A SCARF, PEEPING OUT OF THE HALF-OPEN DESK DRAWER.

     ANGLE INS. 

     FELL'S HAND DRAWS OUT THE SCARF.  NESTLED IN THE SCARF IS 
     THE PHOTO OF PAZZI IN FRONT OF THE WANTED POSTER. 

     ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE LOOKS AT THE PICTURE.  HE THEN BEGINS TO
     PEER VERY CLOSELY AT IT.  HE PICKS UP THE MAGNIFYING GLASS
     FROM THE DESK, AND WE SEE, IN A HUGE INSERT, THAT HE IS
     MOVING THE MAGNIFYING GLASS TO ATTEMPT TO MAKE OUT THE 
     FIGURE REFLECTED IN THE GLASS COVERING THE WANTED POSTER, ID,
     THE FIGURE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHER, IS STARLING. 

     ANGLE XCU 

     INS THE JUST SEEN OUTLINE OF STARLING, HOLDING THE CAMERA.

     ANGLE 

     FELL, LOOKING AT THE PHOTO.  HE THEN GLANCES AT THE SCARF, 
     PICKS IS UP, AND, QUESTIONINGLY, SNIFFS IT ONCE, AND THEN
     AGAIN.  HE HOLDS THE SCARF TO HIS FACE.  HE RUBS IT
     BETWEEN HIS HANDS, AND SMELLS HIS HANDS. 

     ANGLE PAZZI BEDROOM.

                          PAZZI 
                Yes, but the important thing, as I've 
                said... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...get me a cigarette. 

     PAZZI GETS UP FROM THE BED, AND WRAPS HIMSELF IN A SHEET,
     AND PROCEEDS INTO THE STUDY. 

                          PAZZI 
                The essential thing.  The essential 
                thing, is that we must be absolutely
                quiet about... 

     HE PULLS OPEN THE DESK DRAWER, AND TAKES OUT A PACK OF
     CIGARETTES. 

     HE LOOKS WONDERINGLY, AT THE DRAWER, BEAT.  HE SHRUGS, HE
     IS ABOUT TO START BACK INTO THE BEDROOM, HE GLANCES AT THE
     CURTAINS, BLOWING IN THE OPEN WINDOW, HESITATES.

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...what is it? 

     HE LOOKS INTO THE DESK, SHAKES HIS HEAD.  BEAT.

     AND THEN RETURNS INTO THE BEDROOM. 

                          MRS. PAZZI (cont'd) 
                ...you've forgotten the cigarettes. 

     PAZZI TURNS, AND LOOKS BACK TOWARD THE OPEN WINDOW, AND THE
     BLOWING SHADES.

     A YOUNG WOMAN WALKS PAST THE CAMERA.  SHE TAKES US TO FELL,
     WHO IS SITTING ACROSS FROM THE STATUE OF THE LION AND THE
     BIRD, HE IS PICKING HIS TEETH, AND, VERY DELICATELY, TAKES 
     OUT A SCARF, AND WIPES HIS MOUTH.  WE SEE IT IS THE SCARF
     WHICH HE STOLE FROM PAZZI, HE TAKES OUT THE PHOTOGRAPH OF 
     THE WANTED POSTER, AND LOOKS AT IT, AS HE WALKS THROUGH THE
     PARK. 

     CAMERA TAKES HIM OUT OF THE PARK, PAST THE YOUNG WOMAN, WHO,
     WE SEE, HAS RETURNED TO A STROLLER, WHICH IS EMPTY, SHE IS
     TALKING TO A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, AND GESTURING, "ABOUT THIS
     HIGH..."  SHOWING THE HEIGHT OF HER CHILD.  HE AND THE
     WOMAN START LOOKING IN THE BUSHES.

     ANGLE 

     ON FELL, LEAVING THE PARK, HE WALKS PAST AN APPLIANCE STORE, 
     IN THE WINDOW OF WHICH WE SEE, TEN SILENT TV SCREENS, AND A
     TALKING HEAD ANNOUNCER.

     THE SCENE SHIFTS TO THE HELICOPTER FOOTAGE OF STARLING.

     WE SEE PHOTOS DISPLAYED OF STARLING, NEXT TO THE PEOPLE SHE
     SHOT IN THE SHOOTOUT, AND A VISBO PROCLAIMS, "KILLER OF
     FIVE, THE DEATH ANGEL: CLARICE STARLING." 

     EXT STARLING'S HOUSE, DAY. 

     STARLING, MAPP, AND JIM, MAPP'S BOYFRIEND, ARE COMING OUT OF
     THE HOUSE WITH CRAWFORD, ESCORTED TOWARD SEVERAL CARS OF
     WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY A FUNERAL CORTEGE. 

     A SEDAN PULLS UP, AND KRENDLER GETS OUT.

     SHE STARTS PUSHING HIM, AND CAMERA PANS, TO A GROUP OF
     NEWSVANS, CORDONED OFF, AROUND THE CORNER, AND HELD IN BAY 
     BY VARIOUS POLICE.  STARLING IS BEING SUBDUED BY CRAWFORD

                Trailer Trash BITCH, you still looking 
                for your Daddy, Beat you up, to show he
                Loves you? 

     ANGLE.  ON STARLING, STANDING BY THE LINE OF CARS.  SHE
     SEES SOMETHING, AND TURNS. 

     ANGLE XCU STARLING AS SHE LOOKS.  KRENDLER CONTINUES HIS
     HARANGUE. 

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     ON THE REAR DECK OF A CAR, A STETSON HAT, WITH A BULLET
     THROUGH IT, AND AN OLD SQUARE POLICEBADGE, WITH A BULLETHOLE

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE BLINKS, AND SHAKES HER HEAD TO CLEAR 
     IT. 

     THE SEDAN DRIVES OFF, AS SHE STRAINS TO LOOK AFTER IT.

                          KRENDLER (cont'd) 
                Well, here I am, you... 

     STARLING SHAKES HER HEAD AGAIN, FINDS HERSELF FACING 
     KRENDLER, AND PUNCHES HIM IN THE STOMACH.  KRENDLER GOES 
     DOWN.  STARLING IS SUBDUED BY HER COMFORTERS.  SHE STRAINS 
     TO LOOK AFTER THE DEPARTING CAR.

     INT VERGER'S ROOM. 

     ON THE TV STARLING, BEING PULLED OFF OF KRENDLER.

     VERGER CONVERSES IN GERMAN, WITH THE SWISS.  HE IS TOLD

     COMING HIS WAY SOON. 

     ANGLE.  ON VERGER, LOOKING AT THE PIGS. 

     EXT FLORENTINE PALAZZO. NIGHT.

     PAZZI, WALKING DOWN THE STREET.  NERVOUSLY ADJUSTS HIS SCARF.

     ANGLE 

     A BRIGAND, LOUNGING BY A VAN, NODS IMPERCEPTIBLY, AT PAZZI, 
     WHO CONTINUES WALKING.

     THE BRIGAND GOES INTO THE BACK OF THE VAN.

     ANGLE INT THE VAN. 

     THERE IS ANOTHER BRIGAND INSIDE.  THERE ARE SEVERAL FIREARMS 
     IN A RACK, AND A HOSPITAL GURNEY WITH HEAVY RESTRAINTS.  THE
     SECOND BRIGAND IS LOADING AN ODD LOOKING SHOULDER WEAPON. 

                          SECOND BRIGAND 
                I hit him with the beanbag gun, you stand
                by:  he's still flopping... 

     THE FIRST BRIGAND NODS, AND TAKES A CAPPED HYPODERMIC
     SYRINGE FROM THE SECOND MAN.

                          SECOND BRIGAND (cont'd) 
                Just make sure he's alive, because I've
                already spent the bonus... 

     THE FRUIT MAN NODS TO THE SECOND, AND WE SEE PAZZI
     PROCEEDING UP THE STAIRS INTO THE PALAZZO.

     INT A SALON AT THE PALAZZO, NIGHT.

     A WORKER IS MOVING A FLOOR POLISHER ACROSS THE MARBLE FLOOR 
     OF THE SALON, IN AN ANTEROOM BEYOND WE HEAR FELL LECTURING.
     THE WORKER NODS DIFFERENTIALLY, AT SOMEONE OFF SCREEN. 

     WE SEE HE HAS NODDED AT PAZZI, WHO TAKES US TO THE DOOR OF
     THE SALON.

     HE WIPES HIS HANDS NERVOUSLY, HE MOPS HIS BROW, HE LOOKS AT
     HIS WATCH. 

     HE LOOKS INTO THE SALON.

     ANGLE HIS POV 

     FELL, IN FRONT OF A LECTERN.  A SLIDE MACHINE IS SHOWING A 
     PAINTING OF A HANGED FIGURE ON A HUGE DRIPCLOTH AT THE BACK
     OF THE SALON.

     ANGLE, ON PAZZI, AS HE MOVES TO THE SIDE, IE, OUT OF THE
     DOORWAY TO THE SALON, HE GLANCES OVER HIS SHOULDER, TO MAKE
     SURE HE IS OUT OF THE SIGHT OF THE WORKMAN WITH THE FLOOR
     POLISHER.  HE SEES THE WORKMAN TURN THE POLISHER OFF AND 
     BEGIN COILING THE LONG ELECTRIC CORD.  PAZZI TAKES A SMALL
     FLAT AUTOMATIC FROM A HIP HOLSTER.  CHECKS THE CHAMBER, AND
     SLIPS IT INTO HIS JACKET POCKET.  HE PROCEEDS BACK TO THE
     DOORWAY, WHERE WE AND HE SEE FELL, BEYOND, LECTURING TO A
     COMPANY OF SIX MEN, IN THE SALON. 

                          FELL
                    (LECTURING) 
                Della vigna was disgraced and blinded 
                for his betrayal of his emperor's trust-
                -through avarice.  Avarice and hanging
                    (HE GESTURES TO THE PAINTING)
                are linked in the ancient and the
                madeadeval mind. 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI, AS HANNIBAL (FELL) SPEAKS, HE MOVES TO A
     WINDOW, AND WIPES HIS HAND AGAIN, AND WE SEE HIM LOOK DOWN
     AT THE VAN IN THE STREET, AND WIPE HIS HANDS, MUCH OF THIS
     SPEECH PLAYS AS VOICE-OVER AS HE DOES SO. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Judas and Pier Della Vigna are linked in
                Dante by the avarice he saw in them, and
                their subsequent deaths by hanging.  Ah
                Commendatore Pazzi... 

     ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE SPEAKS TO PAZZI, HALF-SEEN IN THE DOORWAY. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                You are welcome.  Since you are closest
                to the door, would you close the door, to
                improve the quality of the image.
                    (PAZZI DOES SO) 
                You will be interested in this,
                Commandatore, as there are two Pazzi's 
                already in Dante's inferno... 

     ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE WALKS FORWARD, BETWEEN THE CHAIRS OF
     THE SIX OLD MEN (THE STUDIOLO) WHO SIT LISTENING TO HIS
     LECTURE.  A FEW TAKE NOTES. 

                          FELL (cont'd)
                    (TO THE OLD MEN) 
                Camicion de Pazzi, as you know, murdered
                a kinsman, and rests in hell awaiting the
                arrival of a Second Pazzi.  But it's not
                you:  it's Carlino, who will rest 
                forever in hell for the crime of
                Treachery. 

     ANGLE XCU, ON FELL, LOOKING AT PAZZI. 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI, UNDER THE WITHERING STARE.  BEAT.

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                    (AS HE CONTINUES BACK TO HIS
                     LECTERN) 
                Avarice, and Hanging, then. 
                    (HE GESTURES TO THE PHOTOGRAPH
                     OF THE PAINTING) 
                On the next occasion, you might like to
                discuss the matter of Chewing.  Chewing
                in Dante:  Count Ugolino, chewing the
                back of the archbishop's head--Satan,
                with his three Faces, chewing Judas,
                Brutus, and Cassius... all three 
                traitors.  Is it not?  Thank you all for
                your kind attention. 

     THE SCHOLARS APPLAUD HIM, TWO STAND, AND TAKE HIM BY THE
     HAND.

     ANGLE ON PAZZI AT THE DOOR.  HE OPENS THE DOOR, AND THE OLD
     MEN OF THE STUDIOLO EXIT, CHATTERING HAPPILY ABOUT THE 
     LECTURE.  FELL COMES OUT, THE LAST OF THE SALON. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Would you say that I've preserved my
                job, Commendatore? 

                          PAZZI 
                I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it
                seemed as if they, as if they... 

                          FELL 
                Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do
                I owe...? 

                          PAZZI
                I require... 

                          FELL 
                ...yes, yes, yes... 

     HE FOLLOWS FELL BACK INTO THE ROOM, WHERE FELL BEGINS
     PUTTING AWAY HIS MATERIAL IN THE D1RTY SALON. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                ...the effects of my predecessor. 

                          PAZZI 
                I'd like to walk home with you, and... 

                          FELL 
                Yes, of course, and we'll collect them.
                I won't be a minute... 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI AS HE WALKS UP TOWARD FELL. 

     HE PUTS HIS HAND IN THE JACKET POCKET.

     ANGLE INS 

     THE HAND, SEEN THROUGH THE CLOTH, GRIPPING THE AUTOMATIC 
     PISTOL.

     ANGLE 

     ON FELL, AS HE BEGINS TO PACK UP THE SLIDE PROJECTOR, AND 
     THEN HESITATES.

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Ah, no.  I should have shown them this
                one.. 
                    (HE TAKES OUT A SLIDE AND PUTS
                     IT IN THE PROJECTOR)
                This one will interest you:  let me see
                if I can improve the focus... 

     WE SEE THE IMAGE OF A HANGED MAN APPEAR ON THE DROPCLOTH.
     THERE IS A PLAQUE DRAPED AROUND THE NECK OF THE HANGED MAN.

                          FELL (CONT'D)
                Can you make it out, can you make out
                the name on the plaque? 

     FELL WALKS UP TO THE IMAGE DISPLAYED ON THE DROPCLOTH, PAZZI
     WALKS BEHIND HIM.

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                    (LOOKING AT THE IMAGE) 
                It says Pazzi.  Pazzi.  And a rude, a 
                very rude poem, this is your ancestor.
                Francesco, hanging outside the Palazzio
                Vecchio.  Outside These Very Windows. 

     HE TURNS AND FIXES PAZZI WITH HIS GAZE.

     ANGLE, FELL, HIS FACE SEEN IN THE DARK, IN THE BEAM OF THE
     SLIDE PROJECTOR.

     HOLD. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                On a related subject Signor Pazzi, I must
                confess to you:  I'm giving serious
                thought to eating your wife. 

     FELL JERKS THE DROP CLOTH DOWN OVER THE TWO OF THEM.

     ANGLE XCU, ON PAZZI'S FACE AS HE SEES THE CLOTH COMING DOWN.

     ANGLE INS 

     HIS HAND, GOING INTO HIS POCKET, AS HE TRIES TO BRING OUT 
     THE PISTOL.

     ANGLE

     ON THE FACE OF FELL, AS HE ADVANCES, UNDER THE CLOTH,
     ON PAZZI, FELL TAKES A SMALL SPONGE AND A BOTTLE FROM HIS 
     POCKET, AND DUMPS LIQUID FROM THE BOTTLE ONTO THE SPONGE,
     AND GRABS PAZZI BY THE HAIR, PUTS HIM INTO A CHOKEHOLD, AND
     HOLDS THE SPONGE TO PAZZI'S FACE. 

     ANGLE EXT, THE DROP CLOTH, AS WE SEE THE EFFECTS OF THE
     STRUGGLE, AND HEAR THE SMALL PISTOL GOING OFF. 

     ANGLE EXT THE PALAZZO. 

     THE LAST MEMBER OF THE STUDIOLO, COMING OUT, A WORKMAN
     FOLLOWS HIM, AND BEGINS LOCKING THE DOOR. 

     ANGLE 

     ON THE BRIGANDS, AT THEIR VAN, THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER,
     ONE CHECKS HIS WATCH. 

     ANGLE INT THE SALON.

     THE FLOOR POLISHER.  MOVING, AS IF OF ITS OWN VOLITION,
     ACROSS THE FLOOR. 

     ANGLE 

     ON PAZZI, TIED TO THE PODIUM, HIS MOUTH GAGGED.

     ANGLE 

     ON LECHTER, AS HE COILS UP THE LONG ORANGE CORD OF THE
     FLOOR POLISHER, DRAWING IT TOWARD HIM. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Yes.  Your Wife.  Laura.  L'Orange, which
                is the topnote of her skin, wouldn't you
                say?  Or do I grow too personal?  but 
                that is what I think of, when I think of
                her.  And how could I but think of her? 
                I haven't had a bit all day.  The kidney
                and the liver would be su1table for a 
                dinner tonight.  But the rest of the meat
                should hang for a week, in these cool 
                conditions.  Wouldn't you say?  Nod once
                for yes. 
                    (PAUSE) 
                If you tell me what I need to know, 
                then it would be convenient for me to 
                leave without my meal.  And Mrs. Pazzi
                will remain unscathed.  I'll out the 
                questions to you, and we'll see:  I 
                saw at the theatre you had betrayed me.
                And, when the police didn't come, it was
                clear you had sold me out.  Was it to
                Mason Verger?  Blink one for yes. 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI.  BEAT.  THEN HE BLINKS ONCE. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Thank you.  And now:  Are his hit men
                waiting outside? 
                    (PAZZI BLINKS ONCE) 
                Was that a single blink?  Yes.  Thank
                you. 

     FELL FINISHES HIS COILING OF THE ROPE, AND WE SEE HE HAS
     FASHIONED A HANGMAN'S NOOSE. 

     FELL TAKES OUT A STILETTO, AND IT OPENS.  HE ADVANCES TOWARD
     PAZZI, WHO TRIES TO RECOIL. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                No, no.  I'm going to take the tape off.
                Please do not scream.  Do you think you
                can keep from screaming? 
                    (HE TAKES THE TAPE OFF) 
                ...would it help if I were to cut your
                BOWELS OUT...? 

     WE SEE HIM MAKE A SWIPE AND HEAR PAZZI START TO SCREAM.

     FROM OUTSIDE THE WINDOW OF THE SALON, WE SEE PAZZI, TAPED TO
     THE PODIUM, BEING IMPELLED, SCREAMING, TOWARD THE WINDOW. 

     ANGLE 

     ON THE LIGHTED PIAZZA OF THE PALAZZO, TOURISTS LOOK UP AT THE
     SCREAMING. 

     BEAT. 

     ANGLE XCU, ON THE CONTORTED FACE OF PAZZI, LOOKING DOWN, AN
     ORANGE NOOSE AROUND HIS NECK, AS THE PODIUM TILTS THROUGH
     THE OPEN WINDOW. 

     ANGLE 

     THE TWO BRIGANDS AT THE VAN.  REACTION TO THE SOUND OF THE
     SCREAMING, RUN AROUND THE CORNER.  THEY LOOK UP TO SEE PAZZI,
     STILL TAPES TO THE PODIUM, HANGING BY THE ORANGE CORD.

     ANGLE, ON THE VILLAINS, STANDING UNDERNEATH, AS GOUTS OF
     BLOOD FALL ON THEM.

                          BRIGAND ONE 
                ...cover the backdoor.  If he comes out,
                Kill him. 

                          BRIGAND TWO 
                ...the bonus was for... 

                          BRIGAND ONE 
                Kill him, and cut him. 

     HE RUNS TO THE FRONT OF THE PALAZZO, HOLDING HIS SHOULDER
     ARM DOWN ALONGSIDE HIS SIDE. 

     HE RUNS PAST THE LOCKED FRONT DOOR, AND TOWARD AN ALLEYWAY. 

     WE HEAR THE SIRENS OF POLICE CARS.  BRIGAND ONE SLOWS HIS
     WALK, AND PROCEEDS INTO THE ALLEYWAY.  HE SEES A SMALL DOOR,
     IN THE SIDE OF THE PALAZZO, AND A LIGHT BEYOND.

     ANGLE INT THE DOOR.

     A SMALL STAIRCASE.  THE BRIGAND ENTERS, HE LOOKS UP. 

     WE HEAR THE SOUND OF RAPIDLY DESCENDING FOOTSTEPS.  THE
     BRIGAND MOUNTS THE STEPS, HOLDING HIS RIFLE BEFORE HIM.  THE
     SOUND OF THE FOOTSTEPS CONTINUES.

     ON THE SECOND FLOOR, THE BRIGAND SHELTERS HIMSELF IN A ROOM,
     OFF THE LANDING.  THE SOUND OF THE DESCENDING FOOTSTEPS
     CONTINUES.

     ANGLE ON THE BRIGAND, HIDING BEHIND THE DOOR.  THEN HE TURNS
     HIS HEAD.

     ANGLE, HIS POV.

     WE ARE IN A LAUNDRY ROOM.

     THE SOUND OF THE FOOTSTEPS IS, IN FACT, A CLOTHESDRYER.  IN
     ITS GLASS DOOR IN THE SIDE, WE SEE A MAN'S SHOE GOING
     AROUND.

     ANGLE THE BRIGAND, AS HE LOOKS, THEN TO THE SIDE.

     ANGLE, HIS POV, IN THE SIDE OF THE ROOM, THE LEGS OF A DEAD
     MAN PROTRUDE FROM A CLOTHES HAMPER, HE WEARS ONLY ONE SHOE.

     ANGLE XCU

     ON THE BRIGAND, AS HE TURNS.

     ANGLE

     OVER HIM WE SEE HANNIBAL, SMILING, AS HE ADVANCES.

     ANGLE

     ON THE STILETTO, AS IT ENTERS THE BRIGAND'S BELLY.

     ANGLE EXT THE PALAZZO.

     SEVERAL COP CARS PULLING UP, AN AMBULANCE, A NEWSTRUCK.

     THE BOY TURNS.  HANNIBAL IS STANDING NEXT TO HIM.

                          HANNIBAL (cont'd)
                Young man, I am desperate.  If I am not
                at the Piazza Bellosguardo in ten
                minutes, it is the end of marriage.
                    (HE HANDS A BUNDLE OF NOTES
                     TOWARD THE BOY)

                FEED IT TO THE DOGS.  DID THAT DIVERT

                It is not that I care for you--but
                that I posses an enquiring mind.  What
                will you do when I am gone?  When you
                have nothing to occupy your thoughts, 
                save the memory of your own folly, and,

     DRAWN, TO SEE CORDELL.  HOLDING HIS HAND TO HIS BLOODY
     FACE.

                Our other option is to beat you for a
                while, with this axe handle, here.  I
                suppose this is what it feels like. 

     ANGLE 

     ONE OF THE ABDUCTORS (THE POTATOCHIP MEN) GOES TO A CONSOLE
     AND TURNS ON THE SOUND OF RECORDED SCREAMING.  HE LOOKS DOWN
     AT THE PIGS WHO, HEARING THE SCREAMING, COME TO THE SIDE OF
     THE PEN.  HE LOOKS BACK TOWARD THE DIRECTION OF CORDELL, AND
     LECHTER, AND WINCES. 

     HE RAISES THE AXE HANDLE AND PREPARES TO STRIKE.

     VERGER IS SEEN IN THE FLICKER OF THE TV SCREEN.

     WOODS. 

     WE SEE THE MUSTANG, BEHIND HER, COVERED WITH BOUGHS, IN THE
     WOODS, AND BEYOND THAT, BELOW HER, THE GUARDHOUSE. 

     CAMERA TAKES HER UP TO A BARBEDWIRE FENCE, CAMOUFLAGED, WITH
     BRUSH WOVEN INTO IT.  A LARGE TREE STANDS NEXT TO THE FENCE,
     WITH A BOUGH RUNNING FROM THE NEAR SIDE TO THE FAR SIDE. 

     ANGLE, STARLING LOOKS AT IT, AND SMILES.  SHE WALKS FORWARD,
     LOOKING INTENTLY AT THE GROUND. 

     ANGLE, HER POV.  A SMALL TRIPWIRE, SUSPENDED SIX INCHES OFF
     THE GROUND, COVERS THE AREA IN FRONT OF THE SO-ATTRACTIVE
     TREE.  STARLING FOLLOWS THE TRIPWIRE DOWN, PARALLEL TO THE
     FENCE.  SHE STEPS OVER THE TRIPWIRE AND PROCEEDS DOWN,
     WATCHING THE FENCE, LOOKING INTENTLY. 

     SHE GOES INTO A GULLY WHERE WE SEE THAT A RUNOFF OF A STREAM
     IS ERODING A HOLE UNDERNEATH THE BARBEDWIRE FENCE.

     ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE GETS DOWN ON THE GROUND, TAKES A
     STICK AND PROBES IN THE FLOW OF WATER UNDERNEATH THE 
     FENCE.  SHE NODS, SATISFIED, AND BEGINS TO USE THE STICK TO
     ENLARGE THE OPENING UNDER THE FENCE.

     INT VERGER' S ROOM.  NIGHT.

     CORDELL STARTS TO PUSH THE GURNEYBED OUT OF THE ROOM.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                Oh, yes, one waits so long, and then, and
                then ...ALMOST BY MAGIC...Yes, proceed.
                Please.... proceed... 

     CORDELL STARTS TO EXIT.

                          VERGER 
                OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it. 

     CORDELL MOVES TO THE FORKLIFT, STARTS IT, AND IT MOVES
     TOWARD THE GURNEY.

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE WATCHES THE FORKLIFT GENTLY PICK UP
     VERGER IN THE GURNEYBED.  THE SOUND OF SCREAMING STOPS.

                On the ground, on the ground... 

     SHE MOVES TO HIM, AS HE COMPLIES, AND REMOVES HANDCUFFS, AND
     CUFFS THE MAN AROUND A POLE.  HE STARTS TO REMONSTRATE, AND
     SHE HITS HIM ON THE HEAD WITH HER GUNBUTT.  SHE EXITS THE
     TACKROOM, AND ENTERS THE BARN AND ADVANCES ON THE MAULED
     AND BEATEN FORM OF LECHTER.

                          LECHTER 
                Good morning, Clarice. 

                          STARLING

                          LECHTER
                Perhaps... shall we see...? 

                          STARLING

                understand...?  Do right and you'll live

     STARLING TAKES OUT A KNIFE, AND BEGINS TO CUT THE DOCTOR LOOSE.

                I'll do the rest, if you give me the
                knife. 

     SHE LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER, AT THE FORKLIFT COMING DOWN THE
     HILL. 

                          STARLING 
                No, I don't think so. 

     LECHTER HAS FREED HIMSELF, AND IS CHAFING HIS LIMBS TO
     RESTORE CIRCULATION. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                    (AS SHE POINTS TO THE FORKLIFT) 
                I'm going to subdue our friends, coming

     PISTOL, BUT IT IS JUST OUT OF REACH. 

     HE LOOKS UP.

     ANGLE

                Stop there, would you, please, Doctor...?

                          LECHTER
                The girl could use some help. 

                          VERGER
                You're free...

                Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the
                only crime.  I never ceased to hope! 

                          LECHTER 
                The girl needs help. 

                          VERGER 
                And what would be of Greater Help, than
                to release her, from the bonds of this
                sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU
                THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE 
                TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE
                ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND

                          LECHTER 
                For a consideration.

                you'd just stop doing that, I'm going to

                Then you goin to hell... 

                          HANNIBAL
                ...that's right... 

     FRANKLIN LOOSES THE ROPE WHICH HOLDS LECHTER, AND LECHTER
     ENTERS THE PIGPEN.  WE SEE THE PIGS, AT THE FAR END, 
     SAVAGING WHAT WE ASSUME TO BE THE FORMS OF VERGER AND
     CORDELL. 

     ANGLE 

     ON HANNIBAL, AS HE STOOPS TO THE FORM OF STARLING, AND 
     GATHERS HER UP.  THE PIGS ADVANCE ON HIM, AND THEN STOP...
     HE STEPS THROUGH THEM, AND OUT OF THE BARN. 

     ANGLE EXT THE BARN. 

     STARLING, PUT DOWN IN THE GRASS.  BEAT.  SHE STIRS.  SHE HALF-
     OPENS HER EYES.

     ANGLE, HER POV LECHTER, WALKING TOWARD HER, BEHIND HIM THE
     VERGER ESTATE BURSTING INTO ROARING FLAMES.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN, STANDING BY THE FLAMES, LOOKING AT LECHTER, AS
     HE WALKS UP TOWARD STARLING. 

     ANGLE 

     ON LECHTER, AS HE PICKS UP STARLING, WE SEE A SECURITY CAR
     COMING DOWN THE DRIVE, AS LECHTER AND STARLING FADE INTO
     THE WOODS. 

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

     INT SUMPTUOUS, ELEGANT DININGROOM.

     STARLING, IN A DECOLLETE EVENING GOWN, STANDING IN FRONT OF 
     A PERFECT PRESENTATION OF BACCARAT AND LIMOGES.

     ANGLE HER POV.

     LECHTER, IN A TUXEDO, STANDING AGAINST THE BALCONY OF THE 
     ROOM, WHICH LOOKS OUT ON THE SEA.  HE SMILES AT HER.

                          LECHTER
                You look lovely. 

                          STARLING
                Thank you. 
                    (SHE MOVES TO SIT, AND 
                     LECHTER COMES UP AND HOLDS
                     HER CHAIR FOR HER) 
                No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you
                find me so..."

                          LECHTER 
                I'd prefer you to say what you feel. 

                          STARLING
                What is that that smells so wonderful. 

                          LECHTER 
                I hope you'll find it so. 
                    (HE POURS HER A GLASS OF
                     WINE) 
                Yes.  It's good to see you regaining 
                your strength... 

                          STARLING
                Thanks to you... 

     WE SEE LECHTER EXCUSE HIMSELF, AND RETIRE INTO THE KITCHEN.
     WE SEE HIM TAKING DOWN SAUCEPANS, AND MIXING WHAT APPEARS TO
     BE A MARINADE.

                          LECHTER
                Now, what were we last speaking of...? 

                          STARLING 
                We were speaking of my father... 

     LECHTER POURS THE MARINADE INTO A PAN, LIGHTS THE FLAME IN
     THE STOVE, WIPES HIS HANDS, AND RETURNS TO THE DININGROOM. 

                          LECHTER
                ...I'm sorry....? 

                          STARLING 
                ...we were speaking of my father... 

                          LECHTER
                Indeed we were. 

                          STARLING 
                ...and my need for The Institution... 

                          LECHTER 
                Freud, do you know...?  Freud 
                psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon. 

                          STARLING 
                And how did he do that? 

                          LECHTER 
                He saw the truth, and spoke it... 

                          STARLING 
                I'm afraid, this wine is making me
                woozy... 

                          LECHTER 
                ...you have to eat... 

     LECHTER RETURNS TO THE KITCHEN, INDICATING "ONE MOMENT." 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                    (AS THE CAMERA TAKES HIM TO 
                     THE KITCHEN, AND WE HALF-SEE
                     THE TORSO OF A MAN SITTING
                     IN A KITCHEN CHAIR) 
                You've sought out The Institution all 
                your life, as you with it to replace your
                Father.  This is obvious.  Less obvious
                is this:  that you require the 
                institution not to support you, but to 
                FAIL.  FOR THIS KEEPS YOUR FATHER ALIVE. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, SITTING, NODDING, AS SHE DRINKS HER WINE.  SHE
     PUTS THE GLASS DOWN, A TRIFLE WOOZY. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                ...as this keeps your father alive.  The
                truth is two-fold, and the truth is one: 

     THE WIND FROM THE OCEAN BLOWS A STRAND OF HAIR ACROSS HER
     EYES, SHE BRUSHES IT BACK. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd)
                    (VO) 
                That every man is fallible, that every
                institution, being made of men, cannot
                but be corrupt... 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, LOOKING DOWN AT HER HAND. 

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     THE HAND IS COVERED WITH MUD AND BLOOD.

     ANGLE, STARLING, LOOKING PERPLEXED, AT THE KITCHEN WHERE WE 
     SEE THE FORM OF LECHTER, MOVING ACROSS THE KITCHEN.

     ANGLE 

     ON LECHTER.

     AS WE SEE, HE CARRIES A SCALPEL, HE MOVES TOWARD THE HALF-
     SEEN FORM OF THE MAN IN THE CHAIR.

     HE BENDS DOWN OVER THE MAN, AND WE SEE THAT HE CARRIES A
     SCALPEL AND A SMALL MEDICAL SAW... 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                ...the only art in this dish, of course,
                is that it must be fresh... 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, IN THE ROOM, AS SHE PICKS UP A SMALL ROSEBUD
     FROM THE CUT CRYSTAL BUDVASE IN FRONT OF HER.

     SHE LOOKS AT IT WOOZILY, AND IT FALLS FROM HER FINGERS.
     SHE BENDS DOWN.

     ANGLE, HER POV, THE FLOOR.

     THE ROSEBUD, ON A FILTHY, TORN LINOLEUM FLOOR, HER LEGS
     ENCASED IN THE MUDDY PANTS WE SAW HER IN AT VERGER'S FARM. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE STRAIGHTENS, HOLDING THE ROSE.  WE SEE A
     LOOK OF CONSTERNATION ON HER FACE.  HER FACE IS BLOODY, AND
     COVERED IN MUD, WE SEE SHE IS NOT IN A SUMPTUOUS
     DININGROOM, BUT IN A SLUM. 

     ANGLE HER POV 

     LECHTER, IN THE KITCHEN, IN TUXEDO, MOVING PAST THE DOORWAY.

     ANGLE INT THE KITCHEN.

     LECHTER, AS WE NOW SEE, IN THE FILTHY KITCHEN OF A SLUM. 
     COOKING ON A HOTPLATE.  DRESSED IN WORKCLOTHES, CAMERA TAKES
     HIM, FROM BEHIND, TO THE SLUMPED FORM OF THE MAN, CAMERA CUTS
     OFF AT THE MAN'S SHOULDERS, WE SEE LECHTER, FROM THE BACK,
     LIFTING SOMETHING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE MAN'S HEAD, AND
     CARRYING IT BACK TO THE FILTHY TABLETOP, WHERE, AS HE SPEAKS,
     HE BEGINS KNEADING IT WITH FLOUR, WE SEE THE PAN SIZZLING
     ON THE HOTPLATE. 

     ANGLE 

     IN THE SLUM ROOM.  STARLING, DAZED, AND LECHTER, REENTERING. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                That the institution cannot but be 
                corrupt, and, therefore, it cannot be
                but an act of complicity to seek to
                appease it. 

     HE MOVES BACK INTO THE KITCHEN, PUTS THE BREADED PIECES OF
     CUTLET INTO THE PAN, THE FIRE SHOOTS UP. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                So many civilizations eat their slain
                enemies... what do you think...?  How
                much better to devour a person 
                physically, than to devour his spirit. 
                Which is, of course, the purpose of the
                institution. 

     HE REMOVES THE MEAT FROM THE PAN, AND FORKS IT ONTO A TIN
     PLATE.

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                    (REENTERING THE DININGROOM) 
                :and that is the especial surprise,
                I've prepared for You! 

                          STARLING
                I feel weak... 

                          LECHTER
                    (NODDING) 
                ...you must eat. 

     SHE LOOKS DOWN AT THE TABLE.  SHE PICKS UP HER FORK.

     ANGLE HER POV 

     THE LOVELY LINEN TABLE, THE STEAMING MEAT ON THE LIMOGES
     PLATE. 

     A HUGE COCKROACH, SCURRYING ACROSS THE TABLECLOTH.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE RISES, UNSTEADILY, IN HER MUDDY
     CLOTHES...

                          STARLING 
                ...1 don't understand... 

     SHE WALKS TOWARD THE BALCONY WINDOW, LOOKING OUT AT THE
     OCEAN.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     OUT THE WINDOW, A SQUALID CITY STREET, SEEN FROM THE THIRD
     FLOOR. 

     A COUPLE OF CARS STOPPING AT THE END OF THE STREET.

     ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE TURNS BACK TOWARD LECHTER.

                          LECHTER
                    (IN THE KITCHEN) 
                The gift, of course is not the meal--
                but the identification--which of us does
                not need help?  The identity, of your
                true enemy...? 
                ...for you always sought to befriend, to
                wish the love of those who wished you ill. 

     ANGLE, ON LECHTER, STANDING BEFORE THE FIGURE TIED TO THE
     CHAIR. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                Come here--he is in no pain, there are
                no nerves in the brain, come here... 

     ANGLE, LECHTER'S POV THE FIGURE OF CRAWFORD TIED TO THE
     CHAIR. 

     LECHTER MOVES TO HIM AND EXTRACTS FROM HIS UPPER POCKET, A
     XEROX OF THE PHOTO OF THE BADGE WITH THE HOLE IN IT. 

                          LECHTER (CONT'D) 
                Come here, I'm going to cure you. 

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     STARLING, IN THE SLUMROOM, LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW.

     ANGLE 

     STARLING, DAZED, LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW, LECHTER COMES 
     UP BEHIND HER, AND LOOKS OUT.

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     THE SLUM STREET, A VAN NOW PULLING UP, A SQUAD OF SWAT 
     OFFICERS APPROACHING A PARKED CAR.

     ANGLE

     ON LECHTER AND CLARICE.

     LECHTER APPROACHES HER.

     ANGLE HIS POV, 

     STARLING, IN THE BEAUTIFUL GOWN, HE MOVES AS IF TO CARESS 
     HER BREAST.

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS DOWN.  WE SEE SHE IS NOW
     CLOTHED IN HER FILTHY CLOTHES, AND LECHTER IS FRISKING
     HER. 

     ANGLE 

     LECHTER, FRISKING THE FILTHY STARLING, TAKES OUT THE
     MARINECORP HATBADGE, WHICH WE SAW EARLIER, HE BREAKS IT
     OPEN, AND REVEALS A MICROTRANSMITTER.

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                Oh, no.  Oh, NO.  They've put a beeper on
                you.  How careless of me.  How finally 
                careless, Do you think?  Have I erred on
                Purpose?  Eh?  Or am I just unlucky? 
                Could one not say that's the essential
                question of Philosophy...? 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, DAZED, LOOKING ON.

                          STARLING 
                Might I have some more of the wine...? 

     ANGLE ON LECHTER, AS HE MOVES TO A BACK WINDOW.

     STARLING, AS SHE RISES, AGAIN, IN HER BALLGOWN. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                Because, I find I like the effects.  You
                may say that it's inebriation, but it
                seems 
                    (SHE SMILES) 
                This lovely evening, in particular.... it 
                seems to reward me with clarity...
                    (SHE LAUGHS) 

     THERE IS A SOUND BEHIND HER.  THE BEAUTIFUL FRENCHDOORS 
     OPEN AND ADMIT A HAPPY COTERIE OF GOWNED WOMEN AND FORMAL
     DRESSED MEN, THEY ARE ALL CHATTERING THEIR JOY AT SEEING 
     HER. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                ....or perhaps, it is just the heat... I
                was just saying to the Doctor...

     ANGLE HER POV THE OPEN WINDOW, THE SHADES BLOWING.

     CAMERA COMES BACK TO STARLING, WHO IS IN HER RAGS, WITH THE
     SWAT TEAM ENTERING THE ROOM. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                But, do you know, do you know, I'm not
                feeling altogether.... 

     SHE SWOONS.  A SWAT MAN CATCHES HER.

                          SWAT MAN
                ...I've got her... 

     ANGLE 

     IN THE SLUMROOM, WE SEE THAT A SWAT TEAM HAS ENTERED.  ONE OF
     THEM HAS CAUGHT THE FAINTING STARLING IN HIS ARMS.  THE
     SEVERAL MEN PROCEED TOWARD THE BACK OF THE KITCHEN. 

                          STARLING 
                    (AS WE SEE SHE IS IN 
                     KRENDLER'S ARMS)
                ...may be the heat....

                          KRENDLER 
                Let's get her out of here....

     SWAT OFFICER, FROM THE KITCHEN.  AS HE GAZES IN THE
     DIRECTION OF CRAWFORD.

                          STARLING 
                But as my father used to say...

                          SWAT OFFICER
                    (IN KITCHEN)
                ...ohmiGod. 

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT TEXAS GRAVEYARD DAY. 

     A NEW MARBLE HEADSTONE BEING LOWERED ONTO A GRAVE.  IT IS
     ORNATE AND SOLID, AND READS:  JAMES RANDALL STARLING, HUSBAND
     AND FATHER.  DIED 1975.

     ANGLE 

     STARLING STANDING BY THE GRAVE, HOLDING FLOWERS, BEHIND HER
     STAND MAPP AND HER BOYFRIEND.  BEHIND THEM STAND AN OFFICIAL
     LOOKING MAN, WHO HOLDS HIS STETSON, REVERENTLY, IN FRONT OF
     HIM.  IN THE BG WE SEE A TRUCK MOVING SLOWLY DOWN THE
     DUSTY CEMETERY ROAD. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE KNEELS, AS THE STONE IS PLACED,
     PUTTING A SMALL BOUQUET OF FLOWERS NEXT TO IT.  AS SHE 
     KNEELS, AND CAMERA CRANES DOWN, WE READ THE BOTTOM OF THE
     INSCRIPTION:  "DIED 1975.  HE WILL NEVER KNOW HOW HE WAS
     MISSED." 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE STANDS, AND MAPP COMES, AND PUTS HER ARM
     AROUND HER.

                          MAPP 
                That's why it's a stone, you know, It
                means Don't Come Back. 

     STARLING NODS, AND THEY TURN AWAY, AND WALK AWAY FROM THE
     GRAVE.  IN THE BG WE SEE ANOTHER GROUP OF MOURNERS, WEARING
     WESTERN GARB.  STARLING AND HER GROUP CROSS A SERVICE ROAD,
     IN FRONT OF THE OLD TRUCK.

                          STARLING 
                Well.  No.  He can't come back. 

                          MAPP 
                Baby, that's the beginning of wisdom. 

     MAPP PUTS HER ARM AROUND STARLING, AS THEY WALK OFF.
     STARLING NODS, THAT SHE UNDERSTANDS, AND LAYS HER HEAD ON
     MAPP'S SHOULDER.

     WE SEE SEVERAL GRAVEDIGGERS SITTING ON THE BACK.  THE MAN IN
     THE PASSENGER SEAT, WEARING A STRAW WESTERN HAT, TURNS, TO
     LOOK AT STARLING AND THE GROUP.  IT LOOKS LIKE LECHTER. 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AND HER GROUP, AS THE MAN IN THE TRUCK
     MOMENTARILY CATCHES HER EYE. 

     ANGLE

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS AT THE APPROACHING FIGURE.

                Well, you know my name, honey, but I
                don't know yours... 

                          STARLING
                Give it up. 

                          DRUMGO
                Hey, you know, I never thought of
                that... 

     SHE STARTS GETTING INTO THE NURSES GARB. 

                          DRUMGO (cont'd) 
                Ain't this a picture, though, cause you
                know you ain't the first girl, ever got
                lef, in a position, waiting at the

                don't you know that.... old as you
                are...? 

     SHE WALKS BACK TOWARD STARLING, SCOOPS UP HER CHILD, PEEKS
     OUT THE WINDOW, AND STARTS FOR THE DOOR. 

                          DRUMGO (cont'd) 
                Cause, see, they'll always let you down.
                Terrible thing, to do to an orphan... 

     SHE LEANS BACK TOWARD STARLING, GRABS HER HAIR, AND PULLS HER
     BACK AND KISSES HER ON THE LIPS, AND RETIRES AND EXITS.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS OUT OF THE WINDOW.  AT A CAR, WHICH
     IS IN THE FAR END OF THE PARKING LOT, IT ACCELERATES, AND
     SCREECHES UP TO THE DOOR, AND EVELDA, CARRYING HER CHILD,
     GETS IN TO THE STILL MOVING CAR, WHICH STARTS TO TAKE OFF.

     ANGLE EXT THE MIDWIVES CENTER.

     STARLING, CROUCHING AT THE DOOR, RETRIEVES A BACKUP WEAPON
     FROM HER ANKLE HOLSTER.  SHE EMERGES FROM THE DOORWAY. 

     ANGLE 

     IN THE PARKING LOT, DRUMGO AND CHILD, GETTING HAULED INTO 
     THE CAR.  A FIGURE IN THE BACKSEAT OF THE CAR, SHOOTING OVER
     THE ROOF, APACHE STYLE, FIRES AT STARLING, AS THE CAR PEALS
     OUT OF THE PARKINGLOT.

     STARLING TAKES COVER.

     SITS ON A LOW CONCRETE DIVIDER.  HOLD.  A VAN PULLS IN. 
     FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER CAR, AND TEN SWAT CLAD COPS PILE OUT,
     AND APPROACH STARLING.

     STARLING SLOWLY LOOKS UP. 

                          STARLING 
                ....where were you...? 
                    (SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH. ) 

                          SWAT OFFICER 
                    (AS SEVERAL OTHER OFFICERS

                    (AS SHE HANDS HIM THE SMALL
                     RADIO TRANSMITTER) 
                Yeah, well, you didn't get it cause your
                radio went dead.  The backup plan was,
                17.45, you guys are the Cavalry... 

     SHE GETS UP AND WALKS AWAY FROM THE DOORSTEP, TO A SEDAN,
     WHICH IS PULLING UP.  AS SHE GOES, SHE TAKES OFF THE FAKE
     BELLY SHE HAS BEEN WEARING.

     ANOTHER SWAT AGENT TAKES THE RADIO AND LOOKS AT IT.

                ...what happened to Right to Life...?
                    (HE LAUGHS) 

     STARLING ROUNDS ON HIM, HITS HIM SEVERAL TIMES, AND THROWS
     HIM TO THE GROUND.

                          STARLING 
                What happened to Right to Life?  What 
                happened to right to my life...?  I'm in
                there, carrying the mail for all you 
                drugstore cowboys, si'in in a van playin
                with each other's Velcro... 
                    (THE OFFICER STARTS TO GET UP) 
                You wanna get up, you wanna get up?
                Here I am... 

     TWO FBI TYPES GET OUT OF THE NEWLY ARRIVED SEDAN.

                          KRENDLER

                          STARLING

                          CRAWFORD 
                Just a moment.  Starling didn't... 

                          KRENDLER 
                Well, well, well, well, well, she went 
                in there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon.
                Went in there with her gun, Came out,
                without the Felon, without the gun... 

     STARLING STARTS TO SPEAK, AND CRAWFORD STILLS HER. 

                          CRAWFORD 
                I had... one moment, I had an agent in

                          STARLING 
                I could have acted on my own.  I was
                told... 

                          CRAWFORD 
                Starling, I've ordered you to shut... 

                          STARLING 
                ..I was instructed that this was a 
                Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the
                Mayor's Special... 

                          KRENDLER 
                You find something objectionable to
                working in partnership with.... 

                          STARLING 
                Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out
                there, dealing with an armed and
                dangerous... 

                          KRENDLER 
                You were given backup....

                          STARLING 
                THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out 
                there... I'm told that the arrest must
                be a joint... 

                          KRENDLER
                I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that. 

                          STARLING 
                And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a 
                Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance
                to Play, that's fine, but... 

                          KRENDLER
                No, I don't get you... 

                          STARLING 
                Due respect, you don't, sir, your 
                precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC
                SWAT, it's alphabet soup, we don't have
                the same Radio Freqs, we don't... 

                          KRENDLER 
                Oh, is this your political position,
                you're opposed to Joint... 

                          STARLING 
                I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow
                Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of 
                took her down in a snap of the fingers--
                But-- I'm out there, and my Rules of

                          MAYOR'S REP 
                The Rainbow Coalition, what is that,
                excuse me... 

                          KRENDLER 
                And what are you, our Token Woman? 

                          STARLING 
                I don't mind being the token woman, what

                the Arrival of the Strike Force.

                Well, you know, that happens, on the

                I think its meaning is clear. 

                          KRENDLER 
                What, you're saying she was overwrought. 

                          CRAWFORD
                That could be. 

                          KRENDLER 
                Because that's understandable, because.
                She blew the raid.

                control your rage....

     STARLING STARTS TO LAUGH.

                Well, that would be a poor choice,
                wouldn't it...

                I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. 
                Because, you know, you can't understand. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST
                Then tell me. 

                          STARLING 
                Well, you know, you know, you know, the
                point is:  I can't tell you.  Cause you 
                haven't been there.  You haven't done it.
                And that's all there is.

                    (PAUSE.  SHE CHECKS HER NOTES) 
                ...and to have done it, means, can mean 
                to accept, not only danger, but 
                betrayal...?

                          STARLING
                ....that's right.

                          STARLING 
                No.  That's right.  That's all part of

                          PSYCHIATRIST 
                Then, that being so, why is today 
                special?  Why have you come back to see 
                me?  Is it that new file they gave you? 

                          STARLING

                Yes.  I think I do.

                I think it is a phrase you used with
                that woman.  You told her you were an

     INT COPBAR NIGHT.

     STARLING IS DRINKING WITH ARDELIA MAPP, A CONTEMPORARY, AND
     ARDELIA'S BOYFRIEND, JIM.  THERE ARE VARIOUS EMPTY BOTTLES
     IN FRONT OF THEM.

     STARLING IS LOOKING DOWN AT THE FILE WE SAW EARLIER, AND
     SCOWLING. 

     MAPP AND JIM LOOK ON.  A WAITRESS COMES BY. 

                          MAPP 
                You want another drink, honey...? 

                          STARLING 
                I want the same drink.  Cause it did me
                good... but I already drunk it, so,
                barring that, yes, I would like another. 

     THE WAITRESS EXITS. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                B'cause it's one of the few things, in
                the world, which are effective
                an'predictable. 

                          MAPP

                          MAPP 
                I guess the only thing is Suck it

                          STARLING 
                Well.  Excellent... I'm... 

     THERE IS A SOUND OF RENEWED CHEERING, AND HEADS TURN.

     ANGLE. 

     BRIGHAM, BEING CONGRATULATED AND THANKED BY THE VARIOUS
     FOREIGN COPS. 

     BRIGHAM PASSES OUT CAPS WHICH ARE BLAZONED "FBI ACADEMY,
     QUANTICO, VIRGINIA."

     WE SEE BRIGHAM NOTICE STARLING, ET AL, AND EXCUSE HIMSELF.

     ONE OF THE FOREIGN COPS CALLS AFTER HIM.

                          BRIGHAM 
                ...truer words were never spoken... 

     CAMERA TAKES HIM TO THE STARLING TABLE, WHERE STARLING,
     DRUNK, IS LOOKING THROUGH THE FILE.

                          STARLING

                he can't work, and he won't steal... 

     BRIGHAM SITS, AND KISSES STARLING. 

                          STARLING
                Oh baby, oh baby....

                          BRIGHAM 
                Bad beat today.

                          MAPP 
                Look what they put her on... 

     SHE TAKES THE FILE FROM STARLING AND HANDS IT TO BRIGHAM.

                          STARLING 
                No, that is code-word material, that's 
                what that is....

     ANGLE ON BRIGHAM AS HE PICKS UP THE FILE. IT CONTAINS A 
     CATALOGUE FROM AN AUCTION HOUSE, AND WE READ:  FROM A
     COLLECTOR:  DRAWINGS AND SKETCHES BY HANNIBAL LECHTER:
     THESE NEVER-BEFORE OFFERED ITEMS WERE ORIGINALLY IN THE HIGH-

                That's weak.  The man's long gone, he's
                not coming back, buy up a drawing... 

                          STARLING

     KNOT OF DRUNKEN COPS.

     IN THE BG WE SEE PAZZI, AT HIS TABLE, POINTING OUT 
     STARLING, THEY TURN TO LOOK AT HER, WE SEE ONE OF THE 
     FOREIGN COPS, LEAN OVER TO ASK MORE INFORMATION OF PAZZI, 
     AND, THEN, TURN BACK, TO DO A DOUBLETAKE AT THE RETREATING STARLING. 

     ANGLE 

     ON BRIGHAM, HELPING STARLING.

                          BRIGHAM 
                You want to get married...? 

                          STARLING 
                You tol me you wuunt ask me again til
                I'm ready.... 

                          BRIGHAM
                You're ready now. 

                          STARLING
                I'm not. 

                          BRIGHAM 
                That's what you think... 

     EXT STARLING'S APARTMENT BUILDING NIGHT. 

     BRIGHAM AND STARLING WALKING UP, STARLING SWAYING A LITTLE,
     HE HOLDS OUT HIS HAND FOR THE KEY, AND SHE GIVES IT TO HIM. 

                          STARLING
                ...mos kind... 

     WE HEAR A CAR COMING UP THE STREET BEHIND THEM.

     BRIGHAM OPENS THE DOOR. 

     THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE.  AS 
     STARLING IS ABOUT TO ENTER.  SHE PUSHES BRIGHAM OFF TO THE
     SIDE OF THE DOOR, AND UNHOLSTERS HER PISTOL. 

     BEAT. 

     STARLING LOOKS AT BRIGHAM WHO LOOK UNCOMPREHENDING.  ANOTHER
     CAR IS HEARD COMING UP THE ROAD, AND WE SEE ITS HEADLIGHT 
     SHINE ON AND REFLECT FROM A MIRROR INSIDE STARLING'S DOOR. 

     BRIGHAM LEADS STARLING INTO THE HOUSE. 

     HE CLOSES THE DOOR, AND TAKES HER TO THE SOFA. 

     SHE SITS, AND PICKS UP A PHOTOGRAPH IN AN EASELFRAME FROM THE 
     COFFEETABLE. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                Hey, now, what was I afraid of... I'm 
                shooting at shadows... 

                          BRIGHAM 
                Is that what you're afraid of...? 

     ANGLE INS ON THE PHOTOGRAPH, SHOWS A TALL HANDSOME MAN IN
     WESTERN HAT, WEARING A BADGE, HIS HAND ON THE SHOULDER OF A
     YOUNG BLONDE GIRL.

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE PUTS THE PHOTO DOWN. 

                          STARLING 
                Then you tell me, then. 

                          BRIGHAM 
                You want me to solve all your problems
                tonight...? 

                          STARLING
                I feel... 
                    (SHE STARTS TO LAUGH) 
                I feel they're Out to Get Me... 

                          BRIGHAM 
                And who is "they?" 

                          STARLING
                ...they're sending me.  Out to get
                Shot.  Hounding me.... they're...
                    (PAUSE) 

                          BRIGHAM 
                ...the whole world's out to get you... 

                          STARLING 
                How crazy is that. 

                          BRIGHAM 
                Well, you wanna shoot back, it give you a
                big target... 

                          STARLING
                    (SLEEPILY) 
                How crazy is that....

     ANGLE, INS. ON THE LECHTER FILE, AND THE PHOTO OF HANNIBAL
     LECHTER. 

     WE SEE BRIGHAM PUT IT DOWN ON THE TABLE NEXT TO THE PHOTO.
     HOLD, LIGHTS GO OFF. 

     BEAT.  STARLING'S HAND COMES INTO THE FRAME, SWEEPS THE
     LECHTER PHOTO AND FILE ONTO THE FLOOR, AND REPLACES IT WITH
     THE PHOTO OF THE WESTERN GARBED MAN AND THE LITTLE BLONDE
     GIRL. 

     BEAT. 

     THE LIGHT GOES ON AGAIN. 

     WE SEE STARLING SWING TO A SITTING POSITION ON THE COUCH. 
     SHE SIGHS.  SHE SHAKES HER HEAD TO CLEAR IT, AND SHE PULLS
     THE HANNIBAL FILE TO HER.  SHE PICKS UP A PENCIL, AND A PAIR 
     OF READING GLASSES FROM THE TABLE, AND BEGINS MAKING NOTES
     ON THE FILE. 

     ANGLE INS. 

     THE AUCTION CATALOGUE, AN FBI FILE, READING, "SALE OF STOLEN
     HANNIBAL LECHTER MATERIAL."

     EXT VIRGINIA HIGHWAY DAY. 

     STARLING'S FBI SEDAN SPEEDING PAST, ON AN EMPTY COUNTRY ROAD.

     THE CAR PULLS OVER ONTO THE SHOULDER.

     ANGLE INT THE CAR. 

     STARLING, TAKING OUT A MAP.  SHE LOOKS AT THE MAP.  LOOKS 
     AROUND.  SHE THROWS THE CAR INTO REVERSE, AND REVERSES
     SEVERAL HUNDRED YARDS QUICKLY. 

     ANGLE INT THE CAR. 

     STARLING LOOKS FROM THE MAP ACROSS THE ROAD.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     A BARELY DISCERNIBLE BREAK IN THE FOLIAGE, BEAT, THEN 
     STARLING' S CAR PULLS ACROSS THE ROAD, AND INTO THE POV AND
     ENTERS THE BREAK. 

     ANGLE EXT THE CAR. 

     EMERGING FROM A THICK WOODS, THE CAR IS HINGED BY THE CAMERA
     ONTO THE PARK OF A COUNTRY ESTATE, THE CAR DISAPPEARS INTO A
     SMALL DIP IN THE LANDSCAPE.

     ANGLE EXT THE CAR, AT A GATEHOUSE, PREVIOUSLY HIDDEN BY THE
     CONTOUR OF THE LAND.  WE SEE A SMALL DECREPIT GATEHOUSE IN
     STONE, AND, BEYOND IT, A FLIMSY AND ANCIENT BARRICADE, AN
     OLD GAMEKEEPER TYPE IN TWEEDS COMES OUT OF THE GUARDHOUSE.
     HE IS CARRYING A MUG OF COFFEE AND HAS A NAPKIN TUCKED INTO
     HIS COLLAR.  HE REMOVES THE NAPKIN AND APPROACHES THE CAR. 

     STARLING FLASHES HER CREDENTIALS TO THE OLD MAN, WHO HOLDS
     A CLIPBOARD. 

                          STARLING 
                Special Agent Clarice Starling, to see
                Mason Verger. 

     THE MAN AMBLES BACK INTO THE GATEHOUSE.

     ANGLE INT THE GATEHOUSE, THE OLD MAN ENTERS, AND CAMERA
     PULLS BACK TO SHOW, IN A ROOM OFF THE MAIN ROOM, THE FIT
     BODYGUARD TYPES, WATCHING STARLING ON A TV MONITOR.  THERE IS
     A RAFT OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT IN THE ROOM, AND A RACK WITH
     SEVERAL ASSAULT RIFLES ON IT.  ONE OF THE GUARDS IS TYPING
     ONTO A COMPUTER TERMINAL.  HE LOOKS AT THE RESULT, AND
     GLANCES UP AT STARLING, ON THE SCREEN, AND NODS "OKAY" TO THE
     OLD MAN.  THE OLD MAN AMBLES OUT TO THE BARRIER, HAVING
     PICKED UP AN OLD CLIPBOARD AT WHICH HE SQUINTS. 

     THEN, SATISFIED, HE RAISES THE BARRIER, AND STARLING'S CAR
     GOES THROUGH.

     EXT A MAGNIFICENT COUNTRY ESTATE HOUSE.

     A POTATOCHIP VAN IS PARKED TO ONE SIDE IN THE WIDE DRIVE.
     AN OLD RETAINER HOLDS OPEN THE DOOR FOR STARLING, AS SHE
     EXITS FROM HER SEDAN, AND HE SHOWS HER INTO A LARGE 
     OPEN MORNING ROOM, IN WHICH WE FIND TWENTY YOUNG CHILDREN
     OF VARIOUS RACES, ROMPING ON A SELECTION OF NEW TOYS. 

     CAMERA TAKES STARLING THROUGH A MODERN KITCHEN, WHERE 
     SEVERAL WHITE UNIFORMED COOKS ARE WORKING HAPPILY, ONE IS
     OPENING A VAST TIN OF POTATOCHIPS.  ONE OF THEM IS REMOVING A
     TRAY OF COOKIES FROM THE OVEN, SEVERAL TYKES WAIT HAPPILY
     NEARBY.  THE COOK WITH THE TRAY OF COOKIES GIVES STARLING
     A WIDE GRIN.

     THE RETAINER TAKES STARLING PAST THE KITCHEN, TO A DOUBLE
     DOOR, WHICH HE OPENS TO REVEAL A CORRIDOR BEYOND, AND A 
     LARGE FIT MAN IN HIS THIRTIES, WEARING AN ORDERLY'S WHITES,
     COMING TOWARD THE CAMERA.

                          CORDELL 
                Agent Starling, would you come with
                me...? 

     CORDELL BOWS TO THE OLD RETAINER, WHO RETIRES.

     CORDELL AND STARLING WALK DOWN THE CORRIDOR.

                          STARLING 
                The children...? 

                          CORDELL 
                ...they're from Baltimore.... 

                          STARLING 
                I've never heard that he... 

                          CORDELL 
                It's not something he wants to 
                publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he
                does. 

     BEAT. 

                          STARLING 
                I won't take much of his time. 

                          CORDELL 
                He's glad to help.  ...it's just a 
                question of his physical condition.  You
                Understand... 

     CAMERA TAKES STARLING DOWN A CORRIDOR LINED WITH
     HUNTINGPRINTS.  AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR AN OLD WOMAN
     SITS IN A WOODEN CHAIR, KNITTING. 

     THEY HAVE STOPPED.  WAITING FOR THE WOMAN TO LOOK UP. 
     STARLING'S GAZE IS DRAWN BY AN OLD, CREWEL-WORK "SAMPLER"
     FRAMED ON THE WALL BY THE OLD WOMAN'S CHAIR.  AND OBVIOUS
     ANTIQUE.  IT READS: 

     "DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY.  DO NOT TRUST TO PROSPERITY."

     ANGLE ON CORDELL AND STARLING, AS STARLING LOOKS AT THE
     SAMPLER, AND THE OLD WOMAN LOOKS UP FROM HER KNITTING. 

     SHE SITS IN FRONT OF A HALF-OPENED DOOR, WHICH WE SEE IS
     THE DOOR TO A LINEN CLOSET.

                          CORDELL (cont'd)
                ...y'get enough breakfast, Rosie...? 

     BEAT.  XCU ON THE OLD WOMAN, AS SHE LOOKS AT STARLING, AND 
     THEN NODS TO CORDELL, AS IF TO SAY, "THAT IS THE CORRECT 
     CODE."

     ANGLE INS.

     HER HAND DROPS TO THE BACK OF THE WOODEN CHAIR, AND PRESSES 
     A BUTTON CONCEALED IN THE LEG.

     ANGLE 

     THE GROUP IN THE CORRIDOR, THE "LINEN CLOSET," OPENS, TO 
     REVEAL, BEYOND IT, WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SURGICAL FACILITY,
     OR HIGH-TECH HOSPITAL ROOM. 

     INT THE HIGHTECH ROOM.

     THERE IS A NURSE, SITTING AT A STATION, MONITORING VARIOUS
     LIFESIGN DISPLAYS.  SHE LOOKS UP BRIEFLY, AS CORDELL AND
     STARLING ENTER . 

                          NURSE
                    (TO CORDELL) 
                Five minutes... 

     CORDELL NODS, AND TAKES STARLING DEEPER INTO THE ROOM.  WE
     BEGIN TO HEAR THE SUSURRUS OF A MECHANICAL BREATHING
     APPARATUS.  CAMERA GOES WITH STARLING INTO THE ROOM, WHERE WE
     SEE A HOSPITAL BED, WITH A SCREEN IN FRONT OF IT, AND 
     VARIOUS TELEVISION DISPLAYS ABOVE IT, ANGLED TO BE SEEN FROM
     THE BED. 

     STARLING APPROACHES THE BED, AND LOOKS DOWN AT THE FIGURE
     IN IT.  WE SEE HER FACE, BUT THE FIGURE IS SCREENED.  THE
     FIGURE, VERGER, SPEAKS BREATH BY BREATH, WITH AN OBVIOUS
     ELECTRONIC ENHANCEMENT.

                          VERGER 
                Aren't they beautiful, Miss Starling... 

     STARLING LOOKS UP AT THE CHILDREN PLAYING.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     ONE OF THE CHILDREN FALLS OFF A SMALL PLASTIC SLIDE, AND 
     CRIES, A NURSE RUNS TO HIM.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                Well, now, you see, one of them's hurt.
                And what will make it better?  Love.
                Isn't that odd.
                    (PAUSE) 
                He think's he's hurt his knee--but the 
                assurance, the assurance, the assurance
                that someone cares  (WHEEZE WHEEZE)
                Suggests the hurt was elsewhere. 

                          STARLING 
                Mr. Verger, thank you for your time. 

                          VERGER 
                For the worst hurt, of course, that 
                which will not heal, is the conviction
                no one cares.

                          STARLING 
                I've come to see you, sir, about an
                Auction... 

     SHE HOLDS UP THE CATALOGUE TO HIM.

     ANGLE INS 

     "DRAWINGS AND MEMORABILIA RELATING TO THE SERIAL KILLER, 
     HANNIBAL LECHTER."

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, AS HE COMES CLOSE, DONNING SURGICAL GLOVES, AND 
     TAKES THE CATALOGUE, AND HOLDS IT TOWARD VERGER. 

                          VERGER
                Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter...
                And have they sent you, once again to
                capture him?  How terrible for you... 

                          STARLING 
                No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why
                do you say how terrible? 

                          VERGER 
                Because we must leave the past in the
                past.  (WHEEZE WHEEZE) 
                    (CORDELL TURNS A PAGE) 
                Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes,
                my own encounter with him...

     CORDELL TURNS THE PAGE QUICKLY. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                No, no.  That's alright.  Yes.  Lechter's
                drawings of me.  Before... and, of 
                course, after... Now:  you are not sent
                to pursue him.  Then your visit baffles
                me. 

                          STARLING 
                Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. 
                Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the
                prison after his escape, have surfaced 
                and are being sold at auction.  Several
                large reserve bids have been placed on
                them.  I have to ask if you've placed
                those bids. 

                          VERGER
                Because? 

                          STARLING 
                Because if it was not you, then, perhaps
                it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim
                his own property. 

                          VERGER 
                And why would you suspect me, of this
                ghoulishness? 

                          STARLING
                Because, sir, you are the only one of his
                victims who lived.  And because you have 
                large resources. 

                          VERGER 
                Large resources, Starling, which I prefer 
                to devote elsewhere....

     STARLING LOOKS UP, AS WE SEE THE IMAGE ON THE TELEVISION 
     CHANGE TO THE CHILDREN EATING THE COOKIES, AND THE IMAGE
     CHANGES AGAIN TO SHOW A SMALL DISPENSARY, AND THE KNEE OF THE
     CHILD WHO FELL BEING BANDAIDED BY A NURSE.
 
                          STARLING
                Due respect, sir... 

     SHE PRODUCES A COPY OF THE WANTED:  HANNIBAL LECHTER POSTER
     WE SAW AT THE FBI. 

                          STARLING (cont'd)
                Due respect, after your, after your... 

                          VERGER
                My encounter. 

                          STARLING 
                Someone offered three million dollars
                bounty on Dr. Lechter's head.
                    (PAUSE) 

                          CORDELL 
                The identity of the person offering the
                bounty was never established. 

                          VERGER 
                Yes, but we know who it was, and I will
                tell you, Agent Starling, what you know
                to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It
                was illegal, and, worse, it was wrong. 
                And I thank God every day that I did not
                compound my sinful life by the stain of
                a murder.  Do you (WHEEZE) Agent
                Starling:  do you know God?
                    (PAUSE) 

                          STARLING
               ...sir...?

                          VERGER 
                Isn't it funny?  You can look on my
                face (WHEEZE WHEEZE) which you would 
                grant me, is the most hideous sight you
                will see in what I hope is a long life. 
                You can look at me.  Which shows (WHEEZE)
                a Strength which must come from strong
                (WHEEZE) strong convictions.  (WHEEZE)
                But you shy when I say the name of
                God. 

     THE NURSE COMES UP, HOLDING THE TAPE OF A LIFESIGNS 
     MACHINE, SHE NODS TO CORDELL AND INDICATES THE MONITORS.

                          NURSE 
                    (TO STARLING)
                ...I'm sorry.. 
                    (MEANING, YOU MUST GO.) 

                          STARLING 
                Yes, then, you're saying that you
                haven't bid upon these drawings.

                          VERGER
                I have not, I would not.  For life
                (WHEEZE) life goes on Starling.  And,
                wait, wait, I wish to talk to you... 
                I'm... (WHEEZE)  (TO THE NURSE, WHO IS 
                TAKING STARLING'S ARM) One moment.  I was
                afflicted, do you see, but my affliction
                was not in my meeting with your Dr.
                Lechter.  I was afflicted before. 
                Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance.
                Do not (WHEEZE) Do not curse God when
                you are humiliated.  Listen to me:
                embrace it, and you embrace life....
                Listen, and you hear the word of
                God... 

     STARLING IS LED AWAY BY THE CONCERNED NURSE.  CORDELL LINGERS
     BEHIND, AT AN UNSEEN BEHEST OF VERGER. 

     THE NURSE STARTS PREPARING A HYPO AT HER STATION.

                          STARLING 
                ...will he be alright...? 

     THE NURSE, DISTRACTED, NODS, AND RETREATS TOWARD VERGER
     WITH THE HYPO.

     CORDELL COMES OUT TO STARLING.

     INT CORRIDOR, COUNTRY HOUSE, DAY.  STARLING AND CORDELL ARE 
     WALKING, BEYOND THEM, WE SEE VARIOUS CHILDREN PLAYING UNDER
     ADULT SUPERVISION.  A CARETAKER TYPE IS HOLDING A SMALL
     GOAT, WHICH THE CHILDREN ARE PLAYING WITH. 

     CORDELL OPENS THE GLASS DOOR, AND HE WALKS STARLING THROUGH
     THE SCENE OF THE CHILDREN AND THE GOAT. 

                          CORDELL 
                Mr. Verger wanted me to give you 
                this... 
                    (HE HANDS HER A SMALL PRINTED CARD) 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE GLANCES AT THE CARD.

     ANGLE INS THE CARD READS:

     "DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY..." 

     SHE GLANCES AT IT, AND, DISMISSIVELY, PUTS IT IN A POCKET.

                          CORDELL (cont'd) 
                And he has asked me to ask you something. 

                          STARLING 
                What would that be? 

                          CORDELL 
                    (PAUSE)
                He... would consider it a favor if he 
                could make a donation.  To a charitable
                institution of your choice.
                    (PAUSE) 

                          STARLING 
                Now, why in the world would he do that? 

                          CORDELL 
                I... think... he was.... he was 
                touched, by your reaction.  To his
                appearance. 

                          STARLING
                What reaction? 

                          CORDELL
                Exactly. 

                          STARLING 
                    (AS SHE HANDS HIM A CARD) 
                Please, I do not... I don't want to 
                trouble him.  But if you or he have any 
                notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...

                          CORDELL 
                Do you know the seller? 

                          STARLING 
                We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.

                          CORDELL 
                He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's
                stay in Prison. 

                          STARLING
                And how would you know that? 

                          CORDELL 
                Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was...
                he made quite a study. 
                    (PAUSE.  STARLING MAKES A NOTE.
                     SHE LOOKS AROUND.)

                You should get the kids a dog... 

                          CORDELL 
                ....I hardly think so... after "The
                Incident"... 

                          STARLING
                No, no, of course not. 

     SHE STARTS TO GET INTO HER CAR. 

                          CORDELL 
                ...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a
                contribution, to the charitable... 

                          STARLING 
                Tell him to give it to an orphanage.

     STARLING CLOSES THE CAR DOOR.

     HOLD.  ON STARLING, WATCHING THE CHILDREN FOR A MOMENT. 
     THEN SHE TAKES THE CARD FROM HER POCKET AND GLANCES AT IT.

     IT READS : 

     "DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY, DO NOT TRUST TO PROSPERITY.
     BE AWARE OF FORTUNE'S HABIT--SHE WILL DO JUST AS SHE
     PLEASES.  NONE OF THIS IS IN YOUR CONTROL.  BE HAPPY.  BE
     KIND.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE STARTS TO PUT THE CAR IN GEAR, PUTTING
     DOWN THE NOTE.  THEN SHE HESITATES, AND BEGINS TO CRY.

     PARKED IN THE DRIVEWAY, AND THE CHILDREN ROMPING WITH THE
     GOAT. 

     INT PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE DAY. 

     STARLING IS TALKING TO A KINDLY OLDER WOMAN PSYCHIATRIST.

                Yes, so you said.  But what does that
                mean:  to go beyond The Institution.

                Starling:  They got a x-ray.  They think,
                they might have a lead on Lechter.

     DOWN A FLIGHTBAG FROM THE OVERHEAD, AND JOINS THE LINE OF
     EXITING PASSENGERS.

     IN THE JETWAY, AN ARMED SOLDIER, HIS SMG SLUNG IN FRONT OF
     HIM, IS READING AN ITALIAN NEWSPAPER. 

     AS THE JETWAY PULLS UP TO SNUGGLE WITH THE JET, THE SOLDIER
     DROPS THE PAPER ONTO THE STOOL BEFORE HIM, AND COMES TO
     ATTENTION.

     IN THE PLANE, THE STEWARDESS OPENS THE DOOR, THE PASSENGERS
     EXIT, SHE AND PAZZI EXCHANGE A BRIEF, WHISPERED FLIRTATION AS
     HE PASSES.  AS HE MOVES PAST HER, SHE GIVES A SMALL WHOOP IN
     RESPONSE TO SOME CLANDESTINE CARESS OF HIS.

     PLAINCLOTHES COP TYPES, WAITING, AS PAZZI COMES THROUGH
     THEY NOD TO HIM, AND THE GROUP STARTS TO EXIT OUT OF THE

                Institution, which he now graces us with
                his bid to Direct, a note from Guido de

     SILK SQUARE FROM HIS BREAST POCKET, AND CLEANS HIS HALF-
     GLASSES, THEN FOLDS THEM AND PUTS THEM AND THE SQUARE BACK
     IN HIS POCKET.

                Fell...? 

     BEAT.  DR. FELL TURNS TO CAMERA, STILL HOLDING THE NOTE. 

     HE TAKES SEVERAL PACES, TO LOOK AT THE NOTE IN A SHAFT OF
     SUNLIGHT.
 
     HE IS STANDING BESIDE THE STATUE OF JUDITH AND HOLOFERNES. 
     HE NODS AT THE NOTE, AS IF CONFIRMING SOMETHING.  THEN HE 
     LOOKS UP. 

                          DR. FELL 
                Cavalcanti replied publicly to Dante's 
                first sonnet.  Do you know it, Professor
                Sogliato?  I believe it's worth your 
                time:  Listen to the way he makes an
                instrument of the Italian vernacular, 
                which he called the vulgari eloquentia--
                the eloquent voice of the people: 
                Allegro me sembrava amor tenedo/Meo core
                in mano, e ne la braccia avea/Madonna
                involta in un drappa dormedo/Poi la 
                svegliava a d'esto ardeno/Lei paventosa 
                umilmente pascea/Appreso gir lo ne vedea 
                paingendo.  If Dante had written to a 
                Cavalcanti, it would, of course, have 
                been to Andrea, the most literary of his 
                brothers....

                          SOGLIATO
                ...why do you want this job?

                          DR. FELL 
                In the hope, that someday, I should come
                across such a note.  I thank you 
                gentleman for your kind attention, and
                hope you will consider...

                ..who would benefit from his

                    (TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBER)
                ...would you excuse me...? 

     ANGLE EXT THE SALON, ON THE LANDING, FELL IS BEING ADDRESSED 
     BY RICCI. 

                          RICCI 
                ...will have to face the Studiolo, in
                their meeting next week.  And I, for
                one, wish you the best. 

     FELL SHAKES HIS HAND, AND STARTS DOWN THE STAIRCASE.

     CAMERA GOES WITH HIM, WE HEAR PAZZI VO.

                Dottore... 

     FELL TURNS, AND PAZZI COMES TO CATCH UP WITH HIM.

                          PAZZI (cont'd) 
                Pazzi, Rinaldo, Commendatore,
                Prefatura... 

                          FELL 
                Of course, Commendatore... 

     CAMERA TAKES THEM DOWN THE STAIRS, AS THEY TALK.

                          PAZZI 
                Could you tell me:  did you ever meet
                your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...? 

                          FELL 
                I never met him.  I knew him only from
                his writings. 

                          PAZZI 
                I know that the officers who first 
                investigated his disappearance searched
                for a note, a farewell note, a suicide 
                note... 

                          FELL
                ...yes. 

                          PAZZI 
                You have taken over his offices, is that
                not so? 

                          FELL 
                It is only temporary, until my
                confirmation by... 

                          PAZZI 
                Of course, in his offices, if you come 
                across anything, any personal papers of
                his, anything, however trivial, would
                you contact me, please... Are his 
                personal effects still at the Palazzo? 

                          FELL 
                Yes.  Packed and with an inventory.

                          PAZZI 
                I'll have them picked up.

     PAZZI GESTURES TO HIS COLLEAGUE.

                May we drop you? 

                          FELL 
                Thank you, I am most happy to walk in
                this most magnificent of cities. 

     FELL STARTS PULLING ON HIS GLOVES, HE HANDS HIS SKETCHBOOK 
     TO PAZZI FOR A MOMENT.  PAZZI LOOKS DOWN.

     ANGLE PAZZI'S POV 

     FELL'S LEFT HAND, HAS A SCAR ON THE BACK IN THE SHAPE OF A 
     3. 

                               PAZZI 
                May I ask you a personal question, Dr.
                Fell? 

                               FELL 
                If your duty requires it. 

                               PAZZI 
                You have a recent scar on the back of

                               PAZZI 
                You looked oddly at me, back on the
                landing. 

                               FELL 
                Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman.
                Is it hard?  Must one, then, be
                constantly suspicious? 

                               PAZZI 
                Why did you look at me that way?

                I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but
                clean.  Just dressed--in the middle of 
                the... 

     FELL SHAKES HIS HEAD, ASKING TO HAVE THE QUESTION
     WITHDRAWN.

                               PAZZI

                               FELL 
                    (SHRUGS, SMILES) 
                I saw a man, somewhat fatigued.
                Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In
                the middle of the day.
                    (SMILES)
                An old story.  And then I saw the 
                clothing was fresh--therefore:  a man who 
                dressed at home.  And then I remarked
                the new wedding ring.  And so:  the 
                story gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A 
                new, and a beloved wife.  I wish you joy. 
                    (FELL STARTS TO EXIT) 

     PAZZI WALKS WITH HIM. 

                          PAZZI 
                You assemble this, on the instant, from
                these few observations? 

                          FELL
                    (SHRUGS) 
                I'm a historian.  It is our task to 
                assemble the seemingly unconnected into 
                the obvious. 

                          PAZZI
                ...your scar..? 

                          FELL 
                My scar is a war-wound. 

                          PAZZI
                How so? 

                          FELL 
                Carpal-tunnel syndrome.  From a life of 
                typing.  Commendatore.  History,
                a hazardous profession. 

     FELL AND THEN PAZZI STOP.

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                You are a Pazzi of the Pazzim are you
                not? 

                          PAZZI 
                Yes.  How did you know? 

                          FELL 
                You resemble a figure from the Della 
                Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at
                Santa Croce. 

                          PAZZI
                It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John
                the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel? 

                          FELL 
                I have had the honor.

                     PAZZI GOES AFTER HIM.) 

     FELL TURNS TO HIM. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                I wondered that an officer of your 
                exalted rank should come, so late,
                into the case. 

                          PAZZI
                And?  Then? 

                          FELL 
                I wonder no longer.  You were out of the
                country. 

                          PAZZI 
                How could you know? 

                          FELL
                I sense... 
                    (HE TOUCHES HIS NOSE) 
                The faintest whiff of a perfume, whose
                base, whose base, whose base is 
                "Hamamelis" ... it is witch-hazel--such 
                a clean scent.  No, not a European scent.
                I would say it is a scent of the New
                World.  I would say, you have been in
                America.  Have I struck home? 

                          PAZZI 
                You know America? 

                          FELL 
                ...you have brought this perfume... 
                brought this perfume.  Back.  Back from
                America.  To your New Wife... 
                    (HE PICKS UP HIS HAND, AND 
                     GLANCES DOWN AT PAZZI'S
                     WEDDING RING.) 
                You have given it to her, and some of...
                    (HE SMILES) 
                Some of 'her perfume' has found its way
                back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man,
                indeed. 

     HE BOWS, AND STARTS TO TAKE HIS LEAVE, FROM THE STARTLED
     PAZZI.  PAZZI COMES TO HIS SENSES, AND HANDS A CARD TO FELL. 

                          PAZZI 
                Should you come across anything which... 

                          FELL 
                You will be the first I call. 

     FELL TURNS TO LEAVE, TURNS BACK, AND TAKES HIS HAND AND,
     GENTLY RUBS IT ON THE LAPEL OF PAZZI'S SUITJACKET, HE THEN,
     DELICATELY, HOLDS THE HAND UNDER HIS NOSE, AND NODS, AS IF
     IN AGREEMENT WITH HIMSELF. 

     HE NODS, AND WALKS OFF INTO A PARK. 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI, WHO LOOKS AFTER FELL.  HE WALKS BACK TOWARD
     THE CAR.  HE TURNS, TO LOOK AFTER FELL, AND WE SEE HE IS
     STANDING BY A LINE OF PEOPLE, A QUEUE, UNDER A BANNER WHICH
     PROCLAIMS, "ATROCIOUS INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE." 

     PAZZI SHAKES HIS HEAD, AS IF TO CLEAR IT, AND STARTS TOWARD
     HIS CAR, WHERE COP ONE OPENS THE OOOR FOR HIM. 

     ANGLE 

     ON FELL, AS CAMERA TAKES HIM INTO THE PARK, WHICH, WE SEE,
     IS A CEMETERY. 

     HE SITS ON A BENCH, AND TAKES OUT HIS SKETCHBOOK, AND BEGINS
     TO DRAW. 

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     A PIECE OF FUNERAY STATUARY, THE LION, HOLDING THE BIRD IN
     HIS MOUTH. 

     ANGLE ON DR. FELL, SKETCHING.  TIGHT. 

     HE SKETCHES, HE RAISES HIS HAND TO HIS NOSE AND INHALES, AND
     NODS AGAIN. 

     ANGLE, FROM THE SIDE, WE NOW SEE THE STATUE AND FELL'S
     DRAWING.  HE IS DRAWING, NOT THE STATUE, BUT A SKETCH OF
     CLARICE STARLING. 

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

     AN ARMY FATIGUE JACKET OVER ORDERLY'S WHITES.  (BARNEY) 

     ANGLE 

     STARLING, STANDING AT A BUSSTOP, READING A PAPER.

     ANGLE INS. 

     IN THE PAPER IS SECRETED A PHOTO OF BARNEY, ON FBI XEROX 
     FORM, WITH HIS NAME, AND DESCRIPTION.

     ANGLE 

     STARLING WAITS AT THE BUSSTOP.  BARNEY PASSES IN FRONT OF 
     HER, AND CONTINUES WALKING.  STARLING FOLDS THE PAPER AND
     GOES AFTER HIM. 

     ANGLE 

     RUNDOWN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD, DAY. 

     BARNEY, NOW HOLDING A SMALL BAG OF GROCERIES, CROSSES THE 
     STREET. 

     WE SEE STARLING IN THE BG. 

     BARNEY STOPS, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.  WE SEE HE IS 
     LOOKING UP OVERHEAD.

     ANGLE INS HIS POV. 

     A DOVE, CIRCLING IN THE SKY.

     ANGLE XCU.

     BARNEY LOOKING UP, PUZZLED, AND THEN HE LOOKS DOWN.

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     IN THE ROAD AHEAD, A DEAD DOVE. 

     BARNEY WALKS INTO THE POV, PICKS UP THE DOVE, AND WALKS TO A
     SMALL RATTY VERGE OF PARK.  HE PUTS THE DOVE DOWN, LOVINGLY
     IN THE GRASS, AND WE WATCH, AS THE OTHER DOVE LANDS ON A
     FENCE, NEARBY. 

     BARNEY STARTS TO WALK TOWARD THE LIVE BIRD.

     ANGLE 

     OVER THE BIRD, ONTO BARNEY, WITH STARLING WALKING UP BEHIND 
     HIM. 

     BARNEY HESITATES, HIS BACK STILL TO STARLING.

                          BARNEY 
                Are you attracted by Death?
                    (PAUSE) 
                It is the one great mystery, is it not? 
                Anyone who would say otherwise must be a
                hypocrite.  Don't you think...? 

     HE TURNS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND LOOKS AT HER. 

                          BARNEY (cont'd) 
                ...or are you only attracted by power...
                    (HE CHANGES HIS TACK AND TONE.) 
                How are you, Agent Starling? 

                          STARLING 
                Ah, Barney:  you've got a good mernory. 

                          BARNEY 
                You know why that is?  Because there
                are so few things I need to forget. 
                Would you agree, for the record, that I
                have not been read my rights? 

                          STARLING 
                I have not read you your rights. 

                          BARNEY 
                Would you mind saying that into your
                bag...? 

     STARLING STARTS TO OPEN HER BAG, AND SPEAKS INTO IT.

                          STARLING
                I hereby acknowledge that... 

                          BARNEY 
                And now I have "dociled" you, have I
                not?  By forcing your obedience. 

                          STARLING 
                    (SMILING) 
                Then why did you chose to inform me of
                it...? 

                          BARNEY
                To show... 
                    (PAUSE) 
                in my ability to squander.  What one
                might deem an advantage... that my
                strength is greater than yours... 

                          STARLING 
                Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...? 

                          BARNEY 
                If you'll come down the street I will
                make you a cup of coffee. 

     INT BARNEY'S APARTMENT DAY. 

     AS THEY ENTER, THE APARTMENT WITH MANY DEADBOLTS.  STARLING 
     ENTERS WARILY AND TAKES A SEAT WITH HER BACK TO THE WALL, IN
     THE SMALL STUDIO. 

     AS BARNEY BEGINS MAKING COFFEE.

                          BARNEY 
                You almost took down Evelda Drumgo.

                          STARLING 
                Well.  Word gets around. 

                          BARNEY 
                ...what hindered you...? 

                          STARLING
                It wasn't my day. 

                          BARNEY 
                Perhaps you did not have the support
                you required.

                          STARLING 
                It's a poor workman who blames his tools. 

                          BARNEY
                Or, perhaps... 

                          STARLING 
                ...how are things at the Hospital? 

                          BARNEY 
                It's a growth business. 

                          STARLING
                What have they got you doing?

                Orderly. 

                          STARLING 
                I would have figured you an R.N. by now,
                or, maybe Med School. 

                          BARNEY 
                I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous
                professions.

                    (TAKES OUT A NOTEBOOK) 
                You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in 
                Dr. Lechter's prison ward. 

                          BARNEY 
                Yes, I presumed it was about him. 

                          STARLING 
                ...you... 

                          BARNEY 
                I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did 
                not last with him.  I was privileged to
                enjoy his company during that time.

                He said, and these were his words, he 
                valued our time together, because I was
                civil. 

                          STARLING 
                Did you ever think, did you think, after
                he escaped, he would come after you? 

                          BARNEY 
                He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude.
                Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think
                he'd come after you...?

                at auction.  Materials which disappeared
                from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he 
                made, his books.

                          BARNEY 
                Yes? 

                          STARLING 
                And I'd like your help, determining
                who's bidding for their purchase.

                Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed
                Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like
                an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? 
                Ten, twelve grand? 

                          BARNEY

                want the rest of the stuff you stole from

                          BARNEY

                Now, whyn't you help us? 

                          BARNEY 
                That would adversely impact my income. 

                          STARLING 
                Not as much as being jailed for theft of
                Government Property, or for failure to
                pay income tax, on undisclosed income. 

                          BARNEY

     "DO NOT GIVE IN TO ADVERSITY.  DO NOT TRUST TO PROPERTY.
     NONE OF THIS IS IN YOUR CONTROL.  BE HAPPY.  BE KIND." 

     INT VERGER'S MANSION--PLAYROOM--DAY. 

     HAPPY SMALL CHILDREN PLAYING.  ONE SMALL BOY, SMILING, IS
     APPROACHED BY A LOVELY YOUNG NURSE, DRESSED IN WHITE.  SHE
     WHISPERS TO HIM AND HE SMILES AND NODS, AND TAKES HER
     HAND, AS THEY WALK OFF. 

     ANGLE INT VERGER'S MEDICAL FACILITY. 

     WE SEE THE YOUNG CHILD, FRANKLIN, BEING LED OFF ON A TV
     SCREEN.  WE SEE HIS PROGRESS ONTO ANOTHER SCREEN SHOWING THE
     HALL, AND THE OLD WOMAN, ROSIE, KNITTING. 

     ANGLE 

     CORDELL, STANDING BY VERGER'S BED.  CORDELL HOLDS A FOLDER
     MARKED "DEPARTMENT OF CHILD WELFARE.  CITY OF BALTIMORE." 

     HE IS FINISHED READING IT.

                          CORDELL 
                "...and age-appropriate large and small
                motor skills.  His unfortunate home 
                situation has made it necessary for 
                Franklin to form immediate attachments 
                with adults, which we understand to have
                contributed to many instances of his 
                abuse." 

     SOUND OF A "WHOOSH," AS A DOOR OPENS, CORDELL CLOSES THE
     FOLDER.  HE LOOKS TOWARD THE DOOR. 

     ANGLE 

     IN THE BED, VERGER, HIS FACE OBSCURED BY A TELEVISION
     MONITOR.  WE HEAR THE WHIR OF A TV CAMERA. 

     WE SEE THE CAMERA, ABOVE VERGER'S BED, MOVING.

     ANGLE 

     ON A TV SCREEN, WE SEE THE CAMERA TRACK, AND TAKE THE
     FRIGHTENED FRANKLIN, AND THE NURSE STANDING NEXT TO HIM,
     THE NURSE MOTIONS FRANKLIN FORWARD. 

     ANGLE, ON CORDELL, LOOKING DOWN AT VERGER.  (NB THROUGHOUT,
     VERGER SHOULD NEVER BE SEEN.  HE IS INFERRED THROUGH THE
     REACTIONS OF THOSE AROUND HIM.  AND HE, AND IN PARTICULAR, 
     HIS FACE SHOULD ALWAYS BE OBSCURED--A TEASE--BY THIS OR THAT
     INTERVENING OBJECT.) 

     CORDELL NODS, AS IF IN RESPONSE TO A SIGN FROM VERGER.  HE
     LAYS THE HOSPITAL FOLDER ON A SORT OF XEROX MACHINE. 

     ANGLE ON VERGER'S ELECTRONIC DISPLAY.  THE VARIOUS TV
     SCREENS, THE HOSPITAL FOLDER, NOW COMING INTO VIEW ON A
     SCREEN ON WHICH WE READ THE LOGO OF THE BALTIMORE CHILD
     WELFARE, AND "JAMES, FRANKLIN, BORN JUNE 5, 1991," AND A 
     PHOTO OF HIM.  ON THE ADJACENT SCREEN WE SEE THE YOUNG BOY
     COMING FORWARD AT THE URGING OF HIS NURSE.  HIS EYES
     GROWING WIDE WITH FEAR.

     ANGLE 

     FROM BEHIND FRANKLIN, AS HIS BODY OBSCURES OUR VIEW OF 
     VERGER, AND WE HEAR THE ELECTRONICALLY ENHANCED VOICE OF
     VERGER CONVERSING WITH HIM. 

                          VERGER
                Are you Franklin ? 

                          FRANKLIN
                ...Franklin. 

                          VERGER 
                Where do you live? 

                          FRANKLIN 
                With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean. 

     ANGLE SHIFT TO OVER VERGER, ONTO THE FRIGHTENED BOY.  IN THE
     BG WE SEE THE NURSE BEATING A STRATEGIC RETREAT TO THE DOOR,
     AND AFTER HER EXIT, WE SEE HER APPEAR ON THE SCREEN WHICH
     SHOWS THE CORRIDOR, TAKING A CHAIR ACROSS FROM "ROSIE," WE
     SEE HER SIT AND TAKE OUT A BOOK AND READ.  AS VERGER TALKS
     WITH FRANKLIN, WE SEE THE INFORMATION ON THE "TEXT" SCREEN
     SCROLL, WHICH NEW INFO WE SEE REFLECTED IN VERGER'S
     QUESTIONS. 

                          FRANKLIN (cont'd) 
                But Stringbean, he in and out.

                          VERGER 
                In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama,
                is not your real Mama, is she Franklin? 

                          FRANKLIN
                She my foster. 

                          VERGER 
                She's not the first foster that you've
                had.  Is she? 

                          FRANKLIN
                No. 
                    (THE CHILD LOOKS AROUND, AND,
                     FINDING NO SUPPORT, LOOKS
                     BACK AT VERGER.) 

                          VERGER 
                Do you like it at your home, Franklin? 

                          FRANKLIN
                    (FRIGHTENING) 
                We got KittyKat... 

                          VERGER
                Yes.... yes... 

                          FRANKLIN 
                ...and Shirly, let me sleep with her
                sometime. 

                          VERGER 
                Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there
                anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and
                Kittykat.  You have to go away. 

                          FRANKLIN
                ...who say...? 

                          VERGER 
                The government says.  Mama has lost her
                job, so she can't be your foster 
                mother.  The police found a marijuana 
                cigarette in your home.  You can't see
                Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty 
                Cat.  That's what the Government says... 

     ANGLE XCU ON FRANKLIN. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                ...or perhaps they just don't want you
                anymore.  Could that be?  And, do you 
                know what will happen to Kitty Cat?  When
                you go away.  The police will take her,
                and they'll give her a shot.  With a 
                shiny needle.  They'll give Kitty Cat a
                shot.  And it will hurt her.  And then
                she will die. 

     FRANKLIN TAKES THE TAIL OF HIS SHIRT FROM HIS PANTS AND
     HOLDS IT TO HIS EYES. 

     ANGLE 

     ON VERGER'S BED, AND ON CORDELL BEHIND HIM, GLANCING THROUGH
     A FILE. 

     CORDELL LOOKS UP AT THE WAILING OF FRANKLIN. 

                          VERGER (cont'd)
                Come here...
                    (BEAT.
                     FRANKLIN COMES FORWARD, HIS 
                     FACE SCREWING UP IN TERROR AS 
                     THE DETAIL OF VERGER BECOME
                     MORE APPARENT.  HE STOPS
                     MOVING FORWARD.) 
                Do you know how you keep kittycat from
                getting a shot?  Franklin?  No?  Do you
                know.  Then come here... 

     FRANKLIN COMES FORWARD.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                You can keep Kitty Cat from
                getting a shot if... 

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, WHO REACTS TO SOME SIGN FROM VERGER, AND NODS,
     AND TAKES A SMALL PACKAGE FROM A POCKET IN HIS COAT.

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, WHO GIVES THE PACKAGE TO FRANKLIN.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                If you give him this... 

     ANGLE ON FRANKLIN, AS HE LOOKS DOWN AT THE PACKAGE IN HIS
     HANDS. 

     ANGLE INS: 

     IT IS A PACKAGE OF RAT POISON.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN, HOLDING THE POISON, HE LOOKS UP AS VERGER 
     TALKS. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                You can keep her from getting the shot,
                if you give her that rat poison
                yourself... 

     ANGLE, HOLD ON FRANKLIN, WHO BEGINS TO WEEP COPIOUSLY. 

     ANGLE, ON THE VIDEO SCREEN SHOWING FRANKLIN, AS WE HEAR A
     SERVO MOTOR, AND THE SCREEN ZOOMS IN TO SHOW A TEAR. 

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, WHO IS NOW AT A SMALL WETBAR, MIXING VODKA AND
     VERMOUTH AND POURING THEM INTO A MARTINI SHAKER. 

     HE GLANCES OVER, AND NODS. 

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, AS HE PUSHES A BUTTON ON A CONSOLE.  ON THE
     SCREEN OVER VERGER'S BED WE SEE THE NURSE IN THE HALL
     REACT.  SHE PUTS HER PAPERBACK BOOK INTO HER POCKET, AND
     RISES, AND WE SEE HER ENTER VERGER'S ROOM, AND STAND BY
     THE DOOR. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                Goodbye, Franklin. 

     CORDELL WALKS FRANKLIN TO THE DOOR.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                ...remember what we talked about.

     WE HEAR VERGER'S ELECTRONICALLY AMPLIFIED BREATHING BECOME
     EXCITED, AND ON THE LIFESIGNS SCREENS, WE SEE HIS VITAL
     SIGNS BECOME MORE AGITATED, AND THE NURSE, AND CORDELL
     START TOWARD THE BED. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                    (AS HIS BREATHING QUIETS)
                No, I'm fine... 

     WE SEE CORDELL START BACK INTO THE ROOM, AND THEN, AT THE
     SOUND OF VERGER'S VOICE TURN AWAY AGAIN. 

     ANGLE, AT THE DOOR, CORDELL SIGNS TO THE NURSE, AND
     STOOPS TO THE CRYING FRANKLIN. 

     CORDELL TAKES A STERILE PLASTIC BAG FROM HIS POCKET, HE
     REMOVES FROM IT A CLAMP, IN THE JAWS OF WHICH ARE A SMALL
     SQUARE OF COTTON GAUZE.  HE STOOPS TO FRANKLIN, AND
     CAREFULLY TAKES ONE OF FRANKLIN'S TEARS ONTO THE GAUZE.  HE
     NODS TO THE NURSE, WHO EXITS WITH FRANKLIN. 

     HE DISAPPEARS FROM THE SHOT.

     ANGLE ON VERGER.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                ..what have we heard from our friend at
                the FBI...? 

     ANGLE ON CORDELL, AS HE TAKES AN ENVELOPE, AND EXTRACTS A
     XEROX OF AN X-RAY AND PUTS IT ON THE SCREEN, WE SEE IT IS
     THE "BRAZILIAN" X-RAY OF LECHTER'S HAND.  WE SEE AN IMPRINT
     AT THE TOP OF THE X-RAY--THE PATIENTS NAME AND THE LAB
     NAME RIPPED AWAY--ALL THAT REMAINS ARE THE WORDS "...DO
     BRAZIL." 

                          CORDELL 
                Most current information shows the 
                result of an operation for the removal 
                of a sixth digit, the left hand of a man. 

                          VERGER 
                Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter? 

                          CORDELL 
                Not with any certainty we... 

     VERGER'S BREATHING AGAIN BECOMES EXCITABLE.

                          VERGER 
                Why did he come back?

                           CORDELL 
                Our operatives in Brazil have been
                empowered to offer a reward of....

                          VERGER 
                ...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY
                TURN BACK...? 

                          CORDELL
                ...are you alright, sir...? 

                          VERGER 
                HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have
                we Seen it Before. 

                          CORDELL
                Seen what, sir..? 

                          VERGER 
                The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the
                ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why?
                Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT 
                THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS.
                IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. 
                THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As
                Lechter will return back.  You see?  To
                the sight of his oppressor wounded.
                He will return to savage our beloved Miss
                Starling.  Bring me a drink. 

     CORDELL TURNS, BACK TO THE CONSOLE.

     WE SEE CORDELL TURN, AND APPROACH THE BED, HOLDING THE
     MARTINI ON A TRAY. 

     HE PUTS THE TRAY DOWN ON THE BEDTABLE.

     ANGLE INS. 

     WE SEE, ON THE SMALL METAL HOSPITAL TRAY, THE MARTINI SHAKER, 
     THE MARTINI GLASS, AND A SMALL BEAKER, IN WHICH IS THE CLAMP
     WHICH BEARS THE GAUZE PAD WHICH BEARS FRANKLIN'S TEARS.

     CORDELL SHAKES THE SHAKER, POURS IT INTO THE GLASS, AND
     DROPS THE GAUZE PAD INTO IT, AND HANDS IT TO VERGER. 

                          CORDELL
                Your drink, sir. 

                          VERGER 
                It's time to step up the pressure on
                our Sweet Miss Starling.  ...call our 
                friend at the F.B.I.  And, instead of 
                finding Lechter, let's help Him find us. 

     ANGLE 

     ON ONE OF THE VIDEO SCREENS, WE SEE A SHEET LABELLED
     "CONFIDENTIAL FBI NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION."  AND WE SEE, IN 
     VARIOUS SQUARES BELOW, THE DRAWINGS BY LECHTER, THE VARIOUS
     FUNERAY SKETCHES. 

     CAMERA COMES IN ON ONE OF THE MIDDLE, LEFT, WHICH SHOWS THE
     LION WITH A BIRD IN ITS MOUTH.

                ...the purpose of the exercise... is it
                because they are expensive... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                They aren't expensive, you got them
                through your connections.... speaking of
                which: 

                          PAZZI 
                Fine, thank you, but 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                Speaking of which, I want you also to
                get us tickets for the Opera... 

                          PAZZI 
                ...whatever is within my power... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...and that is what you need to expand. 

                          PAZZI 
                I don't understand. 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                    (SHE STOPS AND ADDRESSES HIM) 
                We are here on sufferance.  I am here... 

                          PAZZI 
                ...why are we here in the first place...? 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                Because it is exclusive... because
                everyone will be here... 

     CAMERA TAKES THEM PAST A SIGN ANNOUNCING "EXHIBITION
     INSTRUMENTS OF ATROCIOUS TORTURE," AND A VELVET ROPE, AND
     VARIOUS WELL DRESSED PEOPLE WAITING TO GET IN. 

     PAZZI WALKS TO THE HEAD OF THE LINE, AND SHOWS HIS TICKETS,
     AND IS ADMITTED. 

     ANGLE INT.  THE EXHIBIT HALL. 

     AN IRON MAIDEN.  A COFFIN SHOWING SPIKES ON ONE SIDE, THE
     OTHER SIDE EMPTY, IS AN IMPROVISED ENTRY TO THE EXHIBIT. 
     PAZZI AND HIS WIFE ENTER, SHE STOPS TO GOSSIP WITH A WELL
     DRESSED COUPLE. 

                          MRS. PAZZI (cont'd) 
                Mrs. Demetrio, how good to see you... 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI, AS HE DRIFTS AWAY.  WE SEE HIM STARING AT
     VARIOUS THUMBSCREWS, A RACK, A GUILLOTINE.  HE STOOPS TO READ
     A PLACARD.  HIS WIFE COMES UP BEHIND HIM. 

                          MRS. PAZZI (cont'd)
                You see, that is my point. 

                          PAZZI
                ...my love... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...they asked us to dinner.  How can we
                accept if we cannot return the... 

                          PAZZI 
                I am on the track of... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand 
                dollars reward, which you would have to
                split with your team, which, if you get
                it, will not buy me a new watch...
                    (SHE STOPS TO GREET ANOTHER COUPLE) 

                          PAZZI 
                ...what do you expect me to... 

     HE STOPS, AND TURNS AWAY, WHEN HE SEES THAT SHE IS 
     ENGROSSED.  HE IS NOW LOOKING AT A TORTURE WHEEL.  HE 
     STOPS AND LOOKS INTENTLY INTO THE GLOOM OF THE ROPED OFF
     EXHIBIT. 

     ANGLE HIS POV 

     INSIDE THE EXHIBIT, IN A DARK CORNER, THE FIGURE OF A MAN.
     SKETCHING. 

     ANGLE XCU ON FELL, LECHTER, IN THE GLOOM, SKETCHING. 

     WE SEE A GOOD SKETCH OF THE WHEEL, ON WHICH HE HAS ADDED
     ARCHITECTURAL NOTES ON ANGLES AND DISTANCES.  HE TURNS,
     FEELING SOMEONE LOOKING AT HIM. 

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     PAZZI, BEYOND THE VELVET ROPE.  PEERING INTENTLY, RETURNING
     FELL'S GLANCE. 

     DOUBLECUTTING:  WE RETURN TO PAZZI, STARING, WE SEE HIM MAKE
     A QUICK ADDENDUM TO THE SKETCH OF THE TORTURE WHEEL.  AND
     THEN RETURN TO PAZZI, LEANING OVER TO PEER MORE CLOSELY
     INTO THE GLOOM. 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                So, the question:  as always, Rinaldo,
                the question is one of mmm... 

     ANGLE 

     ON MRS. PAZZI, AS FELL APPEARS AT THEIR SIDE, SHE TURNS TO
     HIM.

                Commendatore would you do me the honor of

                The exhibit is closing.  The exhibit is
                closing in Ten Minutes... please make
                your way to the... 

                          MRS. PAZZI
                Dr. Fell.  You are not Italian. 

                          FELL 
                Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one
                of the few things in life which study
                and a pleasant attitude can not amend.
                What do you think? 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                And how do we account for the interest
                of such a charming man, an interest in
                Torture? 

                          PAZZI 
                Dr. Fell is studying for his examination
                by the Studiolo. 

                          FELL 
                Indeed I am.  And the connection, 
                between Dante, and, in fact, between 
                your illustrious forebears... if you'd
                come with me, I could show you... 

     HE HOLDS UP THE ROPE, AS TO LEAD THEM BACK INTO THE
     EXHIBIT. 

                          PAZZI
                But the exhibit is closing. 

                          FELL 
                How unfortunate. 

     PAZZI STARTS TO HELP HIS WIFE ON WITH HER WRAP.

                          FELL (cont'd)
                May I...? 

     HE TAKES THE WRAP, AND BEGINS TO DRAPE IT AROUND HER
     SHOULDERS.

     ANGLE EXT THE EXHIBIT.  ON THE STREET, THE CURIOUS ARE
     EXITING. 

     FELL CONCLUDES PUTTING THE WRAP ON MRS. PAZZI.

                What a lovely perfume.  I believe I
                recognize it, do I not...? 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                My husband brought it to me from 
                America. 

                          FELL 
                A wonderful country... 

     AN OLDER MAN CALLS PAZZI AWAY. 

                          MRS. PAZZI
                You know it? 

                          FELL 
                I have had many excellent meals there. 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                And yet, they are not know for their
                cuisine.

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                Well, perhaps sometime we... 

     PAZZI REJOINS THE GROUP.

                          FELL 
                Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame.
                What a pleasure. 

     HE MOVES AWAY. 

                          PAZZI 
                The commissioner is going round the
                Cafe... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 

                ...did he invlte us...?

                          PAZZI 
                No.  Invite us?  No, he simply... 

                          MRS. PAZZI
                Then we cannot go. 

                          PAZZI
                Because...? 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                Because we cannot pay... 

     HE LEADS HER OFF, THE TWO OBVIOUSLY HAVING A FIGHT.

     ANGLE 

     IN THE GLOOM, LECHTER-FELL, LOOKING AT THEM APPRAISINGLY.

     INT PAZZI'S APARTMENT NIGHT.

     GLASS OF WHISKY IN FRONT OF HIM, AT HIS DESK.  HIS DESK FULL
     OF PAPERS.  HIS WIFE IN A HOUSEDRESS.  RANTING. 

                          MRS. PAZZI (cont'd)
                ...constant humiliation.  And why? 

                          PAZZI 
                "Because we don't have any money." 

                          MRS. PAZZI

     MRS. PAZZI TAKES THE FOLDER AND FLINGS IT DOWN. 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                It's a joke.  You're a joke.  You're a
                joke.  You don't know what money is--

     ON PAZZI, REARRANGING THE FILE.  WE SEE, IN AN INSERT, THE
     SCARF, THE "MAN WANTED" POSTER, AND FBI CASE STUDY ON
     HANNIBAL LECHTER, AND WE HOLD ON THE "THREE MILLION DOLLARS
     REWARD." 

     ANGLE ON THE TWO, HIS WIFE STORMING OUT.

     SHE CLOSES THE DOOR OF HIS STUDY.

     INT FELL'S STUDY NIGHT. 

     FELL, IN A SMALL ELEGANT CHAMBER OF A PALAZZO.  PLAYING A 
     CLAVIER.  HE STOPS TO ADJUST A PAGE ON THE MUSIC STAND IN
     FRONT OF HIM.  HE RESUMES PLAYING. 

     ANGLE HIS POV 

     THE MUSIC STAND.  IT HOLDS NOT MUSIC, BUT THE SKETCH WE SAW
     HIM DO EARLIER OF STARLING.  WE SEE HIS HAND ADJUST THE PAGES
     ONCE AGAIN, AND THE SKETCH OF STARLING IS HALF-OBSCURED BY
     THE SKETCH WE SAW FELL MAKE OF THE TORTURE WHEEL.  AT THE
     TOP OF THE SKETCH WE SEE THE ADDED FACES OF PAZZI AND MME
     PAZZI, SKETCHED BY FELL AT THE EXHIBIT. 

     ANGLE 

     FRONTAL ON FELL, AS HE STOPS PLAYING.  HE PICKS UP A GLASS OF
     WINE WHICH HAS BEEN RESTING ON THE CLAVIER, AND TAKES ONE OF
     THE SKETCHES AND GAZES INTENTLY AT IT. 

     HE SHIVERS SLIGHTLY, AND TURNS UP THE COLLAR OF HIS
     JACKET. 

     ANGLE, AS HIS POV.

     SNOW BLOWING ACROSS A SMALL WINDOW, THE WINDOW RATTLING. 

     THE SNOW BLOWS THE SHADE.  INSIDE THE WINDOW WE SEE 
     BEARDED SOLDIERS, COOKING OVER A SMALL FIRE MADE ON THE
     FLOOR OF THE DISHEVELLED HOME. 

     ANGLE 

     ON A SMALL DARK BOY, DRESSED IN RAGS, IN THE BLOWING SNOW,
     LOOKING INTO THE WINDOW. 

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     WE SEE THE SOLDIER COME TOWARD THE WINDOW AND FASTEN IT
     AGAINST THE WIND. 

     ANGLE 

     THE BOY, BACKING ACROSS A SMALL COURTYARD INTO THE OPEN DOOR
     OF A SMALL FACTORY BUILDING. 

     INT DARK FACTORY BUILDING NIGHT. 

     STARLING IS MOVING THROUGH THE BUILDING, AGAINST THE WALL,
     HUGGING THE WALL.  SHE HEARS A SOUND, AND TURNS.  SHE LOOKS 
     DOWN. 

     ANGLE HER POV--A SMALL BADGE WITH A BULLETHOLE IN IT, LYING
     ON THE FLOOR.  SHE LOOKS UP TO THE SOUND OF RUNNING, AND SEES 
     A FIGURE FLITTING ACROSS AN OPENING. 

     ANGLE 

     STARLING RAISES HER PISTOL AND PULLS THE TRIGGER. 

     NOTHING HAPPENS.  SHE LOOKS AT THE PISTOL.  IT IS JAMMED, SHE 
     TRIES TO CLEAR IT QUICKLY, WE SEE A HAND ON HER SHOULDER, SHE
     TURNS. 

     ANGLE HER POV 

     IT IS THE FACE OF LECHTER. 

     STARLING RAISES THE PISTOL AND FIRES.  WE SEE THE PISTOL 
     EXPLODE. 

     WE HEAR SCREAMING. 

     ANGLE INT STARLING'S BEDROOM.  STARLING, SITTING UP IN BED, 
     SCREAMING.  MAPP BURST IN TO THE ROOM.  FOLLOWED BY HER
     BOYFRIEND, JIM, WHO CARRIES A GUN, AND SWEEPS THE ROOM.  MAPP
     SITS BY STARLING. 

     SHE QUIETS STARLING. 

                          MAPP

                coffee, cause I'm going to work.

     LOOKS AT HIS WATCH, AND AT MAPP.  HE SHRUGS.

                Show me the pigs. 

     CORDELL COMES AND STANDS BY THE BED.  HE PICKS UP A 
     TELEPHONE, AND TOUCHES SOME BUTTONS ON THE CONSOLE.  WE SEE
     ONE OF THE VIDEO SCREENS COME TO LIFE, AND WE SEE A BARN,
     AND A COUPLE OF RATTY LOOKING GENTLEMEN WITH COFFEECUPS. 

                          VERGER (cont'd)
                Good morning, Gentlemen. 

     THEY TUG THEIR FORELOCKS.

                     ACCENT) 
                We have them trained the two things:  to
                come on the whistle, and to attack the
                figurine. 

     WE SEE THE OTHER GENTLEMEN BRING FORWARD A SCARECROW.

                          GENTLEMAN (cont'd) 
                ...can you see the pig...? 

     WE SEE THE CAMERA SCAN, AND WE SEE TWO LARGE WILD BOARS IN A 
     PEN. 

     WE SEE THE ONE MAN PUT THE SCARECROW OVER A FENCE.

                          GENTLEMAN (cont'd) 
                We stuff the figure with mean scraps, at

                ...Let's see the pigs, please. 

     THE GENTLEMAN BLOWS HIS WHISTLE.  THE PIGS RUN AT THE
     FIGURINE AND STOP.  WE HEAR THE SOUND OF HUMAN SCREAMS. 

                          GENTLEMAN 
                We tape the screams, to get them used

                          GENTLEMAN 
                They will, sir.  We train them, to the
                figurine, eventually, they consume a
                man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...

                          CORDELL 
                We don't want the man consumed.  No.  We
                want to put the man's feet through the 
                bars, and have the pigs... and have the
                pigs eat his feet.

                Yes.  It's all a question of bait--isn't
                it...? 

     ON THE TV SCREEN WE SEE THE PIGS NOSING THE DUMMY.

                          VERGER (cont'd)

                do we think this man arrives. 

                          VERGER 
                Is it necessary to know?

                Well, I don't want to starve them too
                long.  They die. 

                          VERGER 
                Oh, no, no.  It won't be that long. 

     THE CAMERA ZOOMS IN ON THE PIGS.  IN AN UPPER SCREEN WE SEE 
     A CHICKEN WANDERING OUTSIDE THE PEN.  THE CHICKEN WANDERS
     INTO THE PEN.  ON THE FIRST SCREEN WE SEE ONE OF THE PIGS
     TURN, AND RUN BLINDINGLY QUICKLY ACROSS THE ENCLOSURE, AND IN
     A CU WE SEE THE FEW FEATHERS THAT ARE THE REMAINDER OF THE

                Yes, but no one is in control of their

                I don't understand. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST 
                You said:  that you have "decided."
                That your... your feelings of 
                persecution, as you put it are a "self-
                indulgence," and you are going to put 
                them aside.  And get on with your job. 

                          STARLING 
                That's right. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST 
                And you have decided to accept... to
                accept this "emotion," as you put it, to

     SHE CARRIES A BABY IN A SLING, IN HER ARMS. 

                          STARLING 
                    (TO THE MEN BEHIND HER)
                Wait Wait Wait! 

     STARLING CAREFULLY HOLSTERS HER PISTOL AND RAISES HER HANDS. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                Evelda!  Give it up!  Come to me, Baby!
                    (OUT OF THE SIDE OF HER 
                     MOUTH, TO THE MEN BEHIND
                     HER.) 
                ...give her a place to go... give her a 
                place to go.... Come on Evelda.  Nothing
                to it.  I swear to god. 

     WE HEAR A SQUEAL OF TIRES.

     ANGLE XCU ON STARLING, AS HER FACE SCREWS UP, AND HER HEAD
     TURNS FRACTIONALLY TOWARD THE DIRECTION OF THE SOUND.

                          STARLING (cont'd)
                Ev... 

     STARLING'S EYES GROW VERY WIDE.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     EVELDA HAS PRODUCED A SMALL SMG FROM BEHIND HER BABYSLING, 
     AND IS SPRAYING THE STREET. 

     ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND.  BRIGHAM FALL, HIT,
     BY HER SIDE.  AND SEVERAL OTHER SWAT MEMBERS BEGIN RUNNING
     FOR COVER.  THE MAN WITH THE RAINCOAT DROPS IT, TO REVEAL A
     SAWED OFF SHOTGUN.  HE FIRES AT STARLING.  SHE GOES DOWN IN
     THE STREET. 

     ANGLE ON STARLING IN THE STREET.

     AS SHE PICKS HERSELF UP FROM THE PAVEMENT, AND CRAWLS TOWARD
     THE SAFETY OF A PARKED CAR.

     A CADILLAC SEDAN IS COMING DOWN THE STREET, THE SAME APACHE
     STYLE SHOOTER WE SAW PREVIOUSLY IS SHOOTING OVER THE ROOF,
     AT THE POLICE.  THE CAR SCREECHES INTO A FISHTAIL, AND
     EVELDA, STILL SHOOTING, GET INTO THE BACKSEAT.  THE CAR BURNS
     RUBBER, TRYING TO ACCELERATE.

     STARLING EMERGES FROM HER COVER AND FIRES AT THE CAR.  THE
     WINDSHIELD SPATTERS, AND A TIRE BLOWS OUT.  THE CAR CRASHES
     INTO A FISH STALL. 

     SOUND OF A HELICOPTER.

     TWO SHOOTERS TRY TO SLITHER OUT OF THE CRUSHED CAR.
     STARLING, ADVANCING TOWARD THEM, SHOOTS THEM BOTH. 

     ANGLE, HER POV.

     EVELDA, AND THE BABY, IN THE BACKSEAT.  THE BABY CRYING.

     STARLING ADVANCES ON THEM.

                          STARLING (cont'd)
                    (TO THE COPS) 
                SECURITY SECURITY!  WATCH THE FISH HOUSE
                DOOR BEHIND ME.  GET MY BACK.  Evelda.
                Evelda.  Put your hands out of the
                window. 

     ANGLE 

     ON BRIGHAM, ON THE GROUND.  TWITCHING.  HE IS SHAKING HIS
     HEAD, DAZED. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                Evelda.  Show me your hands.  Come on.
                Please.  Show me your hands. 

     ANGLE, ON EVELDA. 

                          EVELDA 
                Well, it's you, chile.  It's my friend
                the orphan... 

                          STARLING 
                Give it up, Evelda.

                          EVELDA 
                You said you din' have no friends--but
                I'm your friend--  I understand you....

                          STARLING 
                Think about the baby... show me your 
                hands.... Evelda?  Show me your hands... 

                          EVELDA
                F'that's the thing to do... 

     SHE WITHDRAWS A HAND FROM THE BABYSLING, SHOWING A SMALL
     PISTOL, WHICH SHE LEVELS AT STARLING. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING AS SHE FIRES AT EVELDA.  SHE RUNS FORWARD, AND
     TAKES THE SCREAMING BABY FROM EVELDA'S ARMS.  THE BABY IS
     COVERED IN BLOOD. 

     STARLING RUNS TO THE STILL RUNNING HOSE WHICH THE FISH
     WORKER DROPPED, AND SLUICES DOWN THE BABY. 

     SOUND OF HELICOPTER.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS UP.

     ANGLE HER POV.

     THE HELICOPTER SHOWS A CAMERAMAN HANGING OUT OF THE DOOR ON
     A SLING, AND THE LOGO WCTU, TV 10.

     ANGLE 

     A TELEVISION SCREEN, SHOWING THE SHOT FROM THE HELICOPTER.
     SCREEN BEARS THE SMALL LOGO, SUPERED IN THE LOWER RIGHT
     CORNER:

     TV 10, NEWS LIVE.

     WE SEE, FROM ABOVE, STARLING, HOSING DOWN THE BABY, AND
     WALKING INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.  WE HEAR THE SOUND OF
     AN AMBULANCE, AND THE HELO SHOT SHIFTS TO AN AMBULANCE
     SCREAMING AROUND THE CORNER. 

     ANGLE 

     BACK ON THE STREET.  STARLING, HOLDING THE BABY, IS WALKING
     THROUGH THE SCENE OF THE CARNAGE.  SHE SEES BRIGHAM, RAISING 
     HIMSELF TO AN ELBOW, AND HE MOUTHS, "I'M ALRIGHT..."

     STARLING WALKS ON, PAST THE CAR, WITH THE DEAD BODIES. 
     PARAMEDICS COME OUT OF THE STOPPED AMBULANCE, AND ONE OF THEM
     TAKES THE INFANT FROM THE DAZED STARLING.

     STARLING HELPS BRIGHAM TO HIS FEET.  HE STANDS WOOZILY, HE
     BEGINS TO UNBUCKLE THE KEVLAR PROTECTIVE VEST HE WEARS. 

                          BRIGHAM
                I... 

                          STARLING 
                What, What, I can't hear you... 

                          BRIGHAM 
                Are you alright...? 

     THEY ARE SCREAMING OVER THE SOUND OF THE HELICOPTER. 

                          STARLING 
                I almost shot the baby... 

                          BRIGHAM
                Who called the TV CREWS...? 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.  BRIGHAM
     CALLS ANOTHER COP OVER. 

                          BRIGHAM (cont'd)
                Sergeant...

     AN OFFICER, FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER, COMES UP TO BRIGHAM.  THE
     THREE ADVANCE TOWARD THE SCENE AT THE PARKED CAR. 

     STARLING TURNS TOWARD THEM.

                          STARLING
                Security!!! 

     WE SEE THE SECOND OFFICER PICK UP THE SHOTGUN FROM THE ARMS
     OF THE "RAINCOAT" MAN. 

                          BRIGHAM 
                    (TURNING BACK, TO RESPOND TO
                     STARLING, HE DRAWS HIS HAND
                     ACROSS HIS THROAT) 
                They're dead... standdown, it's alr... 

     ANGLE 

     ON THE OFFICER PICKING UP THE SHOTGUN.  IT DISCHARGES.

     ANGLE ON BRIGHAM, AS HE FALLS, FELLED BY THE SHOTGUN BLAST. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE TURNS, TO LOOK AT THE SCENE, OF THE DYING 
     BRIGHAM. 

     SHE STARTS TO TAKE A STEP TOWARD HIM, AND STOPS.

     SHE LOOKS UP AT THE HELICOPTER.

     ANGLE

     THE TV IMAGE, WITH THE LOGO ON IT, WE SEE IT ZOOM IN ON 
     STARLING LOOKING UP, SHE THEN WALKS, DAZEDLY, TOWARD THE
     OBVIOUSLY DEAD BRIGMAN, AND SITS, SEVERAL FEET FROM HIM.  WE
     SEE SEVERAL OFFICERS COMING FORWARD TOWARD HER.

                My mother told me to ignore the

                we eat. 

     INT PAZZI'S APARTMENT. 

     HALF SEEN, THROUGH A PANNING SHOT OF A HALFOPEN DOOR, PAZZI
     AND HIS WIFE MAKING LOVE.  WE HEAR PAZZI CALLING: 

                          PAZZI 
                ...Laura...Laura...Laura... 

     ANGLE 

     ON FELL, IN THE SHADOWS, AS HE CLOSES THE FRONT DOOR
     SOUNDLESSLY BEHIND HIM.  HE STANDS FOR A MOMENT, LOOKING,
     CAMERA THEN TAKES HIM INTO THE APARTMENT WHERE HE FINDS THE
     KITCHEN. 

     INT THE KITCHEN, FELL TAKES A KNIFE FROM A MAPLE BLOCK, TRIES
     ITS EDGE, REPLACES IT, TAKES OUT A CLEAVER, AND NODS.  HE
     LOOKS ABOVE, AND TAKES DOWN A COPPER SAUCEPAN FROM THE POT
     RACK.  HE OPENS THE REFRIGERATOR, GLANCES BRIEFLY INSIDE,
     AND NODS, IN SATISFACTION, AND CLOSES IT. 

     HE PICKS UP A DISHTOWEL, TRIES IT BETWEEN HIS HANDS, TESTING
     ITS STRENGTH. 

     HE PUTS IT DOWN, DISSATISFIED. 

     HE BEGINS TO PROWL THROUGH THE APARTMENT, HE PASSES ANOTHER
     HALF OPEN DOOR, AND WE SEE PAZZI AND HIS WIFE, HALF GLIMPSED,
     BEYOND, FELL MOVES INTO A SMALL STUDY. 

     ANGLE 

     THE BACK OF THE DESK CHAIR, HOLDS A MAN'S SPORTCOAT, AND A
     TIE. 

     FELL MOVES TOWARD THE CHAIR, PUTS HIS CLEAVER DOWN ON THE
     DESK, AND TRIES THE TIE BETWEEN HIS HANDS, TESTING HIS
     STRENGTH. 

     HE NODS, SATISFIED, AND PICKS UP THE CLEANER.

     ANGLE INS 

     THE CLEANER, WHICH IS LAYING ON TOP OF THE FILE REGARDING THE 
     DISAPPEARANCE OF DOTTORE FANELLI, BENEATH IT, HALF COVERED,
     IS THE FBI LOGO. 

     WE SEE FELL'S HAND RAISE THE FIRST FILE, TO LOOK AT THE
     SECOND, AND WE READ: "FBI REPORT, THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, ETC,
     OF HANNIBAL LECHTER." 

     ANGLE CU.

     ON FELL, AS HE NODS TO HIMSELF, HE THEN LOOKS DOWN AT
     SOMETHING ELSE. 

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     A SCARF, PEEPING OUT OF THE HALF-OPEN DESK DRAWER.

     ANGLE INS. 

     FELL'S HAND DRAWS OUT THE SCARF.  NESTLED IN THE SCARF IS 
     THE PHOTO OF PAZZI IN FRONT OF THE WANTED POSTER. 

     ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE LOOKS AT THE PICTURE.  HE THEN BEGINS TO
     PEER VERY CLOSELY AT IT.  HE PICKS UP THE MAGNIFYING GLASS
     FROM THE DESK, AND WE SEE, IN A HUGE INSERT, THAT HE IS
     MOVING THE MAGNIFYING GLASS TO ATTEMPT TO MAKE OUT THE 
     FIGURE REFLECTED IN THE GLASS COVERING THE WANTED POSTER, ID,
     THE FIGURE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHER, IS STARLING. 

     ANGLE XCU 

     INS THE JUST SEEN OUTLINE OF STARLING, HOLDING THE CAMERA.

     ANGLE 

     FELL, LOOKING AT THE PHOTO.  HE THEN GLANCES AT THE SCARF, 
     PICKS IS UP, AND, QUESTIONINGLY, SNIFFS IT ONCE, AND THEN
     AGAIN.  HE HOLDS THE SCARF TO HIS FACE.  HE RUBS IT
     BETWEEN HIS HANDS, AND SMELLS HIS HANDS. 

     ANGLE PAZZI BEDROOM. 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...and then, we're going to Greece... 

                          PAZZI 
                Yes, but the important thing, as I've 
                said... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...get me a cigarette. 

     PAZZI GETS UP FROM THE BED, AND WRAPS HIMSELF IN A SHEET,
     AND PROCEEDS INTO THE STUDY. 

                          PAZZI 
                The essential thing.  The essential 
                thing, is that we must be absolutely
                quiet about... 

     HE PULLS OPEN THE DESK DRAWER, AND TAKES OUT A PACK OF
     CIGARETTES. 

     HE LOOKS WONDERINGLY, AT THE DRAWER, BEAT.  HE SHRUGS, HE
     IS ABOUT TO START BACK INTO THE BEDROOM, HE GLANCES AT THE
     CURTAINS, BLOWING IN THE OPEN WINDOW, HESITATES.

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...what is it? 

     HE LOOKS INTO THE DESK, SHAKES HIS HEAD.  BEAT.

     AND THEN RETURNS INTO THE BEDROOM. 

                          MRS. PAZZI (cont'd) 
                ...you've forgotten the cigarettes. 

     PAZZI TURNS, AND LOOKS BACK TOWARD THE OPEN WINDOW, AND THE
     BLOWING SHADES.

     EXT FLORENTINE PARK NIGHT.

     A YOUNG WOMAN WALKS PAST THE CAMERA.  SHE TAKES US TO FELL,
     WHO IS SITTING ACROSS FROM THE STATUE OF THE LION AND THE
     BIRD, HE IS PICKING HIS TEETH, AND, VERY DELICATELY, TAKES 
     OUT A SCARF, AND WIPES HIS MOUTH.  WE SEE IT IS THE SCARF
     WHICH HE STOLE FROM PAZZI, HE TAKES OUT THE PHOTOGRAPH OF 
     THE WANTED POSTER, AND LOOKS AT IT, AS HE WALKS THROUGH THE
     PARK. 

     CAMERA TAKES HIM OUT OF THE PARK, PAST THE YOUNG WOMAN, WHO,
     WE SEE, HAS RETURNED TO A STROLLER, WHICH IS EMPTY, SHE IS
     TALKING TO A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, AND GESTURING, "ABOUT THIS
     HIGH..."  SHOWING THE HEIGHT OF HER CHILD.  HE AND THE
     WOMAN START LOOKING IN THE BUSHES.

     ANGLE 

     ON FELL, LEAVING THE PARK, HE WALKS PAST AN APPLIANCE STORE, 
     IN THE WINDOW OF WHICH WE SEE, TEN SILENT TV SCREENS, AND A
     TALKING HEAD ANNOUNCER.

     THE SCENE SHIFTS TO THE HELICOPTER FOOTAGE OF STARLING.

     WE SEE PHOTOS DISPLAYED OF STARLING, NEXT TO THE PEOPLE SHE
     SHOT IN THE SHOOTOUT, AND A VISBO PROCLAIMS, "KILLER OF
     FIVE, THE DEATH ANGEL: CLARICE STARLING." 

     EXT STARLING'S HOUSE, DAY. 

     STARLING, MAPP, AND JIM, MAPP'S BOYFRIEND, ARE COMING OUT OF
     THE HOUSE WITH CRAWFORD, ESCORTED TOWARD SEVERAL CARS OF
     WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY A FUNERAL CORTEGE. 

     A SEDAN PULLS UP, AND KRENDLER GETS OUT.

                          KRENDLER
                I came to pay my...

     SHE STARTS PUSHING HIM, AND CAMERA PANS, TO A GROUP OF
     NEWSVANS, CORDONED OFF, AROUND THE CORNER, AND HELD IN BAY 
     BY VARIOUS POLICE.  STARLING IS BEING SUBDUED BY CRAWFORD
     ET AL. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                    (AS SHE PUSHES AT KRENDLER)

                You're out she's out... 

     SHE IS BEING DOCILED, AND LED AWAY.

                for your Daddy, Beat you up, to show he
                Loves you? 

     ANGLE.  ON STARLING, STANDING BY THE LINE OF CARS.  SHE
     SEES SOMETHING, AND TURNS. 

     ANGLE XCU STARLING AS SHE LOOKS.  KRENDLER CONTINUES HIS
     HARANGUE. 

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     ON THE REAR DECK OF A CAR, A STETSON HAT, WITH A BULLET
     THROUGH IT, AND AN OLD SQUARE POLICEBADGE, WITH A BULLETHOLE

                mark you up, an... 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE BLINKS, AND SHAKES HER HEAD TO CLEAR 
     IT. 

     THE SEDAN DRIVES OFF, AS SHE STRAINS TO LOOK AFTER IT.

                          KRENDLER (cont'd) 
                Well, here I am, you... 

     STARLING SHAKES HER HEAD AGAIN, FINDS HERSELF FACING 
     KRENDLER, AND PUNCHES HIM IN THE STOMACH.  KRENDLER GOES 
     DOWN.  STARLING IS SUBDUED BY HER COMFORTERS.  SHE STRAINS 
     TO LOOK AFTER THE DEPARTING CAR.

     INT VERGER'S ROOM. 

     ON THE TV STARLING, BEING PULLED OFF OF KRENDLER.

     ANGLE, OVER VERGER, ONTO CORDELL.

     VERGER CONVERSES IN GERMAN, WITH THE SWISS.  HE IS TOLD
     THAT THEY CAN HAVE A DATE, AND THAT A PACKAGE WILL BE
     COMING HIS WAY SOON. 

     ANGLE.  ON VERGER, LOOKING AT THE PIGS. 

     EXT FLORENTINE PALAZZO. NIGHT.

     PAZZI, WALKING DOWN THE STREET.  NERVOUSLY ADJUSTS HIS SCARF.

     ANGLE 

     A BRIGAND, LOUNGING BY A VAN, NODS IMPERCEPTIBLY, AT PAZZI, 
     WHO CONTINUES WALKING.

     THE BRIGAND GOES INTO THE BACK OF THE VAN.

     ANGLE INT THE VAN. 

     THERE IS ANOTHER BRIGAND INSIDE.  THERE ARE SEVERAL FIREARMS 
     IN A RACK, AND A HOSPITAL GURNEY WITH HEAVY RESTRAINTS.  THE
     SECOND BRIGAND IS LOADING AN ODD LOOKING SHOULDER WEAPON. 

                          SECOND BRIGAND 
                I hit him with the beanbag gun, you stand
                by:  he's still flopping... 

     THE FIRST BRIGAND NODS, AND TAKES A CAPPED HYPODERMIC
     SYRINGE FROM THE SECOND MAN.

                          SECOND BRIGAND (cont'd) 
                Just make sure he's alive, because I've
                already spent the bonus... 

     THE FRUIT MAN NODS TO THE SECOND, AND WE SEE PAZZI
     PROCEEDING UP THE STAIRS INTO THE PALAZZO.

     INT A SALON AT THE PALAZZO, NIGHT.

     A WORKER IS MOVING A FLOOR POLISHER ACROSS THE MARBLE FLOOR 
     OF THE SALON, IN AN ANTEROOM BEYOND WE HEAR FELL LECTURING.
     THE WORKER NODS DIFFERENTIALLY, AT SOMEONE OFF SCREEN. 

     WE SEE HE HAS NODDED AT PAZZI, WHO TAKES US TO THE DOOR OF
     THE SALON.

     HE WIPES HIS HANDS NERVOUSLY, HE MOPS HIS BROW, HE LOOKS AT
     HIS WATCH. 

     HE LOOKS INTO THE SALON.

     ANGLE HIS POV 

     FELL, IN FRONT OF A LECTERN.  A SLIDE MACHINE IS SHOWING A 
     PAINTING OF A HANGED FIGURE ON A HUGE DRIPCLOTH AT THE BACK
     OF THE SALON.

     ANGLE, ON PAZZI, AS HE MOVES TO THE SIDE, IE, OUT OF THE
     DOORWAY TO THE SALON, HE GLANCES OVER HIS SHOULDER, TO MAKE
     SURE HE IS OUT OF THE SIGHT OF THE WORKMAN WITH THE FLOOR
     POLISHER.  HE SEES THE WORKMAN TURN THE POLISHER OFF AND 
     BEGIN COILING THE LONG ELECTRIC CORD.  PAZZI TAKES A SMALL
     FLAT AUTOMATIC FROM A HIP HOLSTER.  CHECKS THE CHAMBER, AND
     SLIPS IT INTO HIS JACKET POCKET.  HE PROCEEDS BACK TO THE
     DOORWAY, WHERE WE AND HE SEE FELL, BEYOND, LECTURING TO A
     COMPANY OF SIX MEN, IN THE SALON. 

                          FELL
                    (LECTURING) 
                Della vigna was disgraced and blinded 
                for his betrayal of his emperor's trust-
                -through avarice.  Avarice and hanging
                    (HE GESTURES TO THE PAINTING)
                are linked in the ancient and the
                madeadeval mind. 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI, AS HANNIBAL (FELL) SPEAKS, HE MOVES TO A
     WINDOW, AND WIPES HIS HAND AGAIN, AND WE SEE HIM LOOK DOWN
     AT THE VAN IN THE STREET, AND WIPE HIS HANDS, MUCH OF THIS
     SPEECH PLAYS AS VOICE-OVER AS HE DOES SO. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Judas and Pier Della Vigna are linked in
                Dante by the avarice he saw in them, and
                their subsequent deaths by hanging.  Ah
                Commendatore Pazzi... 

     ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE SPEAKS TO PAZZI, HALF-SEEN IN THE DOORWAY. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                You are welcome.  Since you are closest
                to the door, would you close the door, to
                improve the quality of the image.
                    (PAZZI DOES SO) 
                You will be interested in this,
                Commandatore, as there are two Pazzi's 
                already in Dante's inferno... 

     ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE WALKS FORWARD, BETWEEN THE CHAIRS OF
     THE SIX OLD MEN (THE STUDIOLO) WHO SIT LISTENING TO HIS
     LECTURE.  A FEW TAKE NOTES. 

                          FELL (cont'd)

                Camicion de Pazzi, as you know, murdered
                a kinsman, and rests in hell awaiting the
                arrival of a Second Pazzi.  But it's not
                you:  it's Carlino, who will rest 
                forever in hell for the crime of
                Treachery. 

     ANGLE XCU, ON FELL, LOOKING AT PAZZI. 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI, UNDER THE WITHERING STARE.  BEAT.

                     LECTERN) 
                Avarice, and Hanging, then. 
                    (HE GESTURES TO THE PHOTOGRAPH
                     OF THE PAINTING) 
                On the next occasion, you might like to
                discuss the matter of Chewing.  Chewing
                in Dante:  Count Ugolino, chewing the
                back of the archbishop's head--Satan,
                with his three Faces, chewing Judas,
                Brutus, and Cassius... all three 
                traitors.  Is it not?  Thank you all for
                your kind attention. 

     THE SCHOLARS APPLAUD HIM, TWO STAND, AND TAKE HIM BY THE
     HAND.

     ANGLE ON PAZZI AT THE DOOR.  HE OPENS THE DOOR, AND THE OLD
     MEN OF THE STUDIOLO EXIT, CHATTERING HAPPILY ABOUT THE 
     LECTURE.  FELL COMES OUT, THE LAST OF THE SALON. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Would you say that I've preserved my
                job, Commendatore? 

                          PAZZI 
                I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it
                seemed as if they, as if they... 

                          FELL 
                Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do
                I owe...? 

                          PAZZI
                I require... 

                          FELL 
                ...yes, yes, yes... 

     HE FOLLOWS FELL BACK INTO THE ROOM, WHERE FELL BEGINS
     PUTTING AWAY HIS MATERIAL IN THE D1RTY SALON. 

                          FELL (cont'd)

                          FELL 
                Yes, of course, and we'll collect them.
                I won't be a minute... 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI AS HE WALKS UP TOWARD FELL. 

     HE PUTS HIS HAND IN THE JACKET POCKET.

                Ah, no.  I should have shown them this
                one.. 
                    (HE TAKES OUT A SLIDE AND PUTS
                     IT IN THE PROJECTOR)
                This one will interest you:  let me see
                if I can improve the focus... 

     WE SEE THE IMAGE OF A HANGED MAN APPEAR ON THE DROPCLOTH.
     THERE IS A PLAQUE DRAPED AROUND THE NECK OF THE HANGED MAN.

                          FELL (CONT'D)
                Can you make it out, can you make out
                the name on the plaque? 

     FELL WALKS UP TO THE IMAGE DISPLAYED ON THE DROPCLOTH, PAZZI
     WALKS BEHIND HIM.

                          FELL (cont'd)

                On a related subject Signor Pazzi, I must
                confess to you:  I'm giving serious
                thought to eating your wife. 

     FELL JERKS THE DROP CLOTH DOWN OVER THE TWO OF THEM.

     ANGLE XCU, ON PAZZI'S FACE AS HE SEES THE CLOTH COMING DOWN.

     ON LECHTER, AS HE COILS UP THE LONG ORANGE CORD OF THE
     FLOOR POLISHER, DRAWING IT TOWARD HIM. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Yes.  Your Wife.  Laura.  L'Orange, which
                is the topnote of her skin, wouldn't you
                say?  Or do I grow too personal?  but 
                that is what I think of, when I think of
                her.  And how could I but think of her? 
                I haven't had a bit all day.  The kidney
                and the liver would be su1table for a 
                dinner tonight.  But the rest of the meat
                should hang for a week, in these cool 
                conditions.  Wouldn't you say?  Nod once
                for yes. 
                    (PAUSE) 
                If you tell me what I need to know, 
                then it would be convenient for me to 
                leave without my meal.  And Mrs. Pazzi
                will remain unscathed.  I'll out the 
                questions to you, and we'll see:  I 
                saw at the theatre you had betrayed me.
                And, when the police didn't come, it was
                clear you had sold me out.  Was it to
                Mason Verger?  Blink one for yes. 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI.  BEAT.  THEN HE BLINKS ONCE. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Thank you.  And now:  Are his hit men
                waiting outside? 
                    (PAZZI BLINKS ONCE) 
                Was that a single blink?  Yes.  Thank
                you. 

     FELL FINISHES HIS COILING OF THE ROPE, AND WE SEE HE HAS
     FASHIONED A HANGMAN'S NOOSE. 

     FELL TAKES OUT A STILETTO, AND IT OPENS.  HE ADVANCES TOWARD
     PAZZI, WHO TRIES TO RECOIL. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                No, no.  I'm going to take the tape off.
                Please do not scream.  Do you think you
                can keep from screaming? 
                    (HE TAKES THE TAPE OFF) 
                ...would it help if I were to cut your
                BOWELS OUT...? 

     WE SEE HIM MAKE A SWIPE AND HEAR PAZZI START TO SCREAM.

     FROM OUTSIDE THE WINDOW OF THE SALON, WE SEE PAZZI, TAPED TO
     THE PODIUM, BEING IMPELLED, SCREAMING, TOWARD THE WINDOW. 

     ANGLE 

     ON THE LIGHTED PIAZZA OF THE PALAZZO, TOURISTS LOOK UP AT THE
     SCREAMING. 

     BEAT. 

     ANGLE XCU, ON THE CONTORTED FACE OF PAZZI, LOOKING DOWN, AN
     ORANGE NOOSE AROUND HIS NECK, AS THE PODIUM TILTS THROUGH
     THE OPEN WINDOW. 

     ANGLE 

     THE TWO BRIGANDS AT THE VAN.  REACTION TO THE SOUND OF THE
     SCREAMING, RUN AROUND THE CORNER.  THEY LOOK UP TO SEE PAZZI,
     STILL TAPES TO THE PODIUM, HANGING BY THE ORANGE CORD.

     ANGLE, ON THE VILLAINS, STANDING UNDERNEATH, AS GOUTS OF
     BLOOD FALL ON THEM.

                          BRIGAND ONE 
                ...cover the backdoor.  If he comes out,
                Kill him.

                ...the bonus was for... 

                          BRIGAND ONE 
                Kill him, and cut him. 

     HE RUNS TO THE FRONT OF THE PALAZZO, HOLDING HIS SHOULDER
     ARM DOWN ALONGSIDE HIS SIDE. 

     HE RUNS PAST THE LOCKED FRONT DOOR, AND TOWARD AN ALLEYWAY. 

     WE HEAR THE SIRENS OF POLICE CARS.  BRIGAND ONE SLOWS HIS
     WALK, AND PROCEEDS INTO THE ALLEYWAY.  HE SEES A SMALL DOOR,
     IN THE SIDE OF THE PALAZZO, AND A LIGHT BEYOND.

     ANGLE INT THE DOOR.

     A SMALL STAIRCASE.  THE BRIGAND ENTERS, HE LOOKS UP. 

     WE HEAR THE SOUND OF RAPIDLY DESCENDING FOOTSTEPS.  THE
     BRIGAND MOUNTS THE STEPS, HOLDING HIS RIFLE BEFORE HIM.  THE
     SOUND OF THE FOOTSTEPS CONTINUES.

     ON THE SECOND FLOOR, THE BRIGAND SHELTERS HIMSELF IN A ROOM,
     OFF THE LANDING.  THE SOUND OF THE DESCENDING FOOTSTEPS
     CONTINUES.

     ANGLE ON THE BRIGAND, HIDING BEHIND THE DOOR.  THEN HE TURNS
     HIS HEAD.

     ANGLE, HIS POV.

     WE ARE IN A LAUNDRY ROOM.

     THE SOUND OF THE FOOTSTEPS IS, IN FACT, A CLOTHESDRYER.  IN
     ITS GLASS DOOR IN THE SIDE, WE SEE A MAN'S SHOE GOING
     AROUND.

     ANGLE THE BRIGAND, AS HE LOOKS, THEN TO THE SIDE.

     ANGLE, HIS POV, IN THE SIDE OF THE ROOM, THE LEGS OF A DEAD
     MAN PROTRUDE FROM A CLOTHES HAMPER, HE WEARS ONLY ONE SHOE.

                          HANNIBAL (cont'd)
                Young man, I am desperate.  If I am not
                at the Piazza Bellosguardo in ten
                minutes, it is the end of marriage.
                    (HE HANDS A BUNDLE OF NOTES
                     TOWARD THE BOY)
                Do you think you could help me....?

     ANGLE

     IN THE PIAZZA, THE BODY OF PAZZI IS BEING LOWERED, IN THE
     BG WE SEE HANNIBAL, RIDING ON THE BACK OF THE MOTO, AND
     AWAY.

     INT VERGER'S ROOM, NIGHT. 

     A SMALL CHILD IS EATING POPCORN OUT OF A CROCKERY BOWL.  WE
     SEE HIS FACE, SMILING, IN THE GLOW OF A TELEVISION.

                          CHILD 
                I wanna see more... 

     CORDELL PUSHES A BUTTON ON HIS CONSOLE, AND WE SEE, ON THE
     VIDEO, MONITORS, A NURSE LEAVING THE HALLWAY AND ENTERING
     VERGER'S ROOM.  AS CORDELL TAKES THE CHILD TO HER WE SEE 
     THAT VERGER AND THE CHILD HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE PIGS ATTACK
     THE MAN-SIZED DUMMY, WHICH THEY NOW DO WITH ALACRITY. 

                          CORDELL

                Increase the pressure on Starling.  He
                will come to her. 

     INT STARLING'S HOME DAY. 

     STARLING IS SITTING, AFFECTLESS, IN FRONT OF A FULL CUP OF

                          STARLING
                What is it? 

     HE PRODUCES A SHOEBOX, SHE OPENS IT, IT CONTAINS VARIOUS
     MEMORABILIA OF BRIGHAM.  A PHOTO OF HIM IN THE ARMY, TWO

     ANGLE, A GARAGE.  A POTATOCHIP VAN.  AS CORDELL APPROACHES,
     TWO MEN IN POTATOCHIP DELIVERY UNIFORMS DESCEND FROM THE VAN. 

     CORDELL APPROACHES THEM, AND HANDS THEM EACH A COUPLE OF
     SHEETS OF PAPER. 

     HE CONVERSES WITH THEM, WHILE THE NURSE AND THE KIDS AND THE
     GOATS FROLIC IN THE FOREGROUND. 

     ANGLE INT THE VAN.

     THE TWO MEN, AS THEY CLOSE THE DOORS, AND START OFF.  WE
     SEE THEM AS THEY PULL OUT, WE SEE CORDELL WALKING THROUGH THE
     STABLE AREA.  WE SEE THE VAN SLIDE THROUGH THE VERGER
     ESTATE TOWARD THE OLD GATEHOUSE. 

     ON THE DASHBOARD, ONE HAS SPREAD ONE OF THE SHEETS OF PAPER,
     AND WE SEE IT IS OF STARLING, THE NEXT SHEET IN AN OLD PHOTO
     OF HANNIBAL. 

                          MAN ONE 
                ...be easier if we just kill him. 

                          MAN TWO

     THE OTHER MAN NODS HIS AGREEMENT.

     EXT.  PIG AREA DAY. 

     TWO BOARS GO INSANE AT THE ADVENT OF CORDELL.  WE SEE HIM 
     THROUGH THE STOUT BARS OF THEIR ENCLOSURE.

     CAMERA TAKES HIM INTO THE PIGBARN, WHERE THE GENTLEMAN, THEIR
     TRAINER, IS SEEN CONSTRUCTING A NEW ENEMY. 

                          GENTLEMAN 
                    (LOOKING UP AT CORDELL)
                It's going to be long...? 

     CORDELL SHRUGS 

                          GENTLEMAN (cont'd) 
                Is going to be much longer, we should
                feed them... 

                          CORDELL 
                Mmm.  Is it going to work? 

     THE GENTLEMAN MOVES TO A TAPE PLAYER, AND TURNS IT ON, AND WE
     HEAR A SCREAM.  HE NODS AND TURNS IT OFF. 

                          GENTLEMAN 
                The problem, if it is:  the tape is not 
                the true scream, an' the dummy, of 
                course, is not the true man.  BUT.  Yes,
                yes, I think, is close enough....

                          CORDELL 
                So:  the two problems are:  they should
                be fed, and they should practice on a 
                real... 

     THE GENTLEMAN TURNS HIS BACK ON CORDELL AND IS MOVING THE
     TAPE MACHINE. 

     ANGLE ON THE GENTLEMAN, WITH CORDELL BEHIND HIM.

                No, we know that you're awake... 

                          VERGER
                    (VO) 
                Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you
                for coming.  I am sorry that we could
                not meet under more pleasant
                circumstances.

     ANGLE HIS POV, A SMALL TV CAMERA SET NEAR THE CEILING, ITS
     RED LIGHT ON.

                    (VO) 
                But you will recall what the last time we
                met, you drugged me, and induced me, in
                that state, to scrape my face off and 
                FEED IT TO THE DOGS.  DID THAT DIVERT
                YOU?  TELL HIM WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO
                TO RECIPROCATE!!! 

                          CORDELL 
                ...the bad news is:  we're going to stick
                your feet through those bars tomorrow,
                and feed them to our pigs.

                          VERGER
                    (VO) 
                Thank you, Cordell.

                    (SPEAKING GROGGILY) 
                ...but will that satisfy you? 

                          VERGER 
                Why should you care? 

                          LECHTER 
                It is not that I care for you--but
                that I posses an enquiring mind.  What
                will you do when I am gone?  When you
                have nothing to occupy your thoughts, 
                save the memory of your own folly, and,
                more to the point, stupidity. 

                          VERGER
                ARE YOU DONE?

                          LECHTER 
                    (PAUSES TO THINK, THEN, AS IF
                     SURPRISED)
                Yes. 

                          VERGER 
                You don't wish to beg...? 

                          LECHTER 
                Would that add to your mirth? 

                          VERGER 
                Explain in depth the plan we have for
                him.  Until tomorrow.

     ON LECHTER AND CORDELL.

                          LECHTER 
                One would have thought he'd keep me
                under observation.  To savor his
                triumph. 

                          CORDELL 
                No, I think he proffers to spend his
                happy hours with his playmates. 

                          LECHTER 
                ...young boys, still...? 

                          CORDELL

                          LECHTER
                Mmm... 

                          CORDELL 
                ...and then, he'll be coming down. 

                          LECHTER 
                You said the bad news... 

                          CORDELL
                Yes, I did. 

                          LECHTER 
                I believe that your tone implied that 
                there was some good news.... and, do you
                know... there might be good news for
                you... 

                          CORDELL 
                Oh, yes, what?  You'd bribe me, to, to,
                to, "release" you...? 

                          LECHTER 
                I can make you rich. 

                          CORDELL 
                And I expect you to.
                    (HE LEANS CLOSER TO HANNIBAL)

                so.  I know how that stuff works, take

                Our other option is to beat you for a

                suppose this is what it feels like. 

     ANGLE 

     ONE OF THE ABDUCTORS (THE POTATOCHIP MEN) GOES TO A CONSOLE
     AND TURNS ON THE SOUND OF RECORDED SCREAMING.  HE LOOKS DOWN
     AT THE PIGS WHO, HEARING THE SCREAMING, COME TO THE SIDE OF
     THE PEN.  HE LOOKS BACK TOWARD THE DIRECTION OF CORDELL, AND
     LECHTER, AND WINCES. 

     HE RAISES THE AXE HANDLE AND PREPARES TO STRIKE.

     VERGER IS SEEN IN THE FLICKER OF THE TV SCREEN.

     STARLING, MOVING THROUGH THE MOONLIT NIGHT, THROUGH THE
     WOODS. 

     WE SEE THE MUSTANG, BEHIND HER, COVERED WITH BOUGHS, IN THE
     WOODS, AND BEYOND THAT, BELOW HER, THE GUARDHOUSE. 

     CAMERA TAKES HER UP TO A BARBEDWIRE FENCE, CAMOUFLAGED, WITH
     BRUSH WOVEN INTO IT.  A LARGE TREE STANDS NEXT TO THE FENCE,
     WITH A BOUGH RUNNING FROM THE NEAR SIDE TO THE FAR SIDE. 

     ANGLE, STARLING LOOKS AT IT, AND SMILES.  SHE WALKS FORWARD,
     LOOKING INTENTLY AT THE GROUND. 

     ANGLE, HER POV.  A SMALL TRIPWIRE, SUSPENDED SIX INCHES OFF
     THE GROUND, COVERS THE AREA IN FRONT OF THE SO-ATTRACTIVE
     TREE.  STARLING FOLLOWS THE TRIPWIRE DOWN, PARALLEL TO THE
     FENCE.  SHE STEPS OVER THE TRIPWIRE AND PROCEEDS DOWN,
     WATCHING THE FENCE, LOOKING INTENTLY. 

     SHE GOES INTO A GULLY WHERE WE SEE THAT A RUNOFF OF A STREAM
     IS ERODING A HOLE UNDERNEATH THE BARBEDWIRE FENCE.

     ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE GETS DOWN ON THE GROUND, TAKES A
     STICK AND PROBES IN THE FLOW OF WATER UNDERNEATH THE 
     FENCE.  SHE NODS, SATISFIED, AND BEGINS TO USE THE STICK TO
     ENLARGE THE OPENING UNDER THE FENCE.

                then ...ALMOST BY MAGIC...Yes, proceed.
                Please.... proceed... 

     CORDELL STARTS TO EXIT.

     CAMERA SEES THE GURNEY BED, WITH VERGER ON IT, A SMALL
     COUCH, ON WHICH IS A YOUNG BOY, ASLEEP, IN FRONT OF A
     SILENT TELEVISION, A BOWL OF POPCORN BY HIM.

                OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it. 

     CORDELL MOVES TO THE FORKLIFT, STARTS IT, AND IT MOVES
     TOWARD THE GURNEY.

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE WATCHES THE FORKLIFT GENTLY PICK UP
     VERGER IN THE GURNEYBED.  THE SOUND OF SCREAMING STOPS.

                On the ground, on the ground... 

     SHE MOVES TO HIM, AS HE COMPLIES, AND REMOVES HANDCUFFS, AND
     CUFFS THE MAN AROUND A POLE.  HE STARTS TO REMONSTRATE, AND
     SHE HITS HIM ON THE HEAD WITH HER GUNBUTT.  SHE EXITS THE
     TACKROOM, AND ENTERS THE BARN AND ADVANCES ON THE MAULED
     AND BEATEN FORM OF LECHTER.

                          LECHTER 
                Good morning, Clarice. 

                          STARLING

                          LECHTER
                Perhaps... shall we see...? 

                          STARLING 
                I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due
                respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me,
                I'll shoot you dead, do you 
                understand...?  Do right and you'll live
                through this.

     STARLING TAKES OUT A KNIFE, AND BEGINS TO CUT THE DOCTOR LOOSE.

                I'll do the rest, if you give me the
                knife. 

     SHE LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER, AT THE FORKLIFT COMING DOWN THE
     HILL. 

                          STARLING 
                No, I don't think so. 

     LECHTER HAS FREED HIMSELF, AND IS CHAFING HIS LIMBS TO
     RESTORE CIRCULATION. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                    (AS SHE POINTS TO THE FORKLIFT) 
                I'm going to subdue our friends, coming
                down the hill, and I want you to cuff 
                em, and to put em inside with the other

     AROUND, AND FALLS, DAZILY.  HER PISTOL FALLS THROUGH THE BARS
     INTO THE PIGPEN.

     ON THE MAN IN THE LOFT, AS HE RELOADS, AND SIGHTS ON 
     LECHTER, WHO IS KNEELING BY STARLING.  WE SEE LECHTER PICK UP
     HER PISTOL, AND FIRE AT THE MAN IN THE LOFT. 

     ANGLE.  THE MAN IN THE LOFT, HE FALLS AGAINST A RAILING, HE
     DROPS HIS DARTRIFLE. 

     IT DROPS INTO THE PIG'S PEN.

     ANGLE 

     ON LECHTER, AS HE MOVES TO STARLING, AND PULLS HER AWAY FROM 
     THE PIGPEN, HE TRIES TO REACH THROUGH THE BARS FOR HER
     PISTOL, BUT IT IS JUST OUT OF REACH. 

     HE LOOKS UP.

     ANGLE

     ON VERGER AND CORDELL, APPROACHING LECHTER.

                          CORDELL 
                Stop there, would you, please, Doctor...?

                          LECHTER
                The girl could use some help. 

                          VERGER
                You're free... 

                          LECHTER 
                ...which of us is free...? 

                          VERGER 
                Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest 
                Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the
                only crime.  I never ceased to hope! 

                          LECHTER 
                The girl needs help. 

                          VERGER 
                And what would be of Greater Help, than
                to release her, from the bonds of this
                sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU
                THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE 
                TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE
                ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND 
                UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU THINK?  BLIND
                HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE HIM AND HER FOR
                THE PIGS! 
                    (CORDELL, HOLDING A GUN,
                     ADVANCES ON LECHTER) 

                          LECHTER 
                ...might I make a suggestion...? 

                          VERGER 
                ...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE 
                THE WORD, do you understand...when I give
                the word... 

     ANGLE 

     ON LECHTER, BEING BOUND, AND HOISTED UP, AGAIN, ON THE BEAM.

                          CORDELL 
                ...fraid, that's about it, Doctor. 

                          LECHTER
                Let the girl go. 

                          CORDELL
                Why? 

                          LECHTER 
                For a consideration. 

                          CORDELL 
                'fraid it's too late. 

                          VERGER
                ...when I...
                    (PAUSE) 

     CORDELL CONTINUES THE FINAL PREPARATIONS OF LECHTER.

                          LECHTER 
                ...what has she done to harm you...? 

                          CORDELL 
                Yes, do you know, you're right...
                    (HE PAUSES) 
                ...Mr. Verger...? 
                    (PAUSE)
                Mr. Verger, Sir?  He's ready...
                    (PAUSE) 

     ANGLE ON CORDELL, AS HE LEAVES THE TRUSSED LECHTER, STEPPING 
     OVER STARLING, AND PROCEEDS BACK TOWARD THE GURNEY, WHICH IS
     HALF HIDDEN BY THE PIGPEN. 

     ANGLE 

     HIS POV.  AS HE COMES AROUND THE CORNER, THE CHILD 
     FRANKLIN HAS THE BOWL OF POPCORN, AND IS SEEN FEEDING POPCORN 
     TO VERGER.

     ANGLE CORDELL'S POV. 

     THE LIFESIGNS DISPLAY OF VERGER.  A SINGLE BLIP, A LONG
     PAUSE, ANOTHER IRREGULAR BLIP.  A LONG PAUSE. 

     ANGLE CORDELL, AS HE ADVANCES ON THE CHILD.

                          CORDELL (cont'd) 
                Hey, Franklin.  Hey.  Tell you what, if
                you'd just stop doing that, I'm going to
                give you something nice. 

                          FRANKLIN 
                He don't like popcorn. 

                          CORDELL
                No.  And... 

                          FRANKLIN
                I like Popcorn... 

                          CORDELL 
                ...yes, if you'll, just step away... 

                          FRANKLIN 
                You give me whatever I want...? 

                          CORDELL 
                Yes.  You know I will.  That's right. 

                          FRANKLIN
                Awright. 

     FRANKLIN STEPS AWAY.  AND CORDELL RUNS UP TO VERGER AND
     TRIES TO REVIVE HIM.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN, AS HE MOVES AROUND THE PEN, AND PULLS A LEVER
     WHICH OPENS THE GATE.

     ANGLE 

     ON THE PIGS, AS THEY START TO MOVE INTO THE AREA OCCUPIED BY
     CORDELL AND VERGER.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN.

                          FRANKLIN (cont'd) 
                You know what I want...? 

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, BENT OVER VERGER, AS HE LOOKS BACK. 

     ANGLE ON FRANKLIN. 

                          FRANKLIN (cont'd)
                I WANT KITTYKAT!!!

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, AS HE SEES THE PIGS APPROACHING, HE STARTS TO
     SCREAM.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN, AS HE CLIMBS UP TO THE AREA WHERE WE SEE
     LECHTER. 

                          LECHTER 
                Let me down, son, let me down. 

                          FRANKLIN 
                What'll you do for me? 

                          LECHTER 
                I'll take you home. 

                          FRANKLIN
                Ain't got no home. 

                          LECHTER 
                Then what would you like...? 

     FRANKLIN COMES OVER AND WHISPERS TO HIM.

     ANGLE 

     ON HANNIBAL, AS HE RECOILS.  BEAT.  THE SOUND OF
     SCREAMING STOPS.

     PAUSE 

                          HANNIBAL
                    (PAUSE) 
                Yes.  You shall have it... 

                          FRANKLIN 
                Then you goin to hell... 

                          HANNIBAL
                ...that's right... 

     FRANKLIN LOOSES THE ROPE WHICH HOLDS LECHTER, AND LECHTER
     ENTERS THE PIGPEN.  WE SEE THE PIGS, AT THE FAR END, 
     SAVAGING WHAT WE ASSUME TO BE THE FORMS OF VERGER AND
     CORDELL. 

     ANGLE 

     ON HANNIBAL, AS HE STOOPS TO THE FORM OF STARLING, AND 
     GATHERS HER UP.  THE PIGS ADVANCE ON HIM, AND THEN STOP...
     HE STEPS THROUGH THEM, AND OUT OF THE BARN. 

     ANGLE EXT THE BARN. 

     STARLING, PUT DOWN IN THE GRASS.  BEAT.  SHE STIRS.  SHE HALF-
     OPENS HER EYES.

     ANGLE, HER POV LECHTER, WALKING TOWARD HER, BEHIND HIM THE
     VERGER ESTATE BURSTING INTO ROARING FLAMES.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN, STANDING BY THE FLAMES, LOOKING AT LECHTER, AS
     HE WALKS UP TOWARD STARLING. 

     ANGLE 

     ON LECHTER, AS HE PICKS UP STARLING, WE SEE A SECURITY CAR
     COMING DOWN THE DRIVE, AS LECHTER AND STARLING FADE INTO
     THE WOODS. 

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

     INT SUMPTUOUS, ELEGANT DININGROOM.

     STARLING, IN A DECOLLETE EVENING GOWN, STANDING IN FRONT OF 
     A PERFECT PRESENTATION OF BACCARAT AND LIMOGES.

     ANGLE HER POV.

     LECHTER, IN A TUXEDO, STANDING AGAINST THE BALCONY OF THE 
     ROOM, WHICH LOOKS OUT ON THE SEA.  HE SMILES AT HER.

                          LECHTER
                You look lovely. 

                          STARLING
                Thank you. 
                    (SHE MOVES TO SIT, AND 
                     LECHTER COMES UP AND HOLDS
                     HER CHAIR FOR HER) 
                No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you
                find me so..."

                          LECHTER 
                I'd prefer you to say what you feel. 

                          STARLING
                What is that that smells so wonderful. 

                          LECHTER 
                I hope you'll find it so. 
                    (HE POURS HER A GLASS OF
                     WINE) 
                Yes.  It's good to see you regaining 
                your strength... 

                          STARLING
                Thanks to you... 

     WE SEE LECHTER EXCUSE HIMSELF, AND RETIRE INTO THE KITCHEN.
     WE SEE HIM TAKING DOWN SAUCEPANS, AND MIXING WHAT APPEARS TO
     BE A MARINADE.

                          LECHTER
                Now, what were we last speaking of...? 

                          STARLING 
                We were speaking of my father... 

     LECHTER POURS THE MARINADE INTO A PAN, LIGHTS THE FLAME IN
     THE STOVE, WIPES HIS HANDS, AND RETURNS TO THE DININGROOM. 

                          LECHTER
                ...I'm sorry....? 

                          STARLING 
                ...we were speaking of my father... 

                          LECHTER
                Indeed we were. 

                          STARLING 
                ...and my need for The Institution... 

                          LECHTER 
                Freud, do you know...?  Freud 
                psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon. 

                          STARLING 
                And how did he do that? 

                          LECHTER 
                He saw the truth, and spoke it... 

                          STARLING 
                I'm afraid, this wine is making me
                woozy... 

                          LECHTER 
                ...you have to eat... 

     LECHTER RETURNS TO THE KITCHEN, INDICATING "ONE MOMENT." 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                    (AS THE CAMERA TAKES HIM TO 
                     THE KITCHEN, AND WE HALF-SEE
                     THE TORSO OF A MAN SITTING
                     IN A KITCHEN CHAIR) 
                You've sought out The Institution all 
                your life, as you with it to replace your
                Father.  This is obvious.  Less obvious
                is this:  that you require the 
                institution not to support you, but to 
                FAIL.  FOR THIS KEEPS YOUR FATHER ALIVE. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, SITTING, NODDING, AS SHE DRINKS HER WINE.  SHE
     PUTS THE GLASS DOWN, A TRIFLE WOOZY. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                ...as this keeps your father alive.  The
                truth is two-fold, and the truth is one: 

     THE WIND FROM THE OCEAN BLOWS A STRAND OF HAIR ACROSS HER
     EYES, SHE BRUSHES IT BACK. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd)
                    (VO) 
                That every man is fallible, that every
                institution, being made of men, cannot
                but be corrupt... 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, LOOKING DOWN AT HER HAND. 

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     THE HAND IS COVERED WITH MUD AND BLOOD.

     ANGLE, STARLING, LOOKING PERPLEXED, AT THE KITCHEN WHERE WE 
     SEE THE FORM OF LECHTER, MOVING ACROSS THE KITCHEN.

     ANGLE 

     ON LECHTER.

     AS WE SEE, HE CARRIES A SCALPEL, HE MOVES TOWARD THE HALF-
     SEEN FORM OF THE MAN IN THE CHAIR.

     HE BENDS DOWN OVER THE MAN, AND WE SEE THAT HE CARRIES A
     SCALPEL AND A SMALL MEDICAL SAW... 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                ...the only art in this dish, of course,
                is that it must be fresh... 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, IN THE ROOM, AS SHE PICKS UP A SMALL ROSEBUD
     FROM THE CUT CRYSTAL BUDVASE IN FRONT OF HER.

     SHE LOOKS AT IT WOOZILY, AND IT FALLS FROM HER FINGERS.
     SHE BENDS DOWN.

     ANGLE, HER POV, THE FLOOR.

     THE ROSEBUD, ON A FILTHY, TORN LINOLEUM FLOOR, HER LEGS
     ENCASED IN THE MUDDY PANTS WE SAW HER IN AT VERGER'S FARM. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE STRAIGHTENS, HOLDING THE ROSE.  WE SEE A
     LOOK OF CONSTERNATION ON HER FACE.  HER FACE IS BLOODY, AND
     COVERED IN MUD, WE SEE SHE IS NOT IN A SUMPTUOUS
     DININGROOM, BUT IN A SLUM. 

     ANGLE HER POV 

     LECHTER, IN THE KITCHEN, IN TUXEDO, MOVING PAST THE DOORWAY.

     ANGLE INT THE KITCHEN.

     LECHTER, AS WE NOW SEE, IN THE FILTHY KITCHEN OF A SLUM. 
     COOKING ON A HOTPLATE.  DRESSED IN WORKCLOTHES, CAMERA TAKES
     HIM, FROM BEHIND, TO THE SLUMPED FORM OF THE MAN, CAMERA CUTS
     OFF AT THE MAN'S SHOULDERS, WE SEE LECHTER, FROM THE BACK,
     LIFTING SOMETHING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE MAN'S HEAD, AND
     CARRYING IT BACK TO THE FILTHY TABLETOP, WHERE, AS HE SPEAKS,
     HE BEGINS KNEADING IT WITH FLOUR, WE SEE THE PAN SIZZLING
     ON THE HOTPLATE. 

     ANGLE 

     IN THE SLUM ROOM.  STARLING, DAZED, AND LECHTER, REENTERING. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                That the institution cannot but be 
                corrupt, and, therefore, it cannot be
                but an act of complicity to seek to
                appease it. 

     HE MOVES BACK INTO THE KITCHEN, PUTS THE BREADED PIECES OF
     CUTLET INTO THE PAN, THE FIRE SHOOTS UP. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                So many civilizations eat their slain
                enemies... what do you think...?  How
                much better to devour a person 
                physically, than to devour his spirit. 
                Which is, of course, the purpose of the
                institution. 

     HE REMOVES THE MEAT FROM THE PAN, AND FORKS IT ONTO A TIN
     PLATE.

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                    (REENTERING THE DININGROOM) 
                :and that is the especial surprise,
                I've prepared for You! 

                          STARLING
                I feel weak... 

                          LECHTER
                    (NODDING) 
                ...you must eat. 

     SHE LOOKS DOWN AT THE TABLE.  SHE PICKS UP HER FORK.

     ANGLE HER POV 

     THE LOVELY LINEN TABLE, THE STEAMING MEAT ON THE LIMOGES
     PLATE. 

     A HUGE COCKROACH, SCURRYING ACROSS THE TABLECLOTH.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE RISES, UNSTEADILY, IN HER MUDDY
     CLOTHES...

                          STARLING 
                ...1 don't understand... 

     SHE WALKS TOWARD THE BALCONY WINDOW, LOOKING OUT AT THE
     OCEAN.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     OUT THE WINDOW, A SQUALID CITY STREET, SEEN FROM THE THIRD
     FLOOR. 

     A COUPLE OF CARS STOPPING AT THE END OF THE STREET.

     ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE TURNS BACK TOWARD LECHTER.

                          LECHTER
                    (IN THE KITCHEN) 
                The gift, of course is not the meal--
                but the identification--which of us does
                not need help?  The identity, of your
                true enemy...? 
                ...for you always sought to befriend, to
                wish the love of those who wished you ill. 

     ANGLE, ON LECHTER, STANDING BEFORE THE FIGURE TIED TO THE
     CHAIR. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                Come here--he is in no pain, there are
                no nerves in the brain, come here... 

     ANGLE, LECHTER'S POV THE FIGURE OF CRAWFORD TIED TO THE
     CHAIR. 

     LECHTER MOVES TO HIM AND EXTRACTS FROM HIS UPPER POCKET, A
     XEROX OF THE PHOTO OF THE BADGE WITH THE HOLE IN IT. 

                          LECHTER (CONT'D) 
                Come here, I'm going to cure you. 

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     STARLING, IN THE SLUMROOM, LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW.

     ANGLE 

     STARLING, DAZED, LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW, LECHTER COMES 
     UP BEHIND HER, AND LOOKS OUT.

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     THE SLUM STREET, A VAN NOW PULLING UP, A SQUAD OF SWAT 
     OFFICERS APPROACHING A PARKED CAR.

     ANGLE

     ON LECHTER AND CLARICE.

     LECHTER APPROACHES HER.

     ANGLE HIS POV, 

     STARLING, IN THE BEAUTIFUL GOWN, HE MOVES AS IF TO CARESS 
     HER BREAST.

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS DOWN.  WE SEE SHE IS NOW
     CLOTHED IN HER FILTHY CLOTHES, AND LECHTER IS FRISKING
     HER. 

     ANGLE 

     LECHTER, FRISKING THE FILTHY STARLING, TAKES OUT THE
     MARINECORP HATBADGE, WHICH WE SAW EARLIER, HE BREAKS IT
     OPEN, AND REVEALS A MICROTRANSMITTER.

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                Oh, no.  Oh, NO.  They've put a beeper on
                you.  How careless of me.  How finally 
                careless, Do you think?  Have I erred on
                Purpose?  Eh?  Or am I just unlucky? 
                Could one not say that's the essential
                question of Philosophy...? 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, DAZED, LOOKING ON.

                          STARLING 
                Might I have some more of the wine...? 

     ANGLE ON LECHTER, AS HE MOVES TO A BACK WINDOW.

     STARLING, AS SHE RISES, AGAIN, IN HER BALLGOWN. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                Because, I find I like the effects.  You
                may say that it's inebriation, but it
                seems 
                    (SHE SMILES) 
                This lovely evening, in particular.... it 
                seems to reward me with clarity...
                    (SHE LAUGHS) 

     THERE IS A SOUND BEHIND HER.  THE BEAUTIFUL FRENCHDOORS 
     OPEN AND ADMIT A HAPPY COTERIE OF GOWNED WOMEN AND FORMAL
     DRESSED MEN, THEY ARE ALL CHATTERING THEIR JOY AT SEEING 
     HER. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                ....or perhaps, it is just the heat... I
                was just saying to the Doctor...
                    (SHE GESTURES) 

     ANGLE HER POV THE OPEN WINDOW, THE SHADES BLOWING.

     CAMERA COMES BACK TO STARLING, WHO IS IN HER RAGS, WITH THE
     SWAT TEAM ENTERING THE ROOM. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                But, do you know, do you know, I'm not
                feeling altogether.... 

     SHE SWOONS.  A SWAT MAN CATCHES HER.

                          SWAT MAN
                ...I've got her... 

     ANGLE 

     IN THE SLUMROOM, WE SEE THAT A SWAT TEAM HAS ENTERED.  ONE OF
     THEM HAS CAUGHT THE FAINTING STARLING IN HIS ARMS.  THE
     SEVERAL MEN PROCEED TOWARD THE BACK OF THE KITCHEN. 

                          STARLING 
                    (AS WE SEE SHE IS IN 
                     KRENDLER'S ARMS)
                ...may be the heat....

                          KRENDLER 
                Let's get her out of here....

     SWAT OFFICER, FROM THE KITCHEN.  AS HE GAZES IN THE
     DIRECTION OF CRAWFORD.

                          STARLING 
                But as my father used to say...

                          SWAT OFFICER
                    (IN KITCHEN)
                ...ohmiGod.

     EXT TEXAS GRAVEYARD DAY. 

     A NEW MARBLE HEADSTONE BEING LOWERED ONTO A GRAVE.  IT IS
     ORNATE AND SOLID, AND READS:  JAMES RANDALL STARLING, HUSBAND
     AND FATHER.  DIED 1975.

     ANGLE 

     STARLING STANDING BY THE GRAVE, HOLDING FLOWERS, BEHIND HER
     STAND MAPP AND HER BOYFRIEND.  BEHIND THEM STAND AN OFFICIAL
     LOOKING MAN, WHO HOLDS HIS STETSON, REVERENTLY, IN FRONT OF
     HIM.  IN THE BG WE SEE A TRUCK MOVING SLOWLY DOWN THE
     DUSTY CEMETERY ROAD. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE KNEELS, AS THE STONE IS PLACED,
     PUTTING A SMALL BOUQUET OF FLOWERS NEXT TO IT.  AS SHE 
     KNEELS, AND CAMERA CRANES DOWN, WE READ THE BOTTOM OF THE
     INSCRIPTION:  "DIED 1975.  HE WILL NEVER KNOW HOW HE WAS
     MISSED." 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE STANDS, AND MAPP COMES, AND PUTS HER ARM
     AROUND HER.

                          MAPP 
                That's why it's a stone, you know, It
                means Don't Come Back. 

     STARLING NODS, AND THEY TURN AWAY, AND WALK AWAY FROM THE
     GRAVE.  IN THE BG WE SEE ANOTHER GROUP OF MOURNERS, WEARING
     WESTERN GARB.  STARLING AND HER GROUP CROSS A SERVICE ROAD,
     IN FRONT OF THE OLD TRUCK.

                          STARLING 
                Well.  No.  He can't come back. 

                          MAPP 
                Baby, that's the beginning of wisdom. 

     MAPP PUTS HER ARM AROUND STARLING, AS THEY WALK OFF.
     STARLING NODS, THAT SHE UNDERSTANDS, AND LAYS HER HEAD ON
     MAPP'S SHOULDER.

     WE SEE SEVERAL GRAVEDIGGERS SITTING ON THE BACK.  THE MAN IN
     THE PASSENGER SEAT, WEARING A STRAW WESTERN HAT, TURNS, TO
     LOOK AT STARLING AND THE GROUP.  IT LOOKS LIKE LECHTER. 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AND HER GROUP, AS THE MAN IN THE TRUCK
     MOMENTARILY CATCHES HER EYE. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE GRAVEYARD. 

     A GLINT OF LIGHT PLAYS ACROSS HER FACE, AND SHE SQUINTS.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     THE LIGHT HITTING THE SHOVEL OF THE GRAVEDIGGER IN THE 
     STRAW HAT.  THE GRAVEDIGGER IS HALF HIDDEN BY THE GROUP HE
     WALKS WITH.

                Give me your gun... 

     ANGLE 

     ON MAPP, AS SHE LOOKS AT STARLING.

                          MAPP

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS AT THE APPROACHING FIGURE.

     STARLING, WHO IS INDICATING, "I JUST WANT TO BE ALONE FOR A
     WHILE."

     FRIEND, WE SEE THEM PASS BY ANOTHER SMALL FUNERAL, SEVERAL
     BLACK CLAD MOURNERS AND AN OLD LIMOUSINE, AT THE GRAVESIDE. 

     STARLING CHATS WITH MAPP FOR A MOMENT, OBVIOUSLY SAYING SHE,
     STARLING, WANTS TO STAY ON AT THE GRAVE.  MAPP NODS, AND SHE
     AND HER FRIEND GET INTO THEIR CAR AND DRIVE AWAY.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE PASSES BY THE OTHER FUNERAL, BACK TOWARD
     HER FATHER'S GRAVE.

     BEGIN MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE.

     At the very edge of hearing, the tone of human VOICES.  
     Unintelligible, babbling, eerie.  Then a loud FLAPPING SOUND.  It 
     shifts from one side of the theater to the other, like something 
     moving among the wall hangings.

     As the TITLE appears, the noise mounts, drowning out the VOICES,
     agitated, becoming violent, banging... inhuman.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. HOUSING PROJECT, CHARLESTOWN, MASSACHUSETTS - DAY

     ON a housing project in the industrial outskirts of Boston.  The
     BANGING seems to flutter away, leading us along, searching... to a 
     tiny balcony, one of dozens, ten stories up.  And there, the source 
     of the sound --

     -- A SHEET, snapping in the wind.  The umbrella-like clothes line 
     on which it hangs bangs against a dirty glass door as if trying to 
     get in.

     THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR a woman paces inside, agitated.  The VOICES 
     rise over the banging, becoming intelligible --

     INT. LIVING ROOM, NELL'S APARTMENT - DAY

     -- becoming a fight.  JANE, 30s, dark-haired, furious, wheels
     across a diminutive, neat, but poor living room.

                               JANE
                   It'll take a month to probate the
                   will, Nell!  A month!  Even if
                   Mother left you something, you
                   won't get it in time to pay the
                   rent.  So instead of complaining,
                   you should be thanking Lou for
                   getting you these two weeks to get
                   Mother's things packed.

     At first we can't even see who she's yelling at.  At first we don't
     even notice her.  Then we do...

     Holding herself, in a dim corner away from the light, small, plain,
     like a part of the faded room is ELEANOR VANCE, 20's -- Nell.
     She stares at the door.  The clothes line raps at the begrimed
     glass.

                               JANE (cont'd)
                   Nell?

     The wind dies, the banging stops.  Nell seems to hear Jane and 
     peers over at her, then across the room to Jane's bored husband,
     LOU.  He's turning a Franklin Mint commemorative coin set in his
     hands, studying it.

                               LOU
                   You're still going to have to
                   settle with your mother's landlord 
                   on the back rent.

     Nell watches Jane's little boy, RICHIE.  Unpacified by the 
     cartoons on the TV, he plows a plastic tank across a shelf through 
     neat rows of delicate PORCELAIN DOLLS.

                               NELL
                   I'm not going to stay.  I'll get a 
                   job.  I'll get my own apartment.

     Richie knocks a porcelain DOLL off, and it breaks all over the 
     carpet.  His parents don't notice.  But Nell feels it in the soul.  
     Richie stops.  A long beat.  He looks at her, insolent, then plows 
     on with his tank.

                               JANE
                   Nell.  A job?  Two months and
                   where is this job?  You have no
                   degree, you've never worked --

     Nell explodes in outraged fury, startling us.

                               NELL
                   -- I've never worked? --

                               JANE
                   You have no experience in the
                   world... the regular world.  What 
                   would you put on a resume?
                          (beat, softening)
                   Now we all appreciate what you did 
                   for Mother.  Isn't that right, 
                   Lou?

                               LOU
                   Eleven years.  Long time.

                               JANE
                   That's why we've been talking.
                   With me getting more time in
                   Accessories, and Lou at the shop 
                   all day, we need somebody to take 
                   care of Richie, do a little 
                   cleaning and cooking.  And in 
                   return you can have the extra 
                   room.

     She goes to Lou, puts a hand on his shoulder, proud of her 
     generosity.  All Nell can do is stare.

     And then: KNOCK KNOCK.  Like a shot Nell is out of the chair and
     turning for a set of FRENCH DOORS across the room.  It's all 
     reflex.  Nell catches herself.

     KNOCK KNOCK.  Richie, lying on the couch like he's sick, raps on 
     the wall with a wooden CANE and squeals:

                               RICHIE
                   Eleanor, help me!  I've got to 
                   pee!

     Nell REACTS, but rather than being amused or annoyed, a wave of 
     TRAUMA flickers over her face.  The reaction is so strong we 
     instantly know something is very wrong.

                               LOU
                   Richie, knock it off before I beat 
                   the crap out of you!

     Nell turns away, sick, breathing hard.

     Jane picks up a JEWELRY BOX from a dresser.

                               JANE
                   You're sure this is all of 
                   Mother's jewelry?  The lawyer said 
                   to make sure we took it to him...
                          (beat)
                   He said there might be some 
                   antique pieces.  Have you seen
                   anything?  Some of it might be
                   valuable.

     Nell knows what is going to happen to that jewelry.  Jane no longer 
     can bear the weight of Nell's stare, checks her watch.  She nods at 
     Lou.  Lou rises, pocketing the coin set.  Richie follows him out.

                               JANE (cont'd)
                   Think about our offer, Nell.  You 
                   don't know how hard it is out 
                   there.

     INT. NELL'S KITCHEN - DAY

     Nell rams through the door into the small kitchen, spotless, empty.
     And then bursts into tears.  Shaking, she digs in her back pocket 
     and pulls out a FINE FILIGREE NECKLACE.  Her mother's.  It's from 
     an age gone by.

     Clutching the necklace, she goes back out the door.

     INT. LIVING ROOM, NELL'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Nell crosses the living room straight for the closed French doors, 
     the glass obscured by gauze curtains.  She throws them open and 
     enters --

     INT. SICK ROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- what once was a dining room.  Transformed into a sick room.  
     Drawn shades.  Dim.  The first traces of dust.

     Nell lingers in the doorway a beat, daunted.

     A perfectly made bed.  The PILLOW, however retains the IMPRESSION 
     of a head.  Lodged between the bed and a nightstand, a CANE.  On 
     the opposite side of the bed is a plastic toilet.  I.V. stand.  
     Shrouded white shapes.

     On the wall above the bed, a framed needlepoint counsels: A PLACE 
     FOR EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE.  A bit of wisdom.  A way 
     to live a life.

     A way Nell has lived for too long.  Seeing it galvanizes her into
     movement.  She goes to an old armoire, a medicine chest, opens it,
     removes a BOTTLE OF TYLENOL WITH CODEINE and marches out.

     INT. LIVING ROOM, NELL'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Nell closes the doors on the chamber of horrors, exhales.  She has 
     been holding her breath.

     INT. NELL'S KITCHEN - DAY

     Nell sits at her tiny kitchen table, water glass and Tylenol in 
     front of her.  The necklace dangles from her fingers.  She stares, 
     mesmerized by it.  Then she undoes the hasp.  The clothes line 
     outside BATTERS louder --

     -- and, defiant, Nell puts the necklace on.  She closes her eyes.

     Silence.  The battering has stopped.  A BEAT.  And then the PHONE 
     RINGS.  Nell opens her eyes.  The phone RINGS.  Keeps ringing.  
     Nell, feeling the drug, finds her way to the phone and picks up.

                               NELL
                   Hello?  Yes, this is Eleanor.
                   -- Where?  Yes, it's right here.

     Nell listens for a long moment.  She picks up the classifieds, 
     flips through.  And there it is:

                         TROUBLE SLEEPING?

     WANTED - RESEARCH SUBJECTS.  $900.00/.WEEK + RM.&BD. @ BEAUTIFUL 
     OLD HOUSE IN BERKSHIRES.  PSYCHOLOGY STUDY.

     END MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

     INT. PSYCH OBSERVATION LAB - DAY

     The lab feels more like the video center of a security office than 
     a psychologist's laboratory.  Two banks of black and white monitors 
     give us images of men and women, different ages, different races, 
     wired to electrodes.  They are taking psychological tests, although 
     we never see the Testers.  The subjects are working through 
     variations on object manipulation and pattern recognition tests.  
     There are subtle differences between the two banks of monitors.  On 
     the left, the subjects are all twitching at exactly the same time, 
     on the right, the subjects are also twitching, but in no 
     discernible sequence.  The subjects on the left are better able to 
     concentrate on their tasks.  The subjects on the right keep 
     stopping, and going over what they have done.

     Two men, MALCOLM KEOGH, in his 50's, is a graying professor, the 
     head of the department; someone we trust.

     He faces PROFESSOR JAMES MARROW.  He is a man whose confidence 
     rests uneasily on his ambition, and in the tension between the two 
     is the power that makes him the teacher students love.  Right now, 
     though, he is defending himself before a Department Review.  This 
     is not a court martial with judges behind a desk, it's more free 
     form.

     The men are having a fight, and they are watched by OTHER 
     PROFESSORS.

                               MALCOLM
                   It's still an electric shock!

                               MARROW
                   Come on Malcolm, it's only seven
                   ohms, it's nothing, it's like a
                   joy buzzer!  And it's not about
                   the pain, it's about the
                   interference with concentration...

     Malcolm looks at the monitor.  This is Marrow's chance to explain 
     it again.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Look, look at what it does!  The 
                   subjects on the left, because they 
                   anticipate the shocks, make the 
                   adjustment, and lose nothing on 
                   their scores.  The subjects on the 
                   right, because the shocks are 
                   random, can't anticipate, and the 
                   distraction throws them off.

                               MALCOLM
                   Stop defending your science after 
                   the fact, Jim.  The department 
                   protocol for research is very 
                   clear about this, and you violated 
                   the rules.  I know, I know, I know 
                   that "Fear and Performance" is a 
                   big sexy idea, but as long as I'm 
                   chairman here you will need this 
                   department's endorsement to 
                   publish it, and right now I can't 
                   do that.

     At this moment, MARY LAMBRETTA, late 20's, Marrow's pretty T.A., 
     opens the door with an armload of files.  Whatever else she's 
     wearing, she wears glasses.  Marrow, seeing her, motions for her to 
     go away.  He doesn't break eye contact with Malcolm.  Mary 
     hesitates...

                               MARROW
                   Malcolm, this is essential work 
                   I'm doing.  Just think what my 
                   research can do for education.  
                   Elementary school classrooms near 
                   train tracks or airports, where 
                   loud noise is random; this helps 
                   to prove the need for sound 
                   insulation if the children are 
                   ever going to learn to read.

                               MALCOLM
                   And that will be a good place to 
                   end this study.

                               MARROW
                   No, Malcolm!  Individual 
                   performance is only part of it.  I 
                   know why baseball players choke 
                   for no reason, I know why 
                   violinists throw up with fear 
                   before every concert, and need to, 
                   to give a great performance, but 
                   what I want to know is, how fear 
                   works in a group...

                               MALCOLM
                   Not the way you've constructed 
                   your group, it's just not ethical!

                               MARROW
                   But if the group knows it's being 
                   studied as a group, you 
                   contaminate the results.  The 
                   deception is minor.

     Malcolm sees Mary Lambretta.

                               MALCOLM
                   Are you working with her?

                               MARROW
                   Mary, I'll meet you outside.

     She understands, and she closes the door.

                               MALCOLM
                   Why are you working with her?  
                   Mary Lambretta was thrown out of 
                   the department for trying to get a 
                   Ph.D. in psychic studies.

                               MARROW
                   And after she was thrown out, she 
                   needed a job.

                               MALCOLM
                   You don't believe in the 
                   paranormal.

                               MARROW
                   No, but she does, and that's all 
                   that matters.

                               MALCOLM
                   Does she know that's why you're 
                   using her?

                               MARROW
                   No.

                               MALCOLM
                   I, I just can't...

                               MARROW
                   She needed a job, Malcolm.  And 
                   she's smart.  And she helps me.

                               MALCOLM
                   I have a bad feeling about what 
                   you're doing.

                               MARROW
                   This is the last chapter.  Please, 
                   please give me clearance.  It's 
                   for science.

     Marrow waits.

                               MALCOLM
                   I'm gonna hate myself for this.

     But he nods.  Permission granted.

                               MARROW
                   Thank you.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LAB - DAY

     They open the door.  They walk out.  Mary is there.  She closes her 
     eyes, and does a gypsy voice.

                               MARY
                   I see a hostile man... he's (she 
                   describes him).  The hostile man 
                   does not believe in Madame Velka.

     This relieves the pressure.  Malcolm is not listening anymore and
     storms off.

                               MARY
                   You know what he's really upset 
                   about?

                               MARROW
                   What?

                               MARY
                   You're going to publish, he's 
                   going to perish... And why did you 
                   hire me for this?

     Marrow has a sly smile.  They go into his office through another 
     door in the lab.

     INT. MARROW'S OFFICE - DAY

     Long, narrow, badly lit, it's filled with filing cabinets, stacks 
     of unread textbooks still in publisher's plastic, a desk with 
     computer.  As soon as they enter, Mary looks at the phone.

                               MARY
                   It's for you.

     And then the phone rings.  He doesn't pick it right up, he lets it
     ring.

                               MARROW
                   You hear the vibrations in the 
                   wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in 
                   the wires, you feel it.  I could 
                   test it.

                               MARY
                   Test it.

     The phone still rings.  Marrow answers.

                               MARROW
                   Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.

                               MARY
                   How'd I know it was for you?

                               MARROW
                          (quickly)
                   Because it's my phone.
                          (back to the phone)
                   Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the 
                   boxes inside, thank you.  See you 
                   soon.  Thank you.

     He hangs up.

     Marrow is trying to read the first file as he goes to his desk.  
     Mary shows him a huge CORKBOARD covered with photos, articles, and 
     various items.

                               MARY
                   Here's how they're organized.  
                   Groups of five, very different 
                   personalities: scored all over the 
                   Kiersey Temperament Sorter just 
                   like you asked for.  And they all 
                   score high on the insomnia charts.

                               MARROW
                   Good.

     A PHOTO OF NELL falls on the floor.  Marrow scoops it up.  He holds 
     the photo of Nell up to Mary, and look at the written notes and 
     studies the graphs that go with it.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   This is correct?

                               MARY
                   Her mother died two months ago.  
                   She says she really wants to do 
                   this.  I didn't know if it'd be 
                   taking advantage...

     Marrow considers the lonely image for a long moment and then looks 
     at the graph of her test scores.

                               MARROW
                          (meaning the graph,
                           not the face)
                   What a beautiful profile.  How do 
                   you feel about her?  What does 
                   your intuition say?

     Mary balks at his teasing.

                               MARY
                   I put my favorites on the top.

     Marrow continues to study the files.

                               MARROW (OC)
                   Okay... this one's good... 
                   Extrovert Feeler... Okay... This 
                   one I like, too...

     We don't pay as much attention now to the cork board as to other
     images on the wall.  We find clinical-looking shots from Stanley
     Milgram's experiments: subjects appearing to scream in response to
     electrical shock.

     Rows of weeping prisoners in the Stanford prison experiment.

     Photos of victims crushed under the stands of a soccer stadium, the
     aftermath of a riot.  A picture of the Fuhrer before his mesmerized
     masses.  Mary opens a large envelope.  She takes out a photograph 
     that we can't see.

                               MARY
                   What's this?
                          (has to get his
                           attention)
                   What's this... this picture?

                               MARROW
                   That?  That's Hill House.

                               MARY
                   This is where we're going?

                               MARROW
                   Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?

     Mary studies the picture, and she can't answer him.  In her 
     glasses, we get the thinnest reflection of the photograph, a 
     glimpse of dark brick and high chimneys.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Nell, in a rust-wormed old Buick, glances from the road to 
     computer-drawn DIRECTIONS TO HILL HOUSE.  She HUMS A TUNE, soft, 
     lonely, like a lullaby but eerie, off-key.

     EXT. ROUTE 39 - DAY

     The car speeds down the country road, past old stone walls, out 
     into rolling meadow, its winding route taking it across the western
     Berkshires, farther and farther into the glorious hills.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Countryside speeds by.  She passes an antique store in a barn.  A
     handpainted sign warns MELBY'S APPLE FARM 100 YARDS.  Nell grabs 
     for the window handle, letting in air.

     She snorts, smelling, breathing like it was the first time in her
     life... sounding like a pig.  And it makes her burst out in
     embarrassing, animal laughter.

     EXT. HILLSDALE - DAY (ESTABLISHING)

     The white-steepled church, five stores and gas station of Hillsdale
     lie in a forgotten notch in the hills.

     EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

     Nell is pumping gas at a country station.  She is alone at the 
     pump.  As she finishes, she hears a BABY CRYING.  She looks up.  
     She is immediately drawn by the sound.

     She moves to a car at another pump.  The car is empty.  The windows 
     are rolled up.  She peers into the car, through the window, and 
     sees a toddler in a car seat.  The child is crying.  Nell looks 
     around, no one is there.  She makes faces at the baby, coos to it.

                               NELL
                   Hello Baby...

     She does a peek-a-boo game, and the baby stops crying, the baby 
     even starts to giggle.

     A VOICE from behind.

                               MOTHER (O.S.)
                   What's going on, what happened?

     Nell turns.  The Mother is a busy country mom, arms filled with 
     stuff from the gas station's market.

                               NELL
                   She's okay.  She woke up and she 
                   saw she was alone.

     The mother has the car open and the baby is smiling now.

                               MOTHER
                   Say thank you, Spencer.
                          (too much of an
                           explanation)
                   I was getting her something to 
                   drink.  She's been crying all 
                   day...

                               NELL
                   That's all right.

                               MOTHER
                   Of course you know, how many 
                   children do you have?

                               NELL
                   None.

                               MOM
                   Then you're a teacher.  Nursery 
                   school.

                               NELL
                   No.

                               MOM
                   You just... you seem like someone 
                   who takes care of children, lots 
                   of children.

                               NELL
                   Maybe... maybe someday.  I'd like 
                   that.

     The woman smiles in something like sympathy, and gets in her car.  
     When she does, we see a friendly GAS STATION ATTENDANT appear 
     behind Nell.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Umm, I'm a little lost.

                               GAS STATION ATTENDANT
                   Where you going?

     Nell takes out her computer drawn directions and an old map.

                               NELL
                   They sent me directions and I've 
                   got a map, but it's kind of 
                   confusing.  Here... it's a place 
                   called Hill House?

     His helpful attitude changes dramatically.

                               GAS STATION ATTENDANT
                   Hill House.

     He takes the map book and tears out the page and crumples it up.

                               NELL
                   What are you doing?

                               GAS STATION ATTENDANT
                   You don't want to go there.

     He turns abruptly and walks away.

                               NELL
                   Did I say something wrong to you?

     Nell slams the Buick door, and breathing hard, starts the engine.  
     She gets control, and puts the car in gear.  She's shaken.  Badly.

     EXT. COUNTRY LANE - DAY

     Nell's Buick bounces over a country road.  The car works its way up
     into the steep, switchbacking hills.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Nell looks out at the forest, feels a chill.  The road is more like 
     a tunnel through the forest than a road.

     EXT. HILLS - DAY

     Nell's car speeds through the trees, climbing the hills, higher and
     higher into the awesome solitude.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Nell takes a final switchback, and something off to the right 
     catches her eye, then is gone in the trees.  She watches again for 
     it.  There.  A glimpse of a gray stone property wall set back 
     twenty yards from the road.

     There it is again.  Moss-greened, twenty feet high, a wicked array 
     of iron spikes and glass mortared atop it.

     And then out of the tangled forest in front of her looms a pair of
     immense stone pillars.  Between them, a steel GATE as high as the 
     wall, chained and padlocked.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE GATE - DAY

     The gate stands immense.  Silent.  Forbidding.  Beyond them a 
     gravel drive curves away through the trees.  Nell kills her car, 
     gets out, instructions in hand.  No one in sight.  A long beat.  
     She reaches in and blows the HORN.

     The HORN shatters the air, rackets off the trees beyond the gate,
     echoing.  Silence.

     Nell blows the HORN a sustained staccato in annoyance.  The echo
     replies in a terrible, deafening battering of sound.  Nell covers 
     her ears.  Silence once again.

     In a fit of agitation she goes to the padlock and rattles it.  It's
     locked good.  She turns --

     -- and there is a man right behind her.  It is MR. DUDLEY, his hair
     tied back like an ex-hippie.  He stands between Nell and her open
     car door, weed spear in hand.  He smiles at her -- rough, dirty,
     massive.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   What do you want?

                               NELL
                   Oh!  You scared me.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Me?  No.  What are you doing here?

                               NELL
                   Are you Mister Dudley, the
                   caretaker?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the 
                   caretaker.  What are you doing 
                   here?

                               NELL
                   I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm 
                   supposed to check in with Mrs. 
                   Dudley up at the house.  Is she 
                   here?

     She hands him the directions.  He glances at them.  She uses the
     distraction to get into her car.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Maybe she is...

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Nell looks at the gate, some part of her aware it's a point of no-
     return.  Mr. Dudley eases over to her window.  Mr. Dudley gives her 
     one last look and goes to the gate.  He produces a keyring and 
     undoes the padlock.

                               NELL
                   Why do you need a chain like that?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   That's a good question.  What is 
                   it about fences?  Sometimes a 
                   locked chain makes people on both 
                   sides of the fence just a little 
                   more comfortable.  Why would that 
                   be?

     He unwinds the enormous chain, heavy turn after heavy turn.  The 
     gates swing in, revealing HILL HOUSE.

                               NELL
                   Is there something about the 
                   house?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.

     Grinning, Dudley steps aside and Nell rolls through.  And at that 
     he just grins wider.  Nell pulls away.  Disturbed, she watches him 
     in the rearview mirror.  She turns and in front of her sprawls Hill 
     House.  At center, the features of the oldest part of the House 
     dwarf all others: towering, eye-like windows and the jaws of a 
     Grand Entry with carved ebony doors.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY - DAY

     The car rumbles up the drive toward the carport.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Nell stops the car in front of the entrance, right inside the 
     carport.  In the silence all we can hear is her breathing.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE - DAY

     Her car sits in front of the house, tiny, alone.  Its brake lights 
     go off.

     The finger-like pillars of the car port seem like a hand pinning 
     the car in place under the House's gaze.

     Nell gets out of the car.

     Nell stares, daunted... yet there is something about the House.  A
     romance in its lilac heavy Gothic decay.  Nell feels it, is drawn 
     to it.

     EXT. GRAND ENTRY - DAY

     Nell, suitcase in hand, climbs the steps to the front doors.  On 
     closer inspection, the snaking shapes of the carved doors depict a 
     Garden of Eden.  At center on the knocker, a tarnished silver Adam 
     takes the forbidden fruit from his counterpart Eve.

     Nell lifts Adam and knocks heavily.  There is no answer.  Nell 
     looks around for some sign of life.

     Off to one side is a LADDER and PAINT CANS.  Somebody must've been
     touching up the window trim.

     When she looks back the door is AJAR a fraction of an inch.

                               NELL
                   Hello?  Hello?  Mrs. Dudley?  Mrs. 
                   Dudley, are you here?  Anybody?

     Tentative, she pushes it open into --

     INT. GRAND ENTRY - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- a vast entry towering away to a ceiling lost in shadow far 
     above.  Rays of light filter through floor-to-ceiling curtains.  
     Doors lead off in a half dozen directions.

     Every piece of woodwork or plaster in the house is carved, 
     filigreed, painted or ornamented in wild, ornate fashion.  It 
     overwhelms the eye.

                               NELL
                   Wow...

     She turns around, sets her suitcase on the marble floor.  A short
     hallway straight ahead seems to let onto some vast space, dimly 
     lit.

     And then Nell hears a SOUND.  Carrying through the empty halls from
     some distant place: a low, plaintive MOAN.

     Nell freezes.  The MOANING stops.  Nell strains her ears.  And then 
     the MOAN again.  It comes from the short hallway ahead.  Nell 
     starts for it.  The Moan stops.

     INT. HALL FROM ENTRY TO GREAT HALL - DAY

     Nell moves down the hall.  It's dim, stale, lined with pier tables,
     candelabra.

                               NELL
                   Hello?  Hello?  Mrs. Dudley?

     Her voice echoes from the room beyond.  She follows her own voice
     into --

     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- A long, oval great hall.  Passages and doors lead off in all
     directions to God-knows-where.  A double-grand staircase at the far 
     end ascends to a landing shrouded in darkness before turning up the 
     next floor.  Magnificent ANIMAL HEADS carved on the newel posts 
     glare at her.

     Nell makes her way past clusters of furniture, stops at the center.
     Silence.  An ENORMOUS FIREPLACE dominates one wall.  Large enough 
     to stand in.  An iron mesh SCREEN hangs in its mouth.  Mantle and 
     chimney rise in dark, baroque masonry, becoming lost in the shadows 
     above.

     The MOANING sound.  Nell spins away from the fireplace.  The sound 
     rises from the door at the very back of the hall.  Nell takes a 
     step toward it.

                               NELL
                   Mrs. Dudley?

     She moves up to the door, puts a hand out to it.  The MOANING 
     rises. Nell pushes through --

     INT. 1ST FLOOR HALLWAY TOWARDS KITCHEN - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- into a much narrower, curving hallway.  Doors all along it.  The
     sound comes from the door right there across from the one Nell just
     came through.  She flings it open --

     INT. KITCHEN - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- and comes through into a vast kitchen.  A woman in black with 
     her back to Nell stands at a counter.  The moaning comes from a
     disreputable old CAN OPENER.

     Nell breaths, feels stupid.  The woman senses her, turns from her 
     cans of potatoes.  She is MRS. DUDLEY, sallow, unsmiling.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   It's make the soup or answer the 
                   door.  Can't do both.

                               NELL
                   Mrs. Dudley.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   So far.

     Mrs. Dudley wipes her hands, regards Nell, nods.

                               NELL
                   I'm Eleanor Vance, I'm with --

                               MRS.  DUDLEY
                   -- Dr. Marrow's group.  You're the 
                   first.

     Mrs. Dudley just stares with her sunken face.  It unsettles Nell.

                               MRS. DUDLEY (cont'd)
                   I'll show you your room.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY/MEZZANINE - DAY

     Mrs. Dudley glides up the stairs.  Nell follows, hoisting her 
     suitcase after her.  It appears the mezzanine ahead leads to a 
     hallway.  But as we draw closer what we thought was a hallway is an 
     ENORMOUS OIL PAINTING.  In it stands a man, his features lost in 
     the shadows above, only his body visible.

     The nameplate reads HUGH CRAIN.

                               NELL
                   Hugh Crain.

     Nell looks up: Mrs. Dudley waits coldly at the top of the stairs.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - DAY

     Mrs. Dudley leads Nell down a curved hallway, over aged Persian
     carpets and turns to a door on her left.  She throws it open, 
     stands back.  Nell enters.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - DAY

     Nell lowers her suitcase.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   The Purple Room.  You're going to 
                   be the first visitors that Hill 
                   House has had since Mister Crain 
                   died.

     The room is spacious, in a rococo gothic style with low-relief
     woodwork on the walls rising to a dark, coffered, ceiling of carved
     ivory.  A king-size bed, furniture, all in blue purple.  An open 
     door gives a glimpse of a bathroom.

     A large fireplace dominates one wall.  Its mantle is carved with 
     the faces of children, happy, at play, alive.  Nell touches the 
     wood, loving.

                               NELL
                   They're so beautiful.  Aren't 
                   they?

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.

                               NELL
                   Well, I've never lived with 
                   beauty.  You must love working 
                   here.

     Mrs. Dudley peers at her.  A beat.  And then, cryptic:

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   It's a job.  I keep banker's 
                   hours.  I set dinner on the dining 
                   room sideboard at six.  You can 
                   serve yourselves.  Breakfast is 
                   ready at nine.  I don't wait on 
                   people.  I don't stay after 
                   dinner.  Not after it begins to 
                   get dark.  I leave before dark 
                   comes.  We live in town.  Nine 
                   miles.  So there won't be anyone 
                   around if you need help.  We 
                   couldn't even hear you, in the 
                   night.

                               NELL
                   Why would we --

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   -- no one could.  No one lives any 
                   nearer than town.  No one will 
                   come any nearer than that.  In the 
                   night.  In the dark.

     And with that Mrs. Dudley grins, rictus-like.  She turns and closes 
     the door after her.

     Nell stands there a long moment, the room silent, heavy, old.  She 
     goes to the windows, peers out.  Nothing but forest for miles.  The
     sun is setting.

     Nell removes her windbreaker, opens her suitcase, takes out a 
     blouse and skirt.  Decent enough clothes, but cheap, the tags still 
     on them.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - DAY

     Nell emerges from her room in her new clothes.  The hallway curves 
     away into the distance, lined with massive, ornate doorframes like 
     the one to her room.

     Trying to get a better look, Nell searches the walls for a light
     switch, but can't find one.  She follows the chair rail back to --

     INT. MEZZANINE - SUNSET (CONTINUOUS)

     -- the mezzanine at the top of the stairs.  She searches in vain 
     for a light switch there.  Finally she spots a set of curtains and 
     slings them open.

     The light, late-day though it is, makes her wince.  The window 
     looks down on the driveway.  Outside a BEIGE CAR crunches over the 
     gravel.  Somebody else has arrived.

     Nell watches the car move past, trying to get a glimpse of the 
     driver, but from up here, all she can see is roof.

                               NELL
                   Finally.

     She backs away from the window, spins around --

     -- and out of the darkness, powerful, mad, looms the visage of Hugh
     Crain.  It is the painting.  It is only from up here on the second 
     floor with this curtain open that the FACE is visible in the late-
     day sunlight.

     Despite the artist's discretion, the lines in the man's skin, his
     eyes, his posture, cry of unspeakable sickness.

     Unconsciously, Nell takes a step back.  In the far b.g., near the 
     end of one of the halls, a DOOR stands open, the second or third 
     set of doors in the Gothic Hallway left of the painting.  Just as 
     it starts to come into view, and we're starting to see it, it 
     swings silently shut.

     But Nell has caught the movement out of the corner of her eye.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - DAY

     Nell stares down the long hallway.  Which door was it?

                               NELL
                   Hello?

     No response.  She starts down the hall, slow at first, then faster.

     She passes door after door, shadow after shadow, and as she nears 
     the end of the hall... there is no door here.  Not within 20 feet 
     of, where we thought we just saw it.

     A WHISPER.  VOICES.  Nell backs away.  And then LAUGHTER.  Behind 
     her.  It's coming from another stairwell.  Very real... and very 
     human.

     INT. BACK STAIRWAY - DAY

     Nell looks down from the top of the stairs.  Below Mrs. Dudley and
     THEO, 20s, exotic, sophisticated, in Vera Wang leather, wrestle with
     a pile of designer luggage.  Theo peers up.  She's dark, sexy in an
     amused, worldly way: someone who has seen and done it all.

                               THEO
                   You may think I have a sickness 
                   about packing, but asking people 
                   to help me shlep the stuff I take 
                   with me everywhere is a cheap and 
                   exploitative way of making new 
                   friends.  My name's Theo.

     Theo foists a very heavy bag off on Mrs. Dudley who looks like she's
     been handed a snake.  That makes Nell smile.  She comes running down 
     to help with the bags.

                               NELL
                   I'm Eleanor but everyone calls me 
                   Nell.  Eleanor Vance.  Nell.  I'm 
                   really glad you're here.  Really.

     Theo is a little thrown by Nell's gushing.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   What a beautiful jacket.

     Theo looks her over... and understands.  Nell is desperate to be 
     liked.

                               THEO
                   And what you're wearing, that's 
                   great, too.

                               NELL
                   This?  It's from a thrift shop.

                               THEO
                   What did it cost?

                               NELL
                   Fifteen dollars.

                               THEO
                   That'd be seventy in New York.  
                   You stole it!

                               NELL
                          (embarrassed by the 
                           simple truth)
                   It's all I could afford.

                               THEO
                   Wait.  You're not wearing that 
                   ironically?  This is really you?

                               NELL
                   I don't know what you mean.

     Mrs. Dudley, walking ahead, looks back at them.  Then continues up. 
     Theo makes a face at Mrs. Dudley's back.  Nell smiles, a little.

                               THEO
                   A week.  You and I?  We're going 
                   to have fun.

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - DAY

     Mrs. Dudley opens the door, letting Theo and Nell into a large 
     bedroom, a mirror-image twin of Nell's room, except it's decorated 
     in rich red-orange velvets.

                               THEO
                   This is so twisted.

     She dumps her stuff on the floor, grabs a banister on the four-
     poster bed, swings cat-like onto its high mattress.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   I set dinner on the dining room 
                   sideboard at six.

     Mrs. Dudley lays Theo's suitcase on a luggage stand.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   Breakfast is at nine.  I don't 
                   stay after dinner.  Not after it 
                   begins to get dark.

     Theo, back to Mrs.  Dudley, rolls her eyes at Nell.

                               MRS. DUDLEY (cont'd)
                   I leave, before dark.  So there 
                   won't be anyone around if you need 
                   help.

                               NELL
                   We couldn't even hear you.

     Mrs. Dudley looks up at Nell who mimics her scary smile.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   No one could.  No one lives any 
                   nearer than town.

                               NELL
                   No one will come any nearer than 
                   that.

     Mrs. Dudley smiles at Nell, but it's softer than before.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   In the night.  In the dark.

     Theo leans on the bed, musing at the exchange.  And then Mrs. Dudley
     backs out of the room, shuts the door.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   My room is right next door.  I 
                   think we share a bathroom.

     Theo has an interesting eye on Nell, she's studying her.

                               THEO
                   Don't worry, I probably won't be 
                   in here much.  Light sleeper.

                               NELL
                   That's why we're here.

                               THEO
                   What do you do?

                               NELL
                   I'm between jobs right now.  My 
                   last job... it... the person I was 
                   working for... the job ended.  
                   Over.  So... And you?

                               THEO
                   That depends.

     Theo pops a dress bag on the bed, unzips it.  Theo takes off her 
     coat, and is only wearing a black bra underneath.  Nell reacts, 
     turns away.  Back to the camera, Theo flicks off her bra, stretches.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   I'm supposed to be an artist, but 
                   I've been really distracted from 
                   work by love.  Do you know what I 
                   mean?

                               NELL
                   Not really.

                               THEO
                   Don't tell me Boston is different 
                   from New York.

                               NELL
                          (she knows this 
                           from magazines)
                   Ohh, sure, you have trouble with
                   commitment.

                               THEO
                   My boyfriend thinks so, my 
                   girlfriend doesn't.  If we could 
                   all live together... but... they 
                   hate each other.  It's hard to be 
                   Miss Perversity when you're the 
                   only one at the party.  D'you know 
                   what I mean?

                               NELL
                   No.

                               THEO
                          (delighted)
                   A blank canvas!  I could paint 
                   your portrait, directly on you.  
                   Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands?  
                   Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where 
                   do you live?

                               NELL
                   I don't have anyone.
                          (beat, lying)
                   But I do have a little apartment 
                   of my own.  It has a little flower 
                   garden.  You can just see the 
                   ocean.  At night, when the wind 
                   comes in just right, you can hear 
                   the buoys in the harbor.

     Nell peeks, sees Theo is decent, turns around.

                               THEO
                   That sounds really nice.  You're 
                   lucky.  But you know that.

     Theo comes over, straightens Nell's seams; this is an intimate,
     forward gesture.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                          (with meaning)
                   Come on, we've seen enough of the 
                   bedroom for now.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - DUSK

     The long hall is lost in shadow, its long rows of doors waiting in 
     the deadening silence.  A lamp on a pier table casts a small pool of 
     light.  The walls glow in rich tones, the low-relief carvings a 
     worm's-wood of shadow.

     Nell runs her hand over a wall panel as Theo peeks into a 
     neighboring room.

                               NELL
                   So much carving.  It's everywhere.  
                   On everything.

     Theo starts down the hall.  Nell follows.

     INT. RED PARLOR - DUSK

     Nell and Theo enter a room just off the landing, a lavish parlor 
     with the omnipresent panelled walls, lush red carpet, velvet 
     curtains sweeping floor to ceiling, heavy pieces of furniture.  Nell 
     watches Theo explore.  As Theo moves through the room, Nell's eye 
     lands on another painting of Hugh Crain.  Inside it's ornate golden 
     framework, distinctive little cherubs are embedded.  Cherubs of 
     Death... She runs her fingers over it.

                               THEO
                   Maybe you shouldn't touch --

     Theo twirls out of the room, Nell, anxious, behind her.

     INT. MEZZANINE - DUSK

     As they come out of Crain's study Theo stops at the top of the 
     stairs, Nell behind her.

                               THEO
                   Jeez.

                               NELL
                   I know.

     They stare out at Hugh Crain, the cracking and shadowing of the 
     swirls of oil that compose his face.  The figure is daunting, but 
     dead.  Just a painting.  Four different hallways lead into the 
     mezzanine, all dark and endless in the stray light.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Maybe we should wait for them 
                   here.

     Theo walks out, swings around.

                               THEO
                   Which one?  Pick any.

     Nell looks from one to another.  She doesn't want to.  But she 
     forces a smile and points to one on the left.  They both disappear 
     into the dark gothic hallway.

     INT. SMALL PARLOR (CONFUSING ROOMS) - DUSK

     Theo breezes into a small parlor with heavy green velvet curtains,
     panelled walls, rich settees.  Other doors lead off the room.  Nell
     follows.

                               THEO
                   This is a serious question, but do 
                   you think the Dudleys ever make 
                   love in this room?  They're alone 
                   in the house, no one watching.  No 
                   one... no one watching.  You can 
                   do what you want.

     Theo goes running for another door and is out.

     Nell, realizing she's being left behind, springs after her into 
     another mysterious hallway --

     INT. STATUARY HALL - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

     -- into a wide hall lined with niches and classical statuary.  Theo
     strides down it pointing left and right, bending over, straddling 
     the pieces, provocative:

                               THEO
                   Here.  Here.  Here.
                          (under a leering 
                           gargoyle)
                   Oh yes!  Oh yes oh YES!  Here!

     Nell laughs -- appalled and loving every minute of it.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Can't you just see it?

                               NELL
                   Theo!

     INT. HALL OF MIRRORS - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

     Through a narrow passageway, and large double doors they suddenly
     stand at the threshold of a fantastic ballroom lined with mirrors 
     and chandeliers.  Rows of mirror-coated octagonal pillars, rise to a
     vaulted, mirrored ceiling far above.  With the door opening, there's 
     a CLICK, and a mechanism of some sort is activated.  The FLOOR 
     begins to MOVE like a slow turntable.

     Theo comes right up, looks over Nell's shoulder.  Nell steps out.

     She traipses out across the room, her million reflections waltzing
     with her into infinity.  Theo dances after her.  They dance, not 
     quite together.  Nell stops and pronounces:

                               NELL
                   I love this house.  I really love 
                   this house.

                               THEO
                          (gently, recognizes 
                           that Nell is 
                           different)
                   You're okay.

     Nell blushes... and they burst out laughing.  They take off running,
     their reflections with them, stampeding for an archway on the far 
     side of the room and out --

     INT. 1ST FLOOR HALLS (VARIOUS) - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

     -- into yet another hallway.  They race down the hall, turn into
     another hall, then another, all dimly lit by the very last rays of
     day, all furnished in the House's dark, impossibly complicated,
     impossibly ornate fashion.  As they go, the mood is growing darker, 
     the women unaware that they are getting lost.

                               THEO
                          (having fun)
                   Rats!  We're rats in a maze!
                   That's what this experiment is
                   going to be!

     They open a door to --

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

     They stand at the end of a long hallway to one of the House's
     forgotten outlying wings.  It is dark.  Too dark.  Nell and Theo 
     regard the darkness.

     At the far end of the hall stand a pair of MAHOGANY DOORS, closed,
     almost black, oily-looking.  Surrounding them, an enormously complex
     geometrical frieze.

     The doors themselves are plain.  In their simplicity there is 
     something about them enormously disturbing.  It is as if the doors 
     are looking back at them, Nell goes cold.  Theo holds herself.

                               NELL
                   We should go back.

     Theo nods.  They turn around, Theo opening what she thinks was the 
     door they came through.

     INT. NARROW STAIRCASE - DUSK

     They hurry down a narrow staircase, Theo first, Nell right behind.

                               NELL
                   Theo, I'm scared --

     They fly down a set of steps, Theo flings open a final door -- and
     SCREAMS!

     INT. GRAND ENTRY - NIGHT

     The Grand Entry, where they bump into LUKE SANDERSON, 20's, charming
     and cynical.

                               LUKE
                   Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, 
                   I'm your basic tosser-turner, and 
                   you are...

                               NELL
                   Uh... Nell Vance...

                               LUKE
                   And what kind of sleeper?

                               NELL
                   Well, I... uh...

                               LUKE
                   Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.
                          (to Theo)
                   And you?  I'd guess...

                               THEO
                   You'll never guess.

     She won't answer.

     Marrow comes in the front door.  He looks at the house like 
     MacArthur studying a beachhead.

                               MARROW
                   There we are.  You're Eleanor, 
                   you're Luke, you're Theo.

                               ALL
                   Hi... hello... Dr. Marrow...

                               MARROW
                   And this is Todd, he just came up.

     TODD comes in.

                               TODD
                   Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.

                               LUKE
                          (1950's alien 
                           spaceman)
                   Greetings fellow insomniac.

                               TODD
                          (playing)
                   Greetings fellow sheep counter.

                               MARROW
                   And this is my assistant, Mary 
                   Lambretta.

                               LUKE
                   Greetings.

     And Mary enters.  Crossing the threshold, she catches her breath, 
     and when she comes into the hall and sees everyone, she also sees 
     the house in its detail.  And she has a bad feeling.

     Marrow is still putting everyone at ease.

                               MARROW
                   Eleanor, how was the drive?

                               NELL
                   You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.

                               MARROW
                   Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.

                               NELL
                   I'm really... honored to be part 
                   of this study, Jim.

                               MARROW
                   Well... we're glad to have you.

     His smile is devastating.  Nell reddens, instantly taken by Marrow's
     warmth, observant sensitivity.  Theo notices.

                               MARROW
                   Have either of you seen David 
                   Watts?

                               THEO
                   No, but Nell's been here longer 
                   than I have.

                               NELL
                   I only saw Theo drive up.

                               LUKE
                   Who's Watts?

                               MARROW
                   The man who completes the group.

     For a long moment they stand there, silent, looking at each other --
     polite smiles, but awkward, even Marrow.  One by one they all look 
     to him for a cue.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Well, why don't we get some dinner 
                   while we're waiting for him?
                          (beat, backing 
                           through the doors 
                           to the Great Hall)
                   Welcome to Hill House, everyone.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Marrow leads the way across the hall.  The others check out the
     furnishings as they pass.

                               TODD
                   These old Victorian houses are 
                   great, aren't they?

                               LUKE
                          (points to details; 
                           ADJUST FOR SET)
                   It's not Victorian, everyone 
                   thinks that the whole nineteenth 
                   century was Victorian.  This is 
                   gothic, this is English Craftsman, 
                   this is Romanesque.  This is... 
                   insane.  Who lives here?

                               MARROW
                   Nobody.  A local mill owner, Hugh 
                   Crain, built it in 1830.  He had 
                   no heirs, but he put the house in 
                   trust, and the farmland around it, 
                   with the stipulation that it never 
                   be altered or sold.  Crain's 
                   executors made good investments 
                   and for the last hundred and 
                   twenty years, Hill House has taken 
                   care of itself.

     Mary is shaken by the house, but she's honoring Marrow's request.
     Everywhere she looks, she feels the presence of something.

                               TODD
                   So what's this study all about 
                   anyway?  Mary described the kind 
                   of tests we'll be doing, but 
                   didn't fill us in on the big 
                   picture.  She said you needed bad 
                   sleepers, but this wasn't about 
                   curing the problem.

                               MARY
                   I can tell you what this is about.

                               MARROW
                   Eat first, questions later, Mary, 
                   please.

     They exit the hall, Mary and Nell last, and as they do, Nell sees
     Mary's strange look.  She stops.

                               NELL
                   Is something wrong?

                               MARY
                   No.  Just... when I saw your 
                   picture I had a feeling about you, 
                   and now that I meet you, I know I 
                   was right.

                               NELL
                   What?

                               MARY
                   Eat first, questions later.

     And suddenly awkward, Mary exits after the others.

     INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     A chandelier hangs unlit over a long dining table.  LAUGHTER.  At 
     the end Nell and the others sprawl over the remains of a dinner 
     which has been going on for hours.  Luke is opening another bottle 
     of jug wine.

                               LUKE
                   You know what I love about wine 
                   that comes in bottles like this?

                               TODD
                   What?

                               LUKE
                   Every year is a good year.

                               MARROW
                   Theo?  It's your turn.

     Theo twirls her wine glass, licks the dregs inside the rim, 
     thinking.

                               THEO
                   The rest of you may hate your 
                   insomnia, but I find it the best 
                   time of the day for me.  I'm 
                   alone.  Nobody's talking to me but 
                   myself.  My mind is racing with 
                   ideas, and I can think.

                               LUKE
                   Nah, you're going crazy with 
                   doubt, all of your mistakes are 
                   coming back up the pipes, and it's 
                   worse than a nightmare. --

     Nell isn't used to people being so direct and at the same time,
     playful.  She glances at Marrow's LEFT HAND: NO WEDDING RING.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Excuse me.

                               LUKE
                   Don't give me that look, it's 
                   everybody's problem, we just have 
                   different variations, I for 
                   example.  I fall asleep easily.  
                   But I wake up around two or three 
                   in the morning, every morning.  
                   It's that time of night that 
                   Fitzgerald called the deep dark 
                   night of the soul.  I stare 
                   into... the abyss.  Every night.
                          (breaks his own 
                           somber mood)
                   It's the price I pay for being 
                   such a jolly fellow.
                          (to Mary)
                   Y usted?

                               MARY
                   I think I'd fall asleep easily, 
                   but just as I start to feel 
                   comfortable, I see things in the 
                   dark.

     Nell hears this, Nell is tuned into Mary.

                               MARY
                   I feel the presence of something 
                   watching me.  It's not... scary... 
                   not by itself but... I don't want 
                   to go to sleep because I'm worried 
                   about the thing attacking me.  So 
                   when I finally do fall asleep, I'm 
                   like a soldier who's fallen asleep 
                   at her post.  I feel like I've 
                   betrayed myself.  Nell?

     Nell wishes she could hide under her plate.

                               NELL
                   All of you have such interesting 
                   problems.

     There's laughter.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No... Please, I know how that 
                   sounds but... You're all so 
                   articulate.  You know how to talk.  
                   I feel like I'm here under false 
                   pretenses.  It's silly, it's not 
                   like... well, all of you have 
                   trouble sleeping because you live 
                   in the world, and the world is 
                   complicated and scary, but 
                   nothing's ever happened to me.  So 
                   I don't have a reason to sleep 
                   badly.

                               MARROW
                   You wrote that you had trouble 
                   sleeping.

                               NELL
                   Yes, because someone was always 
                   keeping me awake.  Ever since I 
                   was little.  That was my job.  I 
                   took care of my mother and I had 
                   to be there for her all night 
                   long, and she woke up all the 
                   time.  And after she died, well, 
                   it's been a few months, but I 
                   still, I still wake up, it's... a 
                   habit.
                          (beat)
                   I know we've only known each other 
                   a couple of hours, but I'm really 
                   glad to be with people who let me 
                   talk about this.  I'm really happy 
                   to be here with you.

     Silence.  The others are embarrassed by her sincerity.  She's right,
     Nell is not of their world.

                               MARROW
                   We're glad you're here.

     He says this with enough sympathy for Theo to see his interest in 
     the girl in the thrift shop dress.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Why don't we move to another room?

     INT. RED PARLOR - NIGHT

     The HARP sings out, lively, expertly played by Mary.  Theo, Luke, 
     Todd and Nell are impressed with her skill.

                               MARY
                   It's an Erard.  Late 1870s.

     She plays, and as she does, she's aware of the room, and the house,
     and she sees something in a curtain or the fireplace, or a window,
     something at the edge of perception.  She suddenly stops.

                               NELL
                   What's wrong?

                               MARY
                   The harp is out of tune.

     She finds a key and begins TIGHTENING the strings -- as Marrow bangs
     open the door, briefcase in one hand, CELL PHONE in the other.  He
     can't conceal his irritation.  Marrow removes folders from his
     briefcase, passes them around while she plays.  Nell again studies 
     the Cherub of Death on the spine of the leather bound books.

                               MARROW
                   I'll have to count David Watts as 
                   a no-show.  So let's start.  Thank 
                   you, Mary.

     That was a little abrupt, she feels it.  Everybody finds a chair or
     spot on the sofa.  Mary remains on the stool by the harp.  Marrow 
     sits in a large winged-back chair.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   All right?  So, to answer your 
                   earlier question, Todd, why are we 
                   here?  What do we all need in 
                   life, what are the basics?  We 
                   need food, we need water, we need 
                   sleep.  Sleep.  All of you resist 
                   it?  Why?  What does that mean?  
                   Why do we resist sleep?  My field 
                   of study is the individual's 
                   psychology of emotion and 
                   performance.

                               LUKE
                   So why did you need the Addam's 
                   Family mansion for a scientific 
                   test?

                               MARROW
                   I thought it best to be isolated, 
                   to be in a location with a 
                   definite sense of history, and I 
                   wanted to make sure that it wasn't 
                   so pleasant you'd all sleep too 
                   easily.  You'll be taking a 
                   variety of tests, none of them 
                   harmful, and you've got the house, 
                   the grounds, and each other to 
                   keep you company.

                               THEO
                   When do we take the tests?

                               MARROW
                   Every day.  Basically we'll be 
                   hanging out together like we have 
                   so far this evening.

     Nell and Theo are looking through their folders: sheets of paper,
     bizarre geometric puzzles.

                               MARROW
                   Also, there is no phone service to 
                   the House and no TV.  I have the 
                   cell phone for emergencies.  We'll 
                   begin the tests after breakfast 
                   tomorrow.  

     The others shuffle through papers, Nell and Todd intent on them, 
     Theo interested but not overly so, Luke, bored.

                               MARY
                   Dr. Marrow, what is this house?

     When she says this, we should be seeing her from an odd perspective,
     the house's POV.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   There was once a king who built a 
                   palace.  The King's name was Hugh 
                   Crain.  A hundred and thirty years 
                   ago, when the Merrimack Valley was 
                   the center of American industry, 
                   Hugh Crain made two hundred 
                   million dollars.  That's forty-
                   three billion dollars in today's 
                   money.  He could have anything he 
                   wanted.  And what he wanted, was 
                   Rene, his banker's beautiful 
                   daughter.  Rene, and a house 
                   filled with children.

                               NELL
                   All the carvings.

                               MARROW
                   But there's a sad catch to the 
                   story.

                               MARY
                   What happened?

                               MARROW
                   There were no children.  Rene 
                   died, and then Hugh Crain built
                   all of this, and then he died.  
                   His heart was broken.

     Nell shifts, looks at the house with a strange feeling.

                               NELL
                   That's so sad.

     This has been tense between them, a gunfight.  POP!  A LOG in the
     fireplace makes everyone jump.  Theo relishes it, but Nell shudders.

                               MARY
                   I think there's more to the story. 
                   This house has its own music, 
                   Doctor Marrow, I can play it for 
                   you, I can hear it.

     Mary plays, channeling unholy music from the house, from the walls,
     from the curtain, from the air.  Her fingers fly down the harp to 
     the THICKEST WIRE and --

     -- TANG!  Like a steel whip the wire SNAPS.

     Mary SCREAMS in pain.

                               MARY
                   My eye... oh... my eye... my 
                   eye... oh... No...

     The others leap up in shock.  Blood lines the wall behind her.  She
     clutches at her eye, more blood spilling out from between her 
     fingers.

                               TODD
                   Oh Jesus.

     Marrow and Theo rush over to her as she shrieks in pain.

     Todd is frozen, pale, like he's about to be sick.  Nell turns the 
     OTHER WAY, but not because she's scared -- she's searching for a 
     shot glass on a side table.

     Marrow wraps Mary in his arms.  Her shrieking becomes a terrified 
     but quieter wail.

                               MARROW
                   Mary, let me see your eye.

     Nell appears by his side with the glass.  Marrow pries Mary's hand 
     from her face.

     Blood flows freely from the eyelid, but her eye is intact.

                               NELL
                   Here, cover it.  Don't let her 
                   touch it.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

     Marrow slams the door on the passenger side of Todd's car.  Mary 
     sits there, moaning, glass covering her eye, blood spilling out 
     around the edges.  Luke is on her side of the car.

                               LUKE
                   Keep your head back, that's it.

     Todd opens his door.  Marrow hands him a key.

                               MARROW
                   Here's my key to the gate.  Call 
                   me the second you know anything.

     Todd takes it, jumps in.  The two men watch the car drive away.

                               LUKE
                   That could have been worse.

                               MARROW
                   Yeah.

     As they turn back, Marrow taps Luke.

                               MARROW
                   Luke, can I talk to you?

                               LUKE
                   Sure.

                               MARROW
                   Because... well, I know I can 
                   trust you.

                               LUKE
                   Why?

                               MARROW
                   I've read your tests.

     That was half a joke, and both men smile.  Now they're bonded.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   There's something... I... I didn't 
                   tell you everyth1ng about the 
                   house, and about Hugh Crain... but 
                   I'm asking you not to repeat it.

                               LUKE
                   I can keep a secret.

     They go in.  The house is outlined by the sky and clouds and the 
     moon.

     INT. MEZZANINE - NIGHT

     Luke catches up with Nell and Theo as he reaches the mezzanine.  The
     painting of Hugh Crain, barely visible in the shadows, looms right
     behind.

                               LUKE
                   He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh 
                   Crain was a monster.  He said that 
                   he was a brutal, horrible man.  He 
                   told me that Crain drove his 
                   workers to early deaths.  Crain 
                   had children chained to the looms 
                   in his mill.  And listen to this: 
                   his beautiful Rene killed herself.

                               THEO
                   And why didn't Marrow tell us?
                   Doesn't he trust women?  That 
                   fuck.

                               NELL
                          (she's thinking 
                           about the story, 
                           not Marrow)
                   A monster?  But he built this for 
                   the woman he loved, like the Taj 
                   Mahal.

                               THEO
                   The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it
                   was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell 
                   us?

                               LUKE
                   He's trying to protect the 
                   experiment.  Personally, I don't 
                   think he's got a large enough 
                   sample for valid results, but as 
                   long as the money's good, and the 
                   food is good, I'm in.

     He heads off.  Theo turns to find Nell staring at the animal heads 
     on the stairs.  Theo touches her.  She starts.

                               THEO
                   Nell, it was an accident.

     INT. MARROW'S BEDROOM (PART OF CONFUSING ROOMS) - NIGHT

     Marrow, sitting at a desk, speaks into a digital voice recorder.  
     His voice is cold, analytical.

                               MARROW
                   Icebreaker exercise conducted over 
                   dinner.  Observed initial bonding 
                   among subjects and experimenter.  
                   After dinner first bland history 
                   of House relayed.  Nell appears 
                   most susceptible to suggestive 
                   history.  Luke, who tested at the 
                   bottom of the Levy-Mogel 
                   Confidence Reliability Scale was 
                   given the second part of the 
                   story.  We should see some results 
                   tomorrow.  Accident with harp, 
                   while unfortunate... complements 
                   the experimental fiction.

     He turns off the machine, and then he says, ruefully:

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Publish or perish.

     He turns off the light.  The shadows in the room are too much for 
     him. He turns the light on, and then pulls the blanket over his 
     head.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell finishes putting things away in drawers.  Theo watches, leaning 
     in the doorway.  Nell looks around at the room: and this is her new
     family's new home.  Theo smiles sweetly at her, comes over.  An 
     awkward moment, as the seriousness drains away.

                               THEO
                   Ever try putting your hair up in a 
                   French twist?

     Theo reaches for Nell's hair.  Nell pulls away.  Theo pauses.  Nell
     realizes she shouldn't have pulled back.

                               NELL
                   Sorry.  I'm not used to being 
                   touched.

     She moves closer to let Theo examine her hair.  Theo takes Nell's 
     hair, holds it up in a French twist.

                               THEO
                   You've been out of the world for a 
                   long time, haven't you?

                               NELL
                   Yes.  I've missed it.

                               THEO
                   No.  The world has missed you.

     Cautiously, Nell peers in a mirror at herself... and likes what she
     sees.  Theo lets Nell's hair drop.  Theo moves for the door.

                               NELL
                   Good night, Theo.

                               THEO
                   You, too.  Happy tossing and 
                   turning.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     As Nell steps OUT OF FRAME and starts undressing, the CAMERA finds 
     the carved mantle, the densely-packed scene of children at play, 
     their faces frozen in dark wooden smiles, their eyes blind but 
     staring OC where we sense Nell changing.

     Now in a long tee-shirt, Nell crawls up onto the high bed.  Its
     headboard is heavy, dark, engraved with fan-like shapes, maybe 
     plants.

     She draws the covers about her and peers up at the ornate headboard.

     Something about it bothers Nell, but she can't put her finger on it.
     She twists over on her side and turns out the light on the 
     nightstand. For a moment, all there is in the darkness is her 
     breathing --

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     -- then almost silence.  We pull back from the CHILDREN'S FACES on 
     the doors of the Great Hall to reveal the vast room standing in 
     darkness.  Covens of strange shapes consort in the shadows, things 
     that in the day would be lamps, the stuff of life.  But now, at the 
     very deepest limit of human hearing, it is as if SOMETHING EXHALES.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

     It is black at the top of the stairs.  The carved animal heads on 
     the balusters are all turned UP THE STAIRWAY, eyes starting in fear.
     Waiting for something to walk down out of that blackness.

     INT. HALL OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT

     Eyes.  Eyes of all the mythological figures.  STARING down the long,
     black hallway.  Awaiting something.  Afraid.

     At the end of the hallway, where all eyes are staring, the double
     doors, the ones that scared Nell and Theo stand shut.

     That something gathering at the edge of our hearing RISES.  Rises as 
     if the House itself is breathing.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     BUMP.  The sound thuds the stillness of the House.  Bump.  Bump.  
     Bump.  Deep, hollow, distant like a dream.  Nell sits up, still 
     asleep, body moving by reflex.

                               NELL
                   Coming, Mother!

     WHUMP.  The noise jars her consciousness, lighting up her mind, VERY
     REAL.  Nell remembers where she is.

     Bump bang.  It's coming from somewhere far off in the House.  Nell
     listens in cold dread.

                               THEO (OC)
                   Nell!

     Nell spins to the bathroom door, goes through --

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- the unlit bathroom, slamming the door to her room behind her,
     across and out the other door --

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- into Theo's room.  THUMP BUMP BUMP.  Nell finds Theo right in 
     front of her, hair wet, kneeling in the bed, clutching her covers to
     herself.

                               THEO
                   What is it!?

     The sound grows nearer.  Out in the hall.  Like something searching.
     Coming toward them.

     Nell lunges at the door.  Theo grabs to stop her, and Nell sees the
     door is DEADBOLTED.  There's a RUSHING sound on the other side of 
     the tall door.  Right there.  Nell freezes.  BUMP!  BUMP!

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Nell!

     Nell recoils to Theo's side, drags Theo out of bed to the corner of
     the room.

     Nell and Theo stare out AT US in terror.  BUMP.  BUMP.  BUMP.  BUMP.

     Nell and Theo's eyes travel over the walls, following whatever it is
     which now seems to be moving out here in the theater.

     The SOUND moves along the wall to the right, reaching its loudest as
     it crosses the back of the theater, then seems to come down the left
     side.

     Theo shivers.  Nell clutches her close.  Nell writhes, unable to 
     stand it any longer.  She jumps up.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Nell!

     Nell charges the door, screaming:

                               NELL
                   No!

     SILENCE.  The bumping goes dead.  Nell blinks, looks back at Theo.  
     But Theo is looking at her hands.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Cold.  Oh, God.  Feel it.

     She looks up in horror at Nell.  Their breath FOGS in the air.  Nell
     holds her hand up in front of her, and as we watch HER HAIR PRICKLES
     UP, GOOSEBUMPS WITH THEM.

     Her eyes turn up to the door, and: BAMBABAMBAM BABBA BAM!  The DOOR
     JARS in its frame, leaping from the blows of whatever's on the other
     side.

     Nell backpedals but slips on the rug, falls there on the floor right
     in front of the door.  Theo SCREAMS.

     Silence.  The BANGING stops.  With a RUSH, whatever is outside the 
     door is no longer there.

     Nell looks at Theo.

     Then Theo looks at the bathroom.

     Nell starts for it, grabs Theo's door, but it's designed to be 
     locked from the BATHROOM SIDE.  Nell looks up --

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- and takes a step into the pitch-dark bathroom.  Theo appears in 
     the doorway behind her.  Across the bathroom the door to Nell's room 
     is closed.  Nell dashes for it --

     -- but A SUDDEN SCUTTLING SOUND stops her dead.  On the other side 
     of the door.  Rasping over wood.  Like a thing without hands trying 
     to turn --

     -- THE DOORKNOB.  A long beat.  The metal creaks as something takes 
     hold of it on the other side.

     Nell, mouth open in cold horror, sees the deadbolt.  It's open.  
     She's in no-man's land: too far from the door to lock it, too close 
     to run.

     The doorknob TURNS, but just as the door starts to open NELL FLAILS
     FORWARD AND SHOOTS THE DEADBOLT HOME.

     The door jams against it.  Nell jumps back.  Theo grabs her back 
     into --

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- her bedroom and slams the door.  A long, deadly silent moment.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   It's in my room.

     But their BREATH no longer fogs.  Theo seems to notice the fact just 
     as Nell starts for her room and... KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.  Behind them.  
     At the door to the hall.

                               LUKE (OC)
                   Hey!  I heard screaming...

                               THEO
                   Luke.

     She grabs for the door and lets Luke in.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell's room stands silent, dark.  The door to the bathroom is shut.  
     The lock slides open.  The door swings in.  Luke stands there, the 
     two women behind him.

     Luke turns on the lights.  The room is perfectly ordinary, no sign 
     that anything has been in here.  The door to the hall is shut.  Nell 
     reacts.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Nell and Theo, wrapped in blankets, sit over mugs of tea at the
     kitchen table.  Marrow, across from them, clicks off his digital
     recorder.  Luke paces behind the women.

                               NELL
                   You really didn't hear anything?

     Marrow takes his glasses off.  Luke looks at him, then goes to the
     kitchen sink.  He turns both faucets on full blast and leans up 
     against the sink, arms folded.  Theo and Nell turn to look at him.  
     A beat.  And then:

     BUMP.  Bump bump.  It's the sound.  Luke goes over to the door, 
     pushes it open.

                               LUKE
                   Oh, look!  There he goes, ol' Hugh 
                   Crain!

     INT. GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

     VARIOUS SHOTS as the bumping seems to travel down the hallway.  A
     rushing sound with it.  They're the same sounds, from the scene 
     before, but somehow have none of the impact, none of the presence as 
     they did in Theo's bedroom.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Luke lets the door shut, turns off the faucet.  The sounds of the
     plumbing die away.

                               LUKE
                   Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm 
                   going to bed.  They can stay up 
                   talking another 45 minutes if they 
                   want, but I gotta try to get some 
                   sleep.

                               MARROW
                   Go ahead.

     Luke leaves the kitchen.  Theo and Nell watch him go.

                               THEO
                   If this was some sort of joke, I'm 
                   going to kill him.

                               NELL
                   You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.

     Marrow watches the exchange closely.

                               MARROW
                   The cold sensation.  Who felt it 
                   first?

                               NELL
                   Theo I think.  You've asked us 
                   that three times, Doctor Marrow.  
                   What's going on?

                               MARROW
                   How do you feel about Luke's 
                   suggestion that it was just the 
                   old plumbing?  Water hammer, 
                   something like that?

     Theo and Nell look at each other in frustration.  But Theo tries to 
     get her mind around the question.

                               THEO
                   I did just take a bath.  I don't 
                   know.

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT

     The room is a lot less frightening now, especially with the lights 
     on.  Nell sits on Theo's bed.  Theo looks at the walls, silent, 
     normal.

                               THEO
                   I did just take a bath.

     When Nell doesn't respond for a moment, Theo turns to her, sees her
     wrestling with herself.

                               NELL
                   Mother always banged on the wall 
                   when she needed me.  The night she 
                   died... I heard her, but I 
                   pretended I didn't.  I was just so 
                   sick of it all.  And then the 
                   banging stopped.  And in the 
                   morning... she was dead.  This is 
                   the first I've ever said this to 
                   anyone.  That was the job I had, 
                   Theo, it's the only job I've ever 
                   known, and I failed.  I'm actually 
                   a bad person, Theo.  The world 
                   doesn't need me.

     Theo shakes her head, brushes at her eyes.  The confession, on the 
     top of the fright, has moved her deeply.

                               THEO
                   Oh, Nell.  Eleven years.  With all 
                   due respect to your mother who I'm 
                   sure was a saint, I'd have called 
                   Doctor Kevorkian, if not for her, 
                   for me.

     It's such a horrible thought it makes Nell smile, and they share a
     tearful laugh.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Nell stands in the door to her room.

                               NELL
                   Good night, Theo.

     Nell shuts the door.  Theo is about to close her door, but 
     hesitates.  She puts on the light and goes to the tub.  She turns it 
     on, waits.  Just the sound of the water.  And no bumping.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell lies asleep under her sheet, the blankets off the end of the 
     bed.  HOVERING OVER HER, on the headboard, the carved faces of 
     children, peering DOWN.

     FLAP.  FLAP flap.  The fan-light at the top of the window right next 
     to the bed is OPEN a crack.  The sheer curtains flap listlessly in a
     gentle breeze.  The flapping grows louder, and with a sudden gust 
     the curtain BILLOWS OUT.  In its flowing form, we sense the SHAPE OF 
     A GIRL'S FACE, fleeting, so insubstantial we know we just saw her, 
     but maybe our eyes are playing tricks on us.

     The CURTAIN blows straight out, touching the bedposts at the foot of
     the bed, and there the wind catches the fabric hanging from them.  
     The Wind seem to sneak under the bedcover and the shape follows...

     Nell sleeps, oblivious, the WIND filling the room, stirring the
     tinkling crystal beads on the candelabra.  The shape of the little
     girl's face now travels underneath the bedsheets toward the pillows,
     toward Nell.

     Nell turns, restless, the AIR catches the edge of the pillowcase, 
     and travels towards Nell's face.  And for a split second there is a
     lifelike IMPRESSION OF A SMALL GIRL'S FACE.  Nell almost awakens.  
     The crystal beads stir, and in their tinkling, in the sigh of wind, 
     we hear:

                               GIRL VOICE
                   Find us, find us Eleanor.

     Nell's eyes open.  And like that, the pillowcase deflates, the air
     rushes up the curtain to the window, and is gone.

     Nell sits up, looks about her.  Everything seems normal.  Just her
     sheets, just the curtains, but on the headboard remain the carved
     faces.  Benevolent.  Nell settles back down on her pillow with a 
     sense of peace.

     INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

     Morning sun filters in through heavy drapes, falling on Marrow at 
     the dining table.  Nell squeezes behind him and the sideboard behind 
     him to get at the coffee.  Nell wears MAKE UP, badly applied, and 
     her HAIR IS UP in a French twist.

                               NELL
                   Sorry.

                               MARROW
                   For an American you do a good 
                   imitation of the British at their 
                   most apologetic.
                          (Veddy British)
                   Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, 
                   sorry...

     Nell smiles.  Theo walks in the door, sees Nell and Marrow, Nell
     squeezed in behind him.

                               NELL
                   Am I that bad?

     Theo is aware of Marrow's curiosity and fascination with Nell.  
     There's a jealousy brewing.

                               THEO
                   Well this is a cozy breakfast.

                               MARROW
                   Good morning, Theo.  Luke.

     Luke comes in behind Theo, tired-looking also.  He goes to the
     sideboard, starts helping himself to breakfast.

                               LUKE
                   After I went to bed, the second 
                   time, after the... noise... I had 
                   the best night's sleep of my life.  
                   Anybody?

     Marrow slept badly, we can see it in his eyes.

                               NELL
                   Yes.  I feel realy rested, too.  
                   Theo?

                               THEO
                   I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks 
                   good.

     But she means exactly the opposite.  Marrow looks over Nell's hair, 
     but she can't stand it.  Luke comes over to the table, drops into a 
     chair next to Nell, digs into breakfast.  Theo's face turns into an
     artificial smile.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Your makeup too.

     Nell sits there flustered.  Marrow senses the jealousy, isn't quite
     sure what to make of it, and intervenes.

                               MARROW
                   Eat your breakfast, Theo, then 
                   we'll get started on the tests.

     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

     CLOSE ON the complex PUZZLE of a field-cognition test.  Nell 
     scratches solutions, erases, and finally looks up in frustration.  
     She sits alone, tiny, in the murk of the vast vaulted Great Hall.  
     The enormous chimney occupies half the wall on one side of the room.

     Clusters of furniture -- overwrought chairs with animal heads, 
     splay-footed coffee tables, limbed lamps -- huddle in strange, 
     silent covens throughout.  Nell, in a plush chair, lays the work on 
     a table beside her.  The CLATTER of stone on stone makes Nell look 
     up.

     The fireplace looms just beyond her cluster of chairs, large enough
     for a man to stand in.  A piece of mortar must have come loose.  
     Nell stares at the chimney.  And a VOICE lets out a loud groan.

     Nell JUMPS.  She pops out of the chair.  It came from another circle 
     of furniture in the shadows.  A figure stands and comes over.  It's 
     Luke, stretching.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   I've been thinking about these 
                   carvings.  Kids.  Lots of kids.  
                   Fat little angel kids.  Wild kids.  
                   Kids with furry animals.

                               NELL
                   The children.  The children Hugh 
                   Crain built the house for.  The 
                   children he never had.

                               LUKE
                   Come on.  These are the typically 
                   sentimental gestures of a depraved 
                   industrialist.

     He puts his hand on a CHAIR, the back of which is heavily carved in
     the motif he just described.

     Nell turns him an appalled look.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   Theo was working in the dining 
                   room.  She's probably done by now.  
                   You finish?

                               NELL
                   Couldn't get the last ones.  You?

                               LUKE
                   I did okay.

     Nell looks at the test, tries to digest this.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   We could do this stuff anywhere.  
                   I don't know what he's up to yet.  
                   But like I said, that's the fun.  
                   It has something to do with this 
                   environment.

     Luke just smiles, rises.  We'll see.

     He walks off, his footsteps echoing in the vast room.  The door 
     shuts after him.

     Nell sags in her chair.  Then something catches her eye.  On a table
     opposite, a SET OF KEYS.  Nell goes, picks them up.  Car keys, house
     keys.  Must be Luke's.  She pockets them, thoughtful, but just as 
     she does --

     -- something MOVES in the fireplace.  So fleeting Nell can barely 
     see it, and we only catch a frame of it.  But the iron MESH CURTAIN 
     hanging in front of the hearth is STILL SWAYING.

     Nell stands there FROZEN.  The massive fireplace LOOMS before her, 
     like a monstrous mouth, black as pitch beyond the black metal 
     curtains.

     The swaying metal scrapes over brick floor.  Its eerie, repetitive
     screep cutting to the nerve.

     Nell sits paralyzed, rooted to the chair.  SCREEP.  SCREEP.  SCREEP.

     A SINGLE STRAND of NELL'S HAIR stirs toward the fireplace, and --

     -- SOMETHING INSIDE THE FIREPLACE MOVES BEHIND THE MESH!

     Nell CRASHES back over her chair, knocking over a lamp and table,
     tripping, stumbling out of the furniture.

     Holy shit.  Whatever moved in there was real.  Big, dark, like
     something's head.  It goes out of focus and we can't see it as we
     follow --

     -- NELL flying away, across the room in headlong terror.

     INT. FOYER - DAY

     Nell slams out of the room, skidding as the door slams behind her.  
     She sways up off the floor to run --

     -- right into Marrow and Theo's legs.  Nell aborts a scream, 
     realizing who it is.  Theo stands there in surprise, holding papers 
     in her hand.

                               NELL
                   There's someone in there!  There's 
                   someone in there in the fireplace!

     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

     Nell and Theo stand behind Marrow and Luke across from the 
     fireplace.  Theo glances at Nell.  Nell is shaken.

     Marrow nods to Luke, and they start forward together, Marrow among 
     the furniture to the left, Luke down the right side.

     The iron screens hang silent in the fireplace, black, impenetrable.
     Marrow and Luke come up on either side, Luke ducking this way and 
     that trying to get a glimpse through the mesh.

     They stop before it, neither breathing, both listening.  Marrow 
     steps forward and pulls one screen aside far enough to look in.  
     DARKNESS.

     Nell and Theo watch, apprehensive.

                               NELL
                   Jim...

     Marrow sticks his head into the fireplace.  For a long moment, 
     nothing happens.

     IN THE FIREPLACE: pitch darkness.  Marrow feels up the chimney.

     AND THEN SOMETHING SWINGS DOWN RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE!  Marrow
     doesn't flinch.

     He FLINGS back the screen, revealing the only things in the 
     fireplace: two massive andirons, and the still-swinging FLUE.  It's 
     cast-iron, forged in the shape of a LION'S HEAD.

     Luke throws back the other screen.  Theo comes over.  Nell follows.
     There's nothing else in the fireplace.

     Luke and Theo stare at Nell.  Marrow squats to study the hearth.  
     The large iron ASH-DROP is coated in soot.

     Not a mark on it.  He opens it.  Inside, a glimpse of ASHES and 
     CHARRED WOOD.  Marrow stands, looks at Nell.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Somebody was in here.  I saw him.

     Marrow looks at her, not sure what to believe.  Nell turns to Luke 
     and Theo for help.  Not from that corner.  Then Nell remembers, 
     reaches into her pocket and produces the KEYS.  She holds them up to 
     Luke.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Are these yours?  I found them 
                   right over there.

                               LUKE
                   Who drives a Toyota?

     Theo shakes her head.  They aren't Marrow's.  Marrow takes the keys 
     from Nell, turns them over.

                               THEO
                   Maybe they're Mary's.

                               MARROW
                   Mary came with me.

                               NELL
                   When I first got here I saw a gray 
                   car pull up.  I thought it was one 
                   of us.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE - DAY

     They stand on the front steps.  Nell's car is right there under the 
     car port.

                               NELL
                   This is my car.

     Theo gestures to a sports car on the circular drive.  Two other cars
     are with it.  They walk out into the driveway.

                               MARROW
                   And those are Luke's and mine.

                               LUKE
                   There's a carriage house around 
                   back.

     EXT. CARRIAGE HOUSE - DAY

     Together they approach a stable/carriage house off to one side of 
     the main House.  It looks old, unused.  They enter through a small 
     door.

     INT. CARRIAGE HOUSE - DAY

     Light filters in through gaps in the wood.  Luke opens one of the 
     main doors with a loud SQUEAK, the sun revealing a TARP-COVERED 
     SHAPE, a carriage.  Unused in a hundred years.  A row of tarp-
     covered carriages fill the stalls into the distance.

                               LUKE
                   Well, this lot is full!

                               THEO
                   He must have left.  Didn't like 
                   the looks of the place or 
                   something.

                               NELL
                   How could he have left without his 
                   keys?

                               THEO
                   Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe 
                   they're not even his.

                               LUKE
                   Then he's got to be in the 
                   house...

     As they leave, the CAMERA LINGERS on a covered shape in one of the
     stalls, SMALLER than the other carriages, it could be a car.  A 
     broken wagon wheel leaning against it.

     INT. STATUARY HALL AND SHORT MONTAGE THROUGH HOUSE - DAY

     Marrow, Theo and Luke move down the hall, opening doors left and 
     right as Nell stands at the center of it all.

                               MARROW
                   Watts!

     No answer.  The statuary peers down on Nell.  Dead faces on busts.  
     Blind marble eyes.

     INT. VARIOUS ROOMS AND HALLS - DAY

     Luke calls out.

                               LUKE
                   Watts!  Oh Watts!  Here Wattsy...

     INT. VARIOUS ROOMS AND HALLS - DAY

     Marrow is looking for him, too.

                               MARROW
                   Watts!  Can you hear us?

     INT. VARIOUS ROOMS AND HALLS - DAY

     Nell and Theo, walking into rooms.

                               THEO
                   Watts?

                               NELL
                   What's his first name?

                               THEO
                   David.

                               NELL
                   David?  David Watts?  Can you hear 
                   us?  David!  Daviiiiid!

     INT. KITCHEN - DAY

     Marrow comes through the kitchen.  Mrs. Dudley, chopping carrots,
     stands by the counter.  Only the slightest pause in the rhythm of 
     her chopping says she's noticed him.

                               MARROW
                   Do you know who these keys belong 
                   to?

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   No.

                               MARROW
                   I was expecting another guest 
                   yesterday.  A man, David Watts.  
                   Did you see him?

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   No.

                               MARROW
                   Is your husband around?  I'd like 
                   to --

                               MRS.  DUDLEY
                   -- Haven't seen him.

                               MARROW
                   Thank you.

     Frustrated, he continues on.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - DAY

     Nell and Theo walk down the long hallway behind, opening doors,
     checking rooms.

                               NELL
                   David?

                               THEO
                   Maybe he never came in.  If he'd 
                   come in, he would have left his 
                   bags at the door, right?  Or maybe 
                   he got here early, and went for a 
                   walk, and fell.  Maybe he's 
                   outside.

     Nell closes a door on the right, and then stops dead.  Staring.

     The shut, dark, door, the one that scared Nell and Theo earlier,
     awaits them at the end.  Ominous.

     Nell approaches.  Closer and closer.  The door nears.

     Nell wraps her arms tightly about herself and try's to open the 
     door.  It's locked.  Her BREATH FOGS THE AIR.  She doesn't notice 
     it.  But then she suddenly GAGS.  With a look of horror she recoils 
     from the door, choking, covering her face.

     Then Theo smells it.  The women are both sick from the smell.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Oh my God, what is it?  Oh, the 
                   smell... ohhh.

     Marrow comes into the hallway.  He sees them from a distance.

     ON the two women.

                               THEO
                          (looks to Nell for 
                           an answer)
                   Is it over?

                               NELL
                   No, it's getting worse.

                               MARROW
                   Nell!  What's wrong?

                               NELL
                   That smell... oh, God.

     Theo blanches, looks at Nell.  She smells it too, and in mirror 
     image fashion backs away from the doors also.  Marrow notices the 
     exchange, and watches them, intense.  And then, in a heartbeat, the 
     moment is over.

     EXT. VERANDA - DAY

     The RED LIGHT on Marrow's DIGITAL VOICE RECORDER blinks.  The device 
     is in Marrow's jacket pocket, CONCEALED from Nell.  They're sitting 
     in Adirondack chairs on the long veranda behind the House.  Marrow, 
     beside her, observes.

                               MARROW
                   What did it smell like?

                               NELL
                   It was very specific.

                               MARROW
                          (so tell me...)
                   All right...

                               NELL
                   In the bathroom in my mother's 
                   room, the toilet was next to an 
                   old wooden table.  It smelled like 
                   that wood.

                               MARROW
                   So... smell... is... Smell is the 
                   sense that triggers the most 
                   powerful memories.  And a memory 
                   can trigger a smell.

                               NELL
                   I wasn't thinking about my 
                   mother's bathroom.

                               MARROW
                   What happened after you smelled 
                   it?

                               NELL
                   I looked at Theo.  She had a look 
                   on her face.

                               MARROW
                   Like she smelled it too?

                               NELL
                   Yes.

                               MARROW
                   And then what happened?

                               NELL
                   I got more scared.

     Marrow thinks about this.

                               MARROW
                   Hmm.

                               NELL
                   I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the 
                   study.

                               MARROW
                   No you're not.  Something moved 
                   you.  You saw something.

     Nell looks to him.  He's sincere.  He believes her.

                               NELL
                   I don't know.  Maybe I...

     "Didn't" she almost says.  She struggles, embarrassed.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   I haven't been with people in a 
                   long time.

     Marrow settles in his chair, looks out at the forest.

                               MARROW
                   I really haven't either.

     Nell peers at him, doubtful.  Is she being made fun of?

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   I mean, I'm surrounded by people, 
                   day in, dayout.  Students, 
                   colleagues.
                          (beat)
                   But most of the time, even when 
                   I'm with them... you know... It's 
                   all about power, there's not much 
                   room for actually getting to know 
                   someone or having someone getting 
                   to know you.

     Nell's face flushes with compassion.  With longing.  Marrow looks at
     her.  He's vulnerable.  Needing.  She doesn't dare hope.  The moment 
     lasts a few heartbeats.

     He looks away.  A flicker of distress crosses Nell's face.  And then 
     she realizes Marrow is looking at --

     -- Luke.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   You have to see something.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - DAY

     Luke, Nell and Marrow mount the stairs, climb up and up.  They find
     Theo in the mezzanine staring at the wall at the painting.  She 
     turns and looks at Nell strangely.

     Nell, confused, turns around.  On the wall and the painting are dark
     stains.  Black.  Blue.  Runny.  Almost like something leaking from 
     the roof has run down.

     Nell steps back.  The stains are the letters N and O.  Pulling back
     farther: the rest of the word ELEANOR.

                               NELL
                   My name.

     She follows the streaking substance up, blinking in rising fear as
     more running letters appear.  The word: WELCOME.  And higher up, the
     last: HOME.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No...

     But the substance doesn't come from the ceiling.

     It is as if the oils on the PAINTING OF HUGH CRAIN have been boiled 
     by a heat gun and blasted off, running down from there.  Hugh's face 
     is gone.  In place of the face, the underlying ivory of the canvas 
     glares out... like a skull.

     Nell SCREAMS and runs away, the others calling out after her in 
     alarm.  As they vanish around the corner, the camera tilts down and 
     we discover smeared paint on the floor.  Smeared, it seems, WITH 
     LITTLE FOOTPRINTS in it.

     INT. RED PARLOR - DAY

     Nell, panic rising in her voice, confronts the others.

                               NELL
                   Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome 
                   Home?  I've never been here.  Who 
                   did this?

                               LUKE
                   It's somebody's idea of a joke.

     She looks at all three of them.

                               NELL
                   Who did this?  Why are you doing 
                   this?  I don't know any of you.  
                   You don't know me.  Why are you 
                   doing this to me?

     Luke shakes his head.  Theo starts getting pissed.  Marrow stands 
     there, arms folded, observing.

                               LUKE
                   I didn't do it.

                               THEO
                   You could have.

                               LUKE
                   So could you!  Is this some fucked 
                   up idea of art, putting someone 
                   else's name to a painting?

                               THEO
                   No.

                               NELL
                   Theo... Did you?

                               THEO
                   Maybe you did it yourself.

                               NELL
                   Why?

                               THEO
                   I don't know.  You've been alone 
                   for a long time, maybe you want 
                   attention.
                          (pointing to 
                           Marrow)
                   Maybe he did it...

                               MARROW
                   I didn't.  You know that, Nell.

     This is horrifying to Nell, being doubted and accused of something 
     so ugly if it were true.

                               NELL
                   I don't know anything.  Whoever 
                   did this, please, just... just say 
                   so... just... please... this is 
                   cruel.  Don't be cruel to me.  I 
                   can't stand it.  You don't know 
                   me.

     And she runs out.

     Nell grabs for the door to leave.

     She flings open the door.  MONSTROUS arms seem to grab at her.  But 
     it's only a wild-looking coat rack in the hall.

     EXT. 2ND FLOOR BALCONY - DAY

     Nell stands at the railing of a stone balcony on the house's second
     floor.  The air stirs her hair.  She peers up at the House's 
     roofline, its clusters of misplaced windows and other features like 
     so many screaming heads.

     Chilled, she pulls her sweater closer.  Marrow comes out onto the
     balcony from twin French doors behind her.

                               NELL
                   Are you coming to confess?

                               MARROW
                   I wish I were.  I wish I had done 
                   it, then I could confess and you'd 
                   be at peace.  That great moral 
                   philosopher Frank Sinatra once 
                   said to someone he loved, I wish 
                   you had an enemy, so I could beat 
                   him up.

     She smiles.

                               NELL
                   Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did 
                   it?

                               MARROW
                   I don't know.

                               NELL
                   It was a stupid thing to do.

                               MARROW
                   It was.

                               NELL
                          (for the absurdity 
                           of the idea)
                   Welcome Home.

                               MARROW
                   You'll never see it again.  Mr. 
                   Dudley's taking care of it.
                          (beat)
                   I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you 
                   something you'd like to see?

                               NELL
                          (still too shaky 
                           for enthusiasm)
                   Sure.

     INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

     Marrow lets Nell into a long, Victorian-era GREENHOUSE.  It's
     overgrown, lush, the leaded-glass panes above stained with years of
     condensation and pollen.  Vines and trees climb up the sides.  Beds 
     of flowers and plants line narrow footpaths of brick.

     Nell leans down to look into a WATER GARDEN with a STATUE OF A MAN
     bursting from the surface, grasping for the air as if he had been
     drowning.  A sudden rumble runs throughout the greenhouse.  And A
     CAVALCADE of water comes out of the STATUE'S mouth surprising Nell.
     She lets out a little yelp, and then laughs with Marrow.

     Nell loves the greenhouse.  It takes her breath away.

                               NELL
                   Oh... it's so beautiful...

     Nell makes her way among the plants.  She looks up at a TOWERING,
     DOUBLE-HELIX STAIRCASE which rises from the floor to a platform 
     which gives access to the roof.  Below the staircase are planters 
     filled with violets.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Violets.  Somebody must've died 
                   here.

     And then, out of the corners, comes Mister Dudley.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   That's where she hanged herself.

                               NELL
                   Who?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope.  
                   Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie.  
                   Don't know how she got it.

                               MARROW
                   That's enough, Mister Dudley.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   She stepped off the platform.
                          (he looks up, with 
                           a suggestive leer)
                   They had long skirts in those 
                   days.

                               MARROW
                   Thank you, Mister Dudley, 
                   please...

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   House is full of stories.  If you 
                   know how to read these things, 
                   it's an open book.  Just a 
                   different library than the kind 
                   you're used to.

                               NELL
                   Why?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Why'd she kill herself?

                               NELL
                   Yes.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                          (what other reason 
                           is there?)
                   She was unhappy.

                               NELL
                   Why?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Can't say.  Haven't been here that 
                   long.
                          (he's off)
                   Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to 
                   work.

     And off he goes.

                               MARROW
                   That's a horrible story.

     Nell looks up, and smiles.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   You're smiling.

     Marrow watches her as she moves about, takes a heavy, ripe bloom in
     hand, lifts it to her face.  While she talks, she walks, and Marrow
     follows.

                               NELL
                   I was just thinking how happy I am 
                   right now.  All my life, I've been 
                   waiting for an adventure.  And I 
                   thought, oh, I'll never have that, 
                   adventures are for people who 
                   travel long distances, that's for 
                   soldiers, that's for the women 
                   that the bullfighters fall in love 
                   with.  And here I am, and 
                   something is happening to me.  
                   Strange noises in the night.  
                   Paintings are calling to me.  And 
                   all it cost to get there was five 
                   gallons of gas.  I'm getting my 
                   adventure.

     For the first time since we've seen Nell, there is something to her
     which is simply... erotic.  Marrow follows her down one of the
     footpaths.  She smiles back at Marrow as he trails her.  She reaches 
     a transept in the greenhouse, and as she turns down it, there's the
     slightest sway to her gait.  Marrow follows her around the corner 
     into the transept.  At the far end the wall is completely overgrown.

     Nell looks up through the ceiling at Hill House looming grim 
     outside, distorted in the old glass.

                               MARROW
                   Someone is playing with you.

                               NELL
                   Why?

                               MARROW
                   I don't know.

                               NELL
                   It doesn't matter.  Even if 
                   they're tormenting me, someone 
                   wants me.  What I do with this is 
                   up to me.  I can be a victim, or I 
                   can be a volunteer.  And I want to 
                   be the volunteer.

     Nell glances at him, and for that split second she is raw, 
     passionate woman.  She walks away, the sway in her gait aching, 
     powerful.  Marrow is surprised by what Nell just said and stares at 
     her as she comes to the overgrown end.  Nell reaches out to the 
     hanging vines, pulls them aside...

     ...and A FACE stares out.  Gastly.  White.  Nell takes an 
     involuntary step back, a little gasp.

     The face is marble.  Blind eyes stare from stained cheeks.  It is a
     STATUE OF CRAIN.  Marrow comes over.

     It's an enormous stone tableaux of Hugh surrounded by cherubim.  The
     plants have attacked it as if trying to wipe its funerary presence
     from the greenhouse.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Hugh Crain.  Can't seem to get 
                   away from him.

     She laughs a little at herself.  Marrow joins in.  He helps her pull 
     the plants back to reveal more of it.

     She reaches out, touches the marble cheek.  Then daring, grins, and
     begins to hum her TUNE.

     Marrow steps back to watch her do a sensual slow-dance with Hugh
     Crain, pirouetting, her hips sliding past... hypnotizing Marrow.

                               MARROW
                   What is that tune?

                               NELL
                   I don't know.  A lullaby I guess.  
                   My mother used to hum it to me.  
                   And her mother before that, and so 
                   on.
                          (to the statue)
                   Hugh Crain, would you care to 
                   dance?

     She hums another two notes, and BANG!  The door behind her SLAMS 
     OPEN in a gust of wind, jolting Nell.  She stops and stares.  
     Outside the window, through the glass, she sees Mr. Dudley, staring 
     at her, he's been watching her dance.  The spell is broken.  Nell, 
     embarrassed, can't bear to look at him.

     A beat, and then Marrow goes over and shuts the door.  When he turns
     back --

     -- Nell is just vanishing around the corner, her rapid footsteps
     echoing in the vaulted room.

     EXT. REAR LAWN - DAY

     Nell hurries away from the House, across the rear lawn, ashamed at
     herself as much as she is spooked.

     In the distance Mr. Dudley is walking toward the House with cans of
     paint cleaner an a ladder.  Nell stops, watching him.  He senses 
     her, pauses, and smiles.

     Nell reacts.  Sees the ladder.  Then Mr. Dudley disappears into the
     House.

     Nell once again starts to hurry away, but looking back over her
     shoulder, almost impales herself on the rusted iron fence of --

     EXT. FAMILY CEMETERY - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- the tiny Crain family cemetery.  Nell catches herself.  A small
     swinging gate bars the way.  She hesitates.

     Nine moss-covered headstones show the wear of a long century.  Eight
     small headstones, one large one.  A half dozen unmarked stones in 
     the grass: stillbirths.

     Nell is drawn into the graveyard.  The large stone is RENE CRAIN'S.  
     The smaller ones are her children's.

     Nell's heart is breaking as she moves among them: the various names.
     One reads ADAM CRAIN APRIL 5th 1874 -- ... The rest of the date is
     covered by growth.  She clears it away.  April 6th, 1874.

                               NELL
                   Only two days.

     There is an EPITAPH, almost wiped out by lichens.  Nell kneels to 
     read it.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   The blest are the dead / Who see 
                   not the sight / Of their own 
                   desolation...

     Nell, disturbed but not knowing what to make of it, rises from the
     gravestone, turns to the next.  ELISA CRAIN AUGUST 21ST, 1878 -- She
     clears it away: August 21, 1878.  The blasphemous epitaph here:

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   A father's joy unjustly snatch'd 
                   by a jealous God...

     Nell is shaken, and dreading what she will find next, whirls to the
     one behind her: WENDY CRAIN JANUARY 1 , 1880 -- She clears it away 
     -- January 1, 1880.  And its graven commandment, so familiar, so
     comforting, now rings with terrible, malevolent promise:

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Suffer the little children unto 
                   me.

     There are three more grave stones, and after clearing away the 
     brush, they too show that the babies died after a few hours, or a 
     day.  There's the same symbol on the graves of the children, a 
     cherub of death.  We've seen this image before.  Nell backs out of 
     the cemetery, afraid.

     INT. MEZZANINE - DAY

     Nell hurries down the mezzanine to the doorway which leads to the 
     Red Parlor.

     INT. RED PARLOR - DAY

     She stands there a beat staring in at the volumes upon volumes of
     books.  Nell is unsure of what she's looking for.  She looks at 
     Crain's painting and recognizes the same Cherubs inside the ornate 
     frame.  The background in the painting IS THE RED PARLOR.  Then 
     recognizes in the painting an OPEN BOOKCASE BEHIND CRAIN.  
     Intuitively, she turns toward the same bookcase across from her and 
     is able to push it open.  Inside a small stairwell...

     INT. CRAIN'S SECRET STUDY - DAY

     Down the circular stairs Nell enters a very small dusty room.  
     Velvet curtains drawn shut, only a sliver of sunlight showing 
     through.  As her eyes adjust, she makes out the furnishings of a 
     late-nineteenth century office, Crain's secret office.

     The bookcases filled with business ledgers.  The business ledgers 
     are stamped with the cherub of death.

     At the end is an enormous desk.  Behind it a massive, carved chair
     covered with a sheet, only its lion-head arm rests protruding from
     underneath.  Nell realizes it's:

                               NELL
                   Crain's study.

     She moves for the desk.  An ENORMOUS MIRROR, its silver inner 
     surface flaking with age, tarnished, reflects the room, the desk, 
     and FOR A SPLIT SECOND, A SHADOW IN THE CHAIR.  Nell steps in front 
     of it, blocking our view.

     And when she steps past, there is only the dim, flaking image of the
     chair, the natural shadow of the room.

     Nell goes around the desk, stands over it.  The chair sits silent
     behind her, shrouded.

     On the desk sits a set of ledgers marked with mill names -- Lowell,
     Haverhill, Manchester -- and years: 1884, '85 and so on.  She flips 
     one open.

     THE LEDGER is a payroll account.  Names upon names of workers 
     rendered in sepia by Crain's severe cursive.  Notations in the 
     column beside it indicate man, woman, or child and the appropriate 
     wage for each class of worker.  Many of them, at least a third, are 
     children.

     NELL reacts.  Disturbed by it.  She shifts closer to that damn chair
     behind her.  The sheet hangs over it in such a way that someone 
     could be sitting there under it.

     She turns the page.  Columns indicate pay, and so on.  But one 
     column, at the very center of the book, hidden in the binding, is 
     unlabeled. Down the column, some names have a line drawn through 
     them, and at the end of the line, a CROSS.

     Nell follows them back, eyes searching across the ledger.

     She turns the page, pushes the book down revealing that concealed
     column, more crosses.  And more.  Her eyes flick back and forth.  
     The crosses are paired with entries for CHILD.  She looks their 
     names...

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Erin, Peter and Sean and Emily and 
                   Elizabeth... who are you?  And 
                   you?  What happened to you?  You 
                   died... How did you die?

     Nell turns the pages.  More and more crosses.  Dozens.  Scores.

     Nell sinks down into Crain's chair and tears come to her eyes.  We 
     see the book.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

     The painting is right there now.  The letters have been erased.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     We see the ledger, and pull back, and the ledger is in Nell's lap.
     Nell sits on the bed in her sleeping tee-shirt and undies.  Theo 
     looks at the book with her.

                               THEO
                   That's so sad.

                               NELL
                   There's hundreds of them.  This 
                   must be a record of the children 
                   who died at the mills, like Luke 
                   said.

                               THEO
                   Before he painted your name over 
                   Mister Crain.

     Theo hands her the bottle.  Nell takes it, tops off her glass,
     spilling.  Her face is red.  She grimaces as she tosses back a big
     swallow.

                               NELL
                   You really think it was Luke?

     Theo takes another swig.  She holds bottles of nail polish up next 
     to Nell's bare feet, testing the colors.

                               THEO
                   Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley 
                   had to clean it and he knows that 
                   he's in charge of all the messes 
                   so why would he make more work for 
                   himself and...
                          (beat)
                   You said the Good Doctor was with 
                   you.

                               NELL
                          (pondering)
                   I don't know what to think 
                   anymore.

                               THEO
                   Just think about one thing right 
                   now: What color?

     Nell finally puts the book down and takes a drink.

                               NELL
                   I've never had a pedicure before.

                               THEO
                   Well?

                               NELL
                   Red.
                          (into this now)
                   What else?

     Theo smiles and takes Nell's foot gently in her hand.  She begins to
     paint her toenails.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   See, isn't this better than a hit 
                   on the head?

     Nell looks down her long legs at Theo.

                               NELL
                   I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.

                               THEO
                   Me too.  Although I learned one 
                   thing about you, that you don't 
                   know about yourself.  You can be a 
                   pretty decent bitch.

     Nell shoots down the rest of the glass of wine.

                               NELL
                   I'll take that as a compliment.
                          (beat, trying to 
                           sound casual)
                   In the city, what kind of place do 
                   you live in?

                               THEO
                   I have a loft.

     Nell is thrilled with this.

                               NELL
                   A loft.  That's a lot of room for 
                   one person.  Probably.  Maybe 
                   there's room for...

     Theo looks up, understands what she's asking.

                               THEO
                   You want to move to New York, you 
                   want to move in with me?

                               NELL
                   I don't know, you know...

     Nell lies back, arms spread, lets the glass roll out of her hand.  
     Theo paints Nell's toenails one by one, carefully guiding the brush 
     strokes in along the skin.  Nell, unused to this, gives into the 
     pleasure, and Theo sees how easy it is to move Nell.

                               THEO
                   My place isn't like yours, Nell, 
                   it doesn't have a view of sea.  It 
                   doesn't have a view of anything.  
                   What's interesting about the way I 
                   live is what goes on inside the 
                   walls.  Living with me... My 
                   boundaries aren't very well 
                   defined, Nell.  Do you know what I 
                   mean?

                               NELL
                   I'm trying.  Have you ever kept 
                   something to yourself because you 
                   were afraid it'd ruin things.

     Theo looks up at her, unreadable.

                               THEO
                   All the time.

     Nell lets out a sigh.  Gently Theo's hand moves down the arch of 
     Nell's foot.  Caressing.  Nell lets her.

     Theo finishes Nell's last little toe, and then with the brush out of
     paint, runs it gently up the inside of Nell's calf.  Nell sighs.

     Theo lowers her face near Nell's toes, licks her lips: soft, near,
     red.  She blows.

     Nell raises herself up, peers down at Theo.  Sees the want on her 
     face.  A long beat.

     Nell breaks the gaze, looks away.  Theo reads Nell's look, and 
     releases her foot.  She sits back in the chair.  For a moment Nell 
     doesn't know what to do.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   I better go to bed.

                               THEO
                   Are you sure?

                               NELL
                   I think so.

                               THEO
                   Okay.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell closes the door and sits at the vanity brushing out her hair 
     for bed.  Her motions are languid in the light of the single small 
     lamp, off-balance with the wine.

     Her HAIR brushes out in long, even strokes.  The brush moves through
     it, lifting it and letting it fall.

     IN THE MIRROR the brush draws through Nell's hair, but as it does, 
     the hair divides in its wake LIKE FINGERS RUNNING THROUGH it.

     Nell freezes.  She's not sure what she just saw.  She runs the brush
     through again, and again it is as if something pulls it back from 
     her head.

     Again -- fast -- she runs the brush through her hair, and this time
     the hair SPINS UP IN A KNOT.

     Nell flinches, dropping the brush, knocking the shade of the lamp on
     the vanity a-wobbling.

     She's out of the chair in a flash, grabbing her own hair, staring at
     the space behind her.  Nothing there.  A beat.

     She steadies herself, feeling the alcohol.  Gets control.

     The Tiffany lamp rocks back and forth, crystal beads shimmering.  
     The light plays across the fireplace and mantle on the wall.  And 
     something there catches her eye.

     Nell feels her way across the room, not sure of what she's seeing.
     Over the sound of the wind outside, there's something at the very
     highest edge of hearing.

     She stops five feet from the mantle.  The swaying light catches the
     rich tones of wood.  Then darkens.  Illuminates it again.  Darkens.  
     The carvings of the playing CHILDREN in the wood SEEM TO MOVE.

     Nell stares in drunken fascination.  And as the first fear begins to
     rise in her throat, the wind dies down and in its place there is the
     FAINTEST TRACE OF CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER.  Nell's reaction changes... 
     to awe.

     Tentative, her hand goes out, shaking... and touches the mantle.

     It is hard and still.  No movement whatsoever.  Silence.  But the 
     FACES engraved in the wood all seem to be peering up at her, hands
     outstretched for her, hopeful.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE GATES - NIGHT

     The enormous LOCKED gates are silhouetted against the moonlit sky.  
     The chain is dangling in the wind.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE - NIGHT

     Hold on Nell's WINDOW, the light shining dim through the gauze
     curtain.  It goes out.  The window stares from an arrangement of 
     other windows, stonework and doors... like an eye with a cataract in 
     a face howling in horror.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell, her breathing heavy, lies tangled in her heavy blankets, 
     asleep, but restless.  Her feet hang off the end of the bed.

     In the b.g., the door to the bathroom is shut, barely visible in the
     faint light from the window.  HOLD on it.

     Silently, it begins to OPEN.  The gap WIDENS, yawning, pitch dark
     beyond.  A long beat.  And then a THUMP.  A SLIDING SOUND.  
     Something drags itself across the floor.

     BUMP.  SLIDE.  Our line of sight is blocked by the bed.  But the 
     sound is getting louder, coming closer.

     Bump.  Slide.  Nell grinds her teeth in her sleep, pulls the 
     blankets about her tighter.  Bump.  The sound stops.  And her BREATH 
     BEGINS TO FOG.

     Whatever has just come in the room is right there, hovering just OC.
     We can feel it.

     Without warning Nell BOLTS upright, GASPING into consciousness.
     REVEAL: nothing.  Just the dark room.  And the bathroom door OPEN.

     Nell stares at the-door, knows she shut it.  Now it's open.  She 
     breaths fast, feeling the cold, knowing something's in here with 
     her.

     She stops breathing, strains her ears.  Silence.  A long moment.  
     Then she notices her feet, hanging out from under the covers.

     They are black.  Feel slick.  Nell turns on the light by her bed and
     looks down.

     HER FEET ARE COVERED IN GORE.  Where Theo had been painting.  Nell
     SCREAMS.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     SCREAMING, Nell spins the tub faucets on full blast, sticks her feet
     into the spray.

                               THEO (OC)
                   Nell?  Nell!

     Weeping, Nell scrubs the gore off her feet -- red, black like old
     clotted blood.

                               NELL
                   Who is doing this to me?

     The door to Theo's bedroom is shut.  The handle rattles, urgent, but 
     it won't open.  It's LOCKED.

                               THEO (OC)
                   Nell, what's wrong?  What's wrong?

     The blood or whatever it is on Nell's feet comes off, is sucked down
     the drain.

                               THEO (OC) (cont'd)
                   Nell, it's locked, let me in!

     Nell, squatting in the tub, sobs as her feet come clean, and there 
     are NO WOUNDS.  Theo rattles the door.

                               THEO (OC)
                   Nell, the door is locked.  Open 
                   it.

     Nell rises, steps out of the tub, and looking like she could kill,
     moves for Theo's door.

     She grabs the handle but realizes what Theo has been trying to tell
     her all along: it's LOCKED.  Perplexed, Nell finds the key in the 
     hole, and turns it.

     The door rams open, Theo behind it, terrified and clearly just 
     awoken.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Nell...

     Nell stares at her, hair tangled, tear-stained, doubtful.  Water
     splashes in the tub, faucets still running.

     The LIGHTS flicker as one in the connecting rooms.  Theo has time to
     look up at the bulb in the bathroom, and they all GO OUT.  Darkness
     swallows them up.  Stray moonlight reflecting in the mirror 
     silhouettes them standing there.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Nell, the tub!

     Nell stoops in the darkness and the faucets squeak shut.  Theo bumps
     her way out of the room.  Nell moves to the doorway following her
     into --

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT

     -- Theo's room.  Theo's form moves by her bed, and with a snick, her
     cigarette lighter lights up.  Theo holds it above her head, its tiny
     orange flame glistening off polished wood in the shadows.  Nell 
     steps toward her.

     Drip.  Drip.  From the bathroom.  Theo's eyes widen?

                               THEO
                   Oh, God, your breath...

     And sweeping over them a SHOCK OF COLD.  Their breath.

     Nell shakes her head: don't say anything.  Nell turns around, the
     darkness almost impenetrable.  SHAPES, alien, threatening, at the 
     very edge of light -- anyone could be some... thing.  Drip.  Drip.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   It's here.

     Nell looks down at Theo's bed, then at Theo who moves closer to 
     Nell.  Nell gives the bed a wide berth.  Together they back toward 
     the wall with the fireplace.

     They stare out at us, eyes trying to adjust, afraid.  Behind them 
     looms the fireplace and in front of it, a metal cage-like fire 
     screen.  A beat.

     BAM!  SOMETHING LUNGES out of the fireplace but is caught in the
     screen, hitting Nell and Theo in the back.

     Theo's lighter goes flying in that very instant, and we never see
     what's hit the screen.  Neither do they.  Theo falls SCREAMING.  
     Nell manages to whirl, embrace the cage and slam it with whatever's 
     inside back into the fireplace.  The screen JOLTS hard enough to 
     lift Nell.

                               NELL
                   HELP!

     Theo still SCREAMING, lying on her back before the fireplace, rams 
     her feet against it.  The screen HAMMERS at Nell and Theo.  They 
     can't run or it'll get out.

     Theo's screaming is suddenly drowned out by a HORRIFYING, INHUMAN
     SOUND from inside the fireplace.

     Theo's scream goes dead in breath-stealing horror.  Nell recovers.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No!  Go AWAY!

     The screen punches out at them, denting.  And then all the air in 
     the room seems to be SUCKED into the fireplace in one THUMP.  The 
     door to the bathroom slams.

     It's gone.  They sit there in the darkness, panting.

     INT. GREENHOUSE - NEXT DAY

     Nell stares at the tableaux of Hugh Crain.  In the morning light it
     seems inert, cold, just a statue.  Luke and Theo enter.  Nell 
     doesn't seem to notice them until they're beside her.

                               THEO
                   Marrow said the same thing as last 
                   night, he says --
                          (meaning, this is
                           on his now
                           doubtful word)
                   -- that he checked with Mrs. 
                   Dudley.  And he says that she told 
                   him that all the fireplaces in the 
                   West Wing connect to the main 
                   chimney.  He says that he thinks 
                   that the flue was open, and with 
                   the windstorm, he says that what 
                   probably happened was some kind of 
                   freak air current --

                               NELL
                   -- What do you think?

     Theo considers, then looks at her, severe.

                               LUKE
                          (lowers his voice)
                   Don't tell the Professor; he'd 
                   probably throw me out.  But test 
                   taking is one of the ways I've 
                   been supporting myself.  I 
                   volunteer for every paid study 
                   that they offer.  Of course 
                   straight psych stuff doesn't pay 
                   as much as the pharmaceuticals do, 
                   or a good wound study.  Check it 
                   out.

     He rolls up his sleeve revealing large, livid SCARS at intervals too
     regular to be anything natural.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   A thousand dollars each.  Am I 
                   sick?  Yes.  Do you know why I 
                   only date freshmen?  By the time 
                   they're sophomores, they've 
                   figured me out.

                               THEO
                          (get back on track!)
                   Mister very talky, would you 
                   please say what it is about this 
                   study that bothers you?

                               LUKE
                   The whole thing feels like 
                   experimental misdirection.  Like 
                   he says it's about one thing, a 
                   psychological profile of 
                   environmental effects on 
                   insomnia... and that'd be a 
                   legitimate study, but I think that 
                   we've been subjected to an 
                   academic bait and switch; he's 
                   really looking at something else.

                               NELL
                   No.  No... Jim's not doing -- 
                   these things.

     But there's a desperate, rising edge to Nell's voice.  Theo's, in
     response, is quiet, sober... certain.

                               THEO
                   Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep 
                   down, if you really thought it 
                   wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be 
                   leaving right this second?  Why 
                   wouldn't you be afraid?  Really 
                   afraid.

                               NELL
                   Because I don't want to ruin 
                   things.  Because home is where the 
                   heart is.

     Theo is chilled by this answer which would only make sense to 
     someone out of her mind.

     Nell looks up and sees the double staircase at the end of the
     greenhouse... the one where Crain's wife killed herself.

     And for a moment we see Crain's wife hanging there and then the 
     image is gone...

     INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

     Lunch remains are on the table as Nell enters, test papers in hand.

                               NELL
                   Jim?  I'm done.

     But Marrow isn't there.  She's about to go back out to look for him,
     but sees something and stops.

     Forgotten by a reading chair to one side of the room.  Barely 
     visible.  Marrow's BRIEFCASE.  Nell goes to the briefcase, knowing 
     she shouldn't look, and unable to help herself.  Marrow's digital 
     recorder glints out at her.

     Nell takes it out, and presses play.  She looks up at the door.  Any
     minute he could come back in here... and then Marrow's voice rings 
     out.

                               MARROW (V.O.)
                   ...the hallway discussion about 
                   last night's fireplace incident 
                   concluded at three a.m.  Nell 
                   continues her alienation of the 
                   other subjects and the 
                   experimenter.  It remains unclear 
                   whether she truly believes she did 
                   not deface the painting.  
                   Interview with the subject in 
                   greenhouse yesterday to ascertain 
                   the extent of her self-delusion 
                   was inconclusive due to her 
                   efforts to sexualize encounter 
                   with experimenter.

     Marrow's voice continues on in his assessment, but Nell isn't 
     hearing anything anymore.

     She dies inside.  Her world upside down.  She falls into a chair, 
     and all we can hear of Marrow is the cold, analytical tone, his 
     garbled jargon.

                               MARROW (OC)
                   One minute!

     It's Marrow, for real, about to enter.  Nell clicks off the 
     recorder, drops it into the briefcase.  Marrow is startled, not 
     expecting Nell to be sitting right next to his papers and briefcase.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Nell.

     She can only stare at him, eyes dead.  Marrow looks from her to the
     briefcase and back.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Were you looking for me?

     Nell can't answer.  Marrow comes over, unsettled.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   How are the tests going?

     Nell rises, staring, emotionless.  Betrayal just beginning to find a
     hold.  She hands him her papers.  Marrow looks at Nell, knows she's 
     been in his briefcase.  He picks it up, and with a final, sorry 
     glance, exits.

     INT. GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

     Nell emerges from the study, stands there a beat, lost.  Then she
     turns, resolute, and starts moving.  Faster.

     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

     Nell, blinded by tears, runs across the room toward the grand entry
     and the exit... and stops.

     DOWN THE CONNECTING HALL, out in the grand entry, at the front 
     doors, are Mr. and Mrs. Dudley.  Leaving for the day.  They stop.  
     Look at her.

     Nell, numb, gazes from the open door to Mrs. Dudley.  Mr. Dudley 
     holds the door open as if in invitation.  Nell could walk out right 
     now.  This is her chance.  But...

     Mrs. Dudley smiles a knowing smile.  An all too knowing smile.  And
     seeing Nell's decision, gently shuts the door.  The LOCK CLICKS.  
     Final.  Fate-sealing.

     Nell turns back to the House, lost.

     INT. RED PARLOR - DAY

     Nell walks right up to the moveable bookcase and enters Crain's 
     secret study.

     INT. CRAIN'S SECRET STUDY - DAY

     Nell sits in silence, trying to find a feeling, any feeling.  A long
     beat.  And without warning she leaps to her feet in SHOCKING rage.

                               NELL
                   How can he think I'm doing this!

     She has a floor lamp in her hands, and hurls it like a throwing 
     hammer at the nearest shelves.  Vases, knickknacks and a LEATHER 
     ALBUM crash to the floor.

     She stalks around the room, and then slows, staring at what she's
     done, the rage draining out of her.  But if she could do something 
     like that...

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No.  No, I couldn't do those 
                   things: I'm not making it up.

     She turns in place, desperate... and sees the old leather album
     precariously tilting on one of the sprung shelves.  It's open.  One 
     of the leaves flips over on its own, gravity and the weight of its 
     own pages TURNING IT.

     Nell approaches, stepping over broken ceramic.  SLIP.  Another page
     turns.

     Nell hovers over it, holding her breath so as not to make the book
     flip over and fall off the shelf in one instant.

     SLIP.  Another page turns.  The book is a PHOTO ALBUM of the late
     nineteenth century, bound with ribbons, the aged Daguerreotypes in
     pressed vellum frames.

     Nell peers closer.  It's open to a faded, gray image taken long 
     before it became the convention to smile for a photograph: a woman, 
     RENE CRAIN, sitting in a chair.

     And standing behind the chair, a fearsome presence in a black coat,
     his face hollow, malevolent.  HUGH CRAIN.

     Nell shivers, and SLIP, the page turns on its own.

     An image of Hugh and Rene, a look of deathly loss on their faces.  
     The page flips.

     Crain hovers, dark, rage just under the surface, but on Rene's face 
     is the faintest, most inappropriate SMILE.  It sends a chill through 
     Nell.

     The album begins to slide down the shelf, and as it does, PAGES 
     FLIP, Rene's SMILE grows wider, her hair dishevelled, her eyes lit 
     with grinning insanity...

     Nell grabs the book just as it falls from the shelf.

     It is open in her hands to a picture of Crain, alone, in front of 
     the enormous fireplace in the Great Hall.  RENE IS GONE.  The photo 
     is monstrous.  Nell, fearful, turns the page --

     -- and REACTS to the last thing she expected.  A picture of a lovely
     woman filled with grace and power.  CAROLYN CRAIN.  Posed.  On a 
     settee before the fireplace.  Beautiful beyond words.  Smiling.  
     Ahead of her time.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   His second wife.  There was a 
                   second wife?  Carolyn.

     It warms Nell.

     She turns the page.  Now Crain is there beside Carolyn.  But there 
     is something different about him.  Less frightening.

     Nell flips the page again, and now there is an image of Crain and
     Carolyn.  Her hair is up in a FRENCH TWIST.  Nell smiles more.

     Nell turns the page yet again.

     But something is wrong.  It is another image of Carolyn and the
     kinder, gentler Crain, but now it is Carolyn who is unsmiling.

     Another page.  Another.  Carolyn's face darkening.  And in this 
     picture, Carolyn's stomach is slightly distended.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   She was pregnant.

     Nell TURNS PAGES FASTER AND FASTER, and as she does, Carolyn SWELLS
     PREGNANT before our eyes in ragged animation, mouth working as if to
     speak, voiceless as it is... ELEANOR.

     Nell fumbles the book onto the floor.  It stares up at her, open to 
     the last page.

     It is an image of Carolyn.  Betrayal.  Hell.  Knowledge.  Her hand 
     seems to be POINTING at the gaping maw of the GRAND FIREPLACE.

     Nell bolts from the room.

     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

     Nell bursts into the Great Hall and stops.  At the far end of the 
     room broods the vast fireplace, its chain curtains hanging like the 
     veil to some hellish sanctuary.

     Nell stares at it, daunted.  What is it that Carolyn is trying to 
     show her?  The fireplace beckons, and Nell approaches against her 
     will.

     She finds a steel poker hanging by the fireplace, and takes it down.
     She uses it to slide one of the chain curtains open.  She steps into
     its soot-black mouth.

     Nell peers up the chimney.  A faint sigh of air.  She sticks the 
     poker up the flue, scratches around.  Nothing.

     She turns her attention to the back of the fireplace, thwocks it.
     Sooty stone chips away, but it's solid.

     The mechanism for the ash drop catches her eye.  Nell grabs the 
     heavy, iron lever.  She pulls, but can barely budge it.  It finally 
     screeches back, and the iron door in the floor of the fireplace 
     SWINGS DOWN.

     Nell looks in.  Two feet down it looks like a gray blanket of ash, a
     charred timber or two sticking out.  Sick with fear, Nell prods the
     ash.  Just charred wood.

     She thrusts the poker down deep.  It vanishes in the ash up to her
     hand.  CLACK.  She rakes through the ash.  CLACK.  And then she 
     feels the poker take purchase.  She draws it out, and full of dread 
     turns it to the light...

     Impaled on its hooks are TWO HUMAN SKULLS.

     Nell fights back the scream in her throat.  One of the skulls is a
     child's skull, the other an IMMENSE SKULL with brooding brow, 
     forehead crushed.

     Nell lets the poker drop.  It bangs off the door, falls in the ash
     drop, its handle hitting a spring.  Nell recoils as the trapdoors 
     SNAP SHUT like a pair of jaws.

     INT. GROUND HALLWAY FLOOR - DUSK

     Nell stumbles down the hall, weeping in fear.

                               NELL
                   Theo!  Jim!  Help!

     But instead she hears children voices, calling out for her.

     INT. CONFUSING SERIES OF ROOMS (THE MAZE) - NIGHT

     Nell winds through the pitch-dark halls, rooms gaping black left and
     right, searching for the voices which seems to come from just around
     the next bend, leading her around corner after corner.

     The hallways peel past Nell as she runs, slamming through doors, 
     ever darker.  The House's hellish carvings glare as she passes, 
     grinning, taunting.  She rages on, oblivious until she rounds a 
     final corner --

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT

     -- into the long, dark hall leading to the LOCKED ROOM.  The 
     STATUARY peer down on her.  Dead faces.  Blind marble eyes.  As she 
     turns, the heads and eyes turn imperceptibly with her.

     For a frame or two the EYES are real, just a subliminal glimmer.  
     For the instant we try to catch the movement, the illusion, it isn't
     there.  It makes Nell stop.  She regards the terrible doors.  She
     considers the labyrinth around her.  And begins to understand.

                               NELL
                   The house... it's a maze, that's 
                   how you designed it, didn't you, 
                   Mister Crain?  So wherever one of 
                   your little guests went, the house 
                   brought them here.  It's designed 
                   to make you come here.  But why?

     Another CRY comes from the far end.

     Nell eases down the hallway, the fear welling back on her like a 
     tide.  She hesitates, but then the CHILD-CRY forces her on.  She 
     reaches the CARVED DOORS with the wooden guard statues.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Oh, no... Oh... no... no, no... 
                   not that... Oh no... Ohhhhhhhhh!

     Gaping cold and stench hit her.  She gags.

     Now the CRY comes from under the door.  Present.  Real.  Right 
     there.  Nell shudders.

     The CRY grows louder, desperate.  She shuts her ears to it.  The CRY
     rises to fearsome rage, not sounding like a child anymore.  Not
     sounding like anything human at all, it's painful.  Nell looks at 
     the locked room in horror and takes off running.

     INT. PICTURE GALLERY - DUSK

     Nell bursts into the picture gallery and stops.  Standing there are
     Marrow, Theo and Luke, stricken silent by her entry.  Looks of shock 
     on their faces.  Nell just stands there.  A beat.  And then it pours 
     out of her, hysterical.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   He hunted all those children in 
                   here.  The dead children, Josiah 
                   and Elizabeth and all of them... 
                   from the books... he took them up 
                   here... he played games... the 
                   ones from his mills he burned them 
                   up in the fireplace but she found 
                   out what he did and she killed
                   him --

     She takes a breath, and turns gray.  Before anyone else can react, 
     her legs go out from under her, and she lands sitting.  Theo and 
     Marrow get to her side fast.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   -- he didn't kill her she killed 
                   him and ran away with her baby --

     Marrow grabs her face.  It's gray, her eyes glazing over.

                               MARROW
                   Get a blanket!

                               THEO
                   It's okay... we're all here...

     Luke races out.  Theo, scared, looks at Marrow.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   What's happening to her?

                               MARROW
                   She's in shock.  Come on.

     He starts to lift her.  Theo takes her other side.

                               NELL
                   After Rene... after she killed 
                   herself... he turned into a 
                   monster.  He did fill the house 
                   with children... he did, but... 
                   they weren't laughing...

     Nell is ugly, sprawling, in shock, as Theo and Marrow shuffle her to 
     a padded bench on one side of the room.

                               THEO
                   Nell, what happened?

                               NELL
                   Carolyn showed me where she hid 
                   him, hid him with all the ones he 
                   killed --

                               MARROW
                   Nell... please, Nell... take a 
                   deep breath...

                               NELL
                   And they're all locked together in 
                   here... and he won't let go of 
                   them!

     Marrow grabs her face.

                               MARROW
                   Nell!

     Luke rushes in with a blanket.  Theo covers Nell and then holds her,
     gently.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Look at me, Nell.  Look at me!

     Nell manages to focus on him, her breath laboring.

                               NELL
                   Hugh Crain.  He's in the house.  
                   He's still here...

     Theo pulls back, goes very still.  The first hint of fear in her 
     eyes.

                               THEO
                   No.

     Marrow sees the panic working on her, gives her a stern look:

                               MARROW
                   Theo!  You too.  Listen to me.

     The command derails Theo's train of thought.  Marrow stares at Nell 
     in pity, can't bear it, and has to look away.  Finally he turns back 
     to her, full of regret.

                               MARROW
                   Nell, you have to hear me.  Let me 
                   explain what's happening to you.
                          (beat)
                   You're participating in a study on 
                   hysteria.

     Everyone but Marrow REACTS.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   I've given you a powerful 
                   suggestion that you're in a 
                   haunted house.  I picked Hill 
                   House because it fits the 
                   expectations.  It was my... it was 
                   my theater, my stage.

     Theo glances at Luke: he's been right all along.  This was never 
     about perception.

                               LUKE
                   Modelling small-group dynamics in 
                   the formation of narrative 
                   hallucinations.  You brought us 
                   here to scare us.  Insomnia, that 
                   was just a decoy issue.  You're 
                   disgusting.

                               NELL
                   Is this true?  I've been 
                   hypnotized?

                               MARROW
                   I hadn't done a study of how group 
                   fear affects individual 
                   performance.  Mass hysteria is 
                   like a story, Nell.  A communal 
                   story.  Someone starts it.  Then 
                   we all add a little more to it.  
                   And then for some reason -- no one 
                   knows how -- we start believing 
                   it.  This story shapes what we see 
                   and hear.  We interpret everything 
                   through it, make it fit the story.  
                   I started our story when I gave 
                   you the history of Hill House.  
                   You've added to it.  That's what 
                   this experiment has all been 
                   about.  That's what it was about, 
                   the experiment's over.  I'm 
                   pulling the plug.  This is my 
                   fault.

                               NELL
                   It's not real?  Crain?  He's not 
                   real?

     Marrow shoots him a look: shut up.

                               MARROW
                   Your fear of him was real.  That's 
                   all the ghost anyone needs.

                               THEO
                   How could you do this to people?

     Nell bucks in his arms, furious, desperate.

                               NELL
                   This is real, I'm not making it 
                   up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were 
                   there -- the banging and last 
                   night.  You, you all saw the 
                   painting!

                               THEO
                   Nell, it makes sense.  It all 
                   makes sense.  You and I, we were 
                   scaring each other, working each 
                   other up.

                               NELL
                   -- but the painting!

     Nobody says anythlng.  The silence tortures Nell.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   I know you think I did that.  I 
                   didn't!  Go to the great hall and 
                   look in the fireplace!

     She starts to laugh.  Marrow gently presses Nell down, tucking the
     blanket around her.

                               MARROW
                   Why would we want to do that, 
                   Nell?

                               NELL
                   Because that's where he burned 
                   them up, the child laborers from 
                   his mills!  Because that's where 
                   their bones are!  He killed
                   hundreds.  He took them here and
                   he killed them.  Their bones are 
                   in the fireplace!

     Nell sobs.  The others exchange looks at this.  It sounds so hollow, 
     so delusional, it makes Marrow look so right.

                               MARROW
                   There are no bones in the 
                   fireplace.  Luke and I looked in 
                   it yesterday.  There's some old 
                   charred wood in the ash drop
                   but --

     Nell SPASMS trying to fight her way up, but Marrow and Luke hold her
     down.  Nell begins to wail in helpless rage.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Nell!  If we look in that 
                   fireplace it'll just make you more 
                   upset.  And when there are no 
                   bones there, you'll say they got 
                   up and walked away.

                               NELL
                   Oh, God, you're not going to 
                   look...

     Theo pushes them back and grabs Nell's hand, gently brushes Nell's
     face.

                               THEO
                   Aw, shhh Nell, shhh.

     Theo turns up to Marrow, intense, furious with him.

     Nell's hysterics have stopped.  She stares up at him, lost.  
     Searching inside herself.  Maybe she is crazy...

                               MARROW
                   There has to be Monster in the 
                   Labyrinth.  We make them up.  
                   That's how we deal with the things 
                   in everyday life that are too 
                   terrible to deal with.  Like 
                   losing someone.  Like being alone.

     Marrow reaches down to Nell, but she shrinks away.  Theo blocks 
     Marrow out, shielding Nell.  Marrow pauses, disgusted with himself.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   I'm sorry, Nell.  I'm really, 
                   really sorry I did this to you.

                               LUKE
                   Sometimes saying you're sorry is 
                   just not enough.

     A disgusted Luke leaves the room.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell lies in her bed, shivering.

                               NELL
                   Don't leave me.

     Theo spreads an extra blanket over Nell.

                               THEO
                   I'm going to stay with you until 
                   you fall asleep.  And then I'm 
                   going to get some brandy.

                               NELL
                   I don't think I want any.

                               THEO
                   I do.

     Theo spots a small candelabra with strings of crystal beads on the
     bedside table.  She lights the two candles.

     Theo goes and turns out the light.  Nell lies there watching the
     flicker of the candles play in the crystal.  Eddies of heat mingle 
     up the frost-covered glass of the window behind the candelabra.  
     Small streaks of frost begin to melt... We see eyes forming in the 
     melting frost, a face begins to form...

     Theo watches Nell.  There can be a TIME DISSOLVE.  Nell falls 
     asleep.  Theo tiptoes out of the room.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Luke eats chips.  Marrow stands by the door, arms folded, matter-of-
     fact.

                               MARROW
                   I gave my key to the gate to Todd, 
                   but the Dudleys'll be here in the 
                   morning.

                               LUKE
                   Do we still get paid for the week?

                               MARROW
                   You get your money.

     Awkward silence.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Where did she come up with it?  
                   How did she put it all together?

                               LUKE
                   Is that the question of compassion 
                   or science?

                               MARROW
                   It's a question.

                               LUKE
                   She got the child labor stuff from 
                   me.

     Theo comes in, she heard what they were talking about.

                               THEO
                   I... I was playing games with 
                   her... Big city games... I was 
                   bad.  And you, Doctor Morrow, you 
                   broke her heart.

     He knows this.  It tears him apart.

                               MARROW
                   Is she asleep?

                               THEO
                   Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't 
                   let her alone the whole night.

     Marrow nods, gets his briefcase, exits.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Marrow steps into the dark, vast room, his glasses glinting.  The 
     faint outline of the fireplace on the far wall looms in the 
     darkness.

     Marrow approaches it.  The mesh screen is still open.  Marrow stands
     there a moment.  Then looks in.

     He squats and tries to open the ash-drop.  It doesn't budge; it's
     jammed by the poker Nell dropped in.

     Marrow considers, then shakes his head, feels stupid for even coming
     in to check.

     Suddenly his CELL PHONE RINGS, startling him.

                               MARROW
                   Shit.
                          (answering the
                           phone)
                   Hello?  Yes, this is Dr. Marrow.
                          (beat)
                   Oh, hello.  Thank you for 
                   returning the call.
                          (beat)
                   No.  You mean he hasn't returned?
                          (long beat)
                   No, we haven't seen him.
                          (beat)
                   Can you tell me, what sort of car 
                   does he drive?
                          (beat, reacting)
                   A Toyota...

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Luke stops Theo, carrying a tray of food and tea, outside the 
     kitchen door.

                               THEO
                   We're fucked.  We're in a haunted 
                   house and we can't get out until 
                   the morning.

                               LUKE
                   You don't really believe it's 
                   haunted... Do you believe in 
                   ghosts?

                               THEO
                   That depends on your definition of 
                   ghosts.  I'm going to check on 
                   her, and then I'm going to stay 
                   awake.

                               LUKE
                   All night?

                               THEO
                   Yeah.

                               LUKE
                   You want company?

                               THEO
                   Maybe someday.

     Some sexual awareness.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell lies in her bed asleep, the room dark except for the last,
     guttering end of one of the candles.  It goes out.

     A FAINT SOUND.  LONG, LOW, like the inarticulate murmur of a dozen
     madmen.  Nell stirs.  Her eyes open.  She hears the sound.

     The wall on the opposite side of the room catches the pale gloom 
     from the window.  The twisting figures in the plaster, the low-
     relief, the shadows they make seem to COME TOGETHER AS AN EYE.  
     Black.  Not human.  The woodwork around it like some half-face.

     The GIBBERING begins to RISE.

     OUT OF THE CORNER OF HER EYE she can see a FORM beside her in the 
     bed.

     Nell's mouth moves.  She manages to form words, but it's just a
     whisper.

                               NELL
                   Theo...

     Nell reaches out under the covers.

     Her HAND is suddenly grasped.

     THE EYE on the wall stares.  The babbling, liquid, deep voice 
     mounts, and as the shadows move ever so slowly, the EYE seems to 
     roam over the room.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Oh, God.  It's looking for me.

     And then the babbling stops.  Nell grimaces in pain.  She tries to 
     look at Theo, but it's far too DARK right there beside her.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Theo, my hand.  You're hurting me.

     In the place of the babbling, another sound.  High-pitched, drawn-
     out.  A CHILD'S CRY.  Nell reacts.

     The cry wails louder, coming through the wall.  It's a wail of 
     agony.  A wail not of this earth.  Nell struggles, racked between 
     the pain in her hand and the tortured child's cry.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   A child.  No.  No!  I'm right 
                   HERE!

     The EYE focusses on her.  Dead on her.  Nell stops.  And with sudden
     violence, she's WRENCHED out of the bed by whatever's beside her.  
     Nell hits the floor with a scream.  She grabs at the table on this 
     side of the bed, pulling a lamp down on her, yanking at its chain.

     The room FLASHES into brilliance.  Nell stands up, panting... There 
     is nothing in the room.  No Theo.  She looks at her hand.

     The eye on the wall is gone.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Oh, God.  Who was holding my hand?

     Nell snaps around.  There on the window, SPREADING before her eyes 
     the frost on the glass is melting into a HORRIFYING FACE.  The face 
     of CRAIN.

     Nell recoils in prickling fear.  Living fear.  Then her fear turns 
     to RAGE.  In the blink of an eye there's a heavy ashtray in her 
     hand, and it's flying at the window.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   I will not let you hurt a CHILD!

     The window BASHES out into the night, the face vanishing with a HOWL
     of air.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     NeIl explodes from her room, a flying fury of hate.  The child-cry
     seems to race ahead of her into --

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- Theo's room, which is empty.  Now it seems like it's coming from 
     the door to the hall, is right there.  Nell races after it and --

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- barges out into the hallway.  She breaks into a run.  The cry 
     sounds from farther off.  Nell chases after it.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Theo carrying a pot of tea and some cups enters quietly just in case
     Nell is asleep.  She stops in surprise.  The window is smashed, lamp 
     on the floor.  Nell is gone.

                               THEO
                   Nell?

     INT. NELL'S HALLWAY - NORTH WING - NIGHT

     A panicked Theo runs out of Nell's room into the hallway.

                               THEO
                   Luke... Jim...!

     INT. CROSS HALL - NIGHT

     Halls sprawl away into darkness in all directions as Nell tries to
     feel out where she is, and realizes she's lost.  Just like Theo and 
     she were before.  But now it's night.  And she's alone.  She's been 
     tricked.

     Panting, she stops, presses herself against the wall.  Her breath
     catches.

     Across from her is a MIRROR.  Herself reflected in its tarnished
     surface.  But there is something wrong with it.  Nell steps across 
     to it.

     Her reflected self begins to SMILE.  But SHE'S NOT SMILING!  Nell
     writhes in horror, but can't pull away from the mirror.  In it, her
     GRIN WIDENS, INSANE.  The bottom half of her face is someone else's.

     BANG!  Nell recoils.  The sound breaks the spell, knocking Nell back
     from the mirror.

     BANG.  BANG.  BANG.  Nell turns and runs.

     INT. HALL OF PILLARS - NIGHT

     The banging chases Nell into the hall of pillars.  Nell turns to 
     face whatever it is that's coming after her.  The BANGING 
     CRESCENDOES... and then recedes, still audible, but like the thing 
     following her has taken a wrong turn.

     Another mirror on the wall.  Nell glimpses herself in it.  This time
     her EYES are someone else's, lit with insanity.

     Nell backs away, through doors into --

     INT. HALL OF MIRRORS - NIGHT

     -- the hall of mirrors.  Bang bang bang bang...

     The octagonal, mirror-lined pillars cast and re-cast her reflection
     throughout the room.  Nell is everywhere in plain sight, but hidden 
     by the very infinity of her images.  The BANGING grows louder.

                               NELL
                   Why do you want me?

     The BANGING ceases.  And then we see the real Nell standing there.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   WHO AM I?

     She turns around.  Her REFLECTIONS all TURN with her.  EXCEPT ONE.  
     For a long moment, we see it but Nell doesn't.

     And then she does.

     The REFLECTED NELL stands there, hands hanging, silent.

     Nell exhales in shuddering fear.  The Reflected Nell MOUTHS 
     compelling the real Nell to whisper with it:

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Welcome home, Eleanor...

     With that the Reflected Nell grins and her STOMACH SWELLS before our
     eyes, pregnant just like Carolyn Crain.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No.

     Nell runs.

     INT. HALL OUTSIDE GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

     Nell races down the long hall, bare feet flying, covering her face
     from MIRRORS left and right.  She stumbles into --

     INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- the greenhouse where she slips on the marble.  She kicks the door
     shut behind her and lunges for the spiral staircase, her horror
     driving her up and up, setting the rickety thing swinging.  We HEAR
     what Nell hears, the voices of children.

                               VOICES OF CHILDREN
                   Help us... help us...

                               NELL
                   I'm here... I'm here... I'm coming 
                   to you, I'm coming to you...

     Nell climbs higher and higher into the dark reaches above.

     AS SHE CLIMBS: through the greenhouse windows we see the night sky,
     the clouds driven by the wind, the moon, old vines wrapped aroud the
     skin of the greenhouse... and the shapes and shadows of the vines 
     seem to shift as if it was alive...

     Nell reaches the landing.  The stair case rolls back and forth 
     beneath her.  A beat.  And then BAM!  The door slams open below.

                               MARROW (OC)
                   Nell!  Nell, are you in here?

     Nell can only manage sobbing relief.

                               LUKE (OC)
                   Look, the stairs!

     Nell drags herself to the hand rail.  Marrow, Luke and Theo rush 
     into view below.

     They all react to the sight of Nell at the precarious top -- with 
     her insanely happy smile.  They think she's there to kill herself.  
     Just like Rene Crain.

     They all freak out in a chorus of 'Nell!  No, Nell!'

                               MARROW
                   Nell!  Don't move.

     Nell couldn't anyway.  She just grins madly, tears running down her
     face.  Marrow grabs for the stairs, but they shift under Nell's
     movement from up above.

                               LUKE
                   It's not going to hold your 
                   weight.

                               MARROW
                   Just stay there, Nell!

     Marrow mounts the stairs.  The metal support rods sing out under his
     weight.  And the whole thing pitches, rolling around as he goes up.
     Five feet.  Ten feet.  Fifteen feet up.  The sway gets wilder as he 
     goes.

     At twenty feet, with twenty more to go to reach Nell, he stops.  The
     stairs buck, sway out dizzily.  And then to his dismay, he realizes
     he's on the WRONG SIDE of the double helix staircase.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Damn it.

     He straddles the rail to climb over to the other half.

                               LUKE
                   Don't!

     The sudden shift is too much for the old stairs.  The support rods
     CREASE and then the whole enormous column of steel from where Marrow
     is standing to the ground BURSTS from its supports.

     Luke shoves Theo aside, and the bottom half of the stairs spirals 
     out in a massive, deafening COLLAPSE.  Marrow's cellular phone falls 
     out of his pocket and shatters in hundred pieces across the floor.

     The top half of the stairs remains, still hanging from the ceiling.
     Nell grips the railing at the top.

     Marrow hangs there by one hand over the razor tangle of steel below.
     He flails out for the other stairway, swings himself over to it.  It
     takes a moment for him to realize he almost just died.  A moment of
     paralysis.  This is no longer an experiment.  No longer fun and 
     games.

                               MARROW
                   Nell?  Are you up there?

     There she is.  Marrow forces himself to start climbing the shaky
     stairs.  Luke and Theo watch from below, tense.

     Then he's there.  Nell stands a mere arm's length from him on the 
     other side of the railing.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Come on, Nell.  You have to climb 
                   over and step back on the stairs.

     Nell barely seems to hear him.  Instead she looks at the DEFORMING
     SUPPORT RODS around her.  We HEAR the voices of the CHILDREN, 
     calling to her.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Nell!  Now!

     Theo, on the ground, calls up to Nell.

                               THEO
                   Nell, go with him!  Just go with 
                   him.

     Nell refocuses on him and then gingerly climbs over the railing.  
     She hangs there.  She looks down at the tangled steel below...

                               NELL
                   The children want me.  They're 
                   calling me.  They need me.

                               MARROW
                   Nell.  You will come here now.

     Nell looks UP at him, hazy.

     And THEN BEHIND MARROW: the shifting clouds, the moon, the vines... 
     and suddenly all these random elements behind him form a dark 
     hideous face and in front of it a hand, and the hand is rushing 
     forward to PUSH MARROW OFF THE STEPS.

     After we scream, NELL SCREAMS.

                               NELL
                   NO!

     And as Marrow falls forward, pushed by the force behind him, Nell
     grabs him... he is caught on the rail... As she has reached out to 
     him, now she has fallen into thin air, and she falls towards Marrow, 
     and they hold each other.  She has a hand... then a foot... she 
     slips... she holds on again... and reaches the staircase.  She grabs 
     on.

     A moment's peace... and then a new disaster: with a metallic POP POP
     POP the support rods spring from their anchors and the rest of the
     stairwell next to them drops to the ground in a catastrophic
     shattering of sound.

     Marrow looks behind him, to whatever it was that Nell saw over his
     shoulder.  He looks back at her.  Her eyes are closed, she won't 
     open them.

                               MARROW
                   We're going down the stairs, Nell, 
                   I'm taking you down the stairs.

     He leads her go down the stairs.

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Marrow and Theo stand in the doorway to the shared bathroom watching
     Luke finish taping a trash bag over Nell's broken window.  Nell lies 
     in her bed, asleep or unconscious, it's impossible to say.  Luke 
     finishes, comes over.  Marrow is hushed, grim, exhausted.

                               THEO
                   She needs help.

                               MARROW
                   I'll take her with me to the 
                   University tomorrow.  I can't 
                   believe I read the test wrong.  I 
                   didn't see anything that looked 
                   like she was suicidal.

                               LUKE
                   You used the wrong test.

                               THEO
                          (indignant)
                   Will the two of you shut up!  God 
                   damn it!  Maybe the tests were 
                   right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, 
                   she's vulnerable, but I don't 
                   think she's suicidal and I didn't 
                   have to test her.  Maybe she 
                   wasn't trying to kill herself.  
                   Maybe she was really scared.  
                   Maybe she really heard voices.

     Marrow looks away, doesn't want to say this.  Theo reads the 
     feelings on his face.

                               LUKE
                   You're not telling us something.

                               MARROW
                   Watts.  Those were his keys Nell 
                   found.  His roommate called and 
                   said Watts left when he was 
                   supposed to.  I think he's here.

                               THEO
                   He's wandering around the house, 
                   and Nell heard him.  She thought 
                   it was ghosts.  Let's go look for 
                   him again.

                               MARROW
                   No.  If he's lost somewhere in the 
                   house... he'll have to stay lost 
                   until tomorrow, until the night is 
                   over.  What we have to do now is 
                   be together, with Nell.

     And they go.  Three scared people.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Luke sits on the closed toilet and watches Nell in the adjoining 
     room.  Light from the bathroom falls across her fetal, curled form 
     in the bed.

     The door to Theo's room is open too.  Luke glances over.  Theo lies 
     on her bed.  Marrow is slouched in a chair.

     Luke settles back against the wall.

     The HOUSE EXHALES, and the breath of the house is like the poppy 
     field in the Wizard of OZ; it brings on sleep.

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT

     Marrow is struggling to stay awake and his eyes finally close.  Theo
     breathes hard in the grips of some awful dream.

     This is what the House wanted.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell lies asleep, the ornate headboard looming behind her, black 
     with its strange plant-like splay of leaves.

     Nell draws a deep, sleeping breath... and her EYES OPEN.  She lies
     there, her breath still in her lungs, not moving, but sensing
     something.  A long beat.  When she lets her breath out, we can see 
     it in the cold.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Luke's head rests solidly on the wall.  His eyes are closed, unaware
     his breath is fogging too.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell lies there afraid to move, afraid to make the faintest sound.
     From the darkness above WOOD CREAKS.  At first it seems like someone 
     is walking on the floor above.  But it is coming from within the 
     room.

     The CARVINGS on the ceiling, the impossibly elaborate woodwork, ARE
     MOVING.  Incredibly slowly, with incredible subtlety: turning inside
     out, some of the forms lengthening, some shortening.  Carvings 
     changing here, changing there -- the ceiling coming alive -- with 
     some grand design we sense but cannot yet see.

     The wood grows out of the ceiling eating its way down into the tall
     bed POSTERS.  It crawls down the posters, straining the sinewy 
     baroque curves, swelling them...

     The CREAKING begins from the darkness of the wall opposite Nell.  
     Nell inclines her head to see.  Out of the wall two enormous BULGES 
     grow, side by side.

     From behind Nell, now.  The headboard GROANS, its shapes moving, the
     fan-like plant designs thickening and SPLAYING wide.

     Nell can't move, her mind refusing to understand what's going on.  
     The bulges in the wall DROOP to the floor.  And then we BEGIN TO 
     SEE: they are like a pair of KNEES.

     Understanding starts to show in Nell's eyes.  She looks up at the
     ceiling.  And now all the movement, the design behind the awful
     transformation of the ceiling is clear.

     It is a HEAD.  A visage of madness, of absolute horror, eyelids 
     sealing shut its blind face.

     Silence.  Nell's breath comes ragged.  Unable to speak, but trying 
     to call out.

     The EYES OPEN.  A SCREAM tears out of Nell's throat.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Luke is shocked awake in time to see Nell's room CONVULSE on her 
     just before the DOOR SLAMS in his face.

                               LUKE
                   Oh my God...

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     The entire ROOM RAMS itself at Nell, jolting her hard into the
     headboard.  THUMBS FOLD OUT of the woodwork, pinning her by the
     shoulders against it.  As the room lowers itself toward her, she
     SCREAMS out of her mind.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Marrow lunges into the bathroom, thrown from sleep as Luke stares in
     impotent shock.  Theo is there behind Marrow an instant later.

                               MARROW
                   What is it?

     Luke can't make any words come out.  Marrow shoves him aside, grabs 
     the doorknob and thrashes at it.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Help me!

     He braces Luke up, and then they lunge together, shouldering the 
     door.  It splinters out of its frame --

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- and stumble into Nell's room.  Marrow's mouth opens.  Luke stands
     speechless.  They're stricken by the sight: Nell SCREAMING, held by 
     the headboard as the deformed ceiling dips over her, the room 
     THRUSTING at her rhythmically.  Nell and Theo make EYE CONTACT.

                               THEO
                   Oh, Jesus.

     Marrow recovers, reaches out for Nell, and the FACE in the ceiling
     turns on him.  The GAZE stops Marrow in his tracks.  He looks up 
     into it and knows it's real.  Somehow, it is Crain.

     Luke appears from out of nowhere on the other side of the bed and
     SMASHES off one of the wooden hands with a large brass candelabra.
     Nell screams in surprise, but Theo drags her out of the bed.

     The head turns to them.  They flee.  Marrow backs away in awe and 
     fear.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Luke and Theo drag Nell down the stairs into the Great Hall.  Marrow
     brings up the rear.  They retreat for the entry as Luke puts his 
     jacket over Nell's shoulders.  Marrow stops, looks back up the 
     stairs.

                               MARROW
                   Wait a second!  Wait!

     All there is are the sounds of Nell, Luke and Theo making for the 
     hall to the entry.  The House is silent.

                               LUKE
                   No.

     Luke goes out.  But Nell pauses, stopping Theo with her.

     The House is quiet.  Marrow's hand still outstretched.  Nell looks
     around the room.  There are heads everywhere, faces: animal heads,
     humans, gods, all staring from the woodwork, the carpets everything.
     All turning to her.

     Theo looks around, but can't see what Nell is seeing.  Nell's breath
     comes faster, disoriented, yet aware...

                               NELL
                   They're all in here.  All the ones 
                   he killed.  They're just children!  
                   We have to help them!

                               THEO
                          (to Marrow)
                   Come on!  Why are we waiting?

     Even now, Marrow can't believe what he just saw, but Theo's voice
     brings him back.  He whirls, grabs onto Nell, helps Theo drag her 
     out.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY/GATE - NIGHT

     Four cars sit behind the massive, locked gate, as far from Hill 
     House as possible.  Marrow paces past the fence, staring out, the 
     road beyond leading out of this place, so close...

     Luke digs with a pen knife at the marble footing below the gate.  No
     easy way under it.  He stands and gazes at the razor-sharp spikes
     twenty feet up.  There's no way to climb this.

                               THEO
                   Oh my God we need to call someone?

     Marrow just looks at her and walks back to Nell's car.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - NIGHT

     Nell sits in the passenger seat of her car, wrapped in her jacket.  
     She stares out at the gate, at Luke and Theo consulting.  Marrow 
     appears in the window.

                               MARROW
                   You okay?

     Nell nods, but there's something about her not right.

                               NELL
                   Why did you bring me here?

     Marrow shakes his head, doesn't fully understand.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Why did you call me and tell me to 
                   look in the paper for the ad?

                               MARROW
                   Nell, what are you talking about?  
                   I never called you.

     Nell stares, dismayed, but Marrow is dead serious.

                               NELL
                   But you told me to look in the 
                   paper!  You told me I'd be 
                   perfect!

                               MARROW
                   Nell, the first time I ever spoke 
                   with you in person was the night 
                   we met here.

                               NELL
                   Then who called me?

     Hill House looms behind her, windows forming eyes, the carport a
     gaping mouth.

     Nell's dismay becomes a cold, terrifying understanding, and she 
     turns and stares back up at the House.

     Luke comes up with Theo on the other side of the car.

                               THEO
                   Nell --

                               LUKE
                   -- how much is this car worth?

     EXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY/GATE - NIGHT

     Theo pulls Nell away from the drive.  Marrow stands back from Nell's
     car where Luke belts in behind the wheel.

     Luke eases the car forward to the gate.  He advances until the car's
     bumper makes contact.  And then without further ado, REVS the 
     engine.

     The Buick grinds into the heavy steel bars.  The chain tightens 
     around the two halves of the gate, but shows not the slightest 
     strain.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - NIGHT

     Luke grimaces, shifts into low, pours on the gas.

     EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT

     The car fishes back and forth against the gate, hurling a shower of
     gravel on the other cars off to the side of the road.  Marrow, Nell 
     and Theo move back.

     One of the Buick's headlights breaks.  The grill mashes in.  For a 
     long moment the car struggles against the Gate.  No good.  Luke 
     eases up.

     Theo looks at Marrow.  Luke puts the car in reverse.

                               LUKE
                   Get the hell out of the way!

     They back way up.  Luke vanishes up the drive in the car.  And then 
     the Buick comes around the corner, accelerating, slicing down the 
     gravel road.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - NIGHT

     Luke sits way back in the seat, grits his teeth, floors it, aiming 
     at the gate...

     EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT

     The car SMASHES into it... and is STOPPED, collapsing, twisting in a
     deafening hail of steel and glass.

     The massive gate has BENT itself AROUND the car, holding it in its
     steel-grip.

     EXT. GATE - NIGHT

     Nell understands, the house will not let her go.  She turns away 
     from the gate, faces the House, mesmerized by the beauty in this
     monstrosity.  The House is calling her back, and Nell is drawn 
     towards it.  She starts walking...

     INT. NELL'S CAR - NIGHT

     Luke gasps for the seat belt, the wind knocked out of him, steering
     column pushed to his chest.  Marrow and Theo run up outside.  Luke 
     sees him, sees he's not getting any closer than ten feet, and he's 
     looking back at the gas tank.

     Luke gets the seatbelt off, tries to open the door but it's warped
     shut.  He struggles to get out from behind the wheel.  Sparks jump 
     from the battery.  Gas shoots out of the fuel pump onto the 
     shattered window.  He knows he's in trouble.

                               THEO
                   Hurry.  The gas!  Luke... The gas!

     Finally Luke gets free of the wheel.  It's agonizing to watch...  
     The passenger door is jammed shut too.

     He squirms into the back seat.  The rear doors are in the same
     condition as the front.  But the rear window is blown out.  He 
     crawls out onto the trunk.

     EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT

     Marrow hurries around the back of the car, staying clear of the lake
     of gas spreading about it.  Luke rolls off.  Marrow helps him up, 
     and gets him away a safe distance.

                               LUKE
                   I'm okay.  Okay.  Just my chest.  
                   Just my wind knocked out.

     Marrow looks up at the gate.  It is even more impassible than before
     with the gasoline-saturated wreck in it.  No way to try another 
     break-out either.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   Sorry about your car, Nell.

     He turns around.  The others do too.

     No Nell.  Luke and Theo look up.  Mute dread.  No Nell anywhere.

                               MARROW
                   Oh, no.

     INT. GRAND ENTRY - NIGHT

     The massive black door swings silently into the dark, vaulted entry.
     Marrow pauses there, looks about, and then enters.  He holds a tire
     iron.

     Luke does too.  He and Theo follow Marrow in.

                               THEO
                   I'm sure she went back to her 
                   room.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

     They stay to the outside of the stairs, padding silently up, trying 
     to get a glimpse of the floor above.  It's shrouded in darkness.

     They turn at the landing, eyes riveted to the top of the stairs.  
     They start up.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - NIGHT

     Marrow, Luke and Theo pause at the top of the stairs and peer down
     both long, empty directions of the hallway.

     Then Marrow turns toward Nell and Theo's room.  The brass 
     candelabra... in front of the open door.

     The rooms draw nearer, closer.  Not even the sound of their 
     breathing.

     The door is ajar.  Marrow pushes it open with the tire iron.  The 
     room lies in silent disarray.  Normal disarray.  The bed normal.  
     The ceiling normal.  No Nell.

     Marrow and Theo REACT and enter the room.  Luke lingers out in the 
     hall a moment.  And just as he steps in after them we HOLD on the 
     long, empty hall --

     -- and a FIGURE glides across.  Far down at the other end.  She
     disappears.  It was Nell.

     INT. STATUARY HALL - NIGHT

     Nell walks through the row of dark statues.  Carved faces watch her
     pass.

     INT. HALL OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell stands before the threshold of the horrific doors, once locked,
     now inexplicably OPEN.  The mythological frieze on the door split in
     half, a world cut in two, a seal broken.  Like something has come 
     out of its tomb.

     Nell steps into the blackness.

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Marrow comes out of the bathroom, joining Theo by the window next to
     her bed.  Luke stands in the doorway.

                               THEO
                   Was sure she'd be in here.

                               LUKE
                          (worried)
                   Where in the hell can she be.

     Marrow remembers.

                               MARROW
                   Oh no...

     INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

     Marrow, Luke and Theo enter the greenhouse, the heavy growth
     forbidding in the darkness.  They spread out on the parallel 
     walkways.

                               THEO
                   Nell?

     They reach the transept, turn down it toward the statue of Crain at
     the end looming white in the dusk.

     Dead silence.  Then Marrow SCREAMS.

     Under a thin layer of ice underneath the giant hand that protrudes
     from the pond we find Watt's body, as if the hand wants to keep him
     there forever.  Marrow did find his Watts, a horrifying sight.

                               MARROW
                   Oh my God it's Watts.

     As at the same time out of the mouth from the sculpture erupts a 
     river of blood, scaring the hell out of them.  Their clothes 
     splattered with blood, Marrow quickly leads them out of there.

     INT. LOCKED ROOM - NURSERY - NIGHT

     Nell stands there in the darkness, sensing the expanse of the room,
     turning... and kicking something on the floor.

     It is a wooden toy train.  Then she sees a rocking horse by her 
     feet.  It is a NURSERY.  Turn-of-the-century.

     And as Nell's eyes adjust, as she tries to see what else is in here 
     in the dark, she begins to make out WHITE SHROUDED SHAPES.

     Against the wall.  A bed covered in a sheet.  A table beside it.  A 
     HAND BELL.  A CANE.

     Just like Nell's sick room at home.  Nell realizes it, covers her
     mouth.

     The furniture is in EXACTLY the same position, though the sheets
     covering the pieces are stained, FAR OLDER.

     And on the wall, something in a frame is covered with a piece of
     sheet.

     Nell approaches it in trepidation and removes the cloth.  For a long
     beat, all we see is her face as it goes slack.  Understanding.

     The framed thing is a stitchery.  It says: A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING,
     EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE.

     Just like the one at home.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Marrow, Theo and Luke barge into the Great Hall.

                               THEO
                   Nell!

                               LUKE
                   We can't stay here looking for 
                   her.  She doesn't want to be 
                   found...

     Marrow and Theo look at him.  It's what they've been thinking, but
     haven't had the courage to say.  Theo stops suddenly.  Turns around.  
     The men notice, and pause.

     Then they hear it.  Faint.  Floating down from upstairs somewhere.
     Nell's TUNE.  It doesn't sound right, but it's hard to tell as it's
     coming from so far away.

     They look at each other, start for the stairs.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT

     Theo, Marrow and Luke stand at the end of the dark hallway.  They 
     stare at the gaping doors to the nursery at the far end.  The tune 
     is coming from within.  Abruptly, it stops.

     And instead of Nell's tune, there's a repetitive CREAK.  CREAK.  
     CREAK.

     In rising dread, Theo starts forward.

     It takes Marrow and Luke a moment to come after her.  The CREAKING 
     gets louder, unnerving.

     They get to the doors, Theo first.  She pushes them wide.

     INT. LOCKED ROOM - NURSERY - NIGHT

     They stop there, staring into the shadows.

                               THEO
                   Nell?

     And there, hunched over something turning a CREAKING CRANK of some
     sort, is Nell.

                               MARROW
                   Nell.

     Nell straightens from whatever it is she was doing and turns to 
     them.  Theo steps toward her, afraid for her.

                               THEO
                   What'd you come back for, babe?

                               NELL
                   Just had to be sure.

                               LUKE
                   Come on, Jesus!  Let's go!

     Marrow shuts him up with a vicious gesture, stays back himself as 
     Theo approaches Nell.

                               THEO
                   Let's go, hon.  Don't you want to 
                   go back to your little apartment 
                   where you can hear the buoy out in 
                   the harbor when the wind is just 
                   right?

     Nell smiles at Theo.  She's holding something.

                               NELL
                   Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have 
                   an apartment.

                               THEO
                   Then let's go get you one.

     Nell's smile softens even more.  Her voice is reassuring.

                               NELL
                   Don't worry about me, Theo.  I'm 
                   wanted.  Right here.  I'm home.

     A CHILL of fear cuts through Theo as Nell looks deep into her eyes.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   After all...
                          (beat)
                   I'm family.

     The thing in Nell's hand is a NEEDLE, the thing she's been cranking 
     an ANCIENT PHONOGRAPH.  She lowers the needle to the spinning 
     record.  And HER TUNE, the one she hums all the time, begins to 
     play.

     The others are frozen where they stand.  Marrow's mind reels at the
     implications of what he's hearing.

                               MARROW
                   No.

                               NELL
                   My mother used to hum this to me.  
                   Like her mother hummed it to her.  
                   And my great grandmother Carolyn 
                   hummed it to her.

     Nell turns back.  The others stand there speechless.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   I have to stay.  You better go.  I 
                   could explain it, but you'd never 
                   understand.

     And that, finally, galvanizes the others into action.  Marrow sweeps
     past Theo, grabs Nell hard, and swings her for the door.

                               MARROW
                   Come on.

                               NELL
                   No --

                               THEO
                   Please, Nell, just see us out.

     Luke closes in on Nell with Marrow, and there's nothing she can do 
     but let herself be pulled along.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

     Down the stairs they come, Luke out in front now, bounding down a 
     half flight ahead.  Marrow and Theo support Nell between them.

     Nell looks up at the hooded painting of Crain, but is spun around 
     and taken down the next flight.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Nell, Marrow and Theo reach the bottom of the stairs and pause.  
     Luke is halfway across the room, looking back to make sure they're 
     with him --

     -- and Nell digs her heels in, jerking Marrow and Theo to a stop.  
     She stares.  The others follow her gaze.

     She's looking down the connecting hall, out to the entry at the 
     front doors.  They're open.

                               NELL
                   In the night...

     The DOOR BAMS SHUT with a concussion that rocks the entire room,
     sweeping Luke's jacket under it.  The HANDLES TURN, LOCK DOWN.

     Stunned.  All stunned.

     A RUSH OF AIR.  The House EXHALES.  Silence.  And then CREEEEAK.  
     They cast their eyes back up the stairs.

     BUMP BUMP.  Far-off sounds, hair-raising, of infinite variety, carry
     down the halls.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   ...In the dark.

     Luke rushes from the room.

     INT. GRAND ENTRY - NIGHT

     Luke YELLS and throws himself at the front doors.  Marrow runs over 
     to help him and shoves the tire iron between the doors and PRIES.  
     Marrow throws the useless thing down and stands back.

     Luke joins him, and they shoulder block it together.  But this door 
     is MASSIVE.  There's no way.

                               LUKE
                   No you bastard!  Break!

     He roundhouse kicks it, hurts himself.

     Theo, afraid, watches the Great Hall behind them.  Nell puts her 
     hand on her shoulder.

                               NELL
                   It's not safe for you anymore.  
                   The children need me, and Crain is 
                   doing everything he can to keep me 
                   from them.

     Theo stares, appalled.  Marrow looks around, puts his hand up to 
     shush everyone.  The HOUSE MOANS, the BUMPING growing, searching.

                               MARROW
                   Come on.

     He rushes down the hall, Luke right beside him, Nell and Theo in 
     their wake.

     INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     Luke's first barging into the kitchen.  Big windows all along the 
     wall.  Huge windows.  Marrow follows him in, Luke's fear turning 
     into a vicious smile as he sees the towering windows.

     Nell and Theo are right behind in time to see Luke and Marrow 
     scooping up a table and chair respectively.

                               LUKE
                   Watch out!

     The men rush the same window, side-by-side, and let the heavy pieces
     of furniture fly from ten feet.

     The WINDOW SHATTERS, dozens of panes blown out into the darkness
     beyond.  But the metal LATTICE remains, the chair's legs stuck in 
     it.

     Marrow and Luke pause, taken back a beat.  They hustle over to it.  
     Theo and Nell stand a few feet back.

     Luke grabs the chair, levers it, tries to pry open the metal.  
     Marrow reaches through, knocking loose glass, trying to find some 
     sort of handle on the other side.

                               THEO
                   Hurry!

     Theo watches the door behind them.  Luke pries at the inch of metal
     between him and freedom.  It won't break.

                               MARROW
                   They don't open!

     Marrow slips on the broken glass and catches hold of the lattice
     LACERATING his ring and little finger.  With a cry of pain, he lands 
     on the floor.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Oh Jesus my hand.

     Nell and Theo fall to the floor to help him.  Marrow moans, and Nell
     grips his injured hand in hers.  Fast, like she was born a trauma
     doctor, Nell clamps off the blood with her fingers.

                               NELL
                   Give me your shoelace.

     Marrow tugs at his shoe, in shock, and looks at Nell.  She's calm.
     Terrifyingly calm.  And in that moment, he realizes she's not out of
     her mind.  She just understands things beyond what he could possible
     begin to understand.

                               MARROW
                   What'll happen to us, Nell?

                               NELL
                   Nothing, if you leave right now.  
                   There's a war going on all around 
                   us.  Don't get in the way, please.

     Nell cinches the shoelace tight around his wrist.

     Luke throws down the chair, giving up on the window.

                               LUKE
                   Shit!  All right, you 
                   sonofabitch...

     As he looks up at another one of Crain's painting hanging on the 
     wall.  Nell Theo with Marrow straggle toward the great hall.

     INT. VESTIBULE TOWARDS GREAT HALL - NIGHT

                               LUKE
                   Maybe this'll get your attention!

     Luke flicks a LIGHTER out of his pocket.

                               MARROW
                   Luke!

     Before anyone can stop him, he LIGHTS a towering TAPESTRY on fire.

     He races from one to the next, lighting them.  Theo and Nell help
     Marrow up, back away as Luke shoots by.

     All the tapestries are ON FIRE, blazing up like torches.

     At last, his rage spent, heaving, he moves to join the others at the
     center of the room.  They stare at him, appalled, afraid.  Knowing 
     he has done something wrong.

     Luke stops.  Maybe fifteen feet away.  He sees their expressions.

                               LUKE
                   What?

     Nell looks over at the burning tapestries.  Heat sears the stone,
     blackens the carved figures in the woodwork.

     The ruddy light casts deep shadows throughout the room.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   We'll get out after this wing 
                   burns down.  Let's go.

     But there's no need.  The tapestries are consuming themselves too 
     fast to ignite the walls or ceiling.  They all realize it.  As the 
     last flaming scraps of cloth fall to the floor and go out, there is 
     utter silence.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Luke looks at them helplessly.  An awful, impending beat.  Without
     warning, the huge PERSIAN CARPET he's standing on JERKS out from 
     under him.  Luke falls on his stomach.

     Stunned, Luke looks straight into Nell's eyes.  Then the carpet 
     slides fast for the FIREPLACE.  It whips up to the hearth and sends 
     Luke flying through the chain curtains.

     The others are speechless.  They can do nothing but watch as Luke 
     lays there on the ashdrop.  A long moment.

                               NELL
                          (to the house, to
                           Crain)
                   No!  No!  Let them go!

     She knows what is going to happen, is powerless to prevent it.  Luke
     stands up, has time to give her a look.

     And then the LION'S HEAD FLUE drops open behind him.  Luke looks 
     back into its iron eyes --

     -- and with SHOCKING SPEED the FLUE snaps shut again, taking Luke's
     head off his body.

     The decapitated corpse falls back in the fireplace like a puppet 
     with its strings cut.

     Nell, Marrow and Theo stand there.  Not sure of what just happened,
     their minds unable to accept it.

     A sound comes up in Theo's throat.  A sob.  A horrified whimper.  
     Marrow and Nell stand there speechless.  It's as if saying the 
     obvious will make it real:

                               MARROW
                   Luke.

     BANG.  The blood-splattered LION'S HEAD drops open.  Luke's head 
     falls out.

     Theo SCREAMS and SCREAMS again.  Nell backs away with Marrow, almost
     has the presence of mind to drag them away, but --

     -- CLANG!  The ASH DROP OPENS.  The sudden sound stops them in their
     tracks.

     As they watch, it's as if the House INHALES.  And BOOM!

     Out of the ash drop EXPLODES a hail of BONES, SKULLS, FLYING ASH.

     Nell, Theo and Marrow back up toward the Grand Staircase as TONS OF
     INCINERATED HUMAN REMAINS vomit from the fireplace, blasting across
     the floor, knocking over furniture with shocking violence.  Skulls
     bounce over wood.  Hundreds of them.

     Theo and Marrow cover their faces as shattered bits of bone, loose
     teeth pelt them.  Nell is immune.

     They run up the Grand Staircase toward the top and finally it can't
     reach them anymore.

     INT. MEZZANINE - NIGHT

     They look out at the full scope of Crain's horror.

                               THEO
                   Oh God, we can't get out!

                               MARROW
                   Nell, what do we do?

                               NELL
                   He played hide and seek with the 
                   children.  That's how he built the 
                   house.

     Marrow stares at her, trembling.  He glances around at the winding
     labyrinth of house.  Impossible.

                               MARROW
                   We can't hide in here!  We won't 
                   make it til morning.

     Nell looks at him, pitying.  Infinitely sad, but guarding them.

                               NELL
                   I know.

     Behind them the huge painting of Hugh Crain in a golden frame with
     sharp metal spikes, looks down at them.  The room inhales and 
     exhales, the bumping sound resumes.  A rumble runs through the house 
     and they all look down in fear toward the great hall where a cloud 
     of ashes still hangs in the air.

     Unseen by them, this rumble start to shake the painting behind them.
     The sound from the great hall makes Marrow and Theo back up more, 
     but Nell doesn't move... she senses something is about to happen and 
     she will fight it...

     She suddenly turns and sees the painting... in a flash she reaches 
     out for Marrow and Theo, pull them out of the way as the giant 
     painting with the huge skull, falls face down toward them.  It 
     misses them by a hair, but their clothes are shredded by the spikes.

     Marrow and Theo are-shocked as they back up right toward the GRIFFIN
     on top of the staircase.

     For a split second the BRASS Griffin right behind them, comes alive,
     opens it's fangs and claws and is ready to attack... but Nell sees 
     the danger, grabs a human bone and batters the griffin.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No, no, you leave them alone!

     And the griffin turns back into brass.  Marrow and Theo unaware of 
     what happened behind them.  They have to get out of there.

     INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Nell leads Marrow and Theo down the dark hallway, the twisted 
     woodwork along the walls frozen, but seeming poised to reach out, 
     trip someone, grab a sleeve.

     It is a nightmare House.  Doing what it was made for.

     The BUMPING they've left behind seems to vanish up and into the
     ceiling.  It gives chase, on the floor above.  Nell keeps looking 
     back, and every time she does the BUMPING seems to get more firm, 
     MORE LIKE A FOOTSTEP.  Calm, Nell urges them on.

                               NELL
                   Hurry.

     The FOOTSTEPS upstairs come faster; whatever's up there moving 
     better, more naturally.

     Theo and Marrow turn LEFT through an archway.  Nell looks back at 
     the ceiling.  The thing's moving fast.

     She dodges toward the archway where Theo and Marrow went, and STOPS.
     It's a wall.  Solid wall.  There's no archway here!  Nell backs 
     away.  Alone.

     The House has separated them.

     Nell tries to open any of the hall doors, but they are all locked.
     There's no other way then going back.

     INT. MEZZANINE - DAY

     Nell is back in the mezzanine, steps carefully over Crain's 
     painting.  The long white lace curtains in front of a side window 
     start to flutter in the wind... but the window is closed!

     Nell walks up to the top of the stairs, her back to the window, 
     calls out:

                               NELL
                   Jim!  Theo!

     No answer, and as she steps forward, listening for a reply, the
     CURTAIN BILLOWS OUT behind her, and in its movement, becomes for a
     split second, the image of CRAIN, GRABBING for her.

     Nell, oblivious, steps just OUT OF REACH, and as the breeze fails, 
     the contours and patterns of the billowing curtain dissolve into 
     chaos.  Nell glances back at it, just sees curtain, and looks up at 
     the open window.

     She turns from it, determined, and starts out to find her friends 
     and walks down the steps.

     INT. GRAND STAIRCASE/GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON THE BRASS GRIFFINS that guard the staircase.

     Behind Nell's back they all turn toward her, follow her with their
     eyes as Nell enters the great hall.  And they cower in fear for what 
     is about to happen.  Again Nell call's out for Theo and Marrow.

     And Nell doesn't see the scores of TINY ARMS OF CHILDREN that fold 
     out from the carvings in the high backed chairs in the hall as Nell
     carefully avoids stepping on the skulls and bones of the children 
     that cover the floor.

     Horrifyingly alive are these TINY HANDS as reach out for her hair
     after she passes.  We're screaming as they almost have her... and 
     Nell steps away.

     And then... CREAK... CREAK... CREAK...

     The terrified animal heads on the balustrade, their eyes flash in
     fear.  The lions above the big fireplace snarl restlessly.

     Cherubim, afraid, clasp hands.  Gods and men pay unwilling witness 
     to what is now coming down the stairs.

     The upper flight of stairs strains under the weight of the thing
     coming down, over our heads, coming down, down... and now at the
     landing.  The sound stops.

     Nell's BREATH escapes, visible in the cold as she watches, rooted to
     the floor in the Grand Entry.

     Darkness against darkness.  Something BLOCKS the glint of the gilded
     frame up on the landing.  Something huge.  A beat.

     And then a SHADOW sweeps across the scene, impenetrable, darkening 
     the stairs, wiping them from sight, like something gliding down 
     them.

     Before our eyes, out of the most subtle variation of shadow, 
     flickers into existence:

     THE SHAPE, tall, eight or nine feet, featureless, black, but in the
     proportions of an enormous man with his head bowed, shoulders 
     stooped.  And just like that, all it is...

     ...is a well of darkness and night once again.  We don't even know 
     for sure what we just saw.  But it is still there in that bar of 
     shadow.

     Nell goes rigid, not breathing, not seeing anything but the awful
     presence.  She is spellbound.

     BANG.  A door in the connecting passage opens, and Theo and Marrow 
     come out, between Nell in the entry and the thing in the Great Hall 
     beyond.

     In a flash the SHAPE is moving at Theo and Marrow.  They don't see 
     it, have their backs turned.

                               THEO
                   Nell!  There you --

     But Nell is looking past them.  They see her face and turn around.

                               NELL
                   Nooo, not them!

     What is coming at them makes the blood stop.

     The Shape rushes from the Great Hall, vanishing as it crosses the
     pools of moonlight, reforming darker as it hits shadow again, its 
     wake like a shockwave, invisible itself, but VISIBLE IN ITS EFFECTS:

     Theo SCREAMS.  Marrow stumbles back.  And then Nell's voice rings 
     out:

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Is this where she bashed your 
                   brains in?

     The onrushing presence STOPS.  Seems to turn its attention to Nell,
     standing there before the towering front doors.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   When you came in the door?  I bet 
                   that was the last thing you 
                   expected.  Right?  From Carolyn?
                          (beat)
                   You thought, oh, Carolyn, I've 
                   taken it all out of her, you 
                   thought, Oh, Carolyn, she's no 
                   threat.  Carolyn.  Great Grandma 
                   Carolyn.  Did you know that?

     Nell shows no fear.  There's a ferocious edge to her voice.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   She found out what you did, and 
                   she knew there was only one way to 
                   stop you.  And she stopped you, so 
                   you couldn't torture anymore of 
                   the living.
                          (beat)
                   But you wouldn't even let go of 
                   the dead, would you?  Well, now 
                   I'm here.  They called me.  Did 
                   you know that?  They've been 
                   crying out for help for a long 
                   time.  And I heard them.

     She points out at the human remains strewn all over the Great Hall.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   And I won't let you hurt them 
                   anymore.

     The SHAPE hovers there, silent.  Air and shadow distort around it.  
     The carved animal heads on the Newell posts and walls loll back and 
     forth, alive then not-alive.  Pieces of furniture stamp in fury, try 
     to animate themselves, but can't find limbs that work.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Come on, Hugh Crain, you know what 
                   to do.  We've both been here 
                   before.

     The SHAPE HOWLS FORWARD, knocking everyone out of their seats.  It
     flies across the floor at Nell.

     Marrow and Theo are slammed against the walls out of its way.

     Nell OPENS WIDE HER ARMS in an EMBRACE.

     It's ON HER, but just as it seems to hit, it SPLITS like she went
     right through it.  The SHAPE and all the debris in its wake IMPACTS
     deep in the enormous doors.

     The carved WOODWORK seems to suck it all in, cracking, groaning.  
     And then all the SCREAMS are cut off.

     Nell stands there with her arms spread.  A long moment.

     She opens her eyes.

     And then the woodwork LASHES OUT, grabs her from behind, slams her
     back against the doors.  THE BLOW HAS KILLED HER.

     We feel her bones break as she crumples, is drawn into the woodwork.

     And for a few seconds Nell's body just hangs there... and then it
     gently falls down.

     Theo lets out a horrified cry as she runs toward Nell.

                               THEO
                   NELL!

     Marrow gets up off the floor in terror and awe, his life his 
     beliefs changed forever.  He walks over to Nell and feels her pulse, 
     knowing it is a useless gesture as Theo softly moans over Nell.

     And as the camera pans up across the entry door, we see a new 
     carving in the sculpted doors.  It is a woman and as we move in we 
     can see that she wears the same necklace as Nell...

     INT. HILL HOUSE FRONT DOORS, ENTRY - EARLY MORNING

     The HOUSE INHALES.  And BOOM!

     The front doors blast wide.  Every door in the entry slams open.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

     Against the early light of a rising sun, the silhouette of Hill 
     House. Every window and every door in the House is open, each and 
     every one CRYING OUT with a different, unintelligible voice, like a 
     soul, the soul of a child, escaping from each one.

     EXT. GATE - DAWN

     Theo and Marrow stand on the far side of Nell's wrecked car.  On the
     other side of the gate Mr. Dudley is undoing the chain.  Mrs. Dudley
     stares at the ragged duo.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                          (her final verdict)
                   City people.

     Mr. Dudley can barely get one side of the gate open with the car
     crushed in it.  Theo and Marrow emerge, dazed, into the real world
     again.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   You find out what you wanted to 
                   know, mister?

     Marrow stares at him, he's an exhausted man.  He walks away, Theo
     beside him.

                               THEO
                   I'm not going back to New York 
                   City.  I'm going to find an 
                   apartment with a little flower 
                   garden, where you can just see the 
                   ocean and at night, when the wind 
                   comes in just right, you can hear 
                   the sound of the harbor.  What 
                   about you?

                               MARROW
                   I'm a scientist.  I just conducted 
                   an experiment.  Now I have to 
                   write it up.

                               THEO
                   But the experiment was a failure.

     Now, we could have him say this line...

                               MARROW
                   Was it?

     But he should just look at her, and say the same thing with his 
     eyes.

     We pull back.

     EXT. BERKSHIRE HILLS - DAY (AERIAL)

     The summer hills lie green, passing fast underneath.  Clearings loom
     out of the forest ahead.  And there, its sprawling stone in the
     sunshine, rises Hill House.

                                                       FADE OUT.



     ALTERNATE ENDING

     EXT. GATE - DAWN

     Theo and Marrow stand on the far side of Nell's wrecked car.  On the
     other side of the gate Mr. Dudley is undoing the chain.  Mrs. Dudley
     stares at the ragged duo.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                          (her final verdict)
                   City people.

     Mr. Dudley can barely get one side of the gate open with the car
     crushed in it.  Theo and Marrow emerge, dazed, into the real world
     again.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   You find out what you wanted to 
                   know, mister?

     Marrow stares at him, he's an exhausted man.  He walks away, Theo
     beside him.

     As they walk away, the SOUND OF APPLAUSE comes up.

                                                       WE DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. PRINTING PLANT - DAY

     Where the applause turns out to be the sound of a press finishing a
     run of a book.  This could be shot in an old press in England, or a
     foundry, with a few pieces of equipment to suggest a press.  There 
     are stacks of books.  This is the printing press in Hell.  The NOISE 
     is deafening.

     The title of the book: FEAR AND PERFORMANCE.

     Marrow stands before a mountain of copies of the book.  A PRINTER 
     very proudly hands him a copy.

                               PRINTER
                          (has to shout)
                   First copy!

     Marrow opens the book.  The Printer looks at the page over his
     shoulder.

                               PRINTER (cont'd)
                          (reads)
                   This book is dedicated to Eleanor 
                   Vance, Luke Sanderson, Rene Crain 
                   and Carolyn Crain.
                          (to Marrow)
                   They'll be happy to see this.  
                   Their names in a book, it kind of 
                   makes them immortal, doesn't it?

     Marrow looks at him.

                               MARROW
                   In a way.

     Marrow studies the page.  We go into the whiteness of the page to:

     EXT. HILL HOUSE - DAY

     Where we find Theo.  The House is beautiful today, it's sunny, there
     are flowers outside, the mood has changed.  Theo is now softened, 
     she's found something better than what she had.  She goes into the 
     house.

     INT. HILL HOUSE - DAY

     Theo is in the House.  She looks around, walks up the stairs.

                               THEO
                   Nell?... Nell?

     EXT. BERKSHIRE HILLS - DAY (AERIAL)

     The summer hills lie green, passing fast underneath.  Clearings loom
     out of the forest ahead.  And there, its sprawling stone in the
     sunshine, rises Hill House.

                                                       FADE OUT.

     BEGIN MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE.

     At the very edge of hearing, the tone of human VOICES.  
     Unintelligible, babbling, eerie.  Then a loud FLAPPING SOUND.  It 
     shifts from one side of the theater to the other, like something 
     moving among the wall hangings.

     As the TITLE appears, the noise mounts, drowning out the VOICES,
     agitated, becoming violent, banging... inhuman.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. HOUSING PROJECT, CHARLESTOWN, MASSACHUSETTS - DAY

     ON a housing project in the industrial outskirts of Boston.  The
     BANGING seems to flutter away, leading us along, searching... to a 
     tiny balcony, one of dozens, ten stories up.  And there, the source 
     of the sound --

     -- A SHEET, snapping in the wind.  The umbrella-like clothes line 
     on which it hangs bangs against a dirty glass door as if trying to 
     get in.

     THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR a woman paces inside, agitated.  The VOICES 
     rise over the banging, becoming intelligible --

     INT. LIVING ROOM, NELL'S APARTMENT - DAY

     -- becoming a fight.  JANE, 30s, dark-haired, furious, wheels
     across a diminutive, neat, but poor living room.

                               JANE
                   It'll take a month to probate the
                   will, Nell!  A month!  Even if
                   Mother left you something, you
                   won't get it in time to pay the
                   rent.  So instead of complaining,
                   you should be thanking Lou for
                   getting you these two weeks to get
                   Mother's things packed.

     At first we can't even see who she's yelling at.  At first we don't
     even notice her.  Then we do...

     Holding herself, in a dim corner away from the light, small, plain,
     like a part of the faded room is ELEANOR VANCE, 20's -- Nell.
     She stares at the door.  The clothes line raps at the begrimed
     glass.

                               JANE (cont'd)
                   Nell?

     The wind dies, the banging stops.  Nell seems to hear Jane and 
     peers over at her, then across the room to Jane's bored husband,
     LOU.  He's turning a Franklin Mint commemorative coin set in his
     hands, studying it.

                               LOU
                   You're still going to have to
                   settle with your mother's landlord 
                   on the back rent.

     Nell watches Jane's little boy, RICHIE.  Unpacified by the 
     cartoons on the TV, he plows a plastic tank across a shelf through 
     neat rows of delicate PORCELAIN DOLLS.

                               NELL
                   I'm not going to stay.  I'll get a 
                   job.  I'll get my own apartment.

     Richie knocks a porcelain DOLL off, and it breaks all over the 
     carpet.  His parents don't notice.  But Nell feels it in the soul.  
     Richie stops.  A long beat.  He looks at her, insolent, then plows 
     on with his tank.

                               JANE
                   Nell.  A job?  Two months and
                   where is this job?  You have no
                   degree, you've never worked --

     Nell explodes in outraged fury, startling us.

                               NELL
                   -- I've never worked? --

                               JANE
                   You have no experience in the
                   world... the regular world.  What 
                   would you put on a resume?
                          (beat, softening)
                   Now we all appreciate what you did 
                   for Mother.  Isn't that right, 
                   Lou?

                               LOU
                   Eleven years.  Long time.

                               JANE
                   That's why we've been talking.
                   With me getting more time in
                   Accessories, and Lou at the shop 
                   all day, we need somebody to take 
                   care of Richie, do a little 
                   cleaning and cooking.  And in 
                   return you can have the extra 
                   room.

     She goes to Lou, puts a hand on his shoulder, proud of her 
     generosity.  All Nell can do is stare.

     And then: KNOCK KNOCK.  Like a shot Nell is out of the chair and
     turning for a set of FRENCH DOORS across the room.  It's all 
     reflex.  Nell catches herself.

     KNOCK KNOCK.  Richie, lying on the couch like he's sick, raps on 
     the wall with a wooden CANE and squeals:

                               RICHIE
                   Eleanor, help me!  I've got to 
                   pee!

     Nell REACTS, but rather than being amused or annoyed, a wave of 
     TRAUMA flickers over her face.  The reaction is so strong we 
     instantly know something is very wrong.

                               LOU
                   Richie, knock it off before I beat 
                   the crap out of you!

     Nell turns away, sick, breathing hard.

     Jane picks up a JEWELRY BOX from a dresser.

                               JANE
                   You're sure this is all of 
                   Mother's jewelry?  The lawyer said 
                   to make sure we took it to him...
                          (beat)
                   He said there might be some 
                   antique pieces.  Have you seen
                   anything?  Some of it might be
                   valuable.

     Nell knows what is going to happen to that jewelry.  Jane no longer 
     can bear the weight of Nell's stare, checks her watch.  She nods at 
     Lou.  Lou rises, pocketing the coin set.  Richie follows him out.

                               JANE (cont'd)
                   Think about our offer, Nell.  You 
                   don't know how hard it is out 
                   there.

     INT. NELL'S KITCHEN - DAY

     Nell rams through the door into the small kitchen, spotless, empty.
     And then bursts into tears.  Shaking, she digs in her back pocket 
     and pulls out a FINE FILIGREE NECKLACE.  Her mother's.  It's from 
     an age gone by.

     Clutching the necklace, she goes back out the door.

     INT. LIVING ROOM, NELL'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Nell crosses the living room straight for the closed French doors, 
     the glass obscured by gauze curtains.  She throws them open and 
     enters --

     INT. SICK ROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- what once was a dining room.  Transformed into a sick room.  
     Drawn shades.  Dim.  The first traces of dust.

     Nell lingers in the doorway a beat, daunted.

     A perfectly made bed.  The PILLOW, however retains the IMPRESSION 
     of a head.  Lodged between the bed and a nightstand, a CANE.  On 
     the opposite side of the bed is a plastic toilet.  I.V. stand.  
     Shrouded white shapes.

     On the wall above the bed, a framed needlepoint counsels: A PLACE 
     FOR EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE.  A bit of wisdom.  A way 
     to live a life.

     A way Nell has lived for too long.  Seeing it galvanizes her into
     movement.  She goes to an old armoire, a medicine chest, opens it,
     removes a BOTTLE OF TYLENOL WITH CODEINE and marches out.

     INT. LIVING ROOM, NELL'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Nell closes the doors on the chamber of horrors, exhales.  She has 
     been holding her breath.

     INT. NELL'S KITCHEN - DAY

     Nell sits at her tiny kitchen table, water glass and Tylenol in 
     front of her.  The necklace dangles from her fingers.  She stares, 
     mesmerized by it.  Then she undoes the hasp.  The clothes line 
     outside BATTERS louder --

     -- and, defiant, Nell puts the necklace on.  She closes her eyes.

     Silence.  The battering has stopped.  A BEAT.  And then the PHONE 
     RINGS.  Nell opens her eyes.  The phone RINGS.  Keeps ringing.  
     Nell, feeling the drug, finds her way to the phone and picks up.

                               NELL
                   Hello?  Yes, this is Eleanor.
                   -- Where?  Yes, it's right here.

     Nell listens for a long moment.  She picks up the classifieds, 
     flips through.  And there it is:

                         TROUBLE SLEEPING?

     WANTED - RESEARCH SUBJECTS.  $900.00/.WEEK + RM.&BD. @ BEAUTIFUL 
     OLD HOUSE IN BERKSHIRES.  PSYCHOLOGY STUDY.

     END MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

     INT. PSYCH OBSERVATION LAB - DAY

     The lab feels more like the video center of a security office than 
     a psychologist's laboratory.  Two banks of black and white monitors 
     give us images of men and women, different ages, different races, 
     wired to electrodes.  They are taking psychological tests, although 
     we never see the Testers.  The subjects are working through 
     variations on object manipulation and pattern recognition tests.  
     There are subtle differences between the two banks of monitors.  On 
     the left, the subjects are all twitching at exactly the same time, 
     on the right, the subjects are also twitching, but in no 
     discernible sequence.  The subjects on the left are better able to 
     concentrate on their tasks.  The subjects on the right keep 
     stopping, and going over what they have done.

     Two men, MALCOLM KEOGH, in his 50's, is a graying professor, the 
     head of the department; someone we trust.

     He faces PROFESSOR JAMES MARROW.  He is a man whose confidence 
     rests uneasily on his ambition, and in the tension between the two 
     is the power that makes him the teacher students love.  Right now, 
     though, he is defending himself before a Department Review.  This 
     is not a court martial with judges behind a desk, it's more free 
     form.

     The men are having a fight, and they are watched by OTHER 
     PROFESSORS.

                               MALCOLM
                   It's still an electric shock!

                               MARROW
                   Come on Malcolm, it's only seven
                   ohms, it's nothing, it's like a
                   joy buzzer!  And it's not about
                   the pain, it's about the
                   interference with concentration...

     Malcolm looks at the monitor.  This is Marrow's chance to explain 
     it again.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Look, look at what it does!  The 
                   subjects on the left, because they 
                   anticipate the shocks, make the 
                   adjustment, and lose nothing on 
                   their scores.  The subjects on the 
                   right, because the shocks are 
                   random, can't anticipate, and the 
                   distraction throws them off.

                               MALCOLM
                   Stop defending your science after 
                   the fact, Jim.  The department 
                   protocol for research is very 
                   clear about this, and you violated 
                   the rules.  I know, I know, I know 
                   that "Fear and Performance" is a 
                   big sexy idea, but as long as I'm 
                   chairman here you will need this 
                   department's endorsement to 
                   publish it, and right now I can't 
                   do that.

     At this moment, MARY LAMBRETTA, late 20's, Marrow's pretty T.A., 
     opens the door with an armload of files.  Whatever else she's 
     wearing, she wears glasses.  Marrow, seeing her, motions for her to 
     go away.  He doesn't break eye contact with Malcolm.  Mary 
     hesitates...

                               MARROW
                   Malcolm, this is essential work 
                   I'm doing.  Just think what my 
                   research can do for education.  
                   Elementary school classrooms near 
                   train tracks or airports, where 
                   loud noise is random; this helps 
                   to prove the need for sound 
                   insulation if the children are 
                   ever going to learn to read.

                               MALCOLM
                   And that will be a good place to 
                   end this study.

                               MARROW
                   No, Malcolm!  Individual 
                   performance is only part of it.  I 
                   know why baseball players choke 
                   for no reason, I know why 
                   violinists throw up with fear 
                   before every concert, and need to, 
                   to give a great performance, but 
                   what I want to know is, how fear 
                   works in a group...

                               MALCOLM
                   Not the way you've constructed 
                   your group, it's just not ethical!

                               MARROW
                   But if the group knows it's being 
                   studied as a group, you 
                   contaminate the results.  The 
                   deception is minor.

     Malcolm sees Mary Lambretta.

                               MALCOLM
                   Are you working with her?

                               MARROW
                   Mary, I'll meet you outside.

     She understands, and she closes the door.

                               MALCOLM
                   Why are you working with her?  
                   Mary Lambretta was thrown out of 
                   the department for trying to get a 
                   Ph.D. in psychic studies.

                               MARROW
                   And after she was thrown out, she 
                   needed a job.

                               MALCOLM
                   You don't believe in the 
                   paranormal.

                               MARROW
                   No, but she does, and that's all 
                   that matters.

                               MALCOLM
                   Does she know that's why you're 
                   using her?

                               MARROW
                   No.

                               MALCOLM
                   I, I just can't...

                               MARROW
                   She needed a job, Malcolm.  And 
                   she's smart.  And she helps me.

                               MALCOLM
                   I have a bad feeling about what 
                   you're doing.

                               MARROW
                   This is the last chapter.  Please, 
                   please give me clearance.  It's 
                   for science.

     Marrow waits.

                               MALCOLM
                   I'm gonna hate myself for this.

     But he nods.  Permission granted.

                               MARROW
                   Thank you.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LAB - DAY

     They open the door.  They walk out.  Mary is there.  She closes her 
     eyes, and does a gypsy voice.

                               MARY
                   I see a hostile man... he's (she 
                   describes him).  The hostile man 
                   does not believe in Madame Velka.

     This relieves the pressure.  Malcolm is not listening anymore and
     storms off.

                               MARY
                   You know what he's really upset 
                   about?

                               MARROW
                   What?

                               MARY
                   You're going to publish, he's 
                   going to perish... And why did you 
                   hire me for this?

     Marrow has a sly smile.  They go into his office through another 
     door in the lab.

     INT. MARROW'S OFFICE - DAY

     Long, narrow, badly lit, it's filled with filing cabinets, stacks 
     of unread textbooks still in publisher's plastic, a desk with 
     computer.  As soon as they enter, Mary looks at the phone.

                               MARY
                   It's for you.

     And then the phone rings.  He doesn't pick it right up, he lets it
     ring.

                               MARROW
                   You hear the vibrations in the 
                   wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in 
                   the wires, you feel it.  I could 
                   test it.

                               MARY
                   Test it.

     The phone still rings.  Marrow answers.

                               MARROW
                   Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.

                               MARY
                   How'd I know it was for you?

                               MARROW
                          (quickly)
                   Because it's my phone.
                          (back to the phone)
                   Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the 
                   boxes inside, thank you.  See you 
                   soon.  Thank you.

     He hangs up.

     Marrow is trying to read the first file as he goes to his desk.  
     Mary shows him a huge CORKBOARD covered with photos, articles, and 
     various items.

                               MARY
                   Here's how they're organized.  
                   Groups of five, very different 
                   personalities: scored all over the 
                   Kiersey Temperament Sorter just 
                   like you asked for.  And they all 
                   score high on the insomnia charts.

                               MARROW
                   Good.

     A PHOTO OF NELL falls on the floor.  Marrow scoops it up.  He holds 
     the photo of Nell up to Mary, and look at the written notes and 
     studies the graphs that go with it.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   This is correct?

                               MARY
                   Her mother died two months ago.  
                   She says she really wants to do 
                   this.  I didn't know if it'd be 
                   taking advantage...

     Marrow considers the lonely image for a long moment and then looks 
     at the graph of her test scores.

                               MARROW
                          (meaning the graph,
                           not the face)
                   What a beautiful profile.  How do 
                   you feel about her?  What does 
                   your intuition say?

     Mary balks at his teasing.

                               MARY
                   I put my favorites on the top.

     Marrow continues to study the files.

                               MARROW (OC)
                   Okay... this one's good... 
                   Extrovert Feeler... Okay... This 
                   one I like, too...

     We don't pay as much attention now to the cork board as to other
     images on the wall.  We find clinical-looking shots from Stanley
     Milgram's experiments: subjects appearing to scream in response to
     electrical shock.

     Rows of weeping prisoners in the Stanford prison experiment.

     Photos of victims crushed under the stands of a soccer stadium, the
     aftermath of a riot.  A picture of the Fuhrer before his mesmerized
     masses.  Mary opens a large envelope.  She takes out a photograph 
     that we can't see.

                               MARY
                   What's this?
                          (has to get his
                           attention)
                   What's this... this picture?

                               MARROW
                   That?  That's Hill House.

                               MARY
                   This is where we're going?

                               MARROW
                   Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?

     Mary studies the picture, and she can't answer him.  In her 
     glasses, we get the thinnest reflection of the photograph, a 
     glimpse of dark brick and high chimneys.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Nell, in a rust-wormed old Buick, glances from the road to 
     computer-drawn DIRECTIONS TO HILL HOUSE.  She HUMS A TUNE, soft, 
     lonely, like a lullaby but eerie, off-key.

     EXT. ROUTE 39 - DAY

     The car speeds down the country road, past old stone walls, out 
     into rolling meadow, its winding route taking it across the western
     Berkshires, farther and farther into the glorious hills.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Countryside speeds by.  She passes an antique store in a barn.  A
     handpainted sign warns MELBY'S APPLE FARM 100 YARDS.  Nell grabs 
     for the window handle, letting in air.

     She snorts, smelling, breathing like it was the first time in her
     life... sounding like a pig.  And it makes her burst out in
     embarrassing, animal laughter.

     EXT. HILLSDALE - DAY (ESTABLISHING)

     The white-steepled church, five stores and gas station of Hillsdale
     lie in a forgotten notch in the hills.

     EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

     Nell is pumping gas at a country station.  She is alone at the 
     pump.  As she finishes, she hears a BABY CRYING.  She looks up.  
     She is immediately drawn by the sound.

     She moves to a car at another pump.  The car is empty.  The windows 
     are rolled up.  She peers into the car, through the window, and 
     sees a toddler in a car seat.  The child is crying.  Nell looks 
     around, no one is there.  She makes faces at the baby, coos to it.

                               NELL
                   Hello Baby...

     She does a peek-a-boo game, and the baby stops crying, the baby 
     even starts to giggle.

     A VOICE from behind.

                               MOTHER (O.S.)
                   What's going on, what happened?

     Nell turns.  The Mother is a busy country mom, arms filled with 
     stuff from the gas station's market.

                               NELL
                   She's okay.  She woke up and she 
                   saw she was alone.

     The mother has the car open and the baby is smiling now.

                               MOTHER
                   Say thank you, Spencer.
                          (too much of an
                           explanation)
                   I was getting her something to 
                   drink.  She's been crying all 
                   day...

                               NELL
                   That's all right.

                               MOTHER
                   Of course you know, how many 
                   children do you have?

                               NELL
                   None.

                               MOM
                   Then you're a teacher.  Nursery 
                   school.

                               NELL
                   No.

                               MOM
                   You just... you seem like someone 
                   who takes care of children, lots 
                   of children.

                               NELL
                   Maybe... maybe someday.  I'd like 
                   that.

     The woman smiles in something like sympathy, and gets in her car.  
     When she does, we see a friendly GAS STATION ATTENDANT appear 
     behind Nell.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Umm, I'm a little lost.

                               GAS STATION ATTENDANT
                   Where you going?

     Nell takes out her computer drawn directions and an old map.

                               NELL
                   They sent me directions and I've 
                   got a map, but it's kind of 
                   confusing.  Here... it's a place 
                   called Hill House?

     His helpful attitude changes dramatically.

                               GAS STATION ATTENDANT
                   Hill House.

     He takes the map book and tears out the page and crumples it up.

                               NELL
                   What are you doing?

                               GAS STATION ATTENDANT
                   You don't want to go there.

     He turns abruptly and walks away.

                               NELL
                   Did I say something wrong to you?

     Nell slams the Buick door, and breathing hard, starts the engine.  
     She gets control, and puts the car in gear.  She's shaken.  Badly.

     EXT. COUNTRY LANE - DAY

     Nell's Buick bounces over a country road.  The car works its way up
     into the steep, switchbacking hills.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Nell looks out at the forest, feels a chill.  The road is more like 
     a tunnel through the forest than a road.

     EXT. HILLS - DAY

     Nell's car speeds through the trees, climbing the hills, higher and
     higher into the awesome solitude.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Nell takes a final switchback, and something off to the right 
     catches her eye, then is gone in the trees.  She watches again for 
     it.  There.  A glimpse of a gray stone property wall set back 
     twenty yards from the road.

     There it is again.  Moss-greened, twenty feet high, a wicked array 
     of iron spikes and glass mortared atop it.

     And then out of the tangled forest in front of her looms a pair of
     immense stone pillars.  Between them, a steel GATE as high as the 
     wall, chained and padlocked.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE GATE - DAY

     The gate stands immense.  Silent.  Forbidding.  Beyond them a 
     gravel drive curves away through the trees.  Nell kills her car, 
     gets out, instructions in hand.  No one in sight.  A long beat.  
     She reaches in and blows the HORN.

     The HORN shatters the air, rackets off the trees beyond the gate,
     echoing.  Silence.

     Nell blows the HORN a sustained staccato in annoyance.  The echo
     replies in a terrible, deafening battering of sound.  Nell covers 
     her ears.  Silence once again.

     In a fit of agitation she goes to the padlock and rattles it.  It's
     locked good.  She turns --

     -- and there is a man right behind her.  It is MR. DUDLEY, his hair
     tied back like an ex-hippie.  He stands between Nell and her open
     car door, weed spear in hand.  He smiles at her -- rough, dirty,
     massive.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   What do you want?

                               NELL
                   Oh!  You scared me.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Me?  No.  What are you doing here?

                               NELL
                   Are you Mister Dudley, the
                   caretaker?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the 
                   caretaker.  What are you doing 
                   here?

                               NELL
                   I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm 
                   supposed to check in with Mrs. 
                   Dudley up at the house.  Is she 
                   here?

     She hands him the directions.  He glances at them.  She uses the
     distraction to get into her car.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Maybe she is...

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Nell looks at the gate, some part of her aware it's a point of no-
     return.  Mr. Dudley eases over to her window.  Mr. Dudley gives her 
     one last look and goes to the gate.  He produces a keyring and 
     undoes the padlock.

                               NELL
                   Why do you need a chain like that?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   That's a good question.  What is 
                   it about fences?  Sometimes a 
                   locked chain makes people on both 
                   sides of the fence just a little 
                   more comfortable.  Why would that 
                   be?

     He unwinds the enormous chain, heavy turn after heavy turn.  The 
     gates swing in, revealing HILL HOUSE.

                               NELL
                   Is there something about the 
                   house?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.

     Grinning, Dudley steps aside and Nell rolls through.  And at that 
     he just grins wider.  Nell pulls away.  Disturbed, she watches him 
     in the rearview mirror.  She turns and in front of her sprawls Hill 
     House.  At center, the features of the oldest part of the House 
     dwarf all others: towering, eye-like windows and the jaws of a 
     Grand Entry with carved ebony doors.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY - DAY

     The car rumbles up the drive toward the carport.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Nell stops the car in front of the entrance, right inside the 
     carport.  In the silence all we can hear is her breathing.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE - DAY

     Her car sits in front of the house, tiny, alone.  Its brake lights 
     go off.

     The finger-like pillars of the car port seem like a hand pinning 
     the car in place under the House's gaze.

     Nell gets out of the car.

     Nell stares, daunted... yet there is something about the House.  A
     romance in its lilac heavy Gothic decay.  Nell feels it, is drawn 
     to it.

     EXT. GRAND ENTRY - DAY

     Nell, suitcase in hand, climbs the steps to the front doors.  On 
     closer inspection, the snaking shapes of the carved doors depict a 
     Garden of Eden.  At center on the knocker, a tarnished silver Adam 
     takes the forbidden fruit from his counterpart Eve.

     Nell lifts Adam and knocks heavily.  There is no answer.  Nell 
     looks around for some sign of life.

     Off to one side is a LADDER and PAINT CANS.  Somebody must've been
     touching up the window trim.

     When she looks back the door is AJAR a fraction of an inch.

                               NELL
                   Hello?  Hello?  Mrs. Dudley?  Mrs. 
                   Dudley, are you here?  Anybody?

     Tentative, she pushes it open into --

     INT. GRAND ENTRY - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- a vast entry towering away to a ceiling lost in shadow far 
     above.  Rays of light filter through floor-to-ceiling curtains.  
     Doors lead off in a half dozen directions.

     Every piece of woodwork or plaster in the house is carved, 
     filigreed, painted or ornamented in wild, ornate fashion.  It 
     overwhelms the eye.

                               NELL
                   Wow...

     She turns around, sets her suitcase on the marble floor.  A short
     hallway straight ahead seems to let onto some vast space, dimly 
     lit.

     And then Nell hears a SOUND.  Carrying through the empty halls from
     some distant place: a low, plaintive MOAN.

     Nell freezes.  The MOANING stops.  Nell strains her ears.  And then 
     the MOAN again.  It comes from the short hallway ahead.  Nell 
     starts for it.  The Moan stops.

     INT. HALL FROM ENTRY TO GREAT HALL - DAY

     Nell moves down the hall.  It's dim, stale, lined with pier tables,
     candelabra.

                               NELL
                   Hello?  Hello?  Mrs. Dudley?

     Her voice echoes from the room beyond.  She follows her own voice
     into --

     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- A long, oval great hall.  Passages and doors lead off in all
     directions to God-knows-where.  A double-grand staircase at the far 
     end ascends to a landing shrouded in darkness before turning up the 
     next floor.  Magnificent ANIMAL HEADS carved on the newel posts 
     glare at her.

     Nell makes her way past clusters of furniture, stops at the center.
     Silence.  An ENORMOUS FIREPLACE dominates one wall.  Large enough 
     to stand in.  An iron mesh SCREEN hangs in its mouth.  Mantle and 
     chimney rise in dark, baroque masonry, becoming lost in the shadows 
     above.

     The MOANING sound.  Nell spins away from the fireplace.  The sound 
     rises from the door at the very back of the hall.  Nell takes a 
     step toward it.

                               NELL
                   Mrs. Dudley?

     She moves up to the door, puts a hand out to it.  The MOANING 
     rises. Nell pushes through --

     INT. 1ST FLOOR HALLWAY TOWARDS KITCHEN - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- into a much narrower, curving hallway.  Doors all along it.  The
     sound comes from the door right there across from the one Nell just
     came through.  She flings it open --

     INT. KITCHEN - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- and comes through into a vast kitchen.  A woman in black with 
     her back to Nell stands at a counter.  The moaning comes from a
     disreputable old CAN OPENER.

     Nell breaths, feels stupid.  The woman senses her, turns from her 
     cans of potatoes.  She is MRS. DUDLEY, sallow, unsmiling.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   It's make the soup or answer the 
                   door.  Can't do both.

                               NELL
                   Mrs. Dudley.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   So far.

     Mrs. Dudley wipes her hands, regards Nell, nods.

                               NELL
                   I'm Eleanor Vance, I'm with --

                               MRS.  DUDLEY
                   -- Dr. Marrow's group.  You're the 
                   first.

     Mrs. Dudley just stares with her sunken face.  It unsettles Nell.

                               MRS. DUDLEY (cont'd)
                   I'll show you your room.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY/MEZZANINE - DAY

     Mrs. Dudley glides up the stairs.  Nell follows, hoisting her 
     suitcase after her.  It appears the mezzanine ahead leads to a 
     hallway.  But as we draw closer what we thought was a hallway is an 
     ENORMOUS OIL PAINTING.  In it stands a man, his features lost in 
     the shadows above, only his body visible.

     The nameplate reads HUGH CRAIN.

                               NELL
                   Hugh Crain.

     Nell looks up: Mrs. Dudley waits coldly at the top of the stairs.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - DAY

     Mrs. Dudley leads Nell down a curved hallway, over aged Persian
     carpets and turns to a door on her left.  She throws it open, 
     stands back.  Nell enters.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - DAY

     Nell lowers her suitcase.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   The Purple Room.  You're going to 
                   be the first visitors that Hill 
                   House has had since Mister Crain 
                   died.

     The room is spacious, in a rococo gothic style with low-relief
     woodwork on the walls rising to a dark, coffered, ceiling of carved
     ivory.  A king-size bed, furniture, all in blue purple.  An open 
     door gives a glimpse of a bathroom.

     A large fireplace dominates one wall.  Its mantle is carved with 
     the faces of children, happy, at play, alive.  Nell touches the 
     wood, loving.

                               NELL
                   They're so beautiful.  Aren't 
                   they?

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.

                               NELL
                   Well, I've never lived with 
                   beauty.  You must love working 
                   here.

     Mrs. Dudley peers at her.  A beat.  And then, cryptic:

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   It's a job.  I keep banker's 
                   hours.  I set dinner on the dining 
                   room sideboard at six.  You can 
                   serve yourselves.  Breakfast is 
                   ready at nine.  I don't wait on 
                   people.  I don't stay after 
                   dinner.  Not after it begins to 
                   get dark.  I leave before dark 
                   comes.  We live in town.  Nine 
                   miles.  So there won't be anyone 
                   around if you need help.  We 
                   couldn't even hear you, in the 
                   night.

                               NELL
                   Why would we --

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   -- no one could.  No one lives any 
                   nearer than town.  No one will 
                   come any nearer than that.  In the 
                   night.  In the dark.

     And with that Mrs. Dudley grins, rictus-like.  She turns and closes 
     the door after her.

     Nell stands there a long moment, the room silent, heavy, old.  She 
     goes to the windows, peers out.  Nothing but forest for miles.  The
     sun is setting.

     Nell removes her windbreaker, opens her suitcase, takes out a 
     blouse and skirt.  Decent enough clothes, but cheap, the tags still 
     on them.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - DAY

     Nell emerges from her room in her new clothes.  The hallway curves 
     away into the distance, lined with massive, ornate doorframes like 
     the one to her room.

     Trying to get a better look, Nell searches the walls for a light
     switch, but can't find one.  She follows the chair rail back to --

     INT. MEZZANINE - SUNSET (CONTINUOUS)

     -- the mezzanine at the top of the stairs.  She searches in vain 
     for a light switch there.  Finally she spots a set of curtains and 
     slings them open.

     The light, late-day though it is, makes her wince.  The window 
     looks down on the driveway.  Outside a BEIGE CAR crunches over the 
     gravel.  Somebody else has arrived.

     Nell watches the car move past, trying to get a glimpse of the 
     driver, but from up here, all she can see is roof.

                               NELL
                   Finally.

     She backs away from the window, spins around --

     -- and out of the darkness, powerful, mad, looms the visage of Hugh
     Crain.  It is the painting.  It is only from up here on the second 
     floor with this curtain open that the FACE is visible in the late-
     day sunlight.

     Despite the artist's discretion, the lines in the man's skin, his
     eyes, his posture, cry of unspeakable sickness.

     Unconsciously, Nell takes a step back.  In the far b.g., near the 
     end of one of the halls, a DOOR stands open, the second or third 
     set of doors in the Gothic Hallway left of the painting.  Just as 
     it starts to come into view, and we're starting to see it, it 
     swings silently shut.

     But Nell has caught the movement out of the corner of her eye.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - DAY

     Nell stares down the long hallway.  Which door was it?

                               NELL
                   Hello?

     No response.  She starts down the hall, slow at first, then faster.

     She passes door after door, shadow after shadow, and as she nears 
     the end of the hall... there is no door here.  Not within 20 feet 
     of, where we thought we just saw it.

     A WHISPER.  VOICES.  Nell backs away.  And then LAUGHTER.  Behind 
     her.  It's coming from another stairwell.  Very real... and very 
     human.

     INT. BACK STAIRWAY - DAY

     Nell looks down from the top of the stairs.  Below Mrs. Dudley and
     THEO, 20s, exotic, sophisticated, in Vera Wang leather, wrestle with
     a pile of designer luggage.  Theo peers up.  She's dark, sexy in an
     amused, worldly way: someone who has seen and done it all.

                               THEO
                   You may think I have a sickness 
                   about packing, but asking people 
                   to help me shlep the stuff I take 
                   with me everywhere is a cheap and 
                   exploitative way of making new 
                   friends.  My name's Theo.

     Theo foists a very heavy bag off on Mrs. Dudley who looks like she's
     been handed a snake.  That makes Nell smile.  She comes running down 
     to help with the bags.

                               NELL
                   I'm Eleanor but everyone calls me 
                   Nell.  Eleanor Vance.  Nell.  I'm 
                   really glad you're here.  Really.

     Theo is a little thrown by Nell's gushing.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   What a beautiful jacket.

     Theo looks her over... and understands.  Nell is desperate to be 
     liked.

                               THEO
                   And what you're wearing, that's 
                   great, too.

                               NELL
                   This?  It's from a thrift shop.

                               THEO
                   What did it cost?

                               NELL
                   Fifteen dollars.

                               THEO
                   That'd be seventy in New York.  
                   You stole it!

                               NELL
                          (embarrassed by the 
                           simple truth)
                   It's all I could afford.

                               THEO
                   Wait.  You're not wearing that 
                   ironically?  This is really you?

                               NELL
                   I don't know what you mean.

     Mrs. Dudley, walking ahead, looks back at them.  Then continues up. 
     Theo makes a face at Mrs. Dudley's back.  Nell smiles, a little.

                               THEO
                   A week.  You and I?  We're going 
                   to have fun.

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - DAY

     Mrs. Dudley opens the door, letting Theo and Nell into a large 
     bedroom, a mirror-image twin of Nell's room, except it's decorated 
     in rich red-orange velvets.

                               THEO
                   This is so twisted.

     She dumps her stuff on the floor, grabs a banister on the four-
     poster bed, swings cat-like onto its high mattress.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   I set dinner on the dining room 
                   sideboard at six.

     Mrs. Dudley lays Theo's suitcase on a luggage stand.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   Breakfast is at nine.  I don't 
                   stay after dinner.  Not after it 
                   begins to get dark.

     Theo, back to Mrs.  Dudley, rolls her eyes at Nell.

                               MRS. DUDLEY (cont'd)
                   I leave, before dark.  So there 
                   won't be anyone around if you need 
                   help.

                               NELL
                   We couldn't even hear you.

     Mrs. Dudley looks up at Nell who mimics her scary smile.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   No one could.  No one lives any 
                   nearer than town.

                               NELL
                   No one will come any nearer than 
                   that.

     Mrs. Dudley smiles at Nell, but it's softer than before.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   In the night.  In the dark.

     Theo leans on the bed, musing at the exchange.  And then Mrs. Dudley
     backs out of the room, shuts the door.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   My room is right next door.  I 
                   think we share a bathroom.

     Theo has an interesting eye on Nell, she's studying her.

                               THEO
                   Don't worry, I probably won't be 
                   in here much.  Light sleeper.

                               NELL
                   That's why we're here.

                               THEO
                   What do you do?

                               NELL
                   I'm between jobs right now.  My 
                   last job... it... the person I was 
                   working for... the job ended.  
                   Over.  So... And you?

                               THEO
                   That depends.

     Theo pops a dress bag on the bed, unzips it.  Theo takes off her 
     coat, and is only wearing a black bra underneath.  Nell reacts, 
     turns away.  Back to the camera, Theo flicks off her bra, stretches.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   I'm supposed to be an artist, but 
                   I've been really distracted from 
                   work by love.  Do you know what I 
                   mean?

                               NELL
                   Not really.

                               THEO
                   Don't tell me Boston is different 
                   from New York.

                               NELL
                          (she knows this 
                           from magazines)
                   Ohh, sure, you have trouble with
                   commitment.

                               THEO
                   My boyfriend thinks so, my 
                   girlfriend doesn't.  If we could 
                   all live together... but... they 
                   hate each other.  It's hard to be 
                   Miss Perversity when you're the 
                   only one at the party.  D'you know 
                   what I mean?

                               NELL
                   No.

                               THEO
                          (delighted)
                   A blank canvas!  I could paint 
                   your portrait, directly on you.  
                   Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands?  
                   Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where 
                   do you live?

                               NELL
                   I don't have anyone.
                          (beat, lying)
                   But I do have a little apartment 
                   of my own.  It has a little flower 
                   garden.  You can just see the 
                   ocean.  At night, when the wind 
                   comes in just right, you can hear 
                   the buoys in the harbor.

     Nell peeks, sees Theo is decent, turns around.

                               THEO
                   That sounds really nice.  You're 
                   lucky.  But you know that.

     Theo comes over, straightens Nell's seams; this is an intimate,
     forward gesture.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                          (with meaning)
                   Come on, we've seen enough of the 
                   bedroom for now.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - DUSK

     The long hall is lost in shadow, its long rows of doors waiting in 
     the deadening silence.  A lamp on a pier table casts a small pool of 
     light.  The walls glow in rich tones, the low-relief carvings a 
     worm's-wood of shadow.

     Nell runs her hand over a wall panel as Theo peeks into a 
     neighboring room.

                               NELL
                   So much carving.  It's everywhere.  
                   On everything.

     Theo starts down the hall.  Nell follows.

     INT. RED PARLOR - DUSK

     Nell and Theo enter a room just off the landing, a lavish parlor 
     with the omnipresent panelled walls, lush red carpet, velvet 
     curtains sweeping floor to ceiling, heavy pieces of furniture.  Nell 
     watches Theo explore.  As Theo moves through the room, Nell's eye 
     lands on another painting of Hugh Crain.  Inside it's ornate golden 
     framework, distinctive little cherubs are embedded.  Cherubs of 
     Death... She runs her fingers over it.

                               THEO
                   Maybe you shouldn't touch --

     Theo twirls out of the room, Nell, anxious, behind her.

     INT. MEZZANINE - DUSK

     As they come out of Crain's study Theo stops at the top of the 
     stairs, Nell behind her.

                               THEO
                   Jeez.

                               NELL
                   I know.

     They stare out at Hugh Crain, the cracking and shadowing of the 
     swirls of oil that compose his face.  The figure is daunting, but 
     dead.  Just a painting.  Four different hallways lead into the 
     mezzanine, all dark and endless in the stray light.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Maybe we should wait for them 
                   here.

     Theo walks out, swings around.

                               THEO
                   Which one?  Pick any.

     Nell looks from one to another.  She doesn't want to.  But she 
     forces a smile and points to one on the left.  They both disappear 
     into the dark gothic hallway.

     INT. SMALL PARLOR (CONFUSING ROOMS) - DUSK

     Theo breezes into a small parlor with heavy green velvet curtains,
     panelled walls, rich settees.  Other doors lead off the room.  Nell
     follows.

                               THEO
                   This is a serious question, but do 
                   you think the Dudleys ever make 
                   love in this room?  They're alone 
                   in the house, no one watching.  No 
                   one... no one watching.  You can 
                   do what you want.

     Theo goes running for another door and is out.

     Nell, realizing she's being left behind, springs after her into 
     another mysterious hallway --

     INT. STATUARY HALL - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

     -- into a wide hall lined with niches and classical statuary.  Theo
     strides down it pointing left and right, bending over, straddling 
     the pieces, provocative:

                               THEO
                   Here.  Here.  Here.
                          (under a leering 
                           gargoyle)
                   Oh yes!  Oh yes oh YES!  Here!

     Nell laughs -- appalled and loving every minute of it.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Can't you just see it?

                               NELL
                   Theo!

     INT. HALL OF MIRRORS - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

     Through a narrow passageway, and large double doors they suddenly
     stand at the threshold of a fantastic ballroom lined with mirrors 
     and chandeliers.  Rows of mirror-coated octagonal pillars, rise to a
     vaulted, mirrored ceiling far above.  With the door opening, there's 
     a CLICK, and a mechanism of some sort is activated.  The FLOOR 
     begins to MOVE like a slow turntable.

     Theo comes right up, looks over Nell's shoulder.  Nell steps out.

     She traipses out across the room, her million reflections waltzing
     with her into infinity.  Theo dances after her.  They dance, not 
     quite together.  Nell stops and pronounces:

                               NELL
                   I love this house.  I really love 
                   this house.

                               THEO
                          (gently, recognizes 
                           that Nell is 
                           different)
                   You're okay.

     Nell blushes... and they burst out laughing.  They take off running,
     their reflections with them, stampeding for an archway on the far 
     side of the room and out --

     INT. 1ST FLOOR HALLS (VARIOUS) - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

     -- into yet another hallway.  They race down the hall, turn into
     another hall, then another, all dimly lit by the very last rays of
     day, all furnished in the House's dark, impossibly complicated,
     impossibly ornate fashion.  As they go, the mood is growing darker, 
     the women unaware that they are getting lost.

                               THEO
                          (having fun)
                   Rats!  We're rats in a maze!
                   That's what this experiment is
                   going to be!

     They open a door to --

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

     They stand at the end of a long hallway to one of the House's
     forgotten outlying wings.  It is dark.  Too dark.  Nell and Theo 
     regard the darkness.

     At the far end of the hall stand a pair of MAHOGANY DOORS, closed,
     almost black, oily-looking.  Surrounding them, an enormously complex
     geometrical frieze.

     The doors themselves are plain.  In their simplicity there is 
     something about them enormously disturbing.  It is as if the doors 
     are looking back at them, Nell goes cold.  Theo holds herself.

                               NELL
                   We should go back.

     Theo nods.  They turn around, Theo opening what she thinks was the 
     door they came through.

     INT. NARROW STAIRCASE - DUSK

     They hurry down a narrow staircase, Theo first, Nell right behind.

                               NELL
                   Theo, I'm scared --

     They fly down a set of steps, Theo flings open a final door -- and
     SCREAMS!

     INT. GRAND ENTRY - NIGHT

     The Grand Entry, where they bump into LUKE SANDERSON, 20's, charming
     and cynical.

                               LUKE
                   Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, 
                   I'm your basic tosser-turner, and 
                   you are...

                               NELL
                   Uh... Nell Vance...

                               LUKE
                   And what kind of sleeper?

                               NELL
                   Well, I... uh...

                               LUKE
                   Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.
                          (to Theo)
                   And you?  I'd guess...

                               THEO
                   You'll never guess.

     She won't answer.

     Marrow comes in the front door.  He looks at the house like 
     MacArthur studying a beachhead.

                               MARROW
                   There we are.  You're Eleanor, 
                   you're Luke, you're Theo.

                               ALL
                   Hi... hello... Dr. Marrow...

                               MARROW
                   And this is Todd, he just came up.

     TODD comes in.

                               TODD
                   Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.

                               LUKE
                          (1950's alien 
                           spaceman)
                   Greetings fellow insomniac.

                               TODD
                          (playing)
                   Greetings fellow sheep counter.

                               MARROW
                   And this is my assistant, Mary 
                   Lambretta.

                               LUKE
                   Greetings.

     And Mary enters.  Crossing the threshold, she catches her breath, 
     and when she comes into the hall and sees everyone, she also sees 
     the house in its detail.  And she has a bad feeling.

     Marrow is still putting everyone at ease.

                               MARROW
                   Eleanor, how was the drive?

                               NELL
                   You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.

                               MARROW
                   Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.

                               NELL
                   I'm really... honored to be part 
                   of this study, Jim.

                               MARROW
                   Well... we're glad to have you.

     His smile is devastating.  Nell reddens, instantly taken by Marrow's
     warmth, observant sensitivity.  Theo notices.

                               MARROW
                   Have either of you seen David 
                   Watts?

                               THEO
                   No, but Nell's been here longer 
                   than I have.

                               NELL
                   I only saw Theo drive up.

                               LUKE
                   Who's Watts?

                               MARROW
                   The man who completes the group.

     For a long moment they stand there, silent, looking at each other --
     polite smiles, but awkward, even Marrow.  One by one they all look 
     to him for a cue.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Well, why don't we get some dinner 
                   while we're waiting for him?
                          (beat, backing 
                           through the doors 
                           to the Great Hall)
                   Welcome to Hill House, everyone.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Marrow leads the way across the hall.  The others check out the
     furnishings as they pass.

                               TODD
                   These old Victorian houses are 
                   great, aren't they?

                               LUKE
                          (points to details; 
                           ADJUST FOR SET)
                   It's not Victorian, everyone 
                   thinks that the whole nineteenth 
                   century was Victorian.  This is 
                   gothic, this is English Craftsman, 
                   this is Romanesque.  This is... 
                   insane.  Who lives here?

                               MARROW
                   Nobody.  A local mill owner, Hugh 
                   Crain, built it in 1830.  He had 
                   no heirs, but he put the house in 
                   trust, and the farmland around it, 
                   with the stipulation that it never 
                   be altered or sold.  Crain's 
                   executors made good investments 
                   and for the last hundred and 
                   twenty years, Hill House has taken 
                   care of itself.

     Mary is shaken by the house, but she's honoring Marrow's request.
     Everywhere she looks, she feels the presence of something.

                               TODD
                   So what's this study all about 
                   anyway?  Mary described the kind 
                   of tests we'll be doing, but 
                   didn't fill us in on the big 
                   picture.  She said you needed bad 
                   sleepers, but this wasn't about 
                   curing the problem.

                               MARY
                   I can tell you what this is about.

                               MARROW
                   Eat first, questions later, Mary, 
                   please.

     They exit the hall, Mary and Nell last, and as they do, Nell sees
     Mary's strange look.  She stops.

                               NELL
                   Is something wrong?

                               MARY
                   No.  Just... when I saw your 
                   picture I had a feeling about you, 
                   and now that I meet you, I know I 
                   was right.

                               NELL
                   What?

                               MARY
                   Eat first, questions later.

     And suddenly awkward, Mary exits after the others.

     INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     A chandelier hangs unlit over a long dining table.  LAUGHTER.  At 
     the end Nell and the others sprawl over the remains of a dinner 
     which has been going on for hours.  Luke is opening another bottle 
     of jug wine.

                               LUKE
                   You know what I love about wine 
                   that comes in bottles like this?

                               TODD
                   What?

                               LUKE
                   Every year is a good year.

                               MARROW
                   Theo?  It's your turn.

     Theo twirls her wine glass, licks the dregs inside the rim, 
     thinking.

                               THEO
                   The rest of you may hate your 
                   insomnia, but I find it the best 
                   time of the day for me.  I'm 
                   alone.  Nobody's talking to me but 
                   myself.  My mind is racing with 
                   ideas, and I can think.

                               LUKE
                   Nah, you're going crazy with 
                   doubt, all of your mistakes are 
                   coming back up the pipes, and it's 
                   worse than a nightmare. --

     Nell isn't used to people being so direct and at the same time,
     playful.  She glances at Marrow's LEFT HAND: NO WEDDING RING.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Excuse me.

                               LUKE
                   Don't give me that look, it's 
                   everybody's problem, we just have 
                   different variations, I for 
                   example.  I fall asleep easily.  
                   But I wake up around two or three 
                   in the morning, every morning.  
                   It's that time of night that 
                   Fitzgerald called the deep dark 
                   night of the soul.  I stare 
                   into... the abyss.  Every night.
                          (breaks his own 
                           somber mood)
                   It's the price I pay for being 
                   such a jolly fellow.
                          (to Mary)
                   Y usted?

                               MARY
                   I think I'd fall asleep easily, 
                   but just as I start to feel 
                   comfortable, I see things in the 
                   dark.

     Nell hears this, Nell is tuned into Mary.

                               MARY
                   I feel the presence of something 
                   watching me.  It's not... scary... 
                   not by itself but... I don't want 
                   to go to sleep because I'm worried 
                   about the thing attacking me.  So 
                   when I finally do fall asleep, I'm 
                   like a soldier who's fallen asleep 
                   at her post.  I feel like I've 
                   betrayed myself.  Nell?

     Nell wishes she could hide under her plate.

                               NELL
                   All of you have such interesting 
                   problems.

     There's laughter.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No... Please, I know how that 
                   sounds but... You're all so 
                   articulate.  You know how to talk.  
                   I feel like I'm here under false 
                   pretenses.  It's silly, it's not 
                   like... well, all of you have 
                   trouble sleeping because you live 
                   in the world, and the world is 
                   complicated and scary, but 
                   nothing's ever happened to me.  So 
                   I don't have a reason to sleep 
                   badly.

                               MARROW
                   You wrote that you had trouble 
                   sleeping.

                               NELL
                   Yes, because someone was always 
                   keeping me awake.  Ever since I 
                   was little.  That was my job.  I 
                   took care of my mother and I had 
                   to be there for her all night 
                   long, and she woke up all the 
                   time.  And after she died, well, 
                   it's been a few months, but I 
                   still, I still wake up, it's... a 
                   habit.
                          (beat)
                   I know we've only known each other 
                   a couple of hours, but I'm really 
                   glad to be with people who let me 
                   talk about this.  I'm really happy 
                   to be here with you.

     Silence.  The others are embarrassed by her sincerity.  She's right,
     Nell is not of their world.

                               MARROW
                   We're glad you're here.

     He says this with enough sympathy for Theo to see his interest in 
     the girl in the thrift shop dress.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Why don't we move to another room?

     INT. RED PARLOR - NIGHT

     The HARP sings out, lively, expertly played by Mary.  Theo, Luke, 
     Todd and Nell are impressed with her skill.

                               MARY
                   It's an Erard.  Late 1870s.

     She plays, and as she does, she's aware of the room, and the house,
     and she sees something in a curtain or the fireplace, or a window,
     something at the edge of perception.  She suddenly stops.

                               NELL
                   What's wrong?

                               MARY
                   The harp is out of tune.

     She finds a key and begins TIGHTENING the strings -- as Marrow bangs
     open the door, briefcase in one hand, CELL PHONE in the other.  He
     can't conceal his irritation.  Marrow removes folders from his
     briefcase, passes them around while she plays.  Nell again studies 
     the Cherub of Death on the spine of the leather bound books.

                               MARROW
                   I'll have to count David Watts as 
                   a no-show.  So let's start.  Thank 
                   you, Mary.

     That was a little abrupt, she feels it.  Everybody finds a chair or
     spot on the sofa.  Mary remains on the stool by the harp.  Marrow 
     sits in a large winged-back chair.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   All right?  So, to answer your 
                   earlier question, Todd, why are we 
                   here?  What do we all need in 
                   life, what are the basics?  We 
                   need food, we need water, we need 
                   sleep.  Sleep.  All of you resist 
                   it?  Why?  What does that mean?  
                   Why do we resist sleep?  My field 
                   of study is the individual's 
                   psychology of emotion and 
                   performance.

                               LUKE
                   So why did you need the Addam's 
                   Family mansion for a scientific 
                   test?

                               MARROW
                   I thought it best to be isolated, 
                   to be in a location with a 
                   definite sense of history, and I 
                   wanted to make sure that it wasn't 
                   so pleasant you'd all sleep too 
                   easily.  You'll be taking a 
                   variety of tests, none of them 
                   harmful, and you've got the house, 
                   the grounds, and each other to 
                   keep you company.

                               THEO
                   When do we take the tests?

                               MARROW
                   Every day.  Basically we'll be 
                   hanging out together like we have 
                   so far this evening.

     Nell and Theo are looking through their folders: sheets of paper,
     bizarre geometric puzzles.

                               MARROW
                   Also, there is no phone service to 
                   the House and no TV.  I have the 
                   cell phone for emergencies.  We'll 
                   begin the tests after breakfast 
                   tomorrow.  

     The others shuffle through papers, Nell and Todd intent on them, 
     Theo interested but not overly so, Luke, bored.

                               MARY
                   Dr. Marrow, what is this house?

     When she says this, we should be seeing her from an odd perspective,
     the house's POV.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   There was once a king who built a 
                   palace.  The King's name was Hugh 
                   Crain.  A hundred and thirty years 
                   ago, when the Merrimack Valley was 
                   the center of American industry, 
                   Hugh Crain made two hundred 
                   million dollars.  That's forty-
                   three billion dollars in today's 
                   money.  He could have anything he 
                   wanted.  And what he wanted, was 
                   Rene, his banker's beautiful 
                   daughter.  Rene, and a house 
                   filled with children.

                               NELL
                   All the carvings.

                               MARROW
                   But there's a sad catch to the 
                   story.

                               MARY
                   What happened?

                               MARROW
                   There were no children.  Rene 
                   died, and then Hugh Crain built
                   all of this, and then he died.  
                   His heart was broken.

     Nell shifts, looks at the house with a strange feeling.

                               NELL
                   That's so sad.

     This has been tense between them, a gunfight.  POP!  A LOG in the
     fireplace makes everyone jump.  Theo relishes it, but Nell shudders.

                               MARY
                   I think there's more to the story. 
                   This house has its own music, 
                   Doctor Marrow, I can play it for 
                   you, I can hear it.

     Mary plays, channeling unholy music from the house, from the walls,
     from the curtain, from the air.  Her fingers fly down the harp to 
     the THICKEST WIRE and --

     -- TANG!  Like a steel whip the wire SNAPS.

     Mary SCREAMS in pain.

                               MARY
                   My eye... oh... my eye... my 
                   eye... oh... No...

     The others leap up in shock.  Blood lines the wall behind her.  She
     clutches at her eye, more blood spilling out from between her 
     fingers.

                               TODD
                   Oh Jesus.

     Marrow and Theo rush over to her as she shrieks in pain.

     Todd is frozen, pale, like he's about to be sick.  Nell turns the 
     OTHER WAY, but not because she's scared -- she's searching for a 
     shot glass on a side table.

     Marrow wraps Mary in his arms.  Her shrieking becomes a terrified 
     but quieter wail.

                               MARROW
                   Mary, let me see your eye.

     Nell appears by his side with the glass.  Marrow pries Mary's hand 
     from her face.

     Blood flows freely from the eyelid, but her eye is intact.

                               NELL
                   Here, cover it.  Don't let her 
                   touch it.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

     Marrow slams the door on the passenger side of Todd's car.  Mary 
     sits there, moaning, glass covering her eye, blood spilling out 
     around the edges.  Luke is on her side of the car.

                               LUKE
                   Keep your head back, that's it.

     Todd opens his door.  Marrow hands him a key.

                               MARROW
                   Here's my key to the gate.  Call 
                   me the second you know anything.

     Todd takes it, jumps in.  The two men watch the car drive away.

                               LUKE
                   That could have been worse.

                               MARROW
                   Yeah.

     As they turn back, Marrow taps Luke.

                               MARROW
                   Luke, can I talk to you?

                               LUKE
                   Sure.

                               MARROW
                   Because... well, I know I can 
                   trust you.

                               LUKE
                   Why?

                               MARROW
                   I've read your tests.

     That was half a joke, and both men smile.  Now they're bonded.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   There's something... I... I didn't 
                   tell you everyth1ng about the 
                   house, and about Hugh Crain... but 
                   I'm asking you not to repeat it.

                               LUKE
                   I can keep a secret.

     They go in.  The house is outlined by the sky and clouds and the 
     moon.

     INT. MEZZANINE - NIGHT

     Luke catches up with Nell and Theo as he reaches the mezzanine.  The
     painting of Hugh Crain, barely visible in the shadows, looms right
     behind.

                               LUKE
                   He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh 
                   Crain was a monster.  He said that 
                   he was a brutal, horrible man.  He 
                   told me that Crain drove his 
                   workers to early deaths.  Crain 
                   had children chained to the looms 
                   in his mill.  And listen to this: 
                   his beautiful Rene killed herself.

                               THEO
                   And why didn't Marrow tell us?
                   Doesn't he trust women?  That 
                   fuck.

                               NELL
                          (she's thinking 
                           about the story, 
                           not Marrow)
                   A monster?  But he built this for 
                   the woman he loved, like the Taj 
                   Mahal.

                               THEO
                   The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it
                   was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell 
                   us?

                               LUKE
                   He's trying to protect the 
                   experiment.  Personally, I don't 
                   think he's got a large enough 
                   sample for valid results, but as 
                   long as the money's good, and the 
                   food is good, I'm in.

     He heads off.  Theo turns to find Nell staring at the animal heads 
     on the stairs.  Theo touches her.  She starts.

                               THEO
                   Nell, it was an accident.

     INT. MARROW'S BEDROOM (PART OF CONFUSING ROOMS) - NIGHT

     Marrow, sitting at a desk, speaks into a digital voice recorder.  
     His voice is cold, analytical.

                               MARROW
                   Icebreaker exercise conducted over 
                   dinner.  Observed initial bonding 
                   among subjects and experimenter.  
                   After dinner first bland history 
                   of House relayed.  Nell appears 
                   most susceptible to suggestive 
                   history.  Luke, who tested at the 
                   bottom of the Levy-Mogel 
                   Confidence Reliability Scale was 
                   given the second part of the 
                   story.  We should see some results 
                   tomorrow.  Accident with harp, 
                   while unfortunate... complements 
                   the experimental fiction.

     He turns off the machine, and then he says, ruefully:

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Publish or perish.

     He turns off the light.  The shadows in the room are too much for 
     him. He turns the light on, and then pulls the blanket over his 
     head.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell finishes putting things away in drawers.  Theo watches, leaning 
     in the doorway.  Nell looks around at the room: and this is her new
     family's new home.  Theo smiles sweetly at her, comes over.  An 
     awkward moment, as the seriousness drains away.

                               THEO
                   Ever try putting your hair up in a 
                   French twist?

     Theo reaches for Nell's hair.  Nell pulls away.  Theo pauses.  Nell
     realizes she shouldn't have pulled back.

                               NELL
                   Sorry.  I'm not used to being 
                   touched.

     She moves closer to let Theo examine her hair.  Theo takes Nell's 
     hair, holds it up in a French twist.

                               THEO
                   You've been out of the world for a 
                   long time, haven't you?

                               NELL
                   Yes.  I've missed it.

                               THEO
                   No.  The world has missed you.

     Cautiously, Nell peers in a mirror at herself... and likes what she
     sees.  Theo lets Nell's hair drop.  Theo moves for the door.

                               NELL
                   Good night, Theo.

                               THEO
                   You, too.  Happy tossing and 
                   turning.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     As Nell steps OUT OF FRAME and starts undressing, the CAMERA finds 
     the carved mantle, the densely-packed scene of children at play, 
     their faces frozen in dark wooden smiles, their eyes blind but 
     staring OC where we sense Nell changing.

     Now in a long tee-shirt, Nell crawls up onto the high bed.  Its
     headboard is heavy, dark, engraved with fan-like shapes, maybe 
     plants.

     She draws the covers about her and peers up at the ornate headboard.

     Something about it bothers Nell, but she can't put her finger on it.
     She twists over on her side and turns out the light on the 
     nightstand. For a moment, all there is in the darkness is her 
     breathing --

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     -- then almost silence.  We pull back from the CHILDREN'S FACES on 
     the doors of the Great Hall to reveal the vast room standing in 
     darkness.  Covens of strange shapes consort in the shadows, things 
     that in the day would be lamps, the stuff of life.  But now, at the 
     very deepest limit of human hearing, it is as if SOMETHING EXHALES.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

     It is black at the top of the stairs.  The carved animal heads on 
     the balusters are all turned UP THE STAIRWAY, eyes starting in fear.
     Waiting for something to walk down out of that blackness.

     INT. HALL OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT

     Eyes.  Eyes of all the mythological figures.  STARING down the long,
     black hallway.  Awaiting something.  Afraid.

     At the end of the hallway, where all eyes are staring, the double
     doors, the ones that scared Nell and Theo stand shut.

     That something gathering at the edge of our hearing RISES.  Rises as 
     if the House itself is breathing.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     BUMP.  The sound thuds the stillness of the House.  Bump.  Bump.  
     Bump.  Deep, hollow, distant like a dream.  Nell sits up, still 
     asleep, body moving by reflex.

                               NELL
                   Coming, Mother!

     WHUMP.  The noise jars her consciousness, lighting up her mind, VERY
     REAL.  Nell remembers where she is.

     Bump bang.  It's coming from somewhere far off in the House.  Nell
     listens in cold dread.

                               THEO (OC)
                   Nell!

     Nell spins to the bathroom door, goes through --

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- the unlit bathroom, slamming the door to her room behind her,
     across and out the other door --

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- into Theo's room.  THUMP BUMP BUMP.  Nell finds Theo right in 
     front of her, hair wet, kneeling in the bed, clutching her covers to
     herself.

                               THEO
                   What is it!?

     The sound grows nearer.  Out in the hall.  Like something searching.
     Coming toward them.

     Nell lunges at the door.  Theo grabs to stop her, and Nell sees the
     door is DEADBOLTED.  There's a RUSHING sound on the other side of 
     the tall door.  Right there.  Nell freezes.  BUMP!  BUMP!

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Nell!

     Nell recoils to Theo's side, drags Theo out of bed to the corner of
     the room.

     Nell and Theo stare out AT US in terror.  BUMP.  BUMP.  BUMP.  BUMP.

     Nell and Theo's eyes travel over the walls, following whatever it is
     which now seems to be moving out here in the theater.

     The SOUND moves along the wall to the right, reaching its loudest as
     it crosses the back of the theater, then seems to come down the left
     side.

     Theo shivers.  Nell clutches her close.  Nell writhes, unable to 
     stand it any longer.  She jumps up.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Nell!

     Nell charges the door, screaming:

                               NELL
                   No!

     SILENCE.  The bumping goes dead.  Nell blinks, looks back at Theo.  
     But Theo is looking at her hands.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Cold.  Oh, God.  Feel it.

     She looks up in horror at Nell.  Their breath FOGS in the air.  Nell
     holds her hand up in front of her, and as we watch HER HAIR PRICKLES
     UP, GOOSEBUMPS WITH THEM.

     Her eyes turn up to the door, and: BAMBABAMBAM BABBA BAM!  The DOOR
     JARS in its frame, leaping from the blows of whatever's on the other
     side.

     Nell backpedals but slips on the rug, falls there on the floor right
     in front of the door.  Theo SCREAMS.

     Silence.  The BANGING stops.  With a RUSH, whatever is outside the 
     door is no longer there.

     Nell looks at Theo.

     Then Theo looks at the bathroom.

     Nell starts for it, grabs Theo's door, but it's designed to be 
     locked from the BATHROOM SIDE.  Nell looks up --

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- and takes a step into the pitch-dark bathroom.  Theo appears in 
     the doorway behind her.  Across the bathroom the door to Nell's room 
     is closed.  Nell dashes for it --

     -- but A SUDDEN SCUTTLING SOUND stops her dead.  On the other side 
     of the door.  Rasping over wood.  Like a thing without hands trying 
     to turn --

     -- THE DOORKNOB.  A long beat.  The metal creaks as something takes 
     hold of it on the other side.

     Nell, mouth open in cold horror, sees the deadbolt.  It's open.  
     She's in no-man's land: too far from the door to lock it, too close 
     to run.

     The doorknob TURNS, but just as the door starts to open NELL FLAILS
     FORWARD AND SHOOTS THE DEADBOLT HOME.

     The door jams against it.  Nell jumps back.  Theo grabs her back 
     into --

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- her bedroom and slams the door.  A long, deadly silent moment.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   It's in my room.

     But their BREATH no longer fogs.  Theo seems to notice the fact just 
     as Nell starts for her room and... KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.  Behind them.  
     At the door to the hall.

                               LUKE (OC)
                   Hey!  I heard screaming...

                               THEO
                   Luke.

     She grabs for the door and lets Luke in.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell's room stands silent, dark.  The door to the bathroom is shut.  
     The lock slides open.  The door swings in.  Luke stands there, the 
     two women behind him.

     Luke turns on the lights.  The room is perfectly ordinary, no sign 
     that anything has been in here.  The door to the hall is shut.  Nell 
     reacts.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Nell and Theo, wrapped in blankets, sit over mugs of tea at the
     kitchen table.  Marrow, across from them, clicks off his digital
     recorder.  Luke paces behind the women.

                               NELL
                   You really didn't hear anything?

     Marrow takes his glasses off.  Luke looks at him, then goes to the
     kitchen sink.  He turns both faucets on full blast and leans up 
     against the sink, arms folded.  Theo and Nell turn to look at him.  
     A beat.  And then:

     BUMP.  Bump bump.  It's the sound.  Luke goes over to the door, 
     pushes it open.

                               LUKE
                   Oh, look!  There he goes, ol' Hugh 
                   Crain!

     INT. GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

     VARIOUS SHOTS as the bumping seems to travel down the hallway.  A
     rushing sound with it.  They're the same sounds, from the scene 
     before, but somehow have none of the impact, none of the presence as 
     they did in Theo's bedroom.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Luke lets the door shut, turns off the faucet.  The sounds of the
     plumbing die away.

                               LUKE
                   Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm 
                   going to bed.  They can stay up 
                   talking another 45 minutes if they 
                   want, but I gotta try to get some 
                   sleep.

                               MARROW
                   Go ahead.

     Luke leaves the kitchen.  Theo and Nell watch him go.

                               THEO
                   If this was some sort of joke, I'm 
                   going to kill him.

                               NELL
                   You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.

     Marrow watches the exchange closely.

                               MARROW
                   The cold sensation.  Who felt it 
                   first?

                               NELL
                   Theo I think.  You've asked us 
                   that three times, Doctor Marrow.  
                   What's going on?

                               MARROW
                   How do you feel about Luke's 
                   suggestion that it was just the 
                   old plumbing?  Water hammer, 
                   something like that?

     Theo and Nell look at each other in frustration.  But Theo tries to 
     get her mind around the question.

                               THEO
                   I did just take a bath.  I don't 
                   know.

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT

     The room is a lot less frightening now, especially with the lights 
     on.  Nell sits on Theo's bed.  Theo looks at the walls, silent, 
     normal.

                               THEO
                   I did just take a bath.

     When Nell doesn't respond for a moment, Theo turns to her, sees her
     wrestling with herself.

                               NELL
                   Mother always banged on the wall 
                   when she needed me.  The night she 
                   died... I heard her, but I 
                   pretended I didn't.  I was just so 
                   sick of it all.  And then the 
                   banging stopped.  And in the 
                   morning... she was dead.  This is 
                   the first I've ever said this to 
                   anyone.  That was the job I had, 
                   Theo, it's the only job I've ever 
                   known, and I failed.  I'm actually 
                   a bad person, Theo.  The world 
                   doesn't need me.

     Theo shakes her head, brushes at her eyes.  The confession, on the 
     top of the fright, has moved her deeply.

                               THEO
                   Oh, Nell.  Eleven years.  With all 
                   due respect to your mother who I'm 
                   sure was a saint, I'd have called 
                   Doctor Kevorkian, if not for her, 
                   for me.

     It's such a horrible thought it makes Nell smile, and they share a
     tearful laugh.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Nell stands in the door to her room.

                               NELL
                   Good night, Theo.

     Nell shuts the door.  Theo is about to close her door, but 
     hesitates.  She puts on the light and goes to the tub.  She turns it 
     on, waits.  Just the sound of the water.  And no bumping.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell lies asleep under her sheet, the blankets off the end of the 
     bed.  HOVERING OVER HER, on the headboard, the carved faces of 
     children, peering DOWN.

     FLAP.  FLAP flap.  The fan-light at the top of the window right next 
     to the bed is OPEN a crack.  The sheer curtains flap listlessly in a
     gentle breeze.  The flapping grows louder, and with a sudden gust 
     the curtain BILLOWS OUT.  In its flowing form, we sense the SHAPE OF 
     A GIRL'S FACE, fleeting, so insubstantial we know we just saw her, 
     but maybe our eyes are playing tricks on us.

     The CURTAIN blows straight out, touching the bedposts at the foot of
     the bed, and there the wind catches the fabric hanging from them.  
     The Wind seem to sneak under the bedcover and the shape follows...

     Nell sleeps, oblivious, the WIND filling the room, stirring the
     tinkling crystal beads on the candelabra.  The shape of the little
     girl's face now travels underneath the bedsheets toward the pillows,
     toward Nell.

     Nell turns, restless, the AIR catches the edge of the pillowcase, 
     and travels towards Nell's face.  And for a split second there is a
     lifelike IMPRESSION OF A SMALL GIRL'S FACE.  Nell almost awakens.  
     The crystal beads stir, and in their tinkling, in the sigh of wind, 
     we hear:

                               GIRL VOICE
                   Find us, find us Eleanor.

     Nell's eyes open.  And like that, the pillowcase deflates, the air
     rushes up the curtain to the window, and is gone.

     Nell sits up, looks about her.  Everything seems normal.  Just her
     sheets, just the curtains, but on the headboard remain the carved
     faces.  Benevolent.  Nell settles back down on her pillow with a 
     sense of peace.

     INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

     Morning sun filters in through heavy drapes, falling on Marrow at 
     the dining table.  Nell squeezes behind him and the sideboard behind 
     him to get at the coffee.  Nell wears MAKE UP, badly applied, and 
     her HAIR IS UP in a French twist.

                               NELL
                   Sorry.

                               MARROW
                   For an American you do a good 
                   imitation of the British at their 
                   most apologetic.
                          (Veddy British)
                   Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, 
                   sorry...

     Nell smiles.  Theo walks in the door, sees Nell and Marrow, Nell
     squeezed in behind him.

                               NELL
                   Am I that bad?

     Theo is aware of Marrow's curiosity and fascination with Nell.  
     There's a jealousy brewing.

                               THEO
                   Well this is a cozy breakfast.

                               MARROW
                   Good morning, Theo.  Luke.

     Luke comes in behind Theo, tired-looking also.  He goes to the
     sideboard, starts helping himself to breakfast.

                               LUKE
                   After I went to bed, the second 
                   time, after the... noise... I had 
                   the best night's sleep of my life.  
                   Anybody?

     Marrow slept badly, we can see it in his eyes.

                               NELL
                   Yes.  I feel realy rested, too.  
                   Theo?

                               THEO
                   I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks 
                   good.

     But she means exactly the opposite.  Marrow looks over Nell's hair, 
     but she can't stand it.  Luke comes over to the table, drops into a 
     chair next to Nell, digs into breakfast.  Theo's face turns into an
     artificial smile.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Your makeup too.

     Nell sits there flustered.  Marrow senses the jealousy, isn't quite
     sure what to make of it, and intervenes.

                               MARROW
                   Eat your breakfast, Theo, then 
                   we'll get started on the tests.

     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

     CLOSE ON the complex PUZZLE of a field-cognition test.  Nell 
     scratches solutions, erases, and finally looks up in frustration.  
     She sits alone, tiny, in the murk of the vast vaulted Great Hall.  
     The enormous chimney occupies half the wall on one side of the room.

     Clusters of furniture -- overwrought chairs with animal heads, 
     splay-footed coffee tables, limbed lamps -- huddle in strange, 
     silent covens throughout.  Nell, in a plush chair, lays the work on 
     a table beside her.  The CLATTER of stone on stone makes Nell look 
     up.

     The fireplace looms just beyond her cluster of chairs, large enough
     for a man to stand in.  A piece of mortar must have come loose.  
     Nell stares at the chimney.  And a VOICE lets out a loud groan.

     Nell JUMPS.  She pops out of the chair.  It came from another circle 
     of furniture in the shadows.  A figure stands and comes over.  It's 
     Luke, stretching.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   I've been thinking about these 
                   carvings.  Kids.  Lots of kids.  
                   Fat little angel kids.  Wild kids.  
                   Kids with furry animals.

                               NELL
                   The children.  The children Hugh 
                   Crain built the house for.  The 
                   children he never had.

                               LUKE
                   Come on.  These are the typically 
                   sentimental gestures of a depraved 
                   industrialist.

     He puts his hand on a CHAIR, the back of which is heavily carved in
     the motif he just described.

     Nell turns him an appalled look.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   Theo was working in the dining 
                   room.  She's probably done by now.  
                   You finish?

                               NELL
                   Couldn't get the last ones.  You?

                               LUKE
                   I did okay.

     Nell looks at the test, tries to digest this.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   We could do this stuff anywhere.  
                   I don't know what he's up to yet.  
                   But like I said, that's the fun.  
                   It has something to do with this 
                   environment.

     Luke just smiles, rises.  We'll see.

     He walks off, his footsteps echoing in the vast room.  The door 
     shuts after him.

     Nell sags in her chair.  Then something catches her eye.  On a table
     opposite, a SET OF KEYS.  Nell goes, picks them up.  Car keys, house
     keys.  Must be Luke's.  She pockets them, thoughtful, but just as 
     she does --

     -- something MOVES in the fireplace.  So fleeting Nell can barely 
     see it, and we only catch a frame of it.  But the iron MESH CURTAIN 
     hanging in front of the hearth is STILL SWAYING.

     Nell stands there FROZEN.  The massive fireplace LOOMS before her, 
     like a monstrous mouth, black as pitch beyond the black metal 
     curtains.

     The swaying metal scrapes over brick floor.  Its eerie, repetitive
     screep cutting to the nerve.

     Nell sits paralyzed, rooted to the chair.  SCREEP.  SCREEP.  SCREEP.

     A SINGLE STRAND of NELL'S HAIR stirs toward the fireplace, and --

     -- SOMETHING INSIDE THE FIREPLACE MOVES BEHIND THE MESH!

     Nell CRASHES back over her chair, knocking over a lamp and table,
     tripping, stumbling out of the furniture.

     Holy shit.  Whatever moved in there was real.  Big, dark, like
     something's head.  It goes out of focus and we can't see it as we
     follow --

     -- NELL flying away, across the room in headlong terror.

     INT. FOYER - DAY

     Nell slams out of the room, skidding as the door slams behind her.  
     She sways up off the floor to run --

     -- right into Marrow and Theo's legs.  Nell aborts a scream, 
     realizing who it is.  Theo stands there in surprise, holding papers 
     in her hand.

                               NELL
                   There's someone in there!  There's 
                   someone in there in the fireplace!

     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

     Nell and Theo stand behind Marrow and Luke across from the 
     fireplace.  Theo glances at Nell.  Nell is shaken.

     Marrow nods to Luke, and they start forward together, Marrow among 
     the furniture to the left, Luke down the right side.

     The iron screens hang silent in the fireplace, black, impenetrable.
     Marrow and Luke come up on either side, Luke ducking this way and 
     that trying to get a glimpse through the mesh.

     They stop before it, neither breathing, both listening.  Marrow 
     steps forward and pulls one screen aside far enough to look in.  
     DARKNESS.

     Nell and Theo watch, apprehensive.

                               NELL
                   Jim...

     Marrow sticks his head into the fireplace.  For a long moment, 
     nothing happens.

     IN THE FIREPLACE: pitch darkness.  Marrow feels up the chimney.

     AND THEN SOMETHING SWINGS DOWN RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE!  Marrow
     doesn't flinch.

     He FLINGS back the screen, revealing the only things in the 
     fireplace: two massive andirons, and the still-swinging FLUE.  It's 
     cast-iron, forged in the shape of a LION'S HEAD.

     Luke throws back the other screen.  Theo comes over.  Nell follows.
     There's nothing else in the fireplace.

     Luke and Theo stare at Nell.  Marrow squats to study the hearth.  
     The large iron ASH-DROP is coated in soot.

     Not a mark on it.  He opens it.  Inside, a glimpse of ASHES and 
     CHARRED WOOD.  Marrow stands, looks at Nell.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Somebody was in here.  I saw him.

     Marrow looks at her, not sure what to believe.  Nell turns to Luke 
     and Theo for help.  Not from that corner.  Then Nell remembers, 
     reaches into her pocket and produces the KEYS.  She holds them up to 
     Luke.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Are these yours?  I found them 
                   right over there.

                               LUKE
                   Who drives a Toyota?

     Theo shakes her head.  They aren't Marrow's.  Marrow takes the keys 
     from Nell, turns them over.

                               THEO
                   Maybe they're Mary's.

                               MARROW
                   Mary came with me.

                               NELL
                   When I first got here I saw a gray 
                   car pull up.  I thought it was one 
                   of us.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE - DAY

     They stand on the front steps.  Nell's car is right there under the 
     car port.

                               NELL
                   This is my car.

     Theo gestures to a sports car on the circular drive.  Two other cars
     are with it.  They walk out into the driveway.

                               MARROW
                   And those are Luke's and mine.

                               LUKE
                   There's a carriage house around 
                   back.

     EXT. CARRIAGE HOUSE - DAY

     Together they approach a stable/carriage house off to one side of 
     the main House.  It looks old, unused.  They enter through a small 
     door.

     INT. CARRIAGE HOUSE - DAY

     Light filters in through gaps in the wood.  Luke opens one of the 
     main doors with a loud SQUEAK, the sun revealing a TARP-COVERED 
     SHAPE, a carriage.  Unused in a hundred years.  A row of tarp-
     covered carriages fill the stalls into the distance.

                               LUKE
                   Well, this lot is full!

                               THEO
                   He must have left.  Didn't like 
                   the looks of the place or 
                   something.

                               NELL
                   How could he have left without his 
                   keys?

                               THEO
                   Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe 
                   they're not even his.

                               LUKE
                   Then he's got to be in the 
                   house...

     As they leave, the CAMERA LINGERS on a covered shape in one of the
     stalls, SMALLER than the other carriages, it could be a car.  A 
     broken wagon wheel leaning against it.

     INT. STATUARY HALL AND SHORT MONTAGE THROUGH HOUSE - DAY

     Marrow, Theo and Luke move down the hall, opening doors left and 
     right as Nell stands at the center of it all.

                               MARROW
                   Watts!

     No answer.  The statuary peers down on Nell.  Dead faces on busts.  
     Blind marble eyes.

     INT. VARIOUS ROOMS AND HALLS - DAY

     Luke calls out.

                               LUKE
                   Watts!  Oh Watts!  Here Wattsy...

     INT. VARIOUS ROOMS AND HALLS - DAY

     Marrow is looking for him, too.

                               MARROW
                   Watts!  Can you hear us?

     INT. VARIOUS ROOMS AND HALLS - DAY

     Nell and Theo, walking into rooms.

                               THEO
                   Watts?

                               NELL
                   What's his first name?

                               THEO
                   David.

                               NELL
                   David?  David Watts?  Can you hear 
                   us?  David!  Daviiiiid!

     INT. KITCHEN - DAY

     Marrow comes through the kitchen.  Mrs. Dudley, chopping carrots,
     stands by the counter.  Only the slightest pause in the rhythm of 
     her chopping says she's noticed him.

                               MARROW
                   Do you know who these keys belong 
                   to?

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   No.

                               MARROW
                   I was expecting another guest 
                   yesterday.  A man, David Watts.  
                   Did you see him?

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   No.

                               MARROW
                   Is your husband around?  I'd like 
                   to --

                               MRS.  DUDLEY
                   -- Haven't seen him.

                               MARROW
                   Thank you.

     Frustrated, he continues on.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - DAY

     Nell and Theo walk down the long hallway behind, opening doors,
     checking rooms.

                               NELL
                   David?

                               THEO
                   Maybe he never came in.  If he'd 
                   come in, he would have left his 
                   bags at the door, right?  Or maybe 
                   he got here early, and went for a 
                   walk, and fell.  Maybe he's 
                   outside.

     Nell closes a door on the right, and then stops dead.  Staring.

     The shut, dark, door, the one that scared Nell and Theo earlier,
     awaits them at the end.  Ominous.

     Nell approaches.  Closer and closer.  The door nears.

     Nell wraps her arms tightly about herself and try's to open the 
     door.  It's locked.  Her BREATH FOGS THE AIR.  She doesn't notice 
     it.  But then she suddenly GAGS.  With a look of horror she recoils 
     from the door, choking, covering her face.

     Then Theo smells it.  The women are both sick from the smell.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Oh my God, what is it?  Oh, the 
                   smell... ohhh.

     Marrow comes into the hallway.  He sees them from a distance.

     ON the two women.

                               THEO
                          (looks to Nell for 
                           an answer)
                   Is it over?

                               NELL
                   No, it's getting worse.

                               MARROW
                   Nell!  What's wrong?

                               NELL
                   That smell... oh, God.

     Theo blanches, looks at Nell.  She smells it too, and in mirror 
     image fashion backs away from the doors also.  Marrow notices the 
     exchange, and watches them, intense.  And then, in a heartbeat, the 
     moment is over.

     EXT. VERANDA - DAY

     The RED LIGHT on Marrow's DIGITAL VOICE RECORDER blinks.  The device 
     is in Marrow's jacket pocket, CONCEALED from Nell.  They're sitting 
     in Adirondack chairs on the long veranda behind the House.  Marrow, 
     beside her, observes.

                               MARROW
                   What did it smell like?

                               NELL
                   It was very specific.

                               MARROW
                          (so tell me...)
                   All right...

                               NELL
                   In the bathroom in my mother's 
                   room, the toilet was next to an 
                   old wooden table.  It smelled like 
                   that wood.

                               MARROW
                   So... smell... is... Smell is the 
                   sense that triggers the most 
                   powerful memories.  And a memory 
                   can trigger a smell.

                               NELL
                   I wasn't thinking about my 
                   mother's bathroom.

                               MARROW
                   What happened after you smelled 
                   it?

                               NELL
                   I looked at Theo.  She had a look 
                   on her face.

                               MARROW
                   Like she smelled it too?

                               NELL
                   Yes.

                               MARROW
                   And then what happened?

                               NELL
                   I got more scared.

     Marrow thinks about this.

                               MARROW
                   Hmm.

                               NELL
                   I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the 
                   study.

                               MARROW
                   No you're not.  Something moved 
                   you.  You saw something.

     Nell looks to him.  He's sincere.  He believes her.

                               NELL
                   I don't know.  Maybe I...

     "Didn't" she almost says.  She struggles, embarrassed.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   I haven't been with people in a 
                   long time.

     Marrow settles in his chair, looks out at the forest.

                               MARROW
                   I really haven't either.

     Nell peers at him, doubtful.  Is she being made fun of?

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   I mean, I'm surrounded by people, 
                   day in, dayout.  Students, 
                   colleagues.
                          (beat)
                   But most of the time, even when 
                   I'm with them... you know... It's 
                   all about power, there's not much 
                   room for actually getting to know 
                   someone or having someone getting 
                   to know you.

     Nell's face flushes with compassion.  With longing.  Marrow looks at
     her.  He's vulnerable.  Needing.  She doesn't dare hope.  The moment 
     lasts a few heartbeats.

     He looks away.  A flicker of distress crosses Nell's face.  And then 
     she realizes Marrow is looking at --

     -- Luke.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   You have to see something.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - DAY

     Luke, Nell and Marrow mount the stairs, climb up and up.  They find
     Theo in the mezzanine staring at the wall at the painting.  She 
     turns and looks at Nell strangely.

     Nell, confused, turns around.  On the wall and the painting are dark
     stains.  Black.  Blue.  Runny.  Almost like something leaking from 
     the roof has run down.

     Nell steps back.  The stains are the letters N and O.  Pulling back
     farther: the rest of the word ELEANOR.

                               NELL
                   My name.

     She follows the streaking substance up, blinking in rising fear as
     more running letters appear.  The word: WELCOME.  And higher up, the
     last: HOME.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No...

     But the substance doesn't come from the ceiling.

     It is as if the oils on the PAINTING OF HUGH CRAIN have been boiled 
     by a heat gun and blasted off, running down from there.  Hugh's face 
     is gone.  In place of the face, the underlying ivory of the canvas 
     glares out... like a skull.

     Nell SCREAMS and runs away, the others calling out after her in 
     alarm.  As they vanish around the corner, the camera tilts down and 
     we discover smeared paint on the floor.  Smeared, it seems, WITH 
     LITTLE FOOTPRINTS in it.

     INT. RED PARLOR - DAY

     Nell, panic rising in her voice, confronts the others.

                               NELL
                   Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome 
                   Home?  I've never been here.  Who 
                   did this?

                               LUKE
                   It's somebody's idea of a joke.

     She looks at all three of them.

                               NELL
                   Who did this?  Why are you doing 
                   this?  I don't know any of you.  
                   You don't know me.  Why are you 
                   doing this to me?

     Luke shakes his head.  Theo starts getting pissed.  Marrow stands 
     there, arms folded, observing.

                               LUKE
                   I didn't do it.

                               THEO
                   You could have.

                               LUKE
                   So could you!  Is this some fucked 
                   up idea of art, putting someone 
                   else's name to a painting?

                               THEO
                   No.

                               NELL
                   Theo... Did you?

                               THEO
                   Maybe you did it yourself.

                               NELL
                   Why?

                               THEO
                   I don't know.  You've been alone 
                   for a long time, maybe you want 
                   attention.
                          (pointing to 
                           Marrow)
                   Maybe he did it...

                               MARROW
                   I didn't.  You know that, Nell.

     This is horrifying to Nell, being doubted and accused of something 
     so ugly if it were true.

                               NELL
                   I don't know anything.  Whoever 
                   did this, please, just... just say 
                   so... just... please... this is 
                   cruel.  Don't be cruel to me.  I 
                   can't stand it.  You don't know 
                   me.

     And she runs out.

     Nell grabs for the door to leave.

     She flings open the door.  MONSTROUS arms seem to grab at her.  But 
     it's only a wild-looking coat rack in the hall.

     EXT. 2ND FLOOR BALCONY - DAY

     Nell stands at the railing of a stone balcony on the house's second
     floor.  The air stirs her hair.  She peers up at the House's 
     roofline, its clusters of misplaced windows and other features like 
     so many screaming heads.

     Chilled, she pulls her sweater closer.  Marrow comes out onto the
     balcony from twin French doors behind her.

                               NELL
                   Are you coming to confess?

                               MARROW
                   I wish I were.  I wish I had done 
                   it, then I could confess and you'd 
                   be at peace.  That great moral 
                   philosopher Frank Sinatra once 
                   said to someone he loved, I wish 
                   you had an enemy, so I could beat 
                   him up.

     She smiles.

                               NELL
                   Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did 
                   it?

                               MARROW
                   I don't know.

                               NELL
                   It was a stupid thing to do.

                               MARROW
                   It was.

                               NELL
                          (for the absurdity 
                           of the idea)
                   Welcome Home.

                               MARROW
                   You'll never see it again.  Mr. 
                   Dudley's taking care of it.
                          (beat)
                   I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you 
                   something you'd like to see?

                               NELL
                          (still too shaky 
                           for enthusiasm)
                   Sure.

     INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

     Marrow lets Nell into a long, Victorian-era GREENHOUSE.  It's
     overgrown, lush, the leaded-glass panes above stained with years of
     condensation and pollen.  Vines and trees climb up the sides.  Beds 
     of flowers and plants line narrow footpaths of brick.

     Nell leans down to look into a WATER GARDEN with a STATUE OF A MAN
     bursting from the surface, grasping for the air as if he had been
     drowning.  A sudden rumble runs throughout the greenhouse.  And A
     CAVALCADE of water comes out of the STATUE'S mouth surprising Nell.
     She lets out a little yelp, and then laughs with Marrow.

     Nell loves the greenhouse.  It takes her breath away.

                               NELL
                   Oh... it's so beautiful...

     Nell makes her way among the plants.  She looks up at a TOWERING,
     DOUBLE-HELIX STAIRCASE which rises from the floor to a platform 
     which gives access to the roof.  Below the staircase are planters 
     filled with violets.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Violets.  Somebody must've died 
                   here.

     And then, out of the corners, comes Mister Dudley.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   That's where she hanged herself.

                               NELL
                   Who?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope.  
                   Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie.  
                   Don't know how she got it.

                               MARROW
                   That's enough, Mister Dudley.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   She stepped off the platform.
                          (he looks up, with 
                           a suggestive leer)
                   They had long skirts in those 
                   days.

                               MARROW
                   Thank you, Mister Dudley, 
                   please...

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   House is full of stories.  If you 
                   know how to read these things, 
                   it's an open book.  Just a 
                   different library than the kind 
                   you're used to.

                               NELL
                   Why?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Why'd she kill herself?

                               NELL
                   Yes.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                          (what other reason 
                           is there?)
                   She was unhappy.

                               NELL
                   Why?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Can't say.  Haven't been here that 
                   long.
                          (he's off)
                   Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to 
                   work.

     And off he goes.

                               MARROW
                   That's a horrible story.

     Nell looks up, and smiles.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   You're smiling.

     Marrow watches her as she moves about, takes a heavy, ripe bloom in
     hand, lifts it to her face.  While she talks, she walks, and Marrow
     follows.

                               NELL
                   I was just thinking how happy I am 
                   right now.  All my life, I've been 
                   waiting for an adventure.  And I 
                   thought, oh, I'll never have that, 
                   adventures are for people who 
                   travel long distances, that's for 
                   soldiers, that's for the women 
                   that the bullfighters fall in love 
                   with.  And here I am, and 
                   something is happening to me.  
                   Strange noises in the night.  
                   Paintings are calling to me.  And 
                   all it cost to get there was five 
                   gallons of gas.  I'm getting my 
                   adventure.

     For the first time since we've seen Nell, there is something to her
     which is simply... erotic.  Marrow follows her down one of the
     footpaths.  She smiles back at Marrow as he trails her.  She reaches 
     a transept in the greenhouse, and as she turns down it, there's the
     slightest sway to her gait.  Marrow follows her around the corner 
     into the transept.  At the far end the wall is completely overgrown.

     Nell looks up through the ceiling at Hill House looming grim 
     outside, distorted in the old glass.

                               MARROW
                   Someone is playing with you.

                               NELL
                   Why?

                               MARROW
                   I don't know.

                               NELL
                   It doesn't matter.  Even if 
                   they're tormenting me, someone 
                   wants me.  What I do with this is 
                   up to me.  I can be a victim, or I 
                   can be a volunteer.  And I want to 
                   be the volunteer.

     Nell glances at him, and for that split second she is raw, 
     passionate woman.  She walks away, the sway in her gait aching, 
     powerful.  Marrow is surprised by what Nell just said and stares at 
     her as she comes to the overgrown end.  Nell reaches out to the 
     hanging vines, pulls them aside...

     ...and A FACE stares out.  Gastly.  White.  Nell takes an 
     involuntary step back, a little gasp.

     The face is marble.  Blind eyes stare from stained cheeks.  It is a
     STATUE OF CRAIN.  Marrow comes over.

     It's an enormous stone tableaux of Hugh surrounded by cherubim.  The
     plants have attacked it as if trying to wipe its funerary presence
     from the greenhouse.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Hugh Crain.  Can't seem to get 
                   away from him.

     She laughs a little at herself.  Marrow joins in.  He helps her pull 
     the plants back to reveal more of it.

     She reaches out, touches the marble cheek.  Then daring, grins, and
     begins to hum her TUNE.

     Marrow steps back to watch her do a sensual slow-dance with Hugh
     Crain, pirouetting, her hips sliding past... hypnotizing Marrow.

                               MARROW
                   What is that tune?

                               NELL
                   I don't know.  A lullaby I guess.  
                   My mother used to hum it to me.  
                   And her mother before that, and so 
                   on.
                          (to the statue)
                   Hugh Crain, would you care to 
                   dance?

     She hums another two notes, and BANG!  The door behind her SLAMS 
     OPEN in a gust of wind, jolting Nell.  She stops and stares.  
     Outside the window, through the glass, she sees Mr. Dudley, staring 
     at her, he's been watching her dance.  The spell is broken.  Nell, 
     embarrassed, can't bear to look at him.

     A beat, and then Marrow goes over and shuts the door.  When he turns
     back --

     -- Nell is just vanishing around the corner, her rapid footsteps
     echoing in the vaulted room.

     EXT. REAR LAWN - DAY

     Nell hurries away from the House, across the rear lawn, ashamed at
     herself as much as she is spooked.

     In the distance Mr. Dudley is walking toward the House with cans of
     paint cleaner an a ladder.  Nell stops, watching him.  He senses 
     her, pauses, and smiles.

     Nell reacts.  Sees the ladder.  Then Mr. Dudley disappears into the
     House.

     Nell once again starts to hurry away, but looking back over her
     shoulder, almost impales herself on the rusted iron fence of --

     EXT. FAMILY CEMETERY - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- the tiny Crain family cemetery.  Nell catches herself.  A small
     swinging gate bars the way.  She hesitates.

     Nine moss-covered headstones show the wear of a long century.  Eight
     small headstones, one large one.  A half dozen unmarked stones in 
     the grass: stillbirths.

     Nell is drawn into the graveyard.  The large stone is RENE CRAIN'S.  
     The smaller ones are her children's.

     Nell's heart is breaking as she moves among them: the various names.
     One reads ADAM CRAIN APRIL 5th 1874 -- ... The rest of the date is
     covered by growth.  She clears it away.  April 6th, 1874.

                               NELL
                   Only two days.

     There is an EPITAPH, almost wiped out by lichens.  Nell kneels to 
     read it.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   The blest are the dead / Who see 
                   not the sight / Of their own 
                   desolation...

     Nell, disturbed but not knowing what to make of it, rises from the
     gravestone, turns to the next.  ELISA CRAIN AUGUST 21ST, 1878 -- She
     clears it away: August 21, 1878.  The blasphemous epitaph here:

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   A father's joy unjustly snatch'd 
                   by a jealous God...

     Nell is shaken, and dreading what she will find next, whirls to the
     one behind her: WENDY CRAIN JANUARY 1 , 1880 -- She clears it away 
     -- January 1, 1880.  And its graven commandment, so familiar, so
     comforting, now rings with terrible, malevolent promise:

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Suffer the little children unto 
                   me.

     There are three more grave stones, and after clearing away the 
     brush, they too show that the babies died after a few hours, or a 
     day.  There's the same symbol on the graves of the children, a 
     cherub of death.  We've seen this image before.  Nell backs out of 
     the cemetery, afraid.

     INT. MEZZANINE - DAY

     Nell hurries down the mezzanine to the doorway which leads to the 
     Red Parlor.

     INT. RED PARLOR - DAY

     She stands there a beat staring in at the volumes upon volumes of
     books.  Nell is unsure of what she's looking for.  She looks at 
     Crain's painting and recognizes the same Cherubs inside the ornate 
     frame.  The background in the painting IS THE RED PARLOR.  Then 
     recognizes in the painting an OPEN BOOKCASE BEHIND CRAIN.  
     Intuitively, she turns toward the same bookcase across from her and 
     is able to push it open.  Inside a small stairwell...

     INT. CRAIN'S SECRET STUDY - DAY

     Down the circular stairs Nell enters a very small dusty room.  
     Velvet curtains drawn shut, only a sliver of sunlight showing 
     through.  As her eyes adjust, she makes out the furnishings of a 
     late-nineteenth century office, Crain's secret office.

     The bookcases filled with business ledgers.  The business ledgers 
     are stamped with the cherub of death.

     At the end is an enormous desk.  Behind it a massive, carved chair
     covered with a sheet, only its lion-head arm rests protruding from
     underneath.  Nell realizes it's:

                               NELL
                   Crain's study.

     She moves for the desk.  An ENORMOUS MIRROR, its silver inner 
     surface flaking with age, tarnished, reflects the room, the desk, 
     and FOR A SPLIT SECOND, A SHADOW IN THE CHAIR.  Nell steps in front 
     of it, blocking our view.

     And when she steps past, there is only the dim, flaking image of the
     chair, the natural shadow of the room.

     Nell goes around the desk, stands over it.  The chair sits silent
     behind her, shrouded.

     On the desk sits a set of ledgers marked with mill names -- Lowell,
     Haverhill, Manchester -- and years: 1884, '85 and so on.  She flips 
     one open.

     THE LEDGER is a payroll account.  Names upon names of workers 
     rendered in sepia by Crain's severe cursive.  Notations in the 
     column beside it indicate man, woman, or child and the appropriate 
     wage for each class of worker.  Many of them, at least a third, are 
     children.

     NELL reacts.  Disturbed by it.  She shifts closer to that damn chair
     behind her.  The sheet hangs over it in such a way that someone 
     could be sitting there under it.

     She turns the page.  Columns indicate pay, and so on.  But one 
     column, at the very center of the book, hidden in the binding, is 
     unlabeled. Down the column, some names have a line drawn through 
     them, and at the end of the line, a CROSS.

     Nell follows them back, eyes searching across the ledger.

     She turns the page, pushes the book down revealing that concealed
     column, more crosses.  And more.  Her eyes flick back and forth.  
     The crosses are paired with entries for CHILD.  She looks their 
     names...

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Erin, Peter and Sean and Emily and 
                   Elizabeth... who are you?  And 
                   you?  What happened to you?  You 
                   died... How did you die?

     Nell turns the pages.  More and more crosses.  Dozens.  Scores.

     Nell sinks down into Crain's chair and tears come to her eyes.  We 
     see the book.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

     The painting is right there now.  The letters have been erased.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     We see the ledger, and pull back, and the ledger is in Nell's lap.
     Nell sits on the bed in her sleeping tee-shirt and undies.  Theo 
     looks at the book with her.

                               THEO
                   That's so sad.

                               NELL
                   There's hundreds of them.  This 
                   must be a record of the children 
                   who died at the mills, like Luke 
                   said.

                               THEO
                   Before he painted your name over 
                   Mister Crain.

     Theo hands her the bottle.  Nell takes it, tops off her glass,
     spilling.  Her face is red.  She grimaces as she tosses back a big
     swallow.

                               NELL
                   You really think it was Luke?

     Theo takes another swig.  She holds bottles of nail polish up next 
     to Nell's bare feet, testing the colors.

                               THEO
                   Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley 
                   had to clean it and he knows that 
                   he's in charge of all the messes 
                   so why would he make more work for 
                   himself and...
                          (beat)
                   You said the Good Doctor was with 
                   you.

                               NELL
                          (pondering)
                   I don't know what to think 
                   anymore.

                               THEO
                   Just think about one thing right 
                   now: What color?

     Nell finally puts the book down and takes a drink.

                               NELL
                   I've never had a pedicure before.

                               THEO
                   Well?

                               NELL
                   Red.
                          (into this now)
                   What else?

     Theo smiles and takes Nell's foot gently in her hand.  She begins to
     paint her toenails.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   See, isn't this better than a hit 
                   on the head?

     Nell looks down her long legs at Theo.

                               NELL
                   I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.

                               THEO
                   Me too.  Although I learned one 
                   thing about you, that you don't 
                   know about yourself.  You can be a 
                   pretty decent bitch.

     Nell shoots down the rest of the glass of wine.

                               NELL
                   I'll take that as a compliment.
                          (beat, trying to 
                           sound casual)
                   In the city, what kind of place do 
                   you live in?

                               THEO
                   I have a loft.

     Nell is thrilled with this.

                               NELL
                   A loft.  That's a lot of room for 
                   one person.  Probably.  Maybe 
                   there's room for...

     Theo looks up, understands what she's asking.

                               THEO
                   You want to move to New York, you 
                   want to move in with me?

                               NELL
                   I don't know, you know...

     Nell lies back, arms spread, lets the glass roll out of her hand.  
     Theo paints Nell's toenails one by one, carefully guiding the brush 
     strokes in along the skin.  Nell, unused to this, gives into the 
     pleasure, and Theo sees how easy it is to move Nell.

                               THEO
                   My place isn't like yours, Nell, 
                   it doesn't have a view of sea.  It 
                   doesn't have a view of anything.  
                   What's interesting about the way I 
                   live is what goes on inside the 
                   walls.  Living with me... My 
                   boundaries aren't very well 
                   defined, Nell.  Do you know what I 
                   mean?

                               NELL
                   I'm trying.  Have you ever kept 
                   something to yourself because you 
                   were afraid it'd ruin things.

     Theo looks up at her, unreadable.

                               THEO
                   All the time.

     Nell lets out a sigh.  Gently Theo's hand moves down the arch of 
     Nell's foot.  Caressing.  Nell lets her.

     Theo finishes Nell's last little toe, and then with the brush out of
     paint, runs it gently up the inside of Nell's calf.  Nell sighs.

     Theo lowers her face near Nell's toes, licks her lips: soft, near,
     red.  She blows.

     Nell raises herself up, peers down at Theo.  Sees the want on her 
     face.  A long beat.

     Nell breaks the gaze, looks away.  Theo reads Nell's look, and 
     releases her foot.  She sits back in the chair.  For a moment Nell 
     doesn't know what to do.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   I better go to bed.

                               THEO
                   Are you sure?

                               NELL
                   I think so.

                               THEO
                   Okay.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell closes the door and sits at the vanity brushing out her hair 
     for bed.  Her motions are languid in the light of the single small 
     lamp, off-balance with the wine.

     Her HAIR brushes out in long, even strokes.  The brush moves through
     it, lifting it and letting it fall.

     IN THE MIRROR the brush draws through Nell's hair, but as it does, 
     the hair divides in its wake LIKE FINGERS RUNNING THROUGH it.

     Nell freezes.  She's not sure what she just saw.  She runs the brush
     through again, and again it is as if something pulls it back from 
     her head.

     Again -- fast -- she runs the brush through her hair, and this time
     the hair SPINS UP IN A KNOT.

     Nell flinches, dropping the brush, knocking the shade of the lamp on
     the vanity a-wobbling.

     She's out of the chair in a flash, grabbing her own hair, staring at
     the space behind her.  Nothing there.  A beat.

     She steadies herself, feeling the alcohol.  Gets control.

     The Tiffany lamp rocks back and forth, crystal beads shimmering.  
     The light plays across the fireplace and mantle on the wall.  And 
     something there catches her eye.

     Nell feels her way across the room, not sure of what she's seeing.
     Over the sound of the wind outside, there's something at the very
     highest edge of hearing.

     She stops five feet from the mantle.  The swaying light catches the
     rich tones of wood.  Then darkens.  Illuminates it again.  Darkens.  
     The carvings of the playing CHILDREN in the wood SEEM TO MOVE.

     Nell stares in drunken fascination.  And as the first fear begins to
     rise in her throat, the wind dies down and in its place there is the
     FAINTEST TRACE OF CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER.  Nell's reaction changes... 
     to awe.

     Tentative, her hand goes out, shaking... and touches the mantle.

     It is hard and still.  No movement whatsoever.  Silence.  But the 
     FACES engraved in the wood all seem to be peering up at her, hands
     outstretched for her, hopeful.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE GATES - NIGHT

     The enormous LOCKED gates are silhouetted against the moonlit sky.  
     The chain is dangling in the wind.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE - NIGHT

     Hold on Nell's WINDOW, the light shining dim through the gauze
     curtain.  It goes out.  The window stares from an arrangement of 
     other windows, stonework and doors... like an eye with a cataract in 
     a face howling in horror.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell, her breathing heavy, lies tangled in her heavy blankets, 
     asleep, but restless.  Her feet hang off the end of the bed.

     In the b.g., the door to the bathroom is shut, barely visible in the
     faint light from the window.  HOLD on it.

     Silently, it begins to OPEN.  The gap WIDENS, yawning, pitch dark
     beyond.  A long beat.  And then a THUMP.  A SLIDING SOUND.  
     Something drags itself across the floor.

     BUMP.  SLIDE.  Our line of sight is blocked by the bed.  But the 
     sound is getting louder, coming closer.

     Bump.  Slide.  Nell grinds her teeth in her sleep, pulls the 
     blankets about her tighter.  Bump.  The sound stops.  And her BREATH 
     BEGINS TO FOG.

     Whatever has just come in the room is right there, hovering just OC.
     We can feel it.

     Without warning Nell BOLTS upright, GASPING into consciousness.
     REVEAL: nothing.  Just the dark room.  And the bathroom door OPEN.

     Nell stares at the-door, knows she shut it.  Now it's open.  She 
     breaths fast, feeling the cold, knowing something's in here with 
     her.

     She stops breathing, strains her ears.  Silence.  A long moment.  
     Then she notices her feet, hanging out from under the covers.

     They are black.  Feel slick.  Nell turns on the light by her bed and
     looks down.

     HER FEET ARE COVERED IN GORE.  Where Theo had been painting.  Nell
     SCREAMS.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     SCREAMING, Nell spins the tub faucets on full blast, sticks her feet
     into the spray.

                               THEO (OC)
                   Nell?  Nell!

     Weeping, Nell scrubs the gore off her feet -- red, black like old
     clotted blood.

                               NELL
                   Who is doing this to me?

     The door to Theo's bedroom is shut.  The handle rattles, urgent, but 
     it won't open.  It's LOCKED.

                               THEO (OC)
                   Nell, what's wrong?  What's wrong?

     The blood or whatever it is on Nell's feet comes off, is sucked down
     the drain.

                               THEO (OC) (cont'd)
                   Nell, it's locked, let me in!

     Nell, squatting in the tub, sobs as her feet come clean, and there 
     are NO WOUNDS.  Theo rattles the door.

                               THEO (OC)
                   Nell, the door is locked.  Open 
                   it.

     Nell rises, steps out of the tub, and looking like she could kill,
     moves for Theo's door.

     She grabs the handle but realizes what Theo has been trying to tell
     her all along: it's LOCKED.  Perplexed, Nell finds the key in the 
     hole, and turns it.

     The door rams open, Theo behind it, terrified and clearly just 
     awoken.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Nell...

     Nell stares at her, hair tangled, tear-stained, doubtful.  Water
     splashes in the tub, faucets still running.

     The LIGHTS flicker as one in the connecting rooms.  Theo has time to
     look up at the bulb in the bathroom, and they all GO OUT.  Darkness
     swallows them up.  Stray moonlight reflecting in the mirror 
     silhouettes them standing there.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Nell, the tub!

     Nell stoops in the darkness and the faucets squeak shut.  Theo bumps
     her way out of the room.  Nell moves to the doorway following her
     into --

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT

     -- Theo's room.  Theo's form moves by her bed, and with a snick, her
     cigarette lighter lights up.  Theo holds it above her head, its tiny
     orange flame glistening off polished wood in the shadows.  Nell 
     steps toward her.

     Drip.  Drip.  From the bathroom.  Theo's eyes widen?

                               THEO
                   Oh, God, your breath...

     And sweeping over them a SHOCK OF COLD.  Their breath.

     Nell shakes her head: don't say anything.  Nell turns around, the
     darkness almost impenetrable.  SHAPES, alien, threatening, at the 
     very edge of light -- anyone could be some... thing.  Drip.  Drip.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   It's here.

     Nell looks down at Theo's bed, then at Theo who moves closer to 
     Nell.  Nell gives the bed a wide berth.  Together they back toward 
     the wall with the fireplace.

     They stare out at us, eyes trying to adjust, afraid.  Behind them 
     looms the fireplace and in front of it, a metal cage-like fire 
     screen.  A beat.

     BAM!  SOMETHING LUNGES out of the fireplace but is caught in the
     screen, hitting Nell and Theo in the back.

     Theo's lighter goes flying in that very instant, and we never see
     what's hit the screen.  Neither do they.  Theo falls SCREAMING.  
     Nell manages to whirl, embrace the cage and slam it with whatever's 
     inside back into the fireplace.  The screen JOLTS hard enough to 
     lift Nell.

                               NELL
                   HELP!

     Theo still SCREAMING, lying on her back before the fireplace, rams 
     her feet against it.  The screen HAMMERS at Nell and Theo.  They 
     can't run or it'll get out.

     Theo's screaming is suddenly drowned out by a HORRIFYING, INHUMAN
     SOUND from inside the fireplace.

     Theo's scream goes dead in breath-stealing horror.  Nell recovers.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No!  Go AWAY!

     The screen punches out at them, denting.  And then all the air in 
     the room seems to be SUCKED into the fireplace in one THUMP.  The 
     door to the bathroom slams.

     It's gone.  They sit there in the darkness, panting.

     INT. GREENHOUSE - NEXT DAY

     Nell stares at the tableaux of Hugh Crain.  In the morning light it
     seems inert, cold, just a statue.  Luke and Theo enter.  Nell 
     doesn't seem to notice them until they're beside her.

                               THEO
                   Marrow said the same thing as last 
                   night, he says --
                          (meaning, this is
                           on his now
                           doubtful word)
                   -- that he checked with Mrs. 
                   Dudley.  And he says that she told 
                   him that all the fireplaces in the 
                   West Wing connect to the main 
                   chimney.  He says that he thinks 
                   that the flue was open, and with 
                   the windstorm, he says that what 
                   probably happened was some kind of 
                   freak air current --

                               NELL
                   -- What do you think?

     Theo considers, then looks at her, severe.

                               LUKE
                          (lowers his voice)
                   Don't tell the Professor; he'd 
                   probably throw me out.  But test 
                   taking is one of the ways I've 
                   been supporting myself.  I 
                   volunteer for every paid study 
                   that they offer.  Of course 
                   straight psych stuff doesn't pay 
                   as much as the pharmaceuticals do, 
                   or a good wound study.  Check it 
                   out.

     He rolls up his sleeve revealing large, livid SCARS at intervals too
     regular to be anything natural.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   A thousand dollars each.  Am I 
                   sick?  Yes.  Do you know why I 
                   only date freshmen?  By the time 
                   they're sophomores, they've 
                   figured me out.

                               THEO
                          (get back on track!)
                   Mister very talky, would you 
                   please say what it is about this 
                   study that bothers you?

                               LUKE
                   The whole thing feels like 
                   experimental misdirection.  Like 
                   he says it's about one thing, a 
                   psychological profile of 
                   environmental effects on 
                   insomnia... and that'd be a 
                   legitimate study, but I think that 
                   we've been subjected to an 
                   academic bait and switch; he's 
                   really looking at something else.

                               NELL
                   No.  No... Jim's not doing -- 
                   these things.

     But there's a desperate, rising edge to Nell's voice.  Theo's, in
     response, is quiet, sober... certain.

                               THEO
                   Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep 
                   down, if you really thought it 
                   wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be 
                   leaving right this second?  Why 
                   wouldn't you be afraid?  Really 
                   afraid.

                               NELL
                   Because I don't want to ruin 
                   things.  Because home is where the 
                   heart is.

     Theo is chilled by this answer which would only make sense to 
     someone out of her mind.

     Nell looks up and sees the double staircase at the end of the
     greenhouse... the one where Crain's wife killed herself.

     And for a moment we see Crain's wife hanging there and then the 
     image is gone...

     INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

     Lunch remains are on the table as Nell enters, test papers in hand.

                               NELL
                   Jim?  I'm done.

     But Marrow isn't there.  She's about to go back out to look for him,
     but sees something and stops.

     Forgotten by a reading chair to one side of the room.  Barely 
     visible.  Marrow's BRIEFCASE.  Nell goes to the briefcase, knowing 
     she shouldn't look, and unable to help herself.  Marrow's digital 
     recorder glints out at her.

     Nell takes it out, and presses play.  She looks up at the door.  Any
     minute he could come back in here... and then Marrow's voice rings 
     out.

                               MARROW (V.O.)
                   ...the hallway discussion about 
                   last night's fireplace incident 
                   concluded at three a.m.  Nell 
                   continues her alienation of the 
                   other subjects and the 
                   experimenter.  It remains unclear 
                   whether she truly believes she did 
                   not deface the painting.  
                   Interview with the subject in 
                   greenhouse yesterday to ascertain 
                   the extent of her self-delusion 
                   was inconclusive due to her 
                   efforts to sexualize encounter 
                   with experimenter.

     Marrow's voice continues on in his assessment, but Nell isn't 
     hearing anything anymore.

     She dies inside.  Her world upside down.  She falls into a chair, 
     and all we can hear of Marrow is the cold, analytical tone, his 
     garbled jargon.

                               MARROW (OC)
                   One minute!

     It's Marrow, for real, about to enter.  Nell clicks off the 
     recorder, drops it into the briefcase.  Marrow is startled, not 
     expecting Nell to be sitting right next to his papers and briefcase.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Nell.

     She can only stare at him, eyes dead.  Marrow looks from her to the
     briefcase and back.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Were you looking for me?

     Nell can't answer.  Marrow comes over, unsettled.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   How are the tests going?

     Nell rises, staring, emotionless.  Betrayal just beginning to find a
     hold.  She hands him her papers.  Marrow looks at Nell, knows she's 
     been in his briefcase.  He picks it up, and with a final, sorry 
     glance, exits.

     INT. GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

     Nell emerges from the study, stands there a beat, lost.  Then she
     turns, resolute, and starts moving.  Faster.

     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

     Nell, blinded by tears, runs across the room toward the grand entry
     and the exit... and stops.

     DOWN THE CONNECTING HALL, out in the grand entry, at the front 
     doors, are Mr. and Mrs. Dudley.  Leaving for the day.  They stop.  
     Look at her.

     Nell, numb, gazes from the open door to Mrs. Dudley.  Mr. Dudley 
     holds the door open as if in invitation.  Nell could walk out right 
     now.  This is her chance.  But...

     Mrs. Dudley smiles a knowing smile.  An all too knowing smile.  And
     seeing Nell's decision, gently shuts the door.  The LOCK CLICKS.  
     Final.  Fate-sealing.

     Nell turns back to the House, lost.

     INT. RED PARLOR - DAY

     Nell walks right up to the moveable bookcase and enters Crain's 
     secret study.

     INT. CRAIN'S SECRET STUDY - DAY

     Nell sits in silence, trying to find a feeling, any feeling.  A long
     beat.  And without warning she leaps to her feet in SHOCKING rage.

                               NELL
                   How can he think I'm doing this!

     She has a floor lamp in her hands, and hurls it like a throwing 
     hammer at the nearest shelves.  Vases, knickknacks and a LEATHER 
     ALBUM crash to the floor.

     She stalks around the room, and then slows, staring at what she's
     done, the rage draining out of her.  But if she could do something 
     like that...

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No.  No, I couldn't do those 
                   things: I'm not making it up.

     She turns in place, desperate... and sees the old leather album
     precariously tilting on one of the sprung shelves.  It's open.  One 
     of the leaves flips over on its own, gravity and the weight of its 
     own pages TURNING IT.

     Nell approaches, stepping over broken ceramic.  SLIP.  Another page
     turns.

     Nell hovers over it, holding her breath so as not to make the book
     flip over and fall off the shelf in one instant.

     SLIP.  Another page turns.  The book is a PHOTO ALBUM of the late
     nineteenth century, bound with ribbons, the aged Daguerreotypes in
     pressed vellum frames.

     Nell peers closer.  It's open to a faded, gray image taken long 
     before it became the convention to smile for a photograph: a woman, 
     RENE CRAIN, sitting in a chair.

     And standing behind the chair, a fearsome presence in a black coat,
     his face hollow, malevolent.  HUGH CRAIN.

     Nell shivers, and SLIP, the page turns on its own.

     An image of Hugh and Rene, a look of deathly loss on their faces.  
     The page flips.

     Crain hovers, dark, rage just under the surface, but on Rene's face 
     is the faintest, most inappropriate SMILE.  It sends a chill through 
     Nell.

     The album begins to slide down the shelf, and as it does, PAGES 
     FLIP, Rene's SMILE grows wider, her hair dishevelled, her eyes lit 
     with grinning insanity...

     Nell grabs the book just as it falls from the shelf.

     It is open in her hands to a picture of Crain, alone, in front of 
     the enormous fireplace in the Great Hall.  RENE IS GONE.  The photo 
     is monstrous.  Nell, fearful, turns the page --

     -- and REACTS to the last thing she expected.  A picture of a lovely
     woman filled with grace and power.  CAROLYN CRAIN.  Posed.  On a 
     settee before the fireplace.  Beautiful beyond words.  Smiling.  
     Ahead of her time.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   His second wife.  There was a 
                   second wife?  Carolyn.

     It warms Nell.

     She turns the page.  Now Crain is there beside Carolyn.  But there 
     is something different about him.  Less frightening.

     Nell flips the page again, and now there is an image of Crain and
     Carolyn.  Her hair is up in a FRENCH TWIST.  Nell smiles more.

     Nell turns the page yet again.

     But something is wrong.  It is another image of Carolyn and the
     kinder, gentler Crain, but now it is Carolyn who is unsmiling.

     Another page.  Another.  Carolyn's face darkening.  And in this 
     picture, Carolyn's stomach is slightly distended.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   She was pregnant.

     Nell TURNS PAGES FASTER AND FASTER, and as she does, Carolyn SWELLS
     PREGNANT before our eyes in ragged animation, mouth working as if to
     speak, voiceless as it is... ELEANOR.

     Nell fumbles the book onto the floor.  It stares up at her, open to 
     the last page.

     It is an image of Carolyn.  Betrayal.  Hell.  Knowledge.  Her hand 
     seems to be POINTING at the gaping maw of the GRAND FIREPLACE.

     Nell bolts from the room.

     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

     Nell bursts into the Great Hall and stops.  At the far end of the 
     room broods the vast fireplace, its chain curtains hanging like the 
     veil to some hellish sanctuary.

     Nell stares at it, daunted.  What is it that Carolyn is trying to 
     show her?  The fireplace beckons, and Nell approaches against her 
     will.

     She finds a steel poker hanging by the fireplace, and takes it down.
     She uses it to slide one of the chain curtains open.  She steps into
     its soot-black mouth.

     Nell peers up the chimney.  A faint sigh of air.  She sticks the 
     poker up the flue, scratches around.  Nothing.

     She turns her attention to the back of the fireplace, thwocks it.
     Sooty stone chips away, but it's solid.

     The mechanism for the ash drop catches her eye.  Nell grabs the 
     heavy, iron lever.  She pulls, but can barely budge it.  It finally 
     screeches back, and the iron door in the floor of the fireplace 
     SWINGS DOWN.

     Nell looks in.  Two feet down it looks like a gray blanket of ash, a
     charred timber or two sticking out.  Sick with fear, Nell prods the
     ash.  Just charred wood.

     She thrusts the poker down deep.  It vanishes in the ash up to her
     hand.  CLACK.  She rakes through the ash.  CLACK.  And then she 
     feels the poker take purchase.  She draws it out, and full of dread 
     turns it to the light...

     Impaled on its hooks are TWO HUMAN SKULLS.

     Nell fights back the scream in her throat.  One of the skulls is a
     child's skull, the other an IMMENSE SKULL with brooding brow, 
     forehead crushed.

     Nell lets the poker drop.  It bangs off the door, falls in the ash
     drop, its handle hitting a spring.  Nell recoils as the trapdoors 
     SNAP SHUT like a pair of jaws.

     INT. GROUND HALLWAY FLOOR - DUSK

     Nell stumbles down the hall, weeping in fear.

                               NELL
                   Theo!  Jim!  Help!

     But instead she hears children voices, calling out for her.

     INT. CONFUSING SERIES OF ROOMS (THE MAZE) - NIGHT

     Nell winds through the pitch-dark halls, rooms gaping black left and
     right, searching for the voices which seems to come from just around
     the next bend, leading her around corner after corner.

     The hallways peel past Nell as she runs, slamming through doors, 
     ever darker.  The House's hellish carvings glare as she passes, 
     grinning, taunting.  She rages on, oblivious until she rounds a 
     final corner --

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT

     -- into the long, dark hall leading to the LOCKED ROOM.  The 
     STATUARY peer down on her.  Dead faces.  Blind marble eyes.  As she 
     turns, the heads and eyes turn imperceptibly with her.

     For a frame or two the EYES are real, just a subliminal glimmer.  
     For the instant we try to catch the movement, the illusion, it isn't
     there.  It makes Nell stop.  She regards the terrible doors.  She
     considers the labyrinth around her.  And begins to understand.

                               NELL
                   The house... it's a maze, that's 
                   how you designed it, didn't you, 
                   Mister Crain?  So wherever one of 
                   your little guests went, the house 
                   brought them here.  It's designed 
                   to make you come here.  But why?

     Another CRY comes from the far end.

     Nell eases down the hallway, the fear welling back on her like a 
     tide.  She hesitates, but then the CHILD-CRY forces her on.  She 
     reaches the CARVED DOORS with the wooden guard statues.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Oh, no... Oh... no... no, no... 
                   not that... Oh no... Ohhhhhhhhh!

     Gaping cold and stench hit her.  She gags.

     Now the CRY comes from under the door.  Present.  Real.  Right 
     there.  Nell shudders.

     The CRY grows louder, desperate.  She shuts her ears to it.  The CRY
     rises to fearsome rage, not sounding like a child anymore.  Not
     sounding like anything human at all, it's painful.  Nell looks at 
     the locked room in horror and takes off running.

     INT. PICTURE GALLERY - DUSK

     Nell bursts into the picture gallery and stops.  Standing there are
     Marrow, Theo and Luke, stricken silent by her entry.  Looks of shock 
     on their faces.  Nell just stands there.  A beat.  And then it pours 
     out of her, hysterical.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   He hunted all those children in 
                   here.  The dead children, Josiah 
                   and Elizabeth and all of them... 
                   from the books... he took them up 
                   here... he played games... the 
                   ones from his mills he burned them 
                   up in the fireplace but she found 
                   out what he did and she killed
                   him --

     She takes a breath, and turns gray.  Before anyone else can react, 
     her legs go out from under her, and she lands sitting.  Theo and 
     Marrow get to her side fast.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   -- he didn't kill her she killed 
                   him and ran away with her baby --

     Marrow grabs her face.  It's gray, her eyes glazing over.

                               MARROW
                   Get a blanket!

                               THEO
                   It's okay... we're all here...

     Luke races out.  Theo, scared, looks at Marrow.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   What's happening to her?

                               MARROW
                   She's in shock.  Come on.

     He starts to lift her.  Theo takes her other side.

                               NELL
                   After Rene... after she killed 
                   herself... he turned into a 
                   monster.  He did fill the house 
                   with children... he did, but... 
                   they weren't laughing...

     Nell is ugly, sprawling, in shock, as Theo and Marrow shuffle her to 
     a padded bench on one side of the room.

                               THEO
                   Nell, what happened?

                               NELL
                   Carolyn showed me where she hid 
                   him, hid him with all the ones he 
                   killed --

                               MARROW
                   Nell... please, Nell... take a 
                   deep breath...

                               NELL
                   And they're all locked together in 
                   here... and he won't let go of 
                   them!

     Marrow grabs her face.

                               MARROW
                   Nell!

     Luke rushes in with a blanket.  Theo covers Nell and then holds her,
     gently.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Look at me, Nell.  Look at me!

     Nell manages to focus on him, her breath laboring.

                               NELL
                   Hugh Crain.  He's in the house.  
                   He's still here...

     Theo pulls back, goes very still.  The first hint of fear in her 
     eyes.

                               THEO
                   No.

     Marrow sees the panic working on her, gives her a stern look:

                               MARROW
                   Theo!  You too.  Listen to me.

     The command derails Theo's train of thought.  Marrow stares at Nell 
     in pity, can't bear it, and has to look away.  Finally he turns back 
     to her, full of regret.

                               MARROW
                   Nell, you have to hear me.  Let me 
                   explain what's happening to you.
                          (beat)
                   You're participating in a study on 
                   hysteria.

     Everyone but Marrow REACTS.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   I've given you a powerful 
                   suggestion that you're in a 
                   haunted house.  I picked Hill 
                   House because it fits the 
                   expectations.  It was my... it was 
                   my theater, my stage.

     Theo glances at Luke: he's been right all along.  This was never 
     about perception.

                               LUKE
                   Modelling small-group dynamics in 
                   the formation of narrative 
                   hallucinations.  You brought us 
                   here to scare us.  Insomnia, that 
                   was just a decoy issue.  You're 
                   disgusting.

                               NELL
                   Is this true?  I've been 
                   hypnotized?

                               MARROW
                   I hadn't done a study of how group 
                   fear affects individual 
                   performance.  Mass hysteria is 
                   like a story, Nell.  A communal 
                   story.  Someone starts it.  Then 
                   we all add a little more to it.  
                   And then for some reason -- no one 
                   knows how -- we start believing 
                   it.  This story shapes what we see 
                   and hear.  We interpret everything 
                   through it, make it fit the story.  
                   I started our story when I gave 
                   you the history of Hill House.  
                   You've added to it.  That's what 
                   this experiment has all been 
                   about.  That's what it was about, 
                   the experiment's over.  I'm 
                   pulling the plug.  This is my 
                   fault.

                               NELL
                   It's not real?  Crain?  He's not 
                   real?

     Marrow shoots him a look: shut up.

                               MARROW
                   Your fear of him was real.  That's 
                   all the ghost anyone needs.

                               THEO
                   How could you do this to people?

     Nell bucks in his arms, furious, desperate.

                               NELL
                   This is real, I'm not making it 
                   up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were 
                   there -- the banging and last 
                   night.  You, you all saw the 
                   painting!

                               THEO
                   Nell, it makes sense.  It all 
                   makes sense.  You and I, we were 
                   scaring each other, working each 
                   other up.

                               NELL
                   -- but the painting!

     Nobody says anythlng.  The silence tortures Nell.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   I know you think I did that.  I 
                   didn't!  Go to the great hall and 
                   look in the fireplace!

     She starts to laugh.  Marrow gently presses Nell down, tucking the
     blanket around her.

                               MARROW
                   Why would we want to do that, 
                   Nell?

                               NELL
                   Because that's where he burned 
                   them up, the child laborers from 
                   his mills!  Because that's where 
                   their bones are!  He killed
                   hundreds.  He took them here and
                   he killed them.  Their bones are 
                   in the fireplace!

     Nell sobs.  The others exchange looks at this.  It sounds so hollow, 
     so delusional, it makes Marrow look so right.

                               MARROW
                   There are no bones in the 
                   fireplace.  Luke and I looked in 
                   it yesterday.  There's some old 
                   charred wood in the ash drop
                   but --

     Nell SPASMS trying to fight her way up, but Marrow and Luke hold her
     down.  Nell begins to wail in helpless rage.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Nell!  If we look in that 
                   fireplace it'll just make you more 
                   upset.  And when there are no 
                   bones there, you'll say they got 
                   up and walked away.

                               NELL
                   Oh, God, you're not going to 
                   look...

     Theo pushes them back and grabs Nell's hand, gently brushes Nell's
     face.

                               THEO
                   Aw, shhh Nell, shhh.

     Theo turns up to Marrow, intense, furious with him.

     Nell's hysterics have stopped.  She stares up at him, lost.  
     Searching inside herself.  Maybe she is crazy...

                               MARROW
                   There has to be Monster in the 
                   Labyrinth.  We make them up.  
                   That's how we deal with the things 
                   in everyday life that are too 
                   terrible to deal with.  Like 
                   losing someone.  Like being alone.

     Marrow reaches down to Nell, but she shrinks away.  Theo blocks 
     Marrow out, shielding Nell.  Marrow pauses, disgusted with himself.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   I'm sorry, Nell.  I'm really, 
                   really sorry I did this to you.

                               LUKE
                   Sometimes saying you're sorry is 
                   just not enough.

     A disgusted Luke leaves the room.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell lies in her bed, shivering.

                               NELL
                   Don't leave me.

     Theo spreads an extra blanket over Nell.

                               THEO
                   I'm going to stay with you until 
                   you fall asleep.  And then I'm 
                   going to get some brandy.

                               NELL
                   I don't think I want any.

                               THEO
                   I do.

     Theo spots a small candelabra with strings of crystal beads on the
     bedside table.  She lights the two candles.

     Theo goes and turns out the light.  Nell lies there watching the
     flicker of the candles play in the crystal.  Eddies of heat mingle 
     up the frost-covered glass of the window behind the candelabra.  
     Small streaks of frost begin to melt... We see eyes forming in the 
     melting frost, a face begins to form...

     Theo watches Nell.  There can be a TIME DISSOLVE.  Nell falls 
     asleep.  Theo tiptoes out of the room.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Luke eats chips.  Marrow stands by the door, arms folded, matter-of-
     fact.

                               MARROW
                   I gave my key to the gate to Todd, 
                   but the Dudleys'll be here in the 
                   morning.

                               LUKE
                   Do we still get paid for the week?

                               MARROW
                   You get your money.

     Awkward silence.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Where did she come up with it?  
                   How did she put it all together?

                               LUKE
                   Is that the question of compassion 
                   or science?

                               MARROW
                   It's a question.

                               LUKE
                   She got the child labor stuff from 
                   me.

     Theo comes in, she heard what they were talking about.

                               THEO
                   I... I was playing games with 
                   her... Big city games... I was 
                   bad.  And you, Doctor Morrow, you 
                   broke her heart.

     He knows this.  It tears him apart.

                               MARROW
                   Is she asleep?

                               THEO
                   Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't 
                   let her alone the whole night.

     Marrow nods, gets his briefcase, exits.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Marrow steps into the dark, vast room, his glasses glinting.  The 
     faint outline of the fireplace on the far wall looms in the 
     darkness.

     Marrow approaches it.  The mesh screen is still open.  Marrow stands
     there a moment.  Then looks in.

     He squats and tries to open the ash-drop.  It doesn't budge; it's
     jammed by the poker Nell dropped in.

     Marrow considers, then shakes his head, feels stupid for even coming
     in to check.

     Suddenly his CELL PHONE RINGS, startling him.

                               MARROW
                   Shit.
                          (answering the
                           phone)
                   Hello?  Yes, this is Dr. Marrow.
                          (beat)
                   Oh, hello.  Thank you for 
                   returning the call.
                          (beat)
                   No.  You mean he hasn't returned?
                          (long beat)
                   No, we haven't seen him.
                          (beat)
                   Can you tell me, what sort of car 
                   does he drive?
                          (beat, reacting)
                   A Toyota...

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Luke stops Theo, carrying a tray of food and tea, outside the 
     kitchen door.

                               THEO
                   We're fucked.  We're in a haunted 
                   house and we can't get out until 
                   the morning.

                               LUKE
                   You don't really believe it's 
                   haunted... Do you believe in 
                   ghosts?

                               THEO
                   That depends on your definition of 
                   ghosts.  I'm going to check on 
                   her, and then I'm going to stay 
                   awake.

                               LUKE
                   All night?

                               THEO
                   Yeah.

                               LUKE
                   You want company?

                               THEO
                   Maybe someday.

     Some sexual awareness.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell lies in her bed asleep, the room dark except for the last,
     guttering end of one of the candles.  It goes out.

     A FAINT SOUND.  LONG, LOW, like the inarticulate murmur of a dozen
     madmen.  Nell stirs.  Her eyes open.  She hears the sound.

     The wall on the opposite side of the room catches the pale gloom 
     from the window.  The twisting figures in the plaster, the low-
     relief, the shadows they make seem to COME TOGETHER AS AN EYE.  
     Black.  Not human.  The woodwork around it like some half-face.

     The GIBBERING begins to RISE.

     OUT OF THE CORNER OF HER EYE she can see a FORM beside her in the 
     bed.

     Nell's mouth moves.  She manages to form words, but it's just a
     whisper.

                               NELL
                   Theo...

     Nell reaches out under the covers.

     Her HAND is suddenly grasped.

     THE EYE on the wall stares.  The babbling, liquid, deep voice 
     mounts, and as the shadows move ever so slowly, the EYE seems to 
     roam over the room.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Oh, God.  It's looking for me.

     And then the babbling stops.  Nell grimaces in pain.  She tries to 
     look at Theo, but it's far too DARK right there beside her.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Theo, my hand.  You're hurting me.

     In the place of the babbling, another sound.  High-pitched, drawn-
     out.  A CHILD'S CRY.  Nell reacts.

     The cry wails louder, coming through the wall.  It's a wail of 
     agony.  A wail not of this earth.  Nell struggles, racked between 
     the pain in her hand and the tortured child's cry.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   A child.  No.  No!  I'm right 
                   HERE!

     The EYE focusses on her.  Dead on her.  Nell stops.  And with sudden
     violence, she's WRENCHED out of the bed by whatever's beside her.  
     Nell hits the floor with a scream.  She grabs at the table on this 
     side of the bed, pulling a lamp down on her, yanking at its chain.

     The room FLASHES into brilliance.  Nell stands up, panting... There 
     is nothing in the room.  No Theo.  She looks at her hand.

     The eye on the wall is gone.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Oh, God.  Who was holding my hand?

     Nell snaps around.  There on the window, SPREADING before her eyes 
     the frost on the glass is melting into a HORRIFYING FACE.  The face 
     of CRAIN.

     Nell recoils in prickling fear.  Living fear.  Then her fear turns 
     to RAGE.  In the blink of an eye there's a heavy ashtray in her 
     hand, and it's flying at the window.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   I will not let you hurt a CHILD!

     The window BASHES out into the night, the face vanishing with a HOWL
     of air.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     NeIl explodes from her room, a flying fury of hate.  The child-cry
     seems to race ahead of her into --

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- Theo's room, which is empty.  Now it seems like it's coming from 
     the door to the hall, is right there.  Nell races after it and --

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- barges out into the hallway.  She breaks into a run.  The cry 
     sounds from farther off.  Nell chases after it.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Theo carrying a pot of tea and some cups enters quietly just in case
     Nell is asleep.  She stops in surprise.  The window is smashed, lamp 
     on the floor.  Nell is gone.

                               THEO
                   Nell?

     INT. NELL'S HALLWAY - NORTH WING - NIGHT

     A panicked Theo runs out of Nell's room into the hallway.

                               THEO
                   Luke... Jim...!

     INT. CROSS HALL - NIGHT

     Halls sprawl away into darkness in all directions as Nell tries to
     feel out where she is, and realizes she's lost.  Just like Theo and 
     she were before.  But now it's night.  And she's alone.  She's been 
     tricked.

     Panting, she stops, presses herself against the wall.  Her breath
     catches.

     Across from her is a MIRROR.  Herself reflected in its tarnished
     surface.  But there is something wrong with it.  Nell steps across 
     to it.

     Her reflected self begins to SMILE.  But SHE'S NOT SMILING!  Nell
     writhes in horror, but can't pull away from the mirror.  In it, her
     GRIN WIDENS, INSANE.  The bottom half of her face is someone else's.

     BANG!  Nell recoils.  The sound breaks the spell, knocking Nell back
     from the mirror.

     BANG.  BANG.  BANG.  Nell turns and runs.

     INT. HALL OF PILLARS - NIGHT

     The banging chases Nell into the hall of pillars.  Nell turns to 
     face whatever it is that's coming after her.  The BANGING 
     CRESCENDOES... and then recedes, still audible, but like the thing 
     following her has taken a wrong turn.

     Another mirror on the wall.  Nell glimpses herself in it.  This time
     her EYES are someone else's, lit with insanity.

     Nell backs away, through doors into --

     INT. HALL OF MIRRORS - NIGHT

     -- the hall of mirrors.  Bang bang bang bang...

     The octagonal, mirror-lined pillars cast and re-cast her reflection
     throughout the room.  Nell is everywhere in plain sight, but hidden 
     by the very infinity of her images.  The BANGING grows louder.

                               NELL
                   Why do you want me?

     The BANGING ceases.  And then we see the real Nell standing there.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   WHO AM I?

     She turns around.  Her REFLECTIONS all TURN with her.  EXCEPT ONE.  
     For a long moment, we see it but Nell doesn't.

     And then she does.

     The REFLECTED NELL stands there, hands hanging, silent.

     Nell exhales in shuddering fear.  The Reflected Nell MOUTHS 
     compelling the real Nell to whisper with it:

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Welcome home, Eleanor...

     With that the Reflected Nell grins and her STOMACH SWELLS before our
     eyes, pregnant just like Carolyn Crain.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No.

     Nell runs.

     INT. HALL OUTSIDE GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

     Nell races down the long hall, bare feet flying, covering her face
     from MIRRORS left and right.  She stumbles into --

     INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- the greenhouse where she slips on the marble.  She kicks the door
     shut behind her and lunges for the spiral staircase, her horror
     driving her up and up, setting the rickety thing swinging.  We HEAR
     what Nell hears, the voices of children.

                               VOICES OF CHILDREN
                   Help us... help us...

                               NELL
                   I'm here... I'm here... I'm coming 
                   to you, I'm coming to you...

     Nell climbs higher and higher into the dark reaches above.

     AS SHE CLIMBS: through the greenhouse windows we see the night sky,
     the clouds driven by the wind, the moon, old vines wrapped aroud the
     skin of the greenhouse... and the shapes and shadows of the vines 
     seem to shift as if it was alive...

     Nell reaches the landing.  The stair case rolls back and forth 
     beneath her.  A beat.  And then BAM!  The door slams open below.

                               MARROW (OC)
                   Nell!  Nell, are you in here?

     Nell can only manage sobbing relief.

                               LUKE (OC)
                   Look, the stairs!

     Nell drags herself to the hand rail.  Marrow, Luke and Theo rush 
     into view below.

     They all react to the sight of Nell at the precarious top -- with 
     her insanely happy smile.  They think she's there to kill herself.  
     Just like Rene Crain.

     They all freak out in a chorus of 'Nell!  No, Nell!'

                               MARROW
                   Nell!  Don't move.

     Nell couldn't anyway.  She just grins madly, tears running down her
     face.  Marrow grabs for the stairs, but they shift under Nell's
     movement from up above.

                               LUKE
                   It's not going to hold your 
                   weight.

                               MARROW
                   Just stay there, Nell!

     Marrow mounts the stairs.  The metal support rods sing out under his
     weight.  And the whole thing pitches, rolling around as he goes up.
     Five feet.  Ten feet.  Fifteen feet up.  The sway gets wilder as he 
     goes.

     At twenty feet, with twenty more to go to reach Nell, he stops.  The
     stairs buck, sway out dizzily.  And then to his dismay, he realizes
     he's on the WRONG SIDE of the double helix staircase.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Damn it.

     He straddles the rail to climb over to the other half.

                               LUKE
                   Don't!

     The sudden shift is too much for the old stairs.  The support rods
     CREASE and then the whole enormous column of steel from where Marrow
     is standing to the ground BURSTS from its supports.

     Luke shoves Theo aside, and the bottom half of the stairs spirals 
     out in a massive, deafening COLLAPSE.  Marrow's cellular phone falls 
     out of his pocket and shatters in hundred pieces across the floor.

     The top half of the stairs remains, still hanging from the ceiling.
     Nell grips the railing at the top.

     Marrow hangs there by one hand over the razor tangle of steel below.
     He flails out for the other stairway, swings himself over to it.  It
     takes a moment for him to realize he almost just died.  A moment of
     paralysis.  This is no longer an experiment.  No longer fun and 
     games.

                               MARROW
                   Nell?  Are you up there?

     There she is.  Marrow forces himself to start climbing the shaky
     stairs.  Luke and Theo watch from below, tense.

     Then he's there.  Nell stands a mere arm's length from him on the 
     other side of the railing.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Come on, Nell.  You have to climb 
                   over and step back on the stairs.

     Nell barely seems to hear him.  Instead she looks at the DEFORMING
     SUPPORT RODS around her.  We HEAR the voices of the CHILDREN, 
     calling to her.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Nell!  Now!

     Theo, on the ground, calls up to Nell.

                               THEO
                   Nell, go with him!  Just go with 
                   him.

     Nell refocuses on him and then gingerly climbs over the railing.  
     She hangs there.  She looks down at the tangled steel below...

                               NELL
                   The children want me.  They're 
                   calling me.  They need me.

                               MARROW
                   Nell.  You will come here now.

     Nell looks UP at him, hazy.

     And THEN BEHIND MARROW: the shifting clouds, the moon, the vines... 
     and suddenly all these random elements behind him form a dark 
     hideous face and in front of it a hand, and the hand is rushing 
     forward to PUSH MARROW OFF THE STEPS.

     After we scream, NELL SCREAMS.

                               NELL
                   NO!

     And as Marrow falls forward, pushed by the force behind him, Nell
     grabs him... he is caught on the rail... As she has reached out to 
     him, now she has fallen into thin air, and she falls towards Marrow, 
     and they hold each other.  She has a hand... then a foot... she 
     slips... she holds on again... and reaches the staircase.  She grabs 
     on.

     A moment's peace... and then a new disaster: with a metallic POP POP
     POP the support rods spring from their anchors and the rest of the
     stairwell next to them drops to the ground in a catastrophic
     shattering of sound.

     Marrow looks behind him, to whatever it was that Nell saw over his
     shoulder.  He looks back at her.  Her eyes are closed, she won't 
     open them.

                               MARROW
                   We're going down the stairs, Nell, 
                   I'm taking you down the stairs.

     He leads her go down the stairs.

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Marrow and Theo stand in the doorway to the shared bathroom watching
     Luke finish taping a trash bag over Nell's broken window.  Nell lies 
     in her bed, asleep or unconscious, it's impossible to say.  Luke 
     finishes, comes over.  Marrow is hushed, grim, exhausted.

                               THEO
                   She needs help.

                               MARROW
                   I'll take her with me to the 
                   University tomorrow.  I can't 
                   believe I read the test wrong.  I 
                   didn't see anything that looked 
                   like she was suicidal.

                               LUKE
                   You used the wrong test.

                               THEO
                          (indignant)
                   Will the two of you shut up!  God 
                   damn it!  Maybe the tests were 
                   right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, 
                   she's vulnerable, but I don't 
                   think she's suicidal and I didn't 
                   have to test her.  Maybe she 
                   wasn't trying to kill herself.  
                   Maybe she was really scared.  
                   Maybe she really heard voices.

     Marrow looks away, doesn't want to say this.  Theo reads the 
     feelings on his face.

                               LUKE
                   You're not telling us something.

                               MARROW
                   Watts.  Those were his keys Nell 
                   found.  His roommate called and 
                   said Watts left when he was 
                   supposed to.  I think he's here.

                               THEO
                   He's wandering around the house, 
                   and Nell heard him.  She thought 
                   it was ghosts.  Let's go look for 
                   him again.

                               MARROW
                   No.  If he's lost somewhere in the 
                   house... he'll have to stay lost 
                   until tomorrow, until the night is 
                   over.  What we have to do now is 
                   be together, with Nell.

     And they go.  Three scared people.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Luke sits on the closed toilet and watches Nell in the adjoining 
     room.  Light from the bathroom falls across her fetal, curled form 
     in the bed.

     The door to Theo's room is open too.  Luke glances over.  Theo lies 
     on her bed.  Marrow is slouched in a chair.

     Luke settles back against the wall.

     The HOUSE EXHALES, and the breath of the house is like the poppy 
     field in the Wizard of OZ; it brings on sleep.

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT

     Marrow is struggling to stay awake and his eyes finally close.  Theo
     breathes hard in the grips of some awful dream.

     This is what the House wanted.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell lies asleep, the ornate headboard looming behind her, black 
     with its strange plant-like splay of leaves.

     Nell draws a deep, sleeping breath... and her EYES OPEN.  She lies
     there, her breath still in her lungs, not moving, but sensing
     something.  A long beat.  When she lets her breath out, we can see 
     it in the cold.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Luke's head rests solidly on the wall.  His eyes are closed, unaware
     his breath is fogging too.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell lies there afraid to move, afraid to make the faintest sound.
     From the darkness above WOOD CREAKS.  At first it seems like someone 
     is walking on the floor above.  But it is coming from within the 
     room.

     The CARVINGS on the ceiling, the impossibly elaborate woodwork, ARE
     MOVING.  Incredibly slowly, with incredible subtlety: turning inside
     out, some of the forms lengthening, some shortening.  Carvings 
     changing here, changing there -- the ceiling coming alive -- with 
     some grand design we sense but cannot yet see.

     The wood grows out of the ceiling eating its way down into the tall
     bed POSTERS.  It crawls down the posters, straining the sinewy 
     baroque curves, swelling them...

     The CREAKING begins from the darkness of the wall opposite Nell.  
     Nell inclines her head to see.  Out of the wall two enormous BULGES 
     grow, side by side.

     From behind Nell, now.  The headboard GROANS, its shapes moving, the
     fan-like plant designs thickening and SPLAYING wide.

     Nell can't move, her mind refusing to understand what's going on.  
     The bulges in the wall DROOP to the floor.  And then we BEGIN TO 
     SEE: they are like a pair of KNEES.

     Understanding starts to show in Nell's eyes.  She looks up at the
     ceiling.  And now all the movement, the design behind the awful
     transformation of the ceiling is clear.

     It is a HEAD.  A visage of madness, of absolute horror, eyelids 
     sealing shut its blind face.

     Silence.  Nell's breath comes ragged.  Unable to speak, but trying 
     to call out.

     The EYES OPEN.  A SCREAM tears out of Nell's throat.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Luke is shocked awake in time to see Nell's room CONVULSE on her 
     just before the DOOR SLAMS in his face.

                               LUKE
                   Oh my God...

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     The entire ROOM RAMS itself at Nell, jolting her hard into the
     headboard.  THUMBS FOLD OUT of the woodwork, pinning her by the
     shoulders against it.  As the room lowers itself toward her, she
     SCREAMS out of her mind.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Marrow lunges into the bathroom, thrown from sleep as Luke stares in
     impotent shock.  Theo is there behind Marrow an instant later.

                               MARROW
                   What is it?

     Luke can't make any words come out.  Marrow shoves him aside, grabs 
     the doorknob and thrashes at it.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Help me!

     He braces Luke up, and then they lunge together, shouldering the 
     door.  It splinters out of its frame --

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- and stumble into Nell's room.  Marrow's mouth opens.  Luke stands
     speechless.  They're stricken by the sight: Nell SCREAMING, held by 
     the headboard as the deformed ceiling dips over her, the room 
     THRUSTING at her rhythmically.  Nell and Theo make EYE CONTACT.

                               THEO
                   Oh, Jesus.

     Marrow recovers, reaches out for Nell, and the FACE in the ceiling
     turns on him.  The GAZE stops Marrow in his tracks.  He looks up 
     into it and knows it's real.  Somehow, it is Crain.

     Luke appears from out of nowhere on the other side of the bed and
     SMASHES off one of the wooden hands with a large brass candelabra.
     Nell screams in surprise, but Theo drags her out of the bed.

     The head turns to them.  They flee.  Marrow backs away in awe and 
     fear.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Luke and Theo drag Nell down the stairs into the Great Hall.  Marrow
     brings up the rear.  They retreat for the entry as Luke puts his 
     jacket over Nell's shoulders.  Marrow stops, looks back up the 
     stairs.

                               MARROW
                   Wait a second!  Wait!

     All there is are the sounds of Nell, Luke and Theo making for the 
     hall to the entry.  The House is silent.

                               LUKE
                   No.

     Luke goes out.  But Nell pauses, stopping Theo with her.

     The House is quiet.  Marrow's hand still outstretched.  Nell looks
     around the room.  There are heads everywhere, faces: animal heads,
     humans, gods, all staring from the woodwork, the carpets everything.
     All turning to her.

     Theo looks around, but can't see what Nell is seeing.  Nell's breath
     comes faster, disoriented, yet aware...

                               NELL
                   They're all in here.  All the ones 
                   he killed.  They're just children!  
                   We have to help them!

                               THEO
                          (to Marrow)
                   Come on!  Why are we waiting?

     Even now, Marrow can't believe what he just saw, but Theo's voice
     brings him back.  He whirls, grabs onto Nell, helps Theo drag her 
     out.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY/GATE - NIGHT

     Four cars sit behind the massive, locked gate, as far from Hill 
     House as possible.  Marrow paces past the fence, staring out, the 
     road beyond leading out of this place, so close...

     Luke digs with a pen knife at the marble footing below the gate.  No
     easy way under it.  He stands and gazes at the razor-sharp spikes
     twenty feet up.  There's no way to climb this.

                               THEO
                   Oh my God we need to call someone?

     Marrow just looks at her and walks back to Nell's car.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - NIGHT

     Nell sits in the passenger seat of her car, wrapped in her jacket.  
     She stares out at the gate, at Luke and Theo consulting.  Marrow 
     appears in the window.

                               MARROW
                   You okay?

     Nell nods, but there's something about her not right.

                               NELL
                   Why did you bring me here?

     Marrow shakes his head, doesn't fully understand.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Why did you call me and tell me to 
                   look in the paper for the ad?

                               MARROW
                   Nell, what are you talking about?  
                   I never called you.

     Nell stares, dismayed, but Marrow is dead serious.

                               NELL
                   But you told me to look in the 
                   paper!  You told me I'd be 
                   perfect!

                               MARROW
                   Nell, the first time I ever spoke 
                   with you in person was the night 
                   we met here.

                               NELL
                   Then who called me?

     Hill House looms behind her, windows forming eyes, the carport a
     gaping mouth.

     Nell's dismay becomes a cold, terrifying understanding, and she 
     turns and stares back up at the House.

     Luke comes up with Theo on the other side of the car.

                               THEO
                   Nell --

                               LUKE
                   -- how much is this car worth?

     EXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY/GATE - NIGHT

     Theo pulls Nell away from the drive.  Marrow stands back from Nell's
     car where Luke belts in behind the wheel.

     Luke eases the car forward to the gate.  He advances until the car's
     bumper makes contact.  And then without further ado, REVS the 
     engine.

     The Buick grinds into the heavy steel bars.  The chain tightens 
     around the two halves of the gate, but shows not the slightest 
     strain.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - NIGHT

     Luke grimaces, shifts into low, pours on the gas.

     EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT

     The car fishes back and forth against the gate, hurling a shower of
     gravel on the other cars off to the side of the road.  Marrow, Nell 
     and Theo move back.

     One of the Buick's headlights breaks.  The grill mashes in.  For a 
     long moment the car struggles against the Gate.  No good.  Luke 
     eases up.

     Theo looks at Marrow.  Luke puts the car in reverse.

                               LUKE
                   Get the hell out of the way!

     They back way up.  Luke vanishes up the drive in the car.  And then 
     the Buick comes around the corner, accelerating, slicing down the 
     gravel road.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - NIGHT

     Luke sits way back in the seat, grits his teeth, floors it, aiming 
     at the gate...

     EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT

     The car SMASHES into it... and is STOPPED, collapsing, twisting in a
     deafening hail of steel and glass.

     The massive gate has BENT itself AROUND the car, holding it in its
     steel-grip.

     EXT. GATE - NIGHT

     Nell understands, the house will not let her go.  She turns away 
     from the gate, faces the House, mesmerized by the beauty in this
     monstrosity.  The House is calling her back, and Nell is drawn 
     towards it.  She starts walking...

     INT. NELL'S CAR - NIGHT

     Luke gasps for the seat belt, the wind knocked out of him, steering
     column pushed to his chest.  Marrow and Theo run up outside.  Luke 
     sees him, sees he's not getting any closer than ten feet, and he's 
     looking back at the gas tank.

     Luke gets the seatbelt off, tries to open the door but it's warped
     shut.  He struggles to get out from behind the wheel.  Sparks jump 
     from the battery.  Gas shoots out of the fuel pump onto the 
     shattered window.  He knows he's in trouble.

                               THEO
                   Hurry.  The gas!  Luke... The gas!

     Finally Luke gets free of the wheel.  It's agonizing to watch...  
     The passenger door is jammed shut too.

     He squirms into the back seat.  The rear doors are in the same
     condition as the front.  But the rear window is blown out.  He 
     crawls out onto the trunk.

     EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT

     Marrow hurries around the back of the car, staying clear of the lake
     of gas spreading about it.  Luke rolls off.  Marrow helps him up, 
     and gets him away a safe distance.

                               LUKE
                   I'm okay.  Okay.  Just my chest.  
                   Just my wind knocked out.

     Marrow looks up at the gate.  It is even more impassible than before
     with the gasoline-saturated wreck in it.  No way to try another 
     break-out either.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   Sorry about your car, Nell.

     He turns around.  The others do too.

     No Nell.  Luke and Theo look up.  Mute dread.  No Nell anywhere.

                               MARROW
                   Oh, no.

     INT. GRAND ENTRY - NIGHT

     The massive black door swings silently into the dark, vaulted entry.
     Marrow pauses there, looks about, and then enters.  He holds a tire
     iron.

     Luke does too.  He and Theo follow Marrow in.

                               THEO
                   I'm sure she went back to her 
                   room.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

     They stay to the outside of the stairs, padding silently up, trying 
     to get a glimpse of the floor above.  It's shrouded in darkness.

     They turn at the landing, eyes riveted to the top of the stairs.  
     They start up.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - NIGHT

     Marrow, Luke and Theo pause at the top of the stairs and peer down
     both long, empty directions of the hallway.

     Then Marrow turns toward Nell and Theo's room.  The brass 
     candelabra... in front of the open door.

     The rooms draw nearer, closer.  Not even the sound of their 
     breathing.

     The door is ajar.  Marrow pushes it open with the tire iron.  The 
     room lies in silent disarray.  Normal disarray.  The bed normal.  
     The ceiling normal.  No Nell.

     Marrow and Theo REACT and enter the room.  Luke lingers out in the 
     hall a moment.  And just as he steps in after them we HOLD on the 
     long, empty hall --

     -- and a FIGURE glides across.  Far down at the other end.  She
     disappears.  It was Nell.

     INT. STATUARY HALL - NIGHT

     Nell walks through the row of dark statues.  Carved faces watch her
     pass.

     INT. HALL OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell stands before the threshold of the horrific doors, once locked,
     now inexplicably OPEN.  The mythological frieze on the door split in
     half, a world cut in two, a seal broken.  Like something has come 
     out of its tomb.

     Nell steps into the blackness.

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Marrow comes out of the bathroom, joining Theo by the window next to
     her bed.  Luke stands in the doorway.

                               THEO
                   Was sure she'd be in here.

                               LUKE
                          (worried)
                   Where in the hell can she be.

     Marrow remembers.

                               MARROW
                   Oh no...

     INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

     Marrow, Luke and Theo enter the greenhouse, the heavy growth
     forbidding in the darkness.  They spread out on the parallel 
     walkways.

                               THEO
                   Nell?

     They reach the transept, turn down it toward the statue of Crain at
     the end looming white in the dusk.

     Dead silence.  Then Marrow SCREAMS.

     Under a thin layer of ice underneath the giant hand that protrudes
     from the pond we find Watt's body, as if the hand wants to keep him
     there forever.  Marrow did find his Watts, a horrifying sight.

                               MARROW
                   Oh my God it's Watts.

     As at the same time out of the mouth from the sculpture erupts a 
     river of blood, scaring the hell out of them.  Their clothes 
     splattered with blood, Marrow quickly leads them out of there.

     INT. LOCKED ROOM - NURSERY - NIGHT

     Nell stands there in the darkness, sensing the expanse of the room,
     turning... and kicking something on the floor.

     It is a wooden toy train.  Then she sees a rocking horse by her 
     feet.  It is a NURSERY.  Turn-of-the-century.

     And as Nell's eyes adjust, as she tries to see what else is in here 
     in the dark, she begins to make out WHITE SHROUDED SHAPES.

     Against the wall.  A bed covered in a sheet.  A table beside it.  A 
     HAND BELL.  A CANE.

     Just like Nell's sick room at home.  Nell realizes it, covers her
     mouth.

     The furniture is in EXACTLY the same position, though the sheets
     covering the pieces are stained, FAR OLDER.

     And on the wall, something in a frame is covered with a piece of
     sheet.

     Nell approaches it in trepidation and removes the cloth.  For a long
     beat, all we see is her face as it goes slack.  Understanding.

     The framed thing is a stitchery.  It says: A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING,
     EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE.

     Just like the one at home.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Marrow, Theo and Luke barge into the Great Hall.

                               THEO
                   Nell!

                               LUKE
                   We can't stay here looking for 
                   her.  She doesn't want to be 
                   found...

     Marrow and Theo look at him.  It's what they've been thinking, but
     haven't had the courage to say.  Theo stops suddenly.  Turns around.  
     The men notice, and pause.

     Then they hear it.  Faint.  Floating down from upstairs somewhere.
     Nell's TUNE.  It doesn't sound right, but it's hard to tell as it's
     coming from so far away.

     They look at each other, start for the stairs.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT

     Theo, Marrow and Luke stand at the end of the dark hallway.  They 
     stare at the gaping doors to the nursery at the far end.  The tune 
     is coming from within.  Abruptly, it stops.

     And instead of Nell's tune, there's a repetitive CREAK.  CREAK.  
     CREAK.

     In rising dread, Theo starts forward.

     It takes Marrow and Luke a moment to come after her.  The CREAKING 
     gets louder, unnerving.

     They get to the doors, Theo first.  She pushes them wide.

     INT. LOCKED ROOM - NURSERY - NIGHT

     They stop there, staring into the shadows.

                               THEO
                   Nell?

     And there, hunched over something turning a CREAKING CRANK of some
     sort, is Nell.

                               MARROW
                   Nell.

     Nell straightens from whatever it is she was doing and turns to 
     them.  Theo steps toward her, afraid for her.

                               THEO
                   What'd you come back for, babe?

                               NELL
                   Just had to be sure.

                               LUKE
                   Come on, Jesus!  Let's go!

     Marrow shuts him up with a vicious gesture, stays back himself as 
     Theo approaches Nell.

                               THEO
                   Let's go, hon.  Don't you want to 
                   go back to your little apartment 
                   where you can hear the buoy out in 
                   the harbor when the wind is just 
                   right?

     Nell smiles at Theo.  She's holding something.

                               NELL
                   Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have 
                   an apartment.

                               THEO
                   Then let's go get you one.

     Nell's smile softens even more.  Her voice is reassuring.

                               NELL
                   Don't worry about me, Theo.  I'm 
                   wanted.  Right here.  I'm home.

     A CHILL of fear cuts through Theo as Nell looks deep into her eyes.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   After all...
                          (beat)
                   I'm family.

     The thing in Nell's hand is a NEEDLE, the thing she's been cranking 
     an ANCIENT PHONOGRAPH.  She lowers the needle to the spinning 
     record.  And HER TUNE, the one she hums all the time, begins to 
     play.

     The others are frozen where they stand.  Marrow's mind reels at the
     implications of what he's hearing.

                               MARROW
                   No.

                               NELL
                   My mother used to hum this to me.  
                   Like her mother hummed it to her.  
                   And my great grandmother Carolyn 
                   hummed it to her.

     Nell turns back.  The others stand there speechless.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   I have to stay.  You better go.  I 
                   could explain it, but you'd never 
                   understand.

     And that, finally, galvanizes the others into action.  Marrow sweeps
     past Theo, grabs Nell hard, and swings her for the door.

                               MARROW
                   Come on.

                               NELL
                   No --

                               THEO
                   Please, Nell, just see us out.

     Luke closes in on Nell with Marrow, and there's nothing she can do 
     but let herself be pulled along.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

     Down the stairs they come, Luke out in front now, bounding down a 
     half flight ahead.  Marrow and Theo support Nell between them.

     Nell looks up at the hooded painting of Crain, but is spun around 
     and taken down the next flight.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Nell, Marrow and Theo reach the bottom of the stairs and pause.  
     Luke is halfway across the room, looking back to make sure they're 
     with him --

     -- and Nell digs her heels in, jerking Marrow and Theo to a stop.  
     She stares.  The others follow her gaze.

     She's looking down the connecting hall, out to the entry at the 
     front doors.  They're open.

                               NELL
                   In the night...

     The DOOR BAMS SHUT with a concussion that rocks the entire room,
     sweeping Luke's jacket under it.  The HANDLES TURN, LOCK DOWN.

     Stunned.  All stunned.

     A RUSH OF AIR.  The House EXHALES.  Silence.  And then CREEEEAK.  
     They cast their eyes back up the stairs.

     BUMP BUMP.  Far-off sounds, hair-raising, of infinite variety, carry
     down the halls.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   ...In the dark.

     Luke rushes from the room.

     INT. GRAND ENTRY - NIGHT

     Luke YELLS and throws himself at the front doors.  Marrow runs over 
     to help him and shoves the tire iron between the doors and PRIES.  
     Marrow throws the useless thing down and stands back.

     Luke joins him, and they shoulder block it together.  But this door 
     is MASSIVE.  There's no way.

                               LUKE
                   No you bastard!  Break!

     He roundhouse kicks it, hurts himself.

     Theo, afraid, watches the Great Hall behind them.  Nell puts her 
     hand on her shoulder.

                               NELL
                   It's not safe for you anymore.  
                   The children need me, and Crain is 
                   doing everything he can to keep me 
                   from them.

     Theo stares, appalled.  Marrow looks around, puts his hand up to 
     shush everyone.  The HOUSE MOANS, the BUMPING growing, searching.

                               MARROW
                   Come on.

     He rushes down the hall, Luke right beside him, Nell and Theo in 
     their wake.

     INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     Luke's first barging into the kitchen.  Big windows all along the 
     wall.  Huge windows.  Marrow follows him in, Luke's fear turning 
     into a vicious smile as he sees the towering windows.

     Nell and Theo are right behind in time to see Luke and Marrow 
     scooping up a table and chair respectively.

                               LUKE
                   Watch out!

     The men rush the same window, side-by-side, and let the heavy pieces
     of furniture fly from ten feet.

     The WINDOW SHATTERS, dozens of panes blown out into the darkness
     beyond.  But the metal LATTICE remains, the chair's legs stuck in 
     it.

     Marrow and Luke pause, taken back a beat.  They hustle over to it.  
     Theo and Nell stand a few feet back.

     Luke grabs the chair, levers it, tries to pry open the metal.  
     Marrow reaches through, knocking loose glass, trying to find some 
     sort of handle on the other side.

                               THEO
                   Hurry!

     Theo watches the door behind them.  Luke pries at the inch of metal
     between him and freedom.  It won't break.

                               MARROW
                   They don't open!

     Marrow slips on the broken glass and catches hold of the lattice
     LACERATING his ring and little finger.  With a cry of pain, he lands 
     on the floor.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Oh Jesus my hand.

     Nell and Theo fall to the floor to help him.  Marrow moans, and Nell
     grips his injured hand in hers.  Fast, like she was born a trauma
     doctor, Nell clamps off the blood with her fingers.

                               NELL
                   Give me your shoelace.

     Marrow tugs at his shoe, in shock, and looks at Nell.  She's calm.
     Terrifyingly calm.  And in that moment, he realizes she's not out of
     her mind.  She just understands things beyond what he could possible
     begin to understand.

                               MARROW
                   What'll happen to us, Nell?

                               NELL
                   Nothing, if you leave right now.  
                   There's a war going on all around 
                   us.  Don't get in the way, please.

     Nell cinches the shoelace tight around his wrist.

     Luke throws down the chair, giving up on the window.

                               LUKE
                   Shit!  All right, you 
                   sonofabitch...

     As he looks up at another one of Crain's painting hanging on the 
     wall.  Nell Theo with Marrow straggle toward the great hall.

     INT. VESTIBULE TOWARDS GREAT HALL - NIGHT

                               LUKE
                   Maybe this'll get your attention!

     Luke flicks a LIGHTER out of his pocket.

                               MARROW
                   Luke!

     Before anyone can stop him, he LIGHTS a towering TAPESTRY on fire.

     He races from one to the next, lighting them.  Theo and Nell help
     Marrow up, back away as Luke shoots by.

     All the tapestries are ON FIRE, blazing up like torches.

     At last, his rage spent, heaving, he moves to join the others at the
     center of the room.  They stare at him, appalled, afraid.  Knowing 
     he has done something wrong.

     Luke stops.  Maybe fifteen feet away.  He sees their expressions.

                               LUKE
                   What?

     Nell looks over at the burning tapestries.  Heat sears the stone,
     blackens the carved figures in the woodwork.

     The ruddy light casts deep shadows throughout the room.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   We'll get out after this wing 
                   burns down.  Let's go.

     But there's no need.  The tapestries are consuming themselves too 
     fast to ignite the walls or ceiling.  They all realize it.  As the 
     last flaming scraps of cloth fall to the floor and go out, there is 
     utter silence.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Luke looks at them helplessly.  An awful, impending beat.  Without
     warning, the huge PERSIAN CARPET he's standing on JERKS out from 
     under him.  Luke falls on his stomach.

     Stunned, Luke looks straight into Nell's eyes.  Then the carpet 
     slides fast for the FIREPLACE.  It whips up to the hearth and sends 
     Luke flying through the chain curtains.

     The others are speechless.  They can do nothing but watch as Luke 
     lays there on the ashdrop.  A long moment.

                               NELL
                          (to the house, to
                           Crain)
                   No!  No!  Let them go!

     She knows what is going to happen, is powerless to prevent it.  Luke
     stands up, has time to give her a look.

     And then the LION'S HEAD FLUE drops open behind him.  Luke looks 
     back into its iron eyes --

     -- and with SHOCKING SPEED the FLUE snaps shut again, taking Luke's
     head off his body.

     The decapitated corpse falls back in the fireplace like a puppet 
     with its strings cut.

     Nell, Marrow and Theo stand there.  Not sure of what just happened,
     their minds unable to accept it.

     A sound comes up in Theo's throat.  A sob.  A horrified whimper.  
     Marrow and Nell stand there speechless.  It's as if saying the 
     obvious will make it real:

                               MARROW
                   Luke.

     BANG.  The blood-splattered LION'S HEAD drops open.  Luke's head 
     falls out.

     Theo SCREAMS and SCREAMS again.  Nell backs away with Marrow, almost
     has the presence of mind to drag them away, but --

     -- CLANG!  The ASH DROP OPENS.  The sudden sound stops them in their
     tracks.

     As they watch, it's as if the House INHALES.  And BOOM!

     Out of the ash drop EXPLODES a hail of BONES, SKULLS, FLYING ASH.

     Nell, Theo and Marrow back up toward the Grand Staircase as TONS OF
     INCINERATED HUMAN REMAINS vomit from the fireplace, blasting across
     the floor, knocking over furniture with shocking violence.  Skulls
     bounce over wood.  Hundreds of them.

     Theo and Marrow cover their faces as shattered bits of bone, loose
     teeth pelt them.  Nell is immune.

     They run up the Grand Staircase toward the top and finally it can't
     reach them anymore.

     INT. MEZZANINE - NIGHT

     They look out at the full scope of Crain's horror.

                               THEO
                   Oh God, we can't get out!

                               MARROW
                   Nell, what do we do?

                               NELL
                   He played hide and seek with the 
                   children.  That's how he built the 
                   house.

     Marrow stares at her, trembling.  He glances around at the winding
     labyrinth of house.  Impossible.

                               MARROW
                   We can't hide in here!  We won't 
                   make it til morning.

     Nell looks at him, pitying.  Infinitely sad, but guarding them.

                               NELL
                   I know.

     Behind them the huge painting of Hugh Crain in a golden frame with
     sharp metal spikes, looks down at them.  The room inhales and 
     exhales, the bumping sound resumes.  A rumble runs through the house 
     and they all look down in fear toward the great hall where a cloud 
     of ashes still hangs in the air.

     Unseen by them, this rumble start to shake the painting behind them.
     The sound from the great hall makes Marrow and Theo back up more, 
     but Nell doesn't move... she senses something is about to happen and 
     she will fight it...

     She suddenly turns and sees the painting... in a flash she reaches 
     out for Marrow and Theo, pull them out of the way as the giant 
     painting with the huge skull, falls face down toward them.  It 
     misses them by a hair, but their clothes are shredded by the spikes.

     Marrow and Theo are-shocked as they back up right toward the GRIFFIN
     on top of the staircase.

     For a split second the BRASS Griffin right behind them, comes alive,
     opens it's fangs and claws and is ready to attack... but Nell sees 
     the danger, grabs a human bone and batters the griffin.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No, no, you leave them alone!

     And the griffin turns back into brass.  Marrow and Theo unaware of 
     what happened behind them.  They have to get out of there.

     INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Nell leads Marrow and Theo down the dark hallway, the twisted 
     woodwork along the walls frozen, but seeming poised to reach out, 
     trip someone, grab a sleeve.

     It is a nightmare House.  Doing what it was made for.

     The BUMPING they've left behind seems to vanish up and into the
     ceiling.  It gives chase, on the floor above.  Nell keeps looking 
     back, and every time she does the BUMPING seems to get more firm, 
     MORE LIKE A FOOTSTEP.  Calm, Nell urges them on.

                               NELL
                   Hurry.

     The FOOTSTEPS upstairs come faster; whatever's up there moving 
     better, more naturally.

     Theo and Marrow turn LEFT through an archway.  Nell looks back at 
     the ceiling.  The thing's moving fast.

     She dodges toward the archway where Theo and Marrow went, and STOPS.
     It's a wall.  Solid wall.  There's no archway here!  Nell backs 
     away.  Alone.

     The House has separated them.

     Nell tries to open any of the hall doors, but they are all locked.
     There's no other way then going back.

     INT. MEZZANINE - DAY

     Nell is back in the mezzanine, steps carefully over Crain's 
     painting.  The long white lace curtains in front of a side window 
     start to flutter in the wind... but the window is closed!

     Nell walks up to the top of the stairs, her back to the window, 
     calls out:

                               NELL
                   Jim!  Theo!

     No answer, and as she steps forward, listening for a reply, the
     CURTAIN BILLOWS OUT behind her, and in its movement, becomes for a
     split second, the image of CRAIN, GRABBING for her.

     Nell, oblivious, steps just OUT OF REACH, and as the breeze fails, 
     the contours and patterns of the billowing curtain dissolve into 
     chaos.  Nell glances back at it, just sees curtain, and looks up at 
     the open window.

     She turns from it, determined, and starts out to find her friends 
     and walks down the steps.

     INT. GRAND STAIRCASE/GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON THE BRASS GRIFFINS that guard the staircase.

     Behind Nell's back they all turn toward her, follow her with their
     eyes as Nell enters the great hall.  And they cower in fear for what 
     is about to happen.  Again Nell call's out for Theo and Marrow.

     And Nell doesn't see the scores of TINY ARMS OF CHILDREN that fold 
     out from the carvings in the high backed chairs in the hall as Nell
     carefully avoids stepping on the skulls and bones of the children 
     that cover the floor.

     Horrifyingly alive are these TINY HANDS as reach out for her hair
     after she passes.  We're screaming as they almost have her... and 
     Nell steps away.

     And then... CREAK... CREAK... CREAK...

     The terrified animal heads on the balustrade, their eyes flash in
     fear.  The lions above the big fireplace snarl restlessly.

     Cherubim, afraid, clasp hands.  Gods and men pay unwilling witness 
     to what is now coming down the stairs.

     The upper flight of stairs strains under the weight of the thing
     coming down, over our heads, coming down, down... and now at the
     landing.  The sound stops.

     Nell's BREATH escapes, visible in the cold as she watches, rooted to
     the floor in the Grand Entry.

     Darkness against darkness.  Something BLOCKS the glint of the gilded
     frame up on the landing.  Something huge.  A beat.

     And then a SHADOW sweeps across the scene, impenetrable, darkening 
     the stairs, wiping them from sight, like something gliding down 
     them.

     Before our eyes, out of the most subtle variation of shadow, 
     flickers into existence:

     THE SHAPE, tall, eight or nine feet, featureless, black, but in the
     proportions of an enormous man with his head bowed, shoulders 
     stooped.  And just like that, all it is...

     ...is a well of darkness and night once again.  We don't even know 
     for sure what we just saw.  But it is still there in that bar of 
     shadow.

     Nell goes rigid, not breathing, not seeing anything but the awful
     presence.  She is spellbound.

     BANG.  A door in the connecting passage opens, and Theo and Marrow 
     come out, between Nell in the entry and the thing in the Great Hall 
     beyond.

     In a flash the SHAPE is moving at Theo and Marrow.  They don't see 
     it, have their backs turned.

                               THEO
                   Nell!  There you --

     But Nell is looking past them.  They see her face and turn around.

                               NELL
                   Nooo, not them!

     What is coming at them makes the blood stop.

     The Shape rushes from the Great Hall, vanishing as it crosses the
     pools of moonlight, reforming darker as it hits shadow again, its 
     wake like a shockwave, invisible itself, but VISIBLE IN ITS EFFECTS:

     Theo SCREAMS.  Marrow stumbles back.  And then Nell's voice rings 
     out:

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Is this where she bashed your 
                   brains in?

     The onrushing presence STOPS.  Seems to turn its attention to Nell,
     standing there before the towering front doors.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   When you came in the door?  I bet 
                   that was the last thing you 
                   expected.  Right?  From Carolyn?
                          (beat)
                   You thought, oh, Carolyn, I've 
                   taken it all out of her, you 
                   thought, Oh, Carolyn, she's no 
                   threat.  Carolyn.  Great Grandma 
                   Carolyn.  Did you know that?

     Nell shows no fear.  There's a ferocious edge to her voice.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   She found out what you did, and 
                   she knew there was only one way to 
                   stop you.  And she stopped you, so 
                   you couldn't torture anymore of 
                   the living.
                          (beat)
                   But you wouldn't even let go of 
                   the dead, would you?  Well, now 
                   I'm here.  They called me.  Did 
                   you know that?  They've been 
                   crying out for help for a long 
                   time.  And I heard them.

     She points out at the human remains strewn all over the Great Hall.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   And I won't let you hurt them 
                   anymore.

     The SHAPE hovers there, silent.  Air and shadow distort around it.  
     The carved animal heads on the Newell posts and walls loll back and 
     forth, alive then not-alive.  Pieces of furniture stamp in fury, try 
     to animate themselves, but can't find limbs that work.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Come on, Hugh Crain, you know what 
                   to do.  We've both been here 
                   before.

     The SHAPE HOWLS FORWARD, knocking everyone out of their seats.  It
     flies across the floor at Nell.

     Marrow and Theo are slammed against the walls out of its way.

     Nell OPENS WIDE HER ARMS in an EMBRACE.

     It's ON HER, but just as it seems to hit, it SPLITS like she went
     right through it.  The SHAPE and all the debris in its wake IMPACTS
     deep in the enormous doors.

     The carved WOODWORK seems to suck it all in, cracking, groaning.  
     And then all the SCREAMS are cut off.

     Nell stands there with her arms spread.  A long moment.

     She opens her eyes.

     And then the woodwork LASHES OUT, grabs her from behind, slams her
     back against the doors.  THE BLOW HAS KILLED HER.

     We feel her bones break as she crumples, is drawn into the woodwork.

     And for a few seconds Nell's body just hangs there... and then it
     gently falls down.

     Theo lets out a horrified cry as she runs toward Nell.

                               THEO
                   NELL!

     Marrow gets up off the floor in terror and awe, his life his 
     beliefs changed forever.  He walks over to Nell and feels her pulse, 
     knowing it is a useless gesture as Theo softly moans over Nell.

     And as the camera pans up across the entry door, we see a new 
     carving in the sculpted doors.  It is a woman and as we move in we 
     can see that she wears the same necklace as Nell...

     INT. HILL HOUSE FRONT DOORS, ENTRY - EARLY MORNING

     The HOUSE INHALES.  And BOOM!

     The front doors blast wide.  Every door in the entry slams open.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

     Against the early light of a rising sun, the silhouette of Hill 
     House. Every window and every door in the House is open, each and 
     every one CRYING OUT with a different, unintelligible voice, like a 
     soul, the soul of a child, escaping from each one.

     EXT. GATE - DAWN

     Theo and Marrow stand on the far side of Nell's wrecked car.  On the
     other side of the gate Mr. Dudley is undoing the chain.  Mrs. Dudley
     stares at the ragged duo.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                          (her final verdict)
                   City people.

     Mr. Dudley can barely get one side of the gate open with the car
     crushed in it.  Theo and Marrow emerge, dazed, into the real world
     again.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   You find out what you wanted to 
                   know, mister?

     Marrow stares at him, he's an exhausted man.  He walks away, Theo
     beside him.

                               THEO
                   I'm not going back to New York 
                   City.  I'm going to find an 
                   apartment with a little flower 
                   garden, where you can just see the 
                   ocean and at night, when the wind 
                   comes in just right, you can hear 
                   the sound of the harbor.  What 
                   about you?

                               MARROW
                   I'm a scientist.  I just conducted 
                   an experiment.  Now I have to 
                   write it up.

                               THEO
                   But the experiment was a failure.

     Now, we could have him say this line...

                               MARROW
                   Was it?

     But he should just look at her, and say the same thing with his 
     eyes.

     We pull back.

     EXT. BERKSHIRE HILLS - DAY (AERIAL)

     The summer hills lie green, passing fast underneath.  Clearings loom
     out of the forest ahead.  And there, its sprawling stone in the
     sunshine, rises Hill House.

                                                       FADE OUT.



     ALTERNATE ENDING

     EXT. GATE - DAWN

     Theo and Marrow stand on the far side of Nell's wrecked car.  On the
     other side of the gate Mr. Dudley is undoing the chain.  Mrs. Dudley
     stares at the ragged duo.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                          (her final verdict)
                   City people.

     Mr. Dudley can barely get one side of the gate open with the car
     crushed in it.  Theo and Marrow emerge, dazed, into the real world
     again.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   You find out what you wanted to 
                   know, mister?

     Marrow stares at him, he's an exhausted man.  He walks away, Theo
     beside him.

     As they walk away, the SOUND OF APPLAUSE comes up.

                                                       WE DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. PRINTING PLANT - DAY

     Where the applause turns out to be the sound of a press finishing a
     run of a book.  This could be shot in an old press in England, or a
     foundry, with a few pieces of equipment to suggest a press.  There 
     are stacks of books.  This is the printing press in Hell.  The NOISE 
     is deafening.

     The title of the book: FEAR AND PERFORMANCE.

     Marrow stands before a mountain of copies of the book.  A PRINTER 
     very proudly hands him a copy.

                               PRINTER
                          (has to shout)
                   First copy!

     Marrow opens the book.  The Printer looks at the page over his
     shoulder.

                               PRINTER (cont'd)
                          (reads)
                   This book is dedicated to Eleanor 
                   Vance, Luke Sanderson, Rene Crain 
                   and Carolyn Crain.
                          (to Marrow)
                   They'll be happy to see this.  
                   Their names in a book, it kind of 
                   makes them immortal, doesn't it?

     Marrow looks at him.

                               MARROW
                   In a way.

     Marrow studies the page.  We go into the whiteness of the page to:

     EXT. HILL HOUSE - DAY

     Where we find Theo.  The House is beautiful today, it's sunny, there
     are flowers outside, the mood has changed.  Theo is now softened, 
     she's found something better than what she had.  She goes into the 
     house.

     INT. HILL HOUSE - DAY

CUT TO INT.

SCHOOL FRENCH CLASS - MORNINGClass 3A are in the midst of a French lesson. All the class have name cards hanging around their necks denoting their chosen "French name." MISS WALLER gestures at a screed of subjugated verbs scrawled on the blackboard.

MISS WALLER The imperfect subjunctive, like the imperfect indicative, indicates action in the past. "II voulait qu'elle lui donnat de l'argent." Translate, somebody . . . quickly!

A SCHOOLGIRL - LAURA - blurts out from the front of the class.

LAURA 
"He wanted her to give him some money."

MISS WALLER 
(Angry) Put your hand up! I will not have girls talking out of turn in my class!

The door opens and Miss Stewart brings Juliet into the room.

The presence of the headmistress causes the class to stand up.

MISS STEWART
Good morning, gels.

CLASS (In Unison) Good morning, Miss Stewart.

The class sit.

MISS STEWART
Miss Waller . . . class . . . this is Juliet Hulme. Juliet is joining us from St. Margaret's, and prior to that she spent some time at Queenswood in the Hawkes Bay.

Juliet looks at Miss Stewart haughtily.

JULIET
I am actually from England, Miss Stewart.

MISS STEWART
Of course . . . Juliet's father is Dr. Hulme, the Rector of the University.

Miss Waller looks impressed. Pauline is quietly drawing horses at the back of the class.

MISS STEWART
Juliet's travelled all over the world, and I'm sure she'll be very eager to share her impressions of exotic lands across the seas with the gels of 3A. I'll leave you to it, Miss Waller. Juliet.

Miss Stewart leaves. Miss Waller smiles at Juliet.

MISS WALLER 
You can sit over here, Juliet.

Miss Waller gestures to a desk at the front. She gives Juliet a cardboard name card.

MISS WALLER 
We use French names in this class. You can choose your own.

Miss Waller returns to the blackboard and starts writing.

MISS WALLER 
Now, irregular verbs in the present subjunctive. . . "qu'il vienne". . .

JULIET
Excuse me, Miss Waller . . . you've made a mistake.

Miss Waller turns to Juliet-who now has the name "Antoinette" hanging around her neck.

JULIET
"Je doutais qu'il vienne" is in fact the spoken subjunctive.

MISS WALLER 
It is customary to stand when addressing a teacher . . . "Antoinette."

Juliet stands.

JULIET
You should have written "vint."

Miss Waller frowns, glances at the board, and hastily rubs out the offending word.

MISS WALLER 
(Embarrassed mumble) Oh! I must have copied it incorrectly from my notes.

Juliet stands again.

JULIET
You don't have to apologise, Miss Waller. I found it frightfully difficult myself . . . until I got the hang of it.

Miss Waller turns to Juliet, her face clouded with anger. The class looks terrified.

MISS WALLER 
(Icily) Thank you, Juliet. Open your text-book to page 17.

Pauline is smirking.

CUT TO:

INT. SCHOOL ART CLASS - DAY
The teacher, MRS. COLLINS, comes in, carrying a pile of paper and a box of paints. She starts to distribute them around the tables.

MRS. COLLINS 
Right, I thought we'd do some life drawing today. Pair off into twos and decide who wants to model and who wants to draw.

The girls around Juliet turn to each other, seemingly eager not to be partnered with her. They pair off and Juliet is left alone.

MRS. COLLINS 
Oh, Juliet. . . you haven't got a partner.

JULIET
That s all right, Mrs. Collins. I'm sure I can manage without one.

Mrs. Collins scans the class.

MRS. COLLINS 
Pauline . . . are you with anybody?

Pauline shakes her head.

MRS. COLLINS 
Good! You can come here and pair up with Juliet.

Pauline reluctantly comes up to Juliet's table.

SERIES of SHOTS showing VARIOUS GIRLS sketching their partners. Most of the posing girls are seated in contrived positions with rigid grins on their faces. Mrs. Collins patrols the class, commenting to different girls.

MRS. COLLINS 
You might want to change the colour- make it a bit darker . . . that's very nice, Joan.

PULL BACK. . . to reveal Pauline's "pose" . . . slumped in the chair, arms crossed, a sullen look on her face. She stares intently at Juliet, who is drawing furiously . . . but doesn't refer to Pauline at all.

MRS. COLLINS 
Good heavens, Juliet! What on earth is this???

Mrs. Collins picks up Juliet's drawing. It features an armoured knight on horseback, fighting a dragon.

JULIET
St. George and the Dragon.

Mrs. Collins studies the detail in the drawing.

MRS. COLLINS 
Where's Pauline?

JULIET
Oh, I haven't gotten around to drawing her yet. I was going to pop her on a rock, but I seem to have run out room.

Juliet glances at Pauline.

JULIET
Sorry! I don't know if you've noticed, Mrs. Collin but I've actually drawn St. George in the likeness of world's greatest tenor-Mario Lanza!

MRS. COLLINS 
Yes, I know it's very clever, Juliet, but when I set you a topic, I expect you to follow it. Now put that down and start again!

Mrs. Collins moves on. Juliet looks up at Pauline rather grumpily. Pauline leans forward, an intense look on face . . .

PAULINE
(Whispers) I think your drawing's fantastic!

HONORA RIEPER is standing at her sink bench. She is 43 years old. Dark hair, going gray. A middle-aged woman with a kind face.

Her husband, HERBERT, has just arrived home and is taking off his coat, looking at the mail, etc. He is nearly 60 . . . 15 years older than Honora.

The Riepers' house is clean and tidy. They are a low middle-class family on a modest income.

HONORA 
Oh! . . . Mackerel. We'll have them for lunch tomorrow.

Herbert comes up behind Honora, gives her a peck on cheek and puts his hand on her bum.

HERBERT 
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?

HONORA 
playfully shoves his hand away.

HONORA 
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.

HERBERT 
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.

young student boarder, STEVE BAYLISS, appears in doorway, nervously clutching a record.

STEVE 
Excuse me . . . would you mind if I put my long-playing record on?

HERBERT 
You're partial to a nice bit of mackerel, aren't you, STEVE?

STEVE 
 Well . . . actually, I'm not much of a fish man, Mr. Rieper.

HONORA 
glances at his album.

HONORA 
You have been splashing out!

STEVE 
 Oh! . . . I've got my board money . . .

STEVE 
 starts fishing in his pockets.

At this moment . . . Pauline comes into the kitchen, through back door. She strides past Honora, HERBERT and STEVE 
.

PAULINE
(Brightly) Hello!

HONORA 
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?

Pauline disappears into the lounge.

PAULINE
(O.S.) (Calling) Got an A, Mum!

HONORA 
glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.

HONORA 
Don't worry about it now. We'll sort it out after dinner. You go put your record on.

HERBERT 
Doris Day!

STEVE 
 I think she's very talented!

INT. RIEPERS'HOUSE/LOUNGE - EVENINGCLOSE-UP. . . gramophone needle drops onto a record.

FAST PULL-BACK . . . from the speaker as the opening notes of "Be My Love" by Mario Lanza burst out. Records from the cabinet lie scattered on the floor. Pauline is clutching a Mario Lanza album.

STEVE backs toward the hallway door, holding his Doris Day album forlornly.

HERBERT chuckles at him through the kitchen doorway.

HERBERT 
(Laughing) Ya gotta be quick in this house, mate!

Pauline stares misty-eyed at the album cover. HERBERT 
calls out.

HERBERT 
(O.S.) (Tongue in cheek) Hey! Isn't it that Irish singer . . . Murray O' Lanza?

PAULINE
(annoyed) He's Italian, Dad! The world's greatest tenor!

Mario Lanza starts singing . . . HERBERT comes into the lounge, miming the song with a limp fish. He gesticulates a grand operatic fashion.

PAULINE
Stop it! You're spoiling it! Go away!

She pushes HERBERT out of the room, into the kitchen.

MRS. ZWARTZ Left, right . . . Ieft, right . . . one and two and one and . . .

Pauline and Juliet are sidelined on a bench. Pauline is writing in a textbook. She notices Juliet glancing at her leg. Juliet moves closer.

JULIET
Can I have another look?

Pauline purses her lips and quickly pushes her left stocking down . . . She has a large ugly scar running up her left shin, from ankle to knee.

JULIET
That's so impressive!

Pauline does not look convinced.

JULIET
(Conspiratorial) I've got scars . . . they're on my lungs.

Pauline looks surprised.

JULIET
I was in bed for months during the war, ravaged by respiratory illness.

EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

PAULINE
Osteomyelitus turns your bones to chalk. It took them two years to drain all the muck out.

EXT. ILAM/DRIVEWAY - DAYLOW ANGLE . . . a tree-lined driveway.

Pauline rides her bicycle up the drive. She pauses, wide-eyed.

PAN TO . . . ILAM - a large stately house, set amongst beautiful gardens . . .

Pauline puts her bike on its stand. She pulls the Mario Lanza album out of her bicycle bag.

Pauline is about to approach the house when she glances across the garden, and is transfixed by an enchanting sight:

Juliet on a sunlit bridge that spans the Ilam stream. She is wearing a shredded chiffon dress, with a Christmas tinsel crown and a necklace made from tinfoil. Sunlight filters through the trees, lending Juliet a magical quality. She's casting flowers onto the water. Pauline stands transfixed. Juliet sees her and smiles.

JULIET
Hi, Paul!

SUDDENLY! . . . an 8-year-old boy - JONATHON HULME - comes charging out of the bushes and lays into Juliet with a wooden sword. He is dressed in a "prince's" costume.

JULIET
0www!

Jonathon runs away. Juliet gives chase, yelling to Pauline.

JULIET
The evil Prince Runnymeade is escaping! Get him, Paul!

Pauline joins in the chase after Jonathon, careening through garden and bushes.

Juliet and Pauline lose sight of Jonathon. They pause in a clearing, catching their breath.

JULIET
The blighter's gone to ground!

JONATHON Yaaaa!

Jonathon drops from a tree, onto Pauline, sending, her sprawling. He whacks her on the bottom with his wooden sword.

JULIET
God! Jonty! Jonty-stop it! Go away! We're not playing anymore . . . go on, bugger off!

Jonathon pokes his tongue at Juliet, turns and runs away.

Juliet offers her hand and pulls Pauline up. She pauses, a look of shock on her face . . .

The Mario Lanza record lies broken on the ground. Pauline looks distraught.

JULIET
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!

PAULINE
(Upset) It doesn't matter.

JULIET
Of course it matters! It's Mario!

I NT. ILAM/LOUNGE - DAYCLOSE ON . . . HENRY HULME - a 44-year-old bespectacled academic. He is sniffing, with a disdainful look on his face. He pulls a packet of mouldy sandwiches his jacket pocket.

HENRY What on earth are these?

HILDA HULME, elegant, 36 years old, is setting down a tray of tea on a small table.

HILDA They're egg and salmon sandwiches . . . I gave them to you several days ago.

HENRY I thought I could smell sulphur.

HILDA God, Henry! You're hopeless! You can't be trusted with something as simple as lunch.

JULIET
(O.S.) Mother!

Hilda looks up as Juliet bursts into the room from the garden, followed by Pauline. Hilda smiles at Pauline.

HILDA Hello . . .

JULIET
Jonty broke Paul's record!

HILDA Oh, dear!

JULIET
We must buy her another one!

Juliet drops to the floor, hauling records out of the radiogram cabinet.

Pauline looks around, taking in the sumptuousness of her surroundings: ornate fireplace, paintings, antique furniture.

HILDA Would you like a cup of tea . . . Paul?

PAULINE
No, thank you.

HILDA Well, Juliet's told us all about you. I hear you're fond of opera.

Before Pauline can reply, Juliet fans Mario Lanza albums across the floor.

JULIET
Which one shall we play?

Pauline shrugs awkwardly. Henry looks up from his papers, rather annoyed at this intrusion. Pauline notices a row of beautifully sculpted Plasticine horses adorning the mantelpiece.

Juliet puts a record on the turntable.

HILDA Juliet . . . your father's trying to study.

JULIET
Daddy can study while we're playing records!

HENRY Why don't you go back outside, mmm? I'll be finished soon.

The record drops on the turntable. The arm swings across.

Henry and Hilda glance at each other. Henry silently gathers up his papers and leaves the room.

The needle drops and Mario Lanza's rendition of "The Donkey Serenade" booms into the room.

SWIRLING CAMERA as Juliet takes Pauline's hand and whirls her around, leading her into . . .

The Donkey Serenade finishes abruptly in mid-verse.

Pauline is lying on her back.

Pauline's POV . . . looking straight up into treetops and blue sky. Juliet's face looms over, looking concerned.

JULIET
(Worried) Paul? Oh, God! Paul . . . are you all right?

Pauline's eyes are shut. She speaks with great effort.

PAULINE
(Gasping) I think I'm dying . . .

JULIET
(Upset) Don't . . . please! Please, don't!

Dying breath escapes from Pauline's mouth . . . she goes limp.

Juliet shrieks!

JULIET
(Crying) Paul!!!

Juliet collapses over Pauline's body, crying.

Pauline's eyes flick open! She sniffs and pulls a face.

PAULINE
Urrrgh! You've been eating onions.

Before Juliet has time to react, Pauline pushes her off, giggling maniacally. She leaps to her feet and attempts to run. Juliet grabs Pauline's cardigan, pulling her backwards.

JULIET
You toad!

Pauline sheds the cardigan and runs through the bushes, with Juliet in hot pursuit!

RRRRIP! . . . Juliet tugs at Pauline's blouse and the buttons pop off. Pauline is laughing too hard to run anymore. She pulls off her skirt and waves it around her head as she dances around the bushes, singing "The Donkey Serenade."

PAULINE
(Singing) "There's a light in her eye, Though she may try to hide it, She cannot deny, There's a light in her eye."

Now Juliet is cracking up at the sight of Pauline spinning around in her underwear, shoes and socks.

Pauline circles around and around Juliet, singing. Juliet hurriedly starts undressing down to her underwear.

Juliet giggles and starts jumping up and down.

Pauline suddenly breaks into a run and races through the bushes. Juliet follows.

Both girls are screaming and hooting loudly. Pauline and Juliet burst out of the bushes and . . .

ON THE SOUNDTRACK . . . Mario Lanza picks up "The Donkey Serenade" at the point that Pauline and Juliet stopped. The song builds to a rousing final chorus as . . .

Pauline and Juliet collapse on the ground, rolling and tumbling in an embrace.

Three candles illuminate a little shrine, nestled flower bed in a remote corner of the Ilam garden.

Bricks have been stacked to form a miniature temple, decorated with flowers and tinsel.

Pauline and Juliet are kneeling on the ground, clipping pictures from film magazines. Clipped-out photos lie scattered about.

Pauline holds James Mason's photo.

PAULINE
(Enraptured) I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!

JULIET
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!

Pauline reacts with a degree of shock.

PAULINE
But, we're all going to Heaven!

JULIET
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.

Pauline giggles.

JULIET
It's an absolute Paradise of music, art and enjoyment.

Pauline is entranced. Juliet plucks up some photos.

JULIET
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.

Juliet screws her face up and throws the photo into the stream.

JULIET
Absolutely not! Orson Welles! The most hideous man alive!

Juliet dramatically sweeps her hand over the photos in the shrine and bows her head.

JULIET
We give praise to . . . the saints!

Candlelight flickers on Pauline s enraptured face.

The crumpled photo of Orson Welles floats down the stream. With a sudden violent burst of sound, it is sucked into the weir.

She leaves the room. Juliet raises her eyebrows at Pauline, who looks embarrassed.

PAULINE
(Quietly) It's my middle name.

HERBERT 
smiles at Juliet.

HERBERT 
Yvonne tells us you're good at making models.

JULIET
I adore anything to do with the arts.

HERBERT 
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?

Pauline looks down, cheeks burning.

HERBERT 
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.

JULIET
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT 
shakes his head.

HERBERT 
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.

Muffled voices from the hallway.

PAULINE
He's the manager!

HONORA 
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.

HONORA 
(O.S.) This is the dining room . . .

She smiles at Juliet.

HONORA 
Do excuse us.

She leads John into the hallway.

HONORA 
(O.S.) Breakfast is between seven and nine . . . the bedroom's small, but it's very clean and comfortable.

Pauline scowls.

HERBERT 
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.

JULIET
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.

HERBERT 
(Laughs) Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!

HERBERT 
chuckles. Pauline and Juliet look at each with knowing smiles.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) We have decided how sad it is for other people that they cannot appreciate our genius . . .

CUT TO:

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAYTRACKING ALONG . . . past trees - with sunlight streaming through the branches.

Pauline's V.O. continues . . .

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) . . . but we hope the book will help them to do so a little, though no one could fully appreciate us.

The Hulmes' car is driving along a narrow, winding road on the way to Port Levy.

EXT. WHARF - DAYSUPER: "Port Levy, Easter 1953"

Juliet, in her swimming costume, runs to the end of the jetty and teeters nervously on the edge. Pauline fearlessly barrels past her and jumps in.

SERIES of BLACK & WHITE "HOLIDAY SNAPS":

Girls splashing in the water; Jonathon with ice cream smeared over his face; Henry paddling with trousers and rolled up; Hilda on deck chair.

EXT. PORT LEVY BEACH - DAYPauline and Juliet are in the middle of building an elaborate sand castle. Juliet is working on a tower.

PAULINE
Deborah awaits his return in their private boudoir at the very top of the tower.

TRACKING from sand castle courtyard, up steps into tower.

JULIET
He smells her scent from 50 paces and urges his steed onward!

CAMERA rushes into . . . tower bedroom . . . PANS from Pauline's to Juliet's face, peering in through windows.

PAULINE
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!

JULIET
God, yes!

Juliet starts to giggle at a private thought.

JULIET
(Giggling) I bet she gets up the duff on their first night together!

Pauline guffaws with delight. Jonathon is sitting nearby, digging a hole in the sand.

JONATHON What's "up the duff"?

JULIET
Something you wouldn't understand.

Jonathon launches himself at Juliet, and they roll on the sand, grappling.

JONATHON Tell me! I'm almost 10!

JULIET
You're eight and a half and incredibly stupid!

Pauline is laughing happily.

EXT. COTTAGE - DAYHilda sits on a deck chair in front of the cottage, brushing Pauline's hair. Henry is seated at a table, writing a letter.

Juliet is lying on a towel, making notes in an exercise book.

JULIET
Mummy . . . Pauline and I have decided the Charles and Deborah are going to have a baby. An heir to the throne of Borovnia.

HILDA What a splendid idea!

JULIET
We're calling him Diello.

HILDA That's a good, dramatic name!

JULIET
Paul thought it up.

Pauline beams.

HILDA Aren't you clever! There, all done.

Pauline stands. Juliet touches Pauline's hair. Hilda laughs.

Henry is rifling through his briefcase.

HENRY Hilda! I can't find that letter from the High Commission. They want our passport numbers.

JULIET
(Surprised) Are you going abroad, Daddy?

Hilda scowls at Henry.

HILDA Your father's attending a university conference in England, darling.

HENRY We'll only be away for a few weeks.

Juliet looks at Hilda, a trace of panic across her face.

JULIET
(Worried) You're not going, are you, Mummy?

Hilda hesitates.

HILDA Well . . . I thought I might. It's a long time for your father and I to be apart.

JULIET
But I should go, too!

HILDA Darling, you've got school. You've only just settled in.

JULIET
But- Hilda suddenly stands.

HILDA Who's coming to the shops? I need some cigarettes.

Jonathon barrels out of the cottage.

JONATHON Me! I'm coming.

HILDA (O.S.) Put on your shoes, Jonathon!

CAMERA MOVES IN . . . to Juliet's distraught face.

EXT. PORT LEVY HILLSIDE - EARLY EVENINGClouds swirling about the sky.

A grassy hillside overlooking Port Levy bay. An island sits in the bay, bathed in the last rays of sunlight.

Juliet is a tiny figure against the vast landscape. She runs blindly toward the edge of the hill.

Pauline appears over the brow . . . the hillside is empty! She panics, running, calling out.

PAULINE
(Worried) Julie! Julie!

Pauline finds Juliet curled up in a little ball. She is motionless. Pauline gently takes Juliet in her arms. Juliet is breathing heavily . . . she squeezes her eyes shut, concentrating hard-a look of desperation on her face.

JULIET
Look, Paul!

Pauline looks about, but can see nothing but a scrubby hillside. She looks mystified.

PAULINE
What?

JULIET
It's so beautiful!

PAULINE
What???

Golden light streams on Pauline and Juliet. Pauline look up as the clouds above them open. Juliet stands as if in trance. She offers her hand to Pauline.

JULIET
Come with me.

Juliet pulls Pauline up and hugs her as they walk forward. The barren landscape around Pauline and Juliet morphs into a beautiful garden . . . the Fourth World!

EXT. FOURTH WORLD - DAYPauline and Juliet are amazed! . . . They stand, holding each other's hand tightly. The world around them take on a new form.

The grass beneath their feet has become a well-kept lawn. They are surrounded by fountains and waterfalls. Unicorns graze on the hillside . . . gigantic butterflies hover in the air.

Pauline and Juliet walk about in wonderment.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Today Juliet and I discovered the key to the Fourth World. We have had it in our possession for about six months, but we only realised it on the day of the Death of Christ. We saw a gateway through the clouds. Everything was full of peace and bliss. We then realised we had the key . . .

CUT TO:

INT. HULMES' CAR/COUNTRYSIDE - DAYAs Pauline's V.O. continues . . . CAMERA TRACKS IN SLOWLY, past Henry and Hilda, to a SHOT of Pauline and Juliet sitting quietly, staring ahead, blissfully.

PAULINE
(Diary V0.) We have an extra part of our brain which can appreciate the Fourth World. Only about 10 people have it. On two days every year we may use the key and look into that beautiful world which we have been lucky enough to be allowed to know of . . .

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAYWIDE SHOT . . . the Hulmes' car, a small speck at the BOTTOM OF FRAME, winding over the hills.

INT. ILAM/JULIET'S BEDROOM - DAYCLOSE-UP . . .Juliet's face twisted with pain. She gasps as if in labour. Short, harsh panting. Pauline look panic-stricken.

PAULINE
Push! . . . Breathe! . . . It's coming! . . . Oh, God!

PULL OUT . . . to reveal Juliet lying on her bed, in childbirth pose. Her pregnant stomach is pushing at the seams of her school dress.

Juliet wails . . . Pauline pulls out a pillow from between Juliet's legs, her face a mixture of surprise and elation.

PAULINE
It's a boy! Deborah . . . we've got a son and heir!

Pauline hands Juliet the pillow. She cradles it in her arms.

JULIET
I shall call him Diello.

PAULINE
You're such an incredible woman.

JULIET
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.

INT. SCHOOL/ENGLISH CLASS - DAY"THE ROLE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY TODAY" - written on the blackboard. Mrs. STEVE

The class titters . . . they clearly want to I STEVE 
ns s glare deters them.

Pauline sits at the back, smirking.

MRS. STEVE 
NS (Icy) Thank you, Juliet!

JULIET
. . . However, the Queen's biggest problem is her renegade child, Diello. He has proven to be an uncontrollable little brighter, who slaughters his nannies whenever the fancy takes him . . .

MRS. STEVE 
NS That's enough, Juliet!

Juliet stops and stands quietly. Mrs. STEVE 
ns rips the essay out of her hand and waves it under her nose.

MRS. STEVE 
NS I suppose this is your idea of a joke?

JULIET
No, Mrs. STEVE 
ns.

MRS. STEVE 
NS I suppose you think it's witty and clever to mock the Royal Family . . . to poke fun a the Empire, with this . . . rubbish!

Pauline leaps to her feet.

PAULINE
It's not rubbish!

MRS. STEVE 
NS Sit down, Pauline!

JULIET
I really don't understand why you are upset, Mrs. STEVE 
n. I merely wrote an essay on the Royal Family as requested.

Pauline points at the blackboard.

PAULINE
It doesn't say it has to be the Windsors!

MRS. STEVE 
NS (Yelling) Sit down!

Pauline sits down, looking victorious.

MRS. STEVE 
NS (To Juliet) A girl like you should be setting an example! To your seat!

Juliet starts coughing. Mrs. STEVE 
ns's face darkens.

MRS. STEVE 
NS Stop it, Juliet!

Juliet continues coughing. She sits heavily. Pauline snorts, trying not to laugh.

Juliet slumps over her desk, coughing . . . globules of blood splatter her exercise book.

Pauline's smile vanishes.

CUT TO:

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/HALLWAY - NIGHTPauline is standing in the hallway, holding the phone to her ear. She slowly lowers it, her face shocked.

PAULINE

CUT TO:

HONORA 
Come on, sit up.

PAULINE
I'm not hungry.

HONORA 
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.

PAULINE
I just want to be on my own for a while.

HONORA 
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.

HONORA 
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!

HONORA 
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.

PAULINE
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?

HONORA 
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.

PAULINE
But she'll have no one to look after her!

HILDA It's not too late to cancel our travel arrangements . . . if that's what you want?

Juliet tearfully shakes her head. Henry is standing at the foot of the bed, hands behind his back.

HENRY I'm sure you'll like it here . . . it's very tranquil.

HILDA I've spoken to the Matron, and she promises to take special care of you.

HENRY And you can carry on with your studies while you convalesce.

Hilda touches Juliet's hand, and leans forward . . . a concerned look on her face.

HONORA

HERBERT 
Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?

Pauline remains silent.

HONORA 
You used to love making things with Dad, Yvonne.

MOVE IN . . . on Pauline, who has not been listening.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) This evening I had a brainwave: that Juliet and I should write to each other as Charles and Deborah.

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S SLEEPOUT - NIGHTPauline is lying on her bed, furiously writing a letter.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I wrote a six-page letter as Charles and a two-page letter as Paul.

INT. SANATORIUM - DAYJuliet lies on her bed, writing to Pauline.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) She has entered into the spirit of the thing greatly!

As we listen to Juliet's V.O., we see SCENES of TB hospital life . . . the meals brought around . . . the dayroom . . . the DOCTORS.

JULIET
(Letter V.O.) My dear Charles, I miss you and adore you in equal amounts and long for the day we will be reunited, but as I languish here, in this house of disease and decrepitude, my mind turns-with increasing frequency- to the problem of our son . . .

INT. SANATORIUM/JULIET'S ROOM - DAYJuliet sits at a desk. sculpting and painting a Plasticine figure of Diello.

As her V.O. continues . . . TRACK INTO a CLOSE-UP of Diello's fierce little face . . .

PAULINE
(Letter V.O.) I have to report that the lower classes are terrifically dull.

REVEREND NORRIS Hello again . . .

Juliet peers up at a DOG-COLLARED VICAR. She eyes him coldly.

REVEREND NORRIS How are you getting along? It must be awfully hard being away from your school chums . . . I've got something here you might just like to have a look at.

He hands Juliet a leaflet featuring a thin, withered figure in a great deal of pain. "JESUS LOVES YOU" is printed across the top.

Juliet's face hardens.

REVEREND NORRIS Unfortunately, modern medicine can only go so far in combatting an illness like TB. And that's why I'm here . . . because with the power of God, miracles can happen. The Lord has said that those who have faith will be saved! Reach out, Juliet! Reach out for Jesus!

During Reverend Norris's speech . . . CAMERA closes in to BIG CLOSE-UP of Juliet's face. Reverend Norris's voice fades away. . .

JULIET
I'm so happy to see you!

HONORA

HONORA 
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.

JULIET
Thank you so much!

Juliet sits back in her chair. She holds Pauline's hand. HONORA 
admires Juliet's knitting-a red cardigan.

HONORA 
That's coming along well!

JULIET

Goodness me! What a lot of letters. Are your parents enjoying their trip? Oh . . . there's a couple of unopened ones, dear.

JULIET
(Sarcastically) I'm saving them for a rainy day.

HONORA 
gives her a sympathetic look.

HONORA 
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.

JULIET
(Bitterly) They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."

HONORA 
looks startled at the outburst.

JULIET
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.

HONORA 
We don't want to tire you out, dear.

JOHN This is quite something . . . you're damn clever.

Pauline beams.

JOHN So . . . Deborah is married to Charles, and this chap Nicholas . . . is her tennis instructor?

PAULINE
Yes, but there's nothing between them. Deborah would never go for a commoner. Nicholas has got his eye on Gina, an amazingly beautiful gypsy.

She gestures to a Plasticine GINA figure that is sitting or the shelf.

JOHN Looks like you, Yvonne.

Pauline beams.

PAULINE
Juliet made it!

John smiles.

JOHN This is really quite incredible. l bet you girls know the entire royal lineage for the last five centuries.

JULIET
How do you know? Did he tell you?

PAULINE
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.

Pauline giggles. Juliet turns away.

JOHN This looks interesting.

Pauline gives him a dubious look from her bed.

John stands shivering, flicking through the annual.

JOHN These knitting patterns look damn complicated. Have you tried the tea cosy?

Pauline shakes her head and looks on as John continues to thumb awkwardly through the book, his shivers increasing.

He glances at Pauline nervously.

JOHN It's damn cold, isn't it? Do you think I could hop into bed for a moment . . . just to warm up? My feet are like iceblocks.

PAULINE

LAURIE Coming to Lancaster Park on Saturday, Mr. Rieper?

HERBERT 
shakes his head, sullenly.

Wendy hurries into the room, grabs a piece of toast, pulling on a coat.

WENDY Where's John? He said he'd walk with me.

HONORA

HONORA 
(Angry) From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.

Pauline bangs a dish into the rack.

HONORA 
(Angry) If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?

HONORA 
sighs.

HONORA 
You think you're such a clever little madam! You had your father in tears last night!

Pauline flinches.

HONORA 
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!

Well, I guess I take after you then!

EXT. BOROVNIA CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY. . . the courtyard. A féte is in progress. The courtyard is full of PLASTICINE PEOPLE, laughing and singing amidst stalls and sideshows.

Pauline pushes her way through the crowd. A Plasticine finger taps her shoulder . . . she spins around and gasps!

PAULINE
Charles!

The PLASTICINE KING smiles.

CHARLES (James Mason voice) Hello, Gina . . . great to see you here!

He turns away. Pauline scans the crowd. She gets a fleeting glimpse of the back of a ROBED WOMAN.

PAULINE
(Calling) Deborah!

Deborah does not hear, and Pauline desperately pushes between Plasticine people to try and reach her.

A blur of Plasticine faces slide past . . .

CRASH CUT TO:

INT. BOARDING HOUSE/JOHN'S BEDROOM

CLOSE-U P . . . John's sweaty face, still grunting furiously.

CRASH CUT TO:

EXT. BOROVNIA CASTLE COURTYARD - DAYPauline finds herself pulled into the arms of a fierce-looking PLASTICINE KNIGHT.

PAULINE
(Breathless) Diello!

DIELLO (Orson Welles voice) Careful, Gina. . . we almost lost you!

Diello suddenly steps back, draws his sword and expertly runs a passing PEASANT through.

He sweeps his hat off and bows at Pauline.

DIELLO (Orson Welles voice) For you, my lady!

Pauline beams. Her eye is again caught by Deborah's Plasticine figure across the crowd . . . her back is still turned.

PAULINE
Deborah!

Deborah slowly turns around . . . she has a human face-Juliet!

Tears of joy trickle down Pauline's cheeks.

Juliet is laughing and smiling, looking beautiful.

Diello gently wipes Pauline's tears.

DIELLO (Orson Welles voice) You're crying, Gina . . . don't be sad.

Another Plasticine arm tugs at Pauline's shoulder . . . she turns and looks straight at the figure of . . .

NICHOLAS!

NICHOLAS (John s voice) Yvonne!

QUICK CUTS . . .

Nicholas's Plasticine face . . .

John's face in the bedroom . . .

CRASH CUT TO:

INT. BOARDING HOUSE/JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHTCLOSE-UP . . . John's face looming over Pauline.

JOHN Yvonne!

Pauline is lying on the bed beneath him. She looks at him with glazed eyes.

She pushes John away and sits up in bed.

JOHN (Worried) I didn't hurt you, did I?

Pauline jumps out of bed and starts to dress.

PAULINE
I've got to go home.

John jumps out of bed and wraps his arms around her.

JOHN I love you so much.

MOVE IN . . . on Pauline's emotionless face.

CUT TO:

INT. SANATORIUM/CORRIDOR - DAYPauline is hurrying down the sanatorium corridor . . . she breaks into a run.

INT. SANATORIUM/JULIET'S ROOM - DAYJuliet is sitting by her bed, fully clothed. Her suitcases are packed and lie on the bed.

Pauline runs into the room. Juliet stands and they embrace hugging each other tightly.

Henry enters the room and frowns at the sight of the girls hugging. Juliet reaches out for Henry and pulls him into the embrace. He looks decidedly ill at ease as Pauline's black hair nuzzles against his neck.

EXT. STREETS - DAYTRACKING BACK . . . as the Hulmes' car drives toward CAMERA.

Pauline's V.O. starts, reading her poem "The Ones That I Worship":

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) There are living among two dutiful daughters.

INT. HULMES' CAR - DAYPauline and Juliet are sitting together in the back seat.

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) Of a man who possesses two beautiful daughters,

Henry adjusts the rearview mirror and catches sight of their clasped hands.

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) You cannot know nor yet try to guess,/The sweet soothingness of their caress,

Henry's steely gaze in the rearview mirror.

The poem continues over a visual montage:

EXT. ILAM DRIVEWAY - DAYThe Hulmes' car pulls up outside Ilam.

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) The outstanding genius of this pair is understood by few,/They are so rare. . .

Hilda emerges out of the house. Juliet gives her a big hug.

JULIET
Mummy!

HILDA Darling! Welcome home!

EXT. STREET - DAYPauline and Juliet sitting in a tram as it crawls along slowly.

John is running alongside, waving and calling, trying to get Pauline's attention. He is clearly pleading with her, but to no avail.

JOHN Yvonne! Stop! I still love you!

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) Compared with these two, every man is a fool,/The world is most honoured that they should deign to rule,/And I worship the power of these lovely two,/ With that adoring love known to so few . . .

Pauline looks knowingly at Juliet, then down to John, hurrying along the street.

MATCH CUT TO:

EXT. BOROVNIA CASTLE GATES - DAYThe Plasticine figure of Nicholas, hurrying down the passage toward the castle gates.

In an alcove beside the gate, the Plasticine figure of Diello is lurking in the shadows, dagger in hand. Beside him is the rope winch that operates the portcullis.

Footsteps approach . . .

Diello presses himself back into the corner . . .

Nicholas walks briskly. As he nears the portcullis, he espies something twinkling on the ground.

LOW ANGLE . . . Nicholas stops, looks down. Directly above him are the jagged teeth of the portcullis.

He reaches down . . . for a silver ring, set with a small pink stone. It is lying on the ground, as if dropped by somebody.

SUDDENLY!

Diello slashes the rope with his dagger. Before Nicholas can react, the portcullis crashes down on him. His Plasticine body is crushed.

Nicholas's twitching fingers release the brooch. It falls to the ground and breaks. The pink stone pops out of its setting, rolls down the path and comes to rest by Pauline's and Juliet's feet.

Juliet picks up the pink stone. She holds it up and it twinkles in the sunlight.

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) 'Tis indeed a miracle, one must feel, That two such heavenly creatures are real,

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ILAM/BATH ROOM - N IGHTCLOSE-UP . . . Pauline's face, staring intently ahead.

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) Hatred burning bright in the brown eyes with enemies for fuel,

CLOSE-UP . . . Juliet's face, staring intently ahead.

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) Icy scorn glitters in the gray eyes, contemptuous and cruel, Why are men such fools they will not realise,

PULL OUT . . . to show Pauline and Juliet lying in opposite ends of a hot, steaming bath, staring at each other.

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) The wisdom that is hidden behind those strange eyes.

INT. ILAM/)ULIET'S BEDROOM - NIGHTPOEM CONTINUES AS . . .

Pauline and Juliet . . . sleeping in each other's arms in bed.

PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) And these wonderful people are you and I.

FAST TRACK IN . . . to the bedroom door.

Henry is silently observing the two sleeping girls, his face stoney.

Sound of a distant thunderclap . . .

CUT TO:

INT. RIEPERS'HOUSE/HALLWAY - NIGHTHenry is standing on the Riepers' doorstep. Lightning flashes light up his face like something out of a gothic horror.

HENRY Mrs. Rieper . . . may I come in?

HONORA 
is standing, holding the door open, looking rather surprised at the unexpected visitor.

HONORA 
(Surprised) Yes, of course.

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/LOUNGE - NIGHTHenry and HONORA 
are sitting in the lounge. Henry looking rather uncomfortable on the edge of a shabby armchair. HERBERT 
is at a drinks cabinet unscrewing the top off a bottle.

HENRY Your daughter's . . . an imaginative and a spirited girl- HONORA 
If she's spending too much time at your house, you only need to say. All those nights she spends over-she's assured us that you don't mind . . .

HENRY It's rather more complicated than that. Since Mrs. Hulme and I have returned home, Juliet has been behaving in a rather disturbed manner . . . surliness, short temper . . . general irritability-most uncharacteristic.

HERBERT 
is pouring a drink.

HERBERT 
Sure I can't tempt you to a nice sherry, Dr. Hulme?

HENRY No, thank you. The thing is . . .

HONORA 
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.

HERBERT 
sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.

HENRY My wife and I feel the friendship is . . . unhealthy.

HERBERT 
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!

HONORA 
frowns at Henry.

HONORA 
(Concerned) I'm not sure what you mean, Dr. Hulme.

Henry pauses for a moment.

HENRY Your daughter appears to have formed a rather . . . unwholesome attachment to Juliet.

HONORA 
(Worried) What's she done???

HENRY She hasn't done anything . . . it's the intensity of the friendship that concerns me. I think we should avert trouble before it starts.

Henry hands a business card to Honora.

HENRY Dr. Bennett is a very good friend. He's a general physician, but has some expertise in child psychology. If Pauline is indeed developing in a rather . . . er . . . wayward fashion, Dr. Bennett is the ideal man to set her back on track.

CUT TO:

INT. DR. BENNETT'S SURGERY - DAYPauline is slouched in a chair, looking very sullen.

DR. BENNETT (O.S.) What about your studies . . . are you enjoying school?

DR. BENNETT is seated behind his desk. Pauline is silent. She looks at the ceiling. HONORA 
is sitting next to Pauline.

DR. BENNETT Are you happy at home? Pauline is silent.

HONORA 
Answer Dr. Bennett, Yvonne.

Pauline remains silent.

HONORA 
(Annoyed) Yvonne!

DR. BENNETT Mrs. Rieper . . . perhaps you wouldn't mind waiting outside.

HONORA 
leaves the room.

DR. BENNETT Do you like your mother?

Pauline hesitates for a moment.

PAULINE
No.

DR. BENNETT And why is that?

PAULINE
She nags me.

DR. BENNETT And that's why you like to stay with the Hulmes?

Pauline looks wary. She doesn't answer.

DR. BENNETT Or is it because you want to be with Juliet?

No answer.

DR. BENNETT Do you . . . like girls?

PAULINE
No.

DR. BENNETT Why not?

PAULINE
They're silly.

DR. BENNETT But Juliet's not silly?

PAULINE
(Emphatic) No!

DR. BENNETT Yvonne . . . there's nothing wrong with having a close friend, but sometimes things can get . . . too friendly. Such associations can lead to trouble. It isn't good to have just one friend . . . my wife and I have several friend and we enjoy seeing them on a regular basis, and it's all perfectly healthy. Perhaps you could think about spending time with . . . boys- Dr. Bennett stops in mid-sentence, a look of surprise face. He looks down at his chest . . .

A red bloodstain is slowly spreading across his shirt. Dr. Bennett twitches slightly as the blade of a sword work its way out of his chest!

Pauline's face lights up as . . .

Diello rises up behind Dr. Bennett.

DIELLO (Orson Welles voice) Bloody fool!

CRASH CUT TO:

INT. DR. BENNETT'S WAITING ROOM - DAYThe surgery door opens and Pauline steps out, looking elated.

HONORA 
looks up from her chair.

Dr. Bennett appears in the doorway behind Pauline. He casts a wary glance in her direction.

DR. BENNETT Mrs. Rieper . . .

HONORA 
bustles in, and Dr. Bennett closes the door. Pauline sits down, folds her arms and stares blankly at a COUPLE OF SICK PATIENTS.

INT. DR. BENNETT'S SURGERY - DAYCLOSE-UP . . . Dr. Bennett's mouth.

DR. BENNETT Homosexuality . . .

HONORA 
looks horrified.

DR. BENNETT I agree, Mrs. Rieper, it's not a pleasant word. But let us not panic unduly. This condition is often a passing phase with girls of Yvonne's age.

HONORA 
But she's always been such a normal, happy child.

DR. BENNETT It can strike at any time, and adolescent are particularly vulnerable.

HONORA 
But what about the vomiting? She's lost a lot of weight . . .

Dr. Bennett shrugs.

DR. BENNETT Physically, I can find nothing wrong. I've checked for TB and she's clear. I can only attribute her weight loss to her mental disorder.

HONORA 
(Shocked) Oh . . .

DR. BENNETT Look, Mrs. Rieper . . . try not to worry too much. Yvonne's young and strong, and she's got a loving family behind her. Chances are she'll grow out of it. If not . . . well, medical science is progressing in leaps and bounds. There could be a breakthrough at any time!

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/HALLWAY - NIGHTSLOW TRACKING . . . down the hallway corridor. As the CAMERA passes doorways, we see the Riepers' family routine . . . HONORA 
in the kitchen. HERBERT 
wanders by and goes through the adjoining door into the lounge. He sits down and opens the paper. Wendy is attempting to t the fire. The family are chatting to each other, but we do not hear their conversation because . . .

. . . we are listening to Pauline's V.O.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Mother woke me this morning and started lecturing me before I was properly awake, which I thought was somewhat unfair. She has brought up the worst possible threat now. She said that if my health did not prove I could never see the Hulmes again. The thought is too dreadful. Life would be unbearable without Deborah . . .

CAMERA CRANES UP . . . through the ceiling and into . . .

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. . . Pauline's bedroom. The room is filled with the sad strains of "E Lucevan le Stelle," an aria from Puccini's Tosca that is booming out from Pauline's portable record player.

CAMERA CRANES UP past the foot of the bed to reveal Pauline lying on her back, looking very morose.

TRACK IN TO her intense face as her V.O. continues . . .

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) l wish I could die. This is not an idle or temporary impulse. I have decided over the last two or three weeks that it would be the best thing that could happen together, and the thought of death is not fearsome.

CUT TO:

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/LOUNGE - CHRISTMAS DAY 1953CLOSE-UP . . . a Christmas present is torn open . . . followed by several more, in quick cuts. Typical 1953 presents.

Honora, Herbert, Wendy and Pauline are sitting on the floor, amidst presents and discarded wrapping paper. Grandma Parker is sitting in a chair.

HERBERT 
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA 
looks at her with concern.

HONORA 
(Concerned) Is it hurting, dear?

Pauline looks blank.

HONORA 
Your leg . . . have you got pain?

Pauline shakes her head. She rips open a present . . . a new diary.

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHTCLOSE-UP of the Jan. 1st page. Pauline's pen starts to write . . .

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) My New Year's resolution is a far more selfish one than last year, so there is more probability of my keeping it. It is to make my motto: "Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you may be dead."

Pauline looks up from her diary as the CAMERA RUSHES IN toward her face.

HONORA

HONORA 
This arrived today, Yvonne . . .

Pauline looks at her mother with distaste.

PAULINE
My name is Gina!

HONORA 
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.

PAULINE
What does old Stew want?

HONORA 
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.

PAULINE
Who cares!

HONORA 
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.

PAULINE
I'm educating myself!

HONORA 
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE
I'm doing my own writing!

HONORA 
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.

HONORA 
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?

PAULINE
(Scornful) What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!

HONORA 
is very angry.

HONORA 
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.

PAULINE
(Shouting) I don't wanna be in bloody school!

HONORA 
(Shouting) All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!

HONORA 
storms out of the room and slams the door.

Hilda and Walter Perry are playing mixed doubles on the court laid out in the Ilam grounds, behind the house.

Juliet s eyes widen at this unexpected confession.

Pauline's V.O. continues over . . .

A conversation between Henry and the two girls. The large lounge at Ilam is dark and cold. The mood is bleak.

INT. ILAM/JULIET'S BEDROOM - NIGHTJuliet is propped up in bed, looking sick and pale. Hilda is sitting by the side of the bed. Henry stands at the foot of the bed, hands behind his back.

HENRY Your mother and I have talked things over and we've made some decisions . . . I am resigning from the university and will be taking up a position back in England.

Juliet looks horrified.

JULIET
(Vehemently) But Daddy, you can't just leave me with Mother!

Hilda looks hurt.

HILDA We thought it best that you accompany your father. . .

JULIET
(Worried) Is Gina coming, too?

HENRY (Annoyed) Of course not!

JULIET
(Angry) I'm not going to England without Gina!

Hilda and Henry exchange an awkward glance.

HILDA You're not going to England, darling.

Juliet looks confused.

HENRY I'm leaving you in South Africa with Auntie Ina.

Juliet starts to tremble.

HILDA That chest of yours isn't getting any better. The warmer climate is just what you need . . .

HENRY For the good of your health.

Juliet opens her mouth and screams.

CRASH CUT TO:

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHTPauline is crouched on her bed, hugging her knees. She stares intensely ahead.

PAULINE
(Intense) The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!

HONORA 
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.

PAULINE
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!

HONORA 
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!

PAULINE
(Intense) You have to let me go!

HONORA 
stands and walks toward the door.

HONORA 
We'll talk about this when you've calmed down.

HONORA 
pauses at the door. Pauline is slowly rocking on the bed, staring at the wall.

CLOSE-UP . . . Pauline's face as we hear her diary V.O.:

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.

HONORA 
Love, you can still write to each other.

HONORA 
softly touches Pauline's cheek. Pauline winces, averting her face.

MOVE IN . . . to EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Pauline's eyes.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Anger against Mother boiled up inside me as it is she who is one of the main obstacle in my path. Suddenly a means of ridding myself of this obstacle occurred to me. If she were to die . . .

CUT TO:

INT. UNIVERSITY HALL - DAYCLOSE-UP . . . a cloth is whipped away revealing a portrait of Henry painted by Rudi Gopez.

Henry is on stage for the unveiling. He shakes hands with PROFESSOR 2. Hilda is sitting amongst various dignitaries on the stage.

PROFESSOR 1 is at the podium.

PROFESSOR 1 I can not begin to attempt to measure the inestimable value of Dr. Hulme's contributions to Canterbury College, both social and official. We wish both him and Mrs. Hulme all the best for the future.

On sound of large audience clapping:

CUT TO:

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/HALLWAY - DAYCLOSE ON . . . black & white newspaper photo of large audience in the hall.

PULL OUT . . . to reveal newspaper story entitled "Canterbury College Bids Farewell to Rector Today."

PULL OUT FURTHER . . . as the CAMERA rises vertically above Pauline. She is slumped on the hall floor, holding the phone to her ear. The newspaper lies open beside her.

JULIET
(O.S.) (Through phone) Everything's going to be okay, Gina. Mr. Perry's promised to give me 50 pounds for my horse . . .

INT. ILAM/HALLWAY - DAYJuliet is in the Ilam hallway, talking into the phone . . . Walter and Hilda are visible in the lounge beyond.

JULIET
(Hushed) That's a hundred and twenty! It's another 30 pounds and we've got the fare!

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/HALLWAY - DAYPauline looks very upset.

PAULINE
(Upset) It's no bloody good . . . I went to the passport office today. They won't give me one till I'm 20.

CUT between Pauline and Juliet . . .

JULIET
But that's not true! I've got one.

PAULINE
(Choked up) I need my sodding parents' consent.

Tears well in Juliet's eyes.

JULIET
(Sobbing) Don't cry, Gina . . . We're not going to be separated. They can't make us . . . they can't!

Hilda quietly looms up behind Juliet. She gently takes the phone out of Juliet's hand and puts it back on the receiver. Juliet struggles in Hilda's arms, pushing her mother away, screaming.

Pauline stands holding the dead phone.

HONORA 
Yvonne.

Pauline turns and faces her mother.

HONORA 
Please don't be like this, love.

Pauline gives HONORA 
a cursory glance and walks past her, up the stairs. HONORA 
looks after her, a hurt expression on her face.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I did not tell Deborah of my plans for removing Mother. I have made no decision yet as the last fate I wish to meet is one in a borstal. I am trying to think of some way.

CUT TO:

EXT. RIEPERS' BACK GARDEN - DAYTHWACK! . . . An ax chops into a log, splitting it in two.

HERBERT 
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA 
approaches him.

HERBERT 
What now?

HONORA 
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .

CUT TO:

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/LOUNGE - DAYHONORA 
and HERBERT 
are sitting with Hilda in the lounge.

HILDA She's uncontrollable. I've told her that Pauline is not going to South Africa, but she refuses to accept it.

HERBERT 
and HONORA 
exchange a glance.

HILDA I expect you've heard the same from your own daughter.

HONORA 
shakes her head.

HONORA 
(Upset) Yvonne hasn't spoken to me for nearly two weeks.

HILDA Yes . . . well, it hasn't been an easy time for any of us, Mrs. Rieper.

HERBERT 
She's cut us out of her life . . . it's been causing her mother and I a lot of worry.

HILDA What I'm suggesting is that we let the girls spend these last three weeks together. We'd like Pauline to come and stay with Juliet, until she leaves.

HERBERT 
Is that a good idea?

HERBERT 
looks at HONORA 
. . . tears are running down her cheeks. He stands and ushers Hilda toward the door.

HERBERT 
Why don't I telephone you tonight, Mrs. Hulme?

HILDA Yes, of course.

HERBERT 
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.

HONORA 
breaks down into heavy sobs.

CUT TO:

INT. ILAM/HALLWAY - DAYThe front door swings open. Pauline is standing on the step, framed by the doorway, suitcase in hand.

SUPER: "11th June 1954"

Mario Lanza's "The Loveliest Night of the Year" begins and continues over the next few scenes.

Pauline walks into the empty hallway . . . SUDDENLY!

Juliet sweeps down the stairs in a rush of sparkling light. She is dressed in her mother's glittering ballgown.

Juliet takes Pauline's hand, and together they sweep into . . .

INT. ILAM/LOUNGE - DAY . . .. . . the LOUNGE.

Pauline's drab clothes transform into a ballgown as she passes through the doorway.

The song soars as they waltz into the middle of the ballroom . . . Pauline spins . . . in a blur she sees decorations and faces all around.

Pauline gasps as Diello takes her by the waist and waltzes around the room. Characters from Borovnia fill the room. Juliet dances with Charles.

A man in a dark suit turns around . . . MARIO! He launches into the second verse!

Pauline laughs happily as she is swept around and around.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) We realised why Deborah and I have such extraordinary telepathy and why people treat us and look at us the way they do. It is because we are MAD. We are both stark raving MAD!

They are no longer in the lounge - at some point the waltz has dissolved into . . .

EXT. BOROVNIA CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT. . . the courtyard in Borovnia Castle.

The crowds continue dancing to "The Loveliest Night of the Year."

A doorway in the courtyard . . . Henry Hulme is lurking in the shadows, peering out. He is dressed like a jester with cap and bells. The CAMERA PUSHES IN . . . to a distorted FISHEYE SHOT of Henry.

Pauline's V.O. continues, building in intensity . . .

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Dr. Hulme is MAD, as MAD as a March hare!

At the conclusion of the song . . . TWO BURLY BOROVNIAN EXECUTIONERS swing their axes down, chopping a couple of ropes. A huge banner unfurls down the side of the castle tower. In embroidered letters three stories tall is the word . . .

MAD!

INT. CINEMA - NIGHTBANG! . . . a gunshot! CLOSE ON . . . Pauline's face flinching at the sound, a flash of light.

BANG! . . . CLOSE ON . . . Juliet flinching.

Black & white image of Orson Welles shooting a pistol from The Third Man.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) It was the first time I had ever seen It. Deborah had always told me how hideous he was!

Pauline and Juliet are sitting in the cinema, absorbed in the film.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) It is appalling. He is dreadful. I have never in my life seen anything in the same category of hideousness . . . but I adore him!

CUT TO:

EXT. CHRISTCHURCH STREETS - NIGHTPauline and Juliet run along dark, damp, atmospheric streets.

Orson Welles steps out of the shadowy alley into the light. He leers at them. The girls scream! They turn to run, but Orson looms out of another alley.

Pauline and Juliet squeal and run about. PASSERSBY observe their antics with some alarm.

INT. ILAM/HALLWAY - NIGHTThe front door bursts open. Pauline and Juliet run in, still in a state of high excitement.

They charge up the stairs.

INT. ILAM/JULIET'S BEDROOM - NIGHTPauline and Juliet tumble into the bedroom, only to find Orson lurking behind the door! They scream and flee along the balcony only to be greeted by Orson at the other end! They run back into the bedroom and collapse onto the bed, screaming and giggling.

PUSH IN . . . to Pauline's exalted face.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) We talked for some time about It, getting ourselves more and more excited.

A huge shadow of a figure, dressed in hat and cape, rises on the bedroom wall behind the girls, threatening to engulf them.

MUSIC SWELLS UP . . .

Pauline comes down on top of Juliet, kissing her on the lips . . . Pauline's hands slipping Juliet's blouse off her shoulders.

Juliet heaves on the bed, Pauline leans over and . . . MORPHS into Orson Welles!

CLOSE-UP . . . Diello swinging from side to side as he hacks a peasant to pieces.

INTERCUT WITH SHOTS of Pauline and Juliet intertwined with Orson and Diello. Pauline and Juliet sometimes change into their Plasticine counterparts, Deborah and Gina.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) We spent a hectic night going through the saints. It was wonderful! Heavenly! Beautiful! And ours! We felt satisfied indeed. We have now learned the peace of the thing called Bliss, the joy of the thing called Sin.

INT. ILAM/BATHROOM - NIGHTBATHWATER

Pauline and Juliet are soaking in opposite ends of a steaming bathtub.

A few moments silence. Juliet looks blankly at Pauline. A tear rolls down her cheek.

PAULINE
I'm coming with you.

JULIET
Yes . . .

PAULINE
I know what to do about mother.

Juliet's eyes narrow.

PAULINE
We don't want to go to too much trouble . . . some sort of accident.

A moment of silence.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Our main idea for the day was to moider mother.

REVERSE ANGLE . . . Pauline and Juliet walk toward the house. Unicorns are grazing in the Ilam garden. Fairies dance in the air. Large dragonflies hover around the girls.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) This notion is not a new one but this time it is a definite plan which we intend to carry out. We have worked it out carefully and are both thrilled by the idea. Naturally we feel a trifle nervous, but the pleasure of anticipation is great.

EXT. ILAM GROUNDS - NIGHTCLOSE-UP . . . James Mason's photo lands in a roaring fire and is immediately consumed by the flames. Photos of Mel Ferrer, Michael Rennie and Orson Welles follow.

Pauline and Juliet are standing by a roaring fire in the Ilam grounds. They throw Mario records onto the flames. The black vinyl curls and melts. Their Plasticine figures are next. Globs of melted Plasticine drip amidst the burning debris.

It is clearly a strange, ritualistic burning. Pauline and Juliet watch the fire, enraptured.

JULIET
Only the best people fight against all obstacles . . .

Juliet squeezes Pauline's hand.

JULIET
. . . in pursuit of happiness.

WIDE SHOT of the fire.

and HERBERT 
sitting in the front of the car. They are driving home.

PAULINE

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE - DAYHONORA 
is bustling about the house, working. Every time she bends down, or leans over, Pauline is revealed behind her. She is helping, but the mood is one of a hunter closing in on its prey.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I rose late and helped Mother vigorously this morning. Deborah rang and we decided to use a rock in a stocking rather than a sandbag. We discussed the moider fully. I feel very keyed up as though I were planning a surprise party. Mother has fallen in with everything beautifully and the happy event is to take place tomorrow afternoon. So next time I write in this diary Mother will be dead. How odd-yet how pleasing.

JULIET
I will . . . I'm so looking forward to it!

JULIET

silently.

HONORA 
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.

HONORA 
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.

HONORA 
picks up the satchel. Pauline and Juliet tense up . . . as HONORA 
puts the satchel on a chair.

PAULINE

Pauline is sitting on her bed looking at the brick.

Juliet stands beside her. She tugs at her collar.

Do you feel sweaty? I feel sweaty.

Pauline opens a draw and pulls out a stocking.

PAULINE
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.

JULIET
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?

PAULINE
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .

JULIET
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!

Pauline puts the brick in the stocking and ties a knot in the foot.

PAULINE
. . . but in the end I decided against it. I thought it would spoil all their fun.

Pauline puts the brick in her shoulder bag.

JULIET
(Bitterly) Affairs are much more exciting than marriages . . . as Mummy can testify!

They both laugh.

WENDY There's nothing wrong with Sir Edmund Hillary buying underwear for his wife. He was a very nice man!

JULIET
I bet it was thermal underwear!

Pauline roars with laughter.

PAULINE
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!

HONORA 
That's enough, Yvonne!

Juliet roars with laughter. The others don't laugh.

HERBERT 
That man's a credit to the nation.

A SERIES OF CARDS explains what happened subsequently:

In the hours following Honora's murder, a police search of the Rieper house unearthed Pauline's dairies. This resulted in her immediate arrest for the murder her mother.

Juliet was arrested and charged with murder the following day.

After Pauline's arrest it was discovered that Honor, HERBERT 
Rieper had never married. Pauline was therefore charged under her mother's maiden name of Parker.

In August 1954, a plea of insanity was rejected by the jury in the Christchurch Supreme Court trial and Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme were found guilty of murder.

Too young for the death penalty, they were sent to separate prisons to be 'Detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure.'

Juliet was released in November 1959 and immediately left New Zealand to join her mother overseas.

Pauline was released two weeks later, but remain New Zealand on parole until 1965.

It was a condition of their release that they never again.

Writing and Directing Heavenly Creatures

A Talk with Frances Walsh and Peter Jackson

Peter Jackson and Frances Walsh were both born and raised in Wellington, New Zealand. Jackson's first film, Bad Taste 1988), was made by the director over a period of several years while he was working as a photo apprentice at a local newspaper. Jackson's two following films, Meet the Feebles (1990) and Braindead (1992), were co-written with Walsh and Stephen Sinclair; the latter was a hit on the film festival circuit, winning 16 international prizes including a best picture award from the

Academy of Fantasy, Science Fiction and Horror.

Jackson and Walsh (who had previously written for episodic television in New Zealand) co-authored the screenplay for Heavenly Creatures, which went on to garner nominations for both an Academy Award and a Writers Guild Award. Their latest collaboration is The Frighteners, executive-produced

by Robert Zemeckis and starring Michael J. Fox; it will be released in 1996. Jackson and Walsh live in Wellington with their son, Billy.

The version of Heavenly Creatures published here is a final draft, completed in March 1993. The screenplay was 107 pages long.

Fran, my understanding is that you were the first to become interested in the Parker/Hulme murder case as a film subject. It seems to be a popular topic in New Zealand.

Frances Walsh: Well, popular topic-I'm not sure about that. But it's certainly a piece of New Zealand criminal history that has entered into the realm of myth. And as a young girl growing up, I knew about it, and had read lurid newspaper accounts- "Lesbian killers' rampage"?

FW: Yes, yes. And I also got my hands on a novel called Obsession, which I read when I was about 14. I thought at the time that it was extremely good. [laughs] It takes a very damning view of the girls-it's written by two English journalists who came out here to cover the trial. It was something of a hack job that set out to sensationalize the case.

And there was also a play, wasn't there?

FW: Yeah, there's been a play, and there have been nonfiction books written about it. There's also been a great deal of coverage over the years in newspapers and magazines, so it's always had a profile here.

Since it had already been treated in all of these different ways, what compelled you both to explore the subject again?

Peter Jackson: Well, we didn't really think it had been treated that well. Nothing that we had read did we particularly like. And also, the other various treatments all seemed to have a specific agenda, which attempted to make political statements about the murder. What interested us was to show these two 15-year-old girls with no other agenda than to be as accurate as we possibly could, and to somehow imagine what was going on inside their minds.

I know that all of Pauline's voiceovers from the film are from actual diary entries. You made an interesting comment awhile back about how they actually informed the structure of the film. Could you elaborate on that?

PJ: Well, the structure was fairly apparent once we started to do research. It wasn't just the diaries themselves, it was the general research. We read as much of the diaries as we could-we haven't actually ever seen the full, unedited diary-but we gathered as many of the excerpts that were releasedat the time of the trial as we could, which amounted to quite a few pages. And we read the newspapers, and interviewed people, and then the three acts sort of materialized quite neatly. You know, act one is when the two girls meet and become friends, and the turning point is at the end of the first act when you realize that they are now bonded.

FW: It's when they have their first delusional experience together at Port Levy, where they go into the Fourth World. You know these two girls have an imagination that's going to lead to something interesting happening. The second turning point comes with the decision to murder Mother, which tips

the story into the third act.

Whom did you interview to cull together all of this information?

PJ: Well, we went through about 35 or 40 people. We wanted to interview as many people as we could find. Several refused. We talk to about 15 or 16 of their classmates, which was experience. These were 55-year-old women spread out around the country, and they all had changed their names because they'd gotten married. It was quite a detective job to find them.

I read somewhere that the school was not particularly enthusiastic about this; did they help you locate the ex-students?

PJ: No, the school didn't want anything to do with it. Christchurch Girls' School had erased these two girls from their history. The yearbook that had the class photograph with Pauline is no longer available. If you go to the school library, they have all the yearbooks available apart from 1953's, which has her photo in it. It sort of cleansing of the books. The school didn't recognize what it was we were trying to do, which was to redress the issue. Why wipe these girls off the school records? I mean, they were human beings.

FW: Peter and Jim Booth, the producer of the movie, went to see the headmistress of the school, and after they explained what we wanted to do, and allowed her to read the script, her only comment was, "Why can't you make a film about pupils of whom we are proud?"

PJ: We also heard from several sources we interviewed that on the day after the murder happened, the headmistress at the time stood up in front of the assembly and said, "No girl is to discuss a certain matter." This was, like, the day after two of their pupils had murdered somebody, and they couldn't even refer to it directly. Forty years later, we got the sense that the school was exactly the same. And that really gave us all the more reason to make the movie, because we felt that these people were still

living in the 1950s. We found that with a lot of the people we interviewed-that even though 40 years had gone by, they were still presenting attitudes of the '50s: this was some dark, sordid little thingthat was best kept quiet and should never be mentioned. Many times we got, "Why on earth would you want to make a film about this?" We should just forget about it, and hope it will somehow disappear."

And we actually thought about doing that. But within 20 or 30 years most of the people connected with it will be dead, and at that point in time we'll never know anything about it. We felt it was a good time now, while there were still quite a few people alive, to do the interviews and try to get something accurate, for the record. We were also aware of the responsibility we had, because film is such a persuasive medium, and we knew that, unlike any other medium-the newspaper accounts, the play-itcan give an audience visual images, which, in a way, almost replace the real event, especially if you weren't born at that time. So we thought if we made a film now, perhaps people in New Zealand would look upon this case in a different way. That was a responsibility we felt that we didn't want to take lightly.

Pertaining to that quest for accuracy, how does one go about reconstructing, for instance, conversations between Pauline and her mother, or other scenes for which there is no direct documentation?

FW: Well, all you can do is attempt to find out as much as you can about the people involve-the type of people they were, their class background, etc. So to that degree, we spoke to people who knew the Riepers, for example, who had good knowledge of the girls.

Did you interview any of the boarders in the Rieper house?

PJ: Yeah, I did, very briefly. We found one of the boarders, who spoke to me on the telephone. I did the interview, and then the following day I called him back to ask him some more questions and he clammed up; he didn't want to talk to me anymore. He'd obviously gone home to his wife, and she'd

wound him up about the whole thing and told him he shouldn't be involved with it.

FW: I think our understanding when we set out to write this was that we would never be able to re-create the right interiors, with characters who precisely reflect the people who were really there. Our intention was to be true to what we understood of the girls' friendship, and the nature of that

friendship and the nature of those families from which those two girls came. It was never an attempt to re-create reality. We could never do that, obviously. So we went into those things with the spirit of trying to reflect the situation, rather than reality.

PJ: The Hulme family were a lot easier to research than Pauline's family, because the Hulmes were public figures at the time. Henry Hulme being the rector of the local university, there were obviously a lot of university people we could talk to professors, students-who worked with him. Hilda Hulme was also quite a public figure. They were, in some respects, the royalty of Christchurch, because the English class system was and still does exist down there, and they all take these things quite seriously.There used to be garden and tennis parties at Ilam, and there were a lot of people who had social contact with the parents and Juliet at the time.

The research actually carried on through the shooting of the film. I remember when we were in England, auditioning actresses for the part of Juliet before we found Kate Winslet, and we found out that [the late] Anthony Quayle, the English actor, had actually visited the Hulmes in Christchurch in the '50s, so we tracked down his wife and spoke with her. The research just kept on going all the time. We had trips to Christchurch to do our research, but once we started working on the film, we moved there

for nearly five months, so it was an ideal opportunity to find others. We'd hear things about this person who had sat next to Pauline in typing class, and we'd rush around to see them.

I'm sure the production got a certain amount of notice in the local media, so people probably approached you.

PJ: To an extent, but not as much as what we had hoped. Pauline's people were actually quite difficult to research, because they just weren't public; they were quite private people.

FW: We have heard, subsequently, that Pauline's sister, Wendy, has seen the film. She still lives in Christchurch. Her con meets were that the film managed to capture the atmosphere of her home at that time, but her criticism was that the family was "better" than that, we had portrayed them in too shabby a light. And that really touched me.

PJ: She thought that the portrayal of the tension between Pauline and her mother was very accurate. It was nice, because Wendy is one of the few key people alive who refuses to talk about it. She absolutely refuses to have anything to do with journalists, with anyone, so it was actually very sweet of her to get the message back to us. It was quite amazing to us that she had even gone to see this film. She thought it was good, but incredibly difficult to watch.

In gathering all of this material, I'm sure there were certain things that didn't "fit" dramatically. Was there anything you were tempted to use but didn't, because it was either too sensationalistic or too ethically questionable?

PJ: There was one area we deliberately steered clear of that we felt ultimately didn't have a relation to what we were wanting to tell, and that was that in the Rieper household there was actually a younger sister, named Rosemary, who had Down's syndrome, who is still alive; Wendy still looks after her. At the time of the murder, Rosemary was only 8 years old. This made Honora's life all the more difficult: the daughter lived in a special home, and would come home on the weekends. Pauline writes about Rosemary a lot in her diaries; she was very fond of her. But it was one area where we felt that we were being too invasive into the privacy of this family.

As you say, there was quite a bit of stuff we had to leave out for structural reasons. Pauline's diaries are very, very funny. We ended up using a lot of the more dramatic material in the movie, in the scenes in which she's talking about murder and suicide, but unfortunately we had to leave a lot of the funny things out. She records hilarious conversations that she and Juliet had, and it's all very witty.

Sometimes we used diary entries and just dramatized them, as opposed to using a voiceover. Like the sequence where they go into the Fourth World, where the hilltop changes into a magical landscape. That is described in detail in the diary. So it was a case of having to be very selective, and at the end of the day, it was the more dramatic selections that made it through to the movie rather than the funnier stuff.

The girls ' sense of humor does manage to come through in the film, though. I'm thinking, for instance, of the last scene in the Rieper house, when the family is having lunch with Juliet before the two girls and HONORA 
go to Victoria Park. Were their snide comments about Sir Edmund Hillary in the diary, or were they invented by the two of you?

FW: That was out of our imagination. We were told that they were extremely jolly at that last meal-it was actually in the court records-and that they were cracking jokes, and saying silly, outrageous things, on a sort of giggly high. And we knew that Wendy had worked at Farmer's, the localdepartment store, and also what had been very big in the news that year was Sir Edmund Hillary, a New Zealander, climbing Mt. Everest. He had been knighted, and became a huge national hero; he still is. Because he'd also spent time in Christchurch, we felt that this was an appropriate thing for

them to send up, because whatever they did, they were terribly irreverent. If the Queen was visiting, for example, they wouldn't bother to go out unless it was to take note of the decorations, the pomp and ceremony, to enrich one of their own royal celebrations. They really had no respect for the icons of the day; their interior world was much more important to them.

The film critic for Time, Richard Corliss, likened you to a "physician who assumes a patients fever in order to understand her illness." At what point did you two decide that this was going to have to be presented from the girls' point of view?

PJ: I think from the beginning. That was one of the motivations for doing it. None of the accounts we came across were from the girls' point of view. Like we'd said before, they all had other agendas, so we felt that telling the girls' story was important. It did take us a long time to be able to do that, because it took us a long time to learn who they were, and what was driving them. We were a bit confused-there was a bit of mystery at the beginning-but the more we read, the more we talked to people, we gradually began to formulate who these people were. Ultimately, there was a lot of Pauline that I could recognize in myself, which was very useful.

You, too, Fran?

FW: I felt that the diary: offered the first insight into the friendship, and into Pauline in particular. It was an extremely interesting account of her life, documenting both dramatic and mundane events with a great deal of literary flair. She was a very imaginative, funny and clever young woman who had some quite pretentious ideas, as teenagers do, and I warmed toward her immediately. Reading the diary made me wonder about the huge discrepancies between this young woman and the monster who was portrayed in the newspaper accounts and everything else. And I thought it would be great to take that journey to find out who she was. Because no diary of Juliet's survived-we have heard from people that she did keep a diary, but it was destroyed-I thought it would be harder to get to know her, but that really wasn't the case, because she appeared to be someone who more readily shared her life with people; she was much more of a social creature than Pauline. So it was a combination of the private world that they shared and the understanding that we got from talking to their school friends, inparticular, that gave us insight into the nature of these two girls and the way they appeared to the rest of the world.

I think it's fair to say that both Peter and I felt hugely sympathetic toward Pauline and Juliet, and we did start to identify and empathize with them, all the while trying to keep in balance the knowledge of this terrible act. It was that dynamic, of really liking them, but feeling abhorrence at what they'd done, that kept the thing alive for so long in our minds, and gave the film inner life.

Peter, your camera work, in all of the films you've directed, is extremely dynamic. In 'Heavenly Creatures,' the almost hyperactive camera seems to have an organic relationship to the girls' euphoric state. I've noticed in this script that a lot of these camera directions are written in, with more detail than most other screenplays I've read. Do all of your scripts read like this?

PJ: In this particular screenplay, camera movement came quite readily during the writing stages. At the end of the day, the script is not the document we want to go out and sell; it's the document that the cast and crew have to read. When we write a script intended for me to direct, it's right from the beginning a shooting script; a document for technicians to use. You know, the grips put a circle around the word "DOLLY" so they remember on that particular day of shooting they're going to have to have it on the truck. With this movie, probably more than any other I've done, the camera moves were integral to the scriptwriting. I'll tell you where that came from: the music. We read very early in our research that Pauline and Juliet were both obsessed with Mario Lanza. Neither of us were familiar with his music, so we went out and got some of his records, and before we started writing we played through them and came across several songs that we really liked. One of the very first ones we heard was "The Donkey

Serenade"- FW: Well, we knew that was important to them because Pauline had named one of her novels "The Donkey Serenade."

PJ: When we heard it, just the life and vitality in the song immediately indicated Steadicam. [laughs] It immediately told you you had to have a moving camera. We chose all the songs that were in the movie, and, in the case of "The Donkey Serenade," wrote scenes around them. I found it a great visual tool. It's never happened before in anything I've done-I mean, I've never had the music in advance. We had these songs playing while we were working to get ourselves psyched up to write a scene. At the same time, the music helped me visualize, so that visualization ended up going down on the page. Of course, once you actually arrive on the set, and you have the actors and the camera people there, things can change. I don't regard anything that's written into a script in terms of a camera direction asbeing locked in stone.

How long did it take the two of you to finish a first draft?

PJ: Not really long. I think the first draft was written in probably 10 or 12 weeks. But we didn't start to write until we'd uncovered several months' worth of research.

And the draft we're publishing is the shooting script?

PJ: Yeah. I think that's about draft number five. We did an interesting thing. We did a certain amount of research first, while we were still working on Braindead [Dead Alive in U.S.], and then we wrote the first

draft from the position where we felt we knew some of the facts, but there were a lot of gaps. We thought if we wrote a draft we would know where the holes were, and we would know what we had to pursue in terms of research. For instance, Fran and I had never been down to Christchurch when we wrote this first draft, and Christchurch is such an integral part of the story. Then we made the trip down there before the second draft and were able to modify a lot of things, interview lot more people. We actually did that on purpose, because we wanted to nail the story before overlaying it with a lot of historical detail.

How do the two of you handle writing collaboratively?

PJ: Well, it depends. You know, if Fran's working on some re-writes while we're shooting, and I'm on the set, she'll show me some work that she's done when I come home and we'll revise it together, but generally, when we're actually writing the initial drafts of the script, it's always together.

I think that we both have a good understanding of structure, which helps, and I'm obviously very visually oriented, and Fran is very good on dialogue and character, so we complement each other quite well. I think the best advantage that we have in writing scripts together is that we write a script that I go and make, which is, I think, a wonderful thing. It would be a strange experience for us to write a script that someone else was going to make, because we've never actually experienced that loss of control that so many other writers have. So right from the very beginning, it's a movie. It's not a piece of writing that's going to go out to the marketplace and may or may not sell.

Just one little thing. Even though Heavenly Creatures was very much written by the two of us, my favorite scene in the movie was written by Fran by herself.

Which one is that?

PJ: Well, it was late one night, and we were hoping to finish the first draft of the script-it was, like, ten o'clock already-and we had arrived at the sequence in the tearooms where they're having their last cup of tea before they walk down the track. We sat there wondering how on earth we were going to write this scene. We knew they'd actually gone there to have tea because we'd spoken to this very elderly woman who had served them. She said they were talking quite calmly to one another. But what dialogue do you put in their mouths at this particular moment, when this woman's about to be murdered? Well, the phone rang, and I got up to answer it and ended up stuck on this call for about 45 minutes, and I came back and Fran had written something. She asked me to check it out, and it was never revised: it's where she slides the plate with the last cake over to Honora, and says, "Go on, Mother, treat yourself." It was perfect.

I know you found Kate Winslet at an audition in England. How did you come across Melanie Lynskey, who played Pauline? I understand she was not a professional actress.

PJ: Well, it's one of those stories that sounds like it's not true. We wanted to cast someone in New Zealand, and we'd auditioned a lot of people-five or six hundred-who were either videotaped or photographed. I wanted to find someone who was young, around 1S or 16 years old; I didn't want a 23-year-old in a school uniform. And we wanted someone who was physically very much like the original Pauline; I have a thing about being as accurate as possible. So we quickly exhausted the professional actors in New Zealand who happened to look like Pauline-there's only about one or two. [laughs] We knew we were looking for someone with no experience, but we just had to find them. We kept saying, "Somewhere in New Zealand there's somebody who's perfect for this role."We were actually about four weeks away from beginning shooting, and we had one or two people on the short list, neither of whom we were happy with, but we were coming under enormous pressure to cast one of them, because, you know, the wardrobe department needed to make costumes, and so

on, and Fran said to me, "You're not really happy with the choices, are you?" And I said, "No." And she said, "This is crazy; we've spent all this time and energy on this film and we haven't found Pauline. This is something close to a major tragedy." I was in Christchurch, so Fran decided to drive with a casting person around the lower half of the North Island of New Zealand-she was prepared to drive as far as she had to. They'd visit every small town, go to the local school, visit the principal's office and show a photo of Pauline Parker. She'd say, "We're making a movie about Pauline Parker; do you have any pupils in your school who resemble her who might be interested in this?"

FW: We were in a rusting Ford Cortina, and we had no official I.D. We'd roll up to these provincial schools, and we'd be greeted by some curious teacher. Although no one ever once questioned our authenticity, we would always get asked about the car: "If you're in films, why aren't you driving

a Porsche?" [both laugh] So then I would pitch the story to the entire classroom, scanning the room the whole time, looking for sullen, brooding school girls, all the while thinking, "What would she look like with her hair dyed black?"

PJ: I guess that went on for about a week. Every night I'd get a call from Fran. Anyone that was vaguely appropriate was videotaped, and I got a couple of tapes in Christchurch, and it was a bit depressing. Finally, Fran called from a small town called New Plymouth, and said, "I think I've found someone very interesting. ' And this was Mel. We flew her down to Christchurch and gave her an audition and a screen test, and we cast her two weeks before the film started shooting. I called her mother up on a Friday night and said, "I'd really like Melanie to do the film." And she said, "When does she have to start?" And I said, "Well, she's got to come down here on Sunday." The poor girl didn't even get a chance to go back to school to clean out her locker.

Do you think there was any correspondence between the two actresses and their backgrounds and those of the characters they were playing?

PJ: One of the things that we knew about Pauline was that she was incredibly witty and intelligent, and Melanie was very similar-she was the top student in her province in many subjects. And we knew if we cast an intelligent person, then they were going to hit it. Melanie's also very enigmatic. The character of Pauline doesn't have an enormous amount of dialogue. In a sense, the real Pauline Parker speaks for her, through the diaries. So what we were looking for was an actress who has that kind of aspect to her that's a real movie-star thing: where you can film somebody sitting in a room, doing nothing, and they're still fascinating to watch. We found that in Mel.

I've read that you used actual locations for some of this.

PJ: As much as we could. The only location we couldn't use was Pauline's house, which had been torn down. Fortunately, the school is now a community center; the actual school moved to a different location, so they no longer had control over the buildings; otherwise we'd have definitely been refused

permission. The school buildings are now owned by the Christchurch City Council, which has done nothing to them; they're as they were 40 years ago. They just rent out the various rooms to community groups. We found out what classroom Pauline and Juliet actually were in, and it was the Canterbury

Women's Embroidery Guild-it sounds like something out of Monty Python-and we went into the room and right down one length of the wall was this huge tapestry that had been stretched out on this massive frame. I thought they would never want to take it down, but we managed to get them to do it. So that was the actual classroom where they were, down to the seating.The Ilam house, where Juliet lived, is still there. It's owned by the university, and they were very happy for us to use it. As for the doctor's surgery, where Pauline is interviewed by the doctor, we found out the address, and-you know, this is 40 years later, so you have no idea what to expect-it was just, like, a suburban house. We thought that was strange, in that it didn't seem like a doctor's office. Anyway, we knocked on the door, and the woman who answered happened to be the doctor's daughter-the doctor's long since dead-and we asked her where her father's office had been, and she said, "Oh, he had rooms out the back of the house here; we've never really touched them." We went into this doctor's surgery which was almost exactly the same as it had been 40 years before. So we ended up filming those sequences in the actual room where Pauline was interviewed by the doctor.We also spoke to the woman who was working at the tearooms at Victoria Park and found out exactly where they sitting, and filmed that scene there. Actually, about two months later, that building was demolished.

And what about the murder scene?

PJ: Well, we went to the murder site, and we just felt uncomfortable about filming there. It was very strange, and maybe it was just our imagination, but it was very quiet, very tranquil. I mean, all the way down the path you hear the wind and the birds, and suddenly, when you arrive at the spot, you hear nothing. So we filmed the murder scene at Victoria Park, but it was on a different track, about a hundred yards away.

There is one sequence of scenes in this script which didn't appear in the film. it begins with the tennis party at Ilam, in which Pauline and Juliet are watching from behind some shrubbery as Walter Perry and Hilda Hulme play tennis.

PJ: Well, that sequence was actually shot, and exists in the version of the film that was screened here in New Zealand. When Miramax released the film in the U.S., they had screenings and felt that the film was too long. We had final control over the film, but they pleaded with us to take out about 10 minutes' worth of footage, convinced that it would be tighter. We looked at it, and we actually, ultimately, agreed with them in a funny sort of way. That sequence slows the momentum down. It's quite a fun one to

read-and it's fun in the film as well-but it does slow things down at a point where we didn't think things should be slowing down. Although we've had control over the film's release all over the world, we've requested that the sequence be cut out of the versions screened in every other country. When you're writing a script, a part of you thinks, "Oh, this is perfect, we mustn't change a word of it," but once it's finished it takes a life of its own. We felt that the sequence wasn't telling us anything wedidn't already know about the characters, and at a time where the tension in Pauline's house was really growing, going over to Juliet's house to watch a tennis game was not necessary.

FW: I think when we wrote the script we felt it was very much Pauline and Juliet's story. After the edit, however, it became very evident to us that it was Pauline's story which was the through line and the audience's focal point. Whenever we veered too much into telling the Hulme story and Pauline wasn't on the screen, the pace started to flag. That was something we had to look at after the first assembly-we had to trim and cut Hulme scenes because they weren't as fundamentally interesting as the Rieper scenes.

Although this film is very different from Braindead, both take place in the New Zealand of the 1950s. I'm not that familiar with your country, but from watching these two films I would have to assume that it was, at least in that period, a fairly repressive kind of society, acting almost as a breeding ground for transgression, for explosive kinds of behavior.

PJ: Well, the script for Braindead was set in the modern day up until the very last minute. I was worried going into the movie that the hero of the film, named Lionel, acted in a fairly nerdy kind of way-he doesn't socialize, he takes care of his mother-and yet we wanted him to be the empathetic character in the film. I was afraid that if it was set in the modern day, the audience-especially a young audience-would really jeer at this character, and not be able to relate to him at all. If we set it inthe '50s, people might actually feel more sympathy for him, because they would think, "Well, that sort of thing happened then." With Heavenly Creatures, it was really just a coincidence that the actual event had taken place then.

FW: But that repression is still very much in evidence here: we're I not expressive, we're not demonstrative, we're scared of showing, saying too much. When you go to New York, for instance, and people are yelling and the horns are blaring-if that happened here, someone would get out of theircar, rip open your door and bash you up. There's a level of violence, a subtext of violence, running through New Zealand society that comes out in our movies. We have a veneer of being easygoing, but underneath, we're full of rage. It's an interesting social dynamic. and it makes for interesting art, but it's not so pleasant to actually live in it. It's very much to do with a link with England- PJ: Christchurch in particular.

FW: Christchurch suffers from it more than any other city in New Zealand. It's always been described as "a little piece England"; it's considered to be more English than England. It's always aspired to be that, and it still is in some ways.

PJ: The thing with this murder, too, is that the sense you when you talk to the older generation in Christchurch is that it was an embarrassment to the city, that it was somehow shameful and somehow humiliating. Which is ridiculous, because the story is ultimately a family tragedy.

FW: It's been said that Christchurch was more appalled by revelation that Pauline's parents were not married than by the murder itself. And some uncharitable souls even suggested that one sinful act led on to the other.

Speaking generally about your films, you both seem to have a certain love of campiness, which is apparent in the use of caricatures for many characters, as well as in an overall sort of extremism reminiscent of the work of someone like John Waters here in the U.S. What's interesting about Heavenly Creatures is that while it remains a fundamentally "realistic" docudrama, some of the figures of authority, like the doctor, the vicar and the headmistress, are hilariously overplayed.

PJ: Well, I like movies to be entertaining, to be a little larger than life. With something like Braindead, obviously there's no problem doing that. But with 'Heavenly Creatures,' we were telling what we hoped would be a fairly accurate story. At the same time, however, I still wanted to make a movie; I didn't want something totally tied to real life, and totally dull. So we did have a little bit of fun with some of those characters. I guess if you were trying to justify it you could say we were presenting them from the girls' point of view, but that's not strictly true. I just think that there were really only two people who we needed to be realistic with, and they were Juliet and Pauline, both of whom were slightly larger than life anyway. That's something that came across in the interviews with their classmates. They were remembered as being sort of terrifying: Juliet was so confident and loud, and Pauline was brooding and dark. So, in a sense, the film was a perfect one for us. I don't Like doing stuff that's totally naturalistic. I just like having a little bit of fun.

The fantasy sequences are written pretty much as they appeared on film. Were you aware of how, technically, you were going to handle these special effects as you were writing?

PJ: Pretty much. We hadn't used any optical or digital effects in Braindead, and with Heavenly Creatures, I knew that if I actually wrote digital effects into the script, then it was a great excuse to go out and get this new equipment-I have my own special effects company. So right at the beginning we wrote stuff that could only be done with morphing. We got one computer and hired someone to figure out how it all worked.

What about your use of the Plasticine figures? Was that something you'd heard the girls were interested in?

PJ: Yeah, we interviewed several people who remembered that they used to model figures in Plasticine, and I think HERBERT 
Rieper refers to it in his court testimony. We also interviewed an old guy who had been round to the Hulme's place and had seen Juliet's Plasticine horses on the mantelpiece.

And, of course, there are endless passages in the diaries about Borovnia, and Diello, the murderous prince and all of that. When we thought it would be fun right at the beginning to go into some of these fantasy sequences, the last thing I wanted to do was dress up actors in medieval costumes and

crowns and have them looking like something out of a school play. So we decided it would be really fun to tie the Plasticine figures and Borovnia together. And we knew they'd sculpted figures like Diello, so we just thought, why not have those figures come to life, as it were.

What about the linking of certain actors to certain figures, like Orson Welles to Diello?

PJ: Well, that was something that we devised ourselves. But again, that springs from the fact that the girls used to give pet names to people. Like one of the boarders in the diary, for instance, is referred to as John for a while, and then his name changed to Nicholas.

That's referred to in the scene in Pauline's sleepout.

PJ: Yeah, and for some reason, Pauline refers to him as Nicholas in the rest of her diary. That happened with a lot of people. They were clearly using real, live people as prototypes for some of their fantasy characters. We figured that Diello had a lot of qualities that they seemed to fear in Orson Welles. He seemed to represent some sort of dark, sexual force, so we figured that giving his features to the figure of Diello was appropriate.

Could you talk about the fact that, during production, Anne Perry, the mystery writer, was "outed " as being Juliet Hulme?

FW: Well, where do you start? We knew that would be a possible outcome of making this film-that someone might try and track down either Pauline or Juliet. Which was a very good reason not to make the movie. We had more compelling reasons to make the film, however, because if we didn't, anotherone was going to get made anyway. There were, at the time the film was being funded, five competing projects in various states of preparation.

Didn't Dustin Hoffman have something in the works?

FW: His company, Punch Productions, I believe, had a script written by an American writer; Peter had, in fact, been very tentatively approached to read it, that was how we found out about it. At that point we were about a week away from starting to shoot. And then someone was trying to do a film version of the play we've already spoken of, and other people were developing a very politicized lesbian version of the story. Then there'd been a screenplay written by the late English novelist, Angela Carter, that was with a production company in Auckland, and there was someone in Australia developing a screenplay. So we knew that this story was going to come to the screen, soon-there was no doubt someone was going to make it. And we felt that, in that climate, we would proceed, despite the possibility that these women might be exposed.We knew that in Pauline's case it was less likely. We'd heard a lot of rumor and gossip about Juliet, but we'd heard nothing about Pauline, and I think she has very carefully hidden her identity. Juliet went to no such trouble: she took her stepfather's name-Hilda Hulme ended up marrying Walter Perry-as a novelist, and proceeded to write a series of crime novels. You can look up any contemporary author index in any library, and there is Anne Perry, and her birthdate is the same as Juliet Hulme's, her mother's maiden name is the same, etc. There is a gap in her personal history, where she leaves out New Zealand, but it picks up again after she left the country. So it didn't take a huge amount of detective work from the journalist here in New Zealand who had heard that Anne Perry and JulietHulme were one and the same.

That rumor sprang from a production of the play that had gone on here a year before we started shooting, where a friend of Juliet's, who was still writing to her, confided in one of the actors that Juliet Hulme was now writing murder mysteries as Anne Perry. That rumor hew around the acting community here in New Zealand, and it reached our ears on the set, and it was something that we wanted to entirely disassociate ourselves from, because we knew it would damage the film, and we knew it would damage us. It was inevitable that we would be accused of exploiting this woman's situation in order to promote the movie. When this journalist rang Peter and asked what comment he had about the story, he just begged her not to print it. Of course that was a hopeless situation, because she was a tabloid hack who was going to go ahead and make her name, and she has dined off it ever since. We felt an enormous amount of dread, because the movie hadn't had a chance to stand on its own before this was made known, and it's now been inextricably linked with this revelation. So we've been battling that ever since. But given that it's happened, we've had to deal with it, as she has.

PJ: I mean, we were absolutely disgusted by some of the ads Miramax ran. On the day that this was released in America, I rang Miramax and said, "For heaven's sake, don't associate this film with any of this because we don't approve of this publicity." And a couple of months later, lo and behold, we

get sent by a friend in the States clippings with these ads saying, "Murder, She Wrote," and these other references to Anne Perry that Miramax had been running, and we were just very, very angry.

Did you fever consider using the coordinates of the actual event, but changing enough of the particulars to push it into the fictional realm?

PJ: No, because the case is so well-known in New Zealand; it would be like-

FW: Fictionalizing the O.J. Simpson case.

PJ: It's unnecessary. I mean, sure, if it was just a movie for international consumption, then, yeah. But the fact is that we weren't actually making this film for an international audience. We were very much

making it to try and rectify 40 years of misunderstanding about this case within New Zealand. In a way that was our main motivation for making the film, and in doing that, we obviously had to use their real names. But having said that, "Pauline Parker" and "Juliet Hulme" ceased to exist as people in 1959, because they both took different names. In a sense, I don't think there was any moral problem with using those names, because they themselves stopped using them some 30-odd years ago.

Were there any other films you looked at as inspiration before writing this?

FW: Well, we looked at movies like Let Him Have It, which was based on the Craig/Bentley murder case in England [Bentley was an 18-year-old with a low I.Q. who was hanged for murder]. Although I think that film has quite a lot of merit, in the end it comes across as a grim, dark, true-life murder

story, and similarly Dance with a Stranger, which was about Ruth Ellis [the last woman to be hanged in England]. We felt that if there was one thing we didn't want to do, it was to make a depressing murder film. We really wanted to tell a tale of a friendship, rather than a murder story. Sure, the movie ends with a murder, but for the most part, it celebrates friendship.

PJ: We wanted to make it a lot funnier than those films. And people have said, "It's such a serious subject; why did you try to make it funny?" Well, obviously the murder wasn't funny, and we never attempted to make it funny, but the friendship was funny. Life is funny: generally, human beings

like to enjoy themselves, and there was no doubt that Pauline and Juliet had a hell of a good time, most of the time.

FW: But the other reason why it was important that we tell this as a true story is that it has a kind of universal truth for anybody growing up. When you're at that age, you become very focused on things in an extreme way. And I don't think Pauline and Juliet are so very different from anybody else; I think several things went wrong in their lives-Juliet's parents broke up, and Pauline became very alienated from her family (she was an obsessional manic-depressive character)-and I think it was this terriblecombination of things that led to this extraordinarily horrible act. But it's not something that can be precluded from anybody's experience in growing up. Adolescence is such a crazy time.

PJ: A lot of women have come up to us and said, "I was Pauline. That was me. That was my childhood." I don't think it's that unusual. I think what is unusual about the whole thing is that these aspects of Pauline's character led to the murder, and I don't think the sort of person she was was particularly unusual or freakish or weird. When we hear things like that, it's the best possible endorsement we could get.

THE HEAVY METAL MOVIE 

- Final Draft -







								SCREENPLAY BY

								Dan Goldberg

								and

								Len Blum






								July 18, 1980


 
FADE UP ON 
A WHEATFIELD 
A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun.
As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll.  Ahead
of us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering
along a dirt road.  Getting closer, we can see the driver, a
thin, bookish man with a neat mustache.  This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI.

The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle
of the wheatfield.  The house has several futuristic radar
devices on the roof that rotate constantly.

AUSTIN gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out
two large metal boxes.


 CUT TO 

THE ATTIC WINDOW 
The curtains part ever so slightly, and a pair of eyes peer
down.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE VAN 
AUSTIN shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metal
boxes into the house.  The titles stop rolling as we;


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE HOUSE 
AUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of
the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic
contraption, twice his size.  There are strange tools all
over the floor.

Putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and
takes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic
receptacles mounted in the sides.

He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption,
clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles.
Then he opens the second box.  Inside is a glowing green ball.
Using a pair of special tongs, AUSTIN carefully lifts the ball
out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine,
in the back.

As soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life.  The
glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green
planet in space appears inside it.


 AUSTIN                     (looking at the holograph)

                 Hmmmm ....


He takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make an
adjustment underneath the machine.  Suddenly a wire comes
loose from the sphere and begins to spark.


 AUSTIN                     (seeing sparks)

                 Uh - oh ....


As the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen, the
green planet begins to silently shake.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
With an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk rips
out of the green planet and shoots off into space, leaving
thousands of glowing particles in its wake.


 CUT BACK TO 

AUSTIN 
Not noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quickly
repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other
adjustments.


 CUT TO 

A FOREST 
From the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead,
dropping balls.  We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond
a far-off mountain range.  The forest rumbles as the planetoid
crashes in the distance.

The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful
girl approaches, picking mushrooms.


 CUT TO 

A GREEN BALL NEAR HER FEET 
An ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing
ball, and is drawn to it.  Picking the sphere up, she looks
at it.  Something inside her warns her of its danger, but,
unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful
girl passes through the glass gates and heads home.


 CUT TO 

THE GIRL'S BEDROOM 
The girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to
her basket in the corner.  Through its side, the green ball
begins to glow brightly.

Getting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of
the ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the green
ball behind it.

The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to
surround the girl, like a cocoon.  Slowly the camera pans
up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond
the city gates, rising higher and higher.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera
heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors,
where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of
a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.

The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant
mountains where the huge planetoid fell.  Finally, from high
above the foothills, we begin to come down.

In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are
moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in
the mountaintops.  Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
At the front of the line, the largest barbarian - obviously
their leader - stops and points.


 CUT TO 

THE MOUNTAINS 
A strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains
toward the barbarians.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
The barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps
on going.  One by one, their eyes turn green and they start to
change, becoming hairier, uglier, and stronger.

As their transformations are complete, the barbarians gather
behind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderous
looking sub-humans.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
A frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through
the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound
of ten thousand approaching footsteps.

The camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan.  In the glow
of sunset, the outline of the BARBARIAN LEADER, riding a black
war-horse, appears at the hillside and stops.  Then with a
thundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarians
comes into view behind him, filling the horizon.


 CUT TO 

THE BARBARIAN LEADER 
He is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild-
eyed, he screams to signal the attack.  The bloodthirsty horde
charges down the hill behind him.

The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the
gates of the city, destroying everything in their path.  Smoke
and flames are everywhere.  Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians
run from the onslaught.

As we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the BARBARIAN
LEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below.  Shouting
a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive
doomed building in the middle of the city.


 CUT TO 

THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS 
At the far end of this huge glass hall, the Kraanian Council
sits around a marble table.  From outside, we hear the battle
raging.

Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council
members.


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 They're killing everyone.  We
                 must escape!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 The city is burning!


 COUNCILMAN #4                     (throwing a parchment
                     before the Elder)

                 Even the mountains glow green and an
                 evil slime oozes down!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Elder, we must arm ourselves!  We
                 must fight!


 ELDER 
                 Silence!


Everyone gets quiet.  Looking at the parchment thrown before
him, the ancient, withered ELDER rises to his feet.


 ELDER 
                 We are not a race of warriors.
                 We are statesmen, and scientists.
                 From our very beginning it was ordained
                 that the warrior-race of Taarak the
                 Defender would aid us in times of need.
                 This was the Pact!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Taarak the Defender?  His race is
                 dead!  They cannot defend anyone!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 Some say that the race is not dead
                 - that one still lives.


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 One?  What good is one?


 ELDER 
                 One of Taarak's blood can do much.


Outside, the sounds of battle grow louder.  A boy appears at
the doorway.


 BOY 
                 Elder!  They are at the walls!


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 Well who is this last Defender?
                 How can he be summoned?


 ELDER 
                 It is Taarna, of the blood of
                 Taarak the Defender - the last of
                 the race.  And must be summoned as
                 my forefathers summoned Taarak
                 himself - from within!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 But will this Defender answer?


 ELDER 
                 A Taarakian has no choice.  They
                 must answer.  It is in their blood.


The clattering of armour becomes audible.


 BOY 
                 They are in the halls!  They are coming!!


 ELDER                     (calmly to the boy)

                 Bar the door.
                 (to the Councilmen)
                 We will summon the
                 Defender together.


The Councilmen nod.


 ELDER                     (shutting eyes)

                 Taarna ... Taarna ...


As the Councilmen take up the chant;


 CUT TO 

THE DOOR 
As the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging him
aside.  Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, is
the BARBARIAN LEADER.

With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow
and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed
troops rush in around him.

The chanting continues as we;


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
We look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only
decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure
breaking the barren uniformity of the land.  As the Council's
distant chanting fades out, all is quiet.

Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings
and a huge rush of air.  Just above our heads, TAARNA THE
DEFENDER comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of
a giant crimson bird.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S FACE 
She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing
behind her in the wind.

Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror,
chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.

Spurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly
beast and lassoes it.  She then hoists the creature up into
the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged
rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly.

Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.  As
she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion
on a chain around his neck.


 HUMANOID 
                 I owe you my life.  Let me
                 repay you ...


He takes off his medallion and places it around her neck.
Suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her
towards him.  His eyes change to a bright green as he forces
her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes.  As he
molests her, TAARNA is distracted.  She hears something - voices
inside her, chanting her name.

Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart.  Then she
powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's
ears.  As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him
above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground.

Still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out
a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet.  She then
lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock,
next to the growling creature.

As TAARNA flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian
hungrily.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN GRIMALDI 
He is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine.
As the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN is reaching
deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange
diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron.  The connection
breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the
machine and start smoking and sputtering.  As the smoke grows
thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.


 AUSTIN 
                 Dammit!


AUSTIN pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair
of needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part.

The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke
surrounds it and clouds over everything.  The buzzing sound
grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing
engines.  Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice
crackling over a radiophone.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Where the hell are we?


Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bombers
come tearing out into the moonlit night.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND BELOW 
The sound of jungle night creatures fills the air.  We see
palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky.  The
scene is almost serene.  The camera pans and suddenly the
nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as the
camera continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun on
the bomber's fuselage.  The pan stops at the tail of the
aircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard.

There is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill the
air.  The soldier almost dozes ... suddenly the cacophony of
sound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence
... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters
the silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.

Instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet.
Silhouetted figures rush by.


 CUT TO 

A GUN EMPLACEMENT 
Japanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gun
skyward.  We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines.


 CUT TO 

CLOSEUP OF A SHELL 
It is thrust into a breech.


 CUT TO 

THE B-17 FORMATION 
As the bombers press on, the camera moves in to the lead
aircraft.  In the moonlight we see her name, "Pacific Pearl".


 CUT TO 

INT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 We're there Stepek, right on
                 target ... Rabual dead ahead!


Suddenly a cacophony of explosions split the air as anti-aircraft
shells explode ahead of the aircraft, lighting the inside with
electric blue flashes.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Gee!  Thanks for telling me,
                 Holden.  I thought it was Cleveland.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
Ackack guns blast shells skyward.  The gun blasts light up
the palm tree background, causing momentary silhouettes.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 For Christ sake, hold her steady!


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He can be seen from outside the plane as the shell flashes
light up his turret.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Quit yer bitching Stepek, just drop
                 'em and let's get outta here!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Keep your shirts on guys, tonight I'm
                 gonna hit something.
                 (he settles over the bomb sight)
                 Left two degrees ... steady ...
                 steady ...


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
The flak is severe, with electric blue flashes lighting up
the fuselage interior.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Hey kid, how ya doing back there?


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 
Tailgunner momentarily lit with a shell burst, he's scared
shitless.  He looks nervously back behind the aircraft at
the flak puffs behind the tail.


 TAILGUNNER 
                 Gulp, ah ... I'm ah ... okay
                 ... I think.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up, we're almost there.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He is crouched over his bomb-sights, concentrating.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 C'mon Stepek, there's the
                 whole island of Rabaul down
                 there, you can't miss!


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Screw you ...


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT'S COMPARTMENT 
Suddenly a shell explodes almost on the windshield and the
pilot rears back with the blast.  The right windshield is
shattered.


 PILOT 
                 We took a hit ...


The co-pilot sags forward, held back only by his shoulder
straps.  His eyes stare.  Blood runs from under his helmet.
We know he is dead.


 PILOT 
                 Shit.  Elkhorn just bought it.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 We took one back here too.
                 C'mon Stepek, blast 'em!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER                     (hand on the release button)

                 Steady ... steady ... bombs away!
                 Let's get the hell outta here!


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
We hear the shriek of descending bombs.  The explosions walk
across the airfield, and in the light of the explosions we
see devastation.  The last bomb hits a fuel dump, causing an
enormous ball of fire.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Yahoo!  Bullseye!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE PACIFIC PEARL 

 PILOT                     (exhilarated)

                 Nice shooting Stepek, how are the
                 rest of you guys?


 FLIGHT ENGINEER (V.O.) 
                 Flight Engineer okay.


 RADIO OPERATOR (V.O.) 
                 Radio okay.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Navigator check.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Belly okay.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Ah ... tail okay ...


There is abrupt silence.


 PILOT 
                 Bellson ... Lewis?


Still silence, no reply from either name.


 PILOT 
                 Kid, check the waist positions, see if
                 they're okay.


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 

 TAILGUNNER 
                 Yeah ... will do, skipper.


TAILGUNNER crosses himself, then exits back into the body of
the machine.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT                     (wearily)

                 Let's go home.


We hear jumbled comments from all positions.  Everyone is
happy.


 CREW (V.O.) 
                 Cheers and whoops.


The mood of high spirits is stopped abruptly as the tailgunner
reports back.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Skipper, Bellson and Lewis are both
                 dead.


This is the first time the kid's voice is not scared, just
puzzled.


 PILOT 
                 Dammit!


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Well kid, now you got a real
                 bombing mission under your belt.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He removes his oxygen mask and takes a long swig from a
bottle.


 CUT TO 

EXT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
She rejoins the rest of the group.  The formation is not
quite as tight as before.  As the formation flies along,
puffs of cloud pass by, occasionally obscuring a machine.


 CUT TO 

LOW VIEW OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
Under the "Pacific Pearl's" belly, we see the bellygunner
suspended in his small glass pod.  A red glow brightens up
as he drags on a cigar.  The rest of the formation are
visible stretched to the side and behind as puffs of cloud
waft past.  We begin to feel as if the weather might be
changing.


 CUT TO 

THE NOSE OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
The BOMBARDIER is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle
and sings raucously.  From the front we look in on the pilot
with the dead co-pilot sagging in his seat next to him.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Sorry about Elkhorn, skip.
                 What happened?

 PILOT 
                 I dunno.  The shell exploded and he
                 collapsed.  I think he took it in
                 the head.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Are ya sure he's dead, Skipper?


 PILOT 
                 He's dead.


 BOMBARDIER                     (sings drunkenly)

                 Oh I put my finger in a woodpecker's
                 hole and the woodpecker said God
                 bless my soul; take it out, take it
                 out, take it out, remove it ...


 TAILGUNNER                     (bolder)

                 Hey Stepek, just shut up, okay?


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Up yours kid, wassa matter, you don't
                 like my voice?


While all this banter has been going on the cloud has been
thickening.  Suddenly a serious voice cuts in on the small
talk. It's the NAVIGATOR.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Something's wrong!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 
He is frantically tapping the compass.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 You got a problem, Holden?


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Naw, the kid's the one with the
                 problem.  He don't like my voice!


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up Stepek.  What's the
                 problem, Holden?


 NAVIGATOR 
                 I must have a malfunction, my compass
                 says we're heading north!


 CUT TO 

PILOT 
He looks at his compass.


 PILOT 
                 Mine says east.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Hey, can you guys see the rest of the
                 squadron?


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Negative, there's too much cloud.


A sudden flash of lightning illuminates the whole inside of
the plane.


 CUT TO 

THE COCKPIT 
The dead co-pilot's pale face is momentarily electric blue,
lit by the lightning flash.  We pan past him to the compass in
the instrument panel.  It is spinning madly.


 PILOT 
                 What the hell ...


He reaches forward to tap the compass.


 PILOT 
                 Hey Holden, now my compass has gone
                 crazy.  It's spinning like a son of
                 a bitch!


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Mine too, we must have hit a magnetic
                 field or something !!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
We see a dull glow coming from all crew positions from the
on-board lights.  Suddenly a curtain of rain lashes the machine.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Christ, now they're all doing it!!


 CUT TO 

THE INSTRUMENT PANEL 
All the dials are going haywire.  Above the instrument panel
we see the windshield is spattered with rain.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 You guys quit talking business?
                 I'm trying to sing here!  Oh I
                 put my finger in a woodpecker's ...


 PILOT                     (irritably)

                 Can it Stepek, we got real problems.


Just then through the rain, a strange green glow is seen
in the distance.  It begins to curve toward the aircraft.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE - NEAR BELLY TURRET 
The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Jesus!  Look at that!!


From under the starboard wing, we see the object approaching.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Look at what ... look at what!!?


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's out there, just look at it ...


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For Christ sake, give us a position!


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's about four o'clock, just below
                 ... Holy Shit, it's coming right at us!


The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits
the starboard inner engine.


 CUT TO 

PILOT'S POV 
He has to push the dead co-pilot back to peer out the
broken starboard window ... the number three prop is bent
and windmilling wildly.  It has a strange green luminescence
about it ... the whole machine shakes.


 PILOT 
                 Damn.


The PILOT tries to fly the plane and do the co-pilot's job of
feathering the bad engine.  Suddenly it's too late as the prop
wobbles loose and cartwheels over the wing.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
The prop flies back and slices a great gash in the aircraft's
skin, near the TAILGUNNER'S position.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 We lost the goddamned prop ...
                 Did it do any damage?  Kid, check
                 the tail.


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Come in kid ... kid are you okay?


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Travis; go check the back.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Will do, skipper.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE HATCH 
TRAVIS' turret opens and TRAVIS pulls himself up into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
The gauges are now settled except for the oil pressure to
No. 2 engine.  The pressure drops.  The engine heat gauge
climbs rapidly.  A red warning light begins to flash.


 PILOT                     (to himself)

                 Goddamn it, now what?


He glances out of his window just in time to see a strange,
claw-like feeler coming out of the engine casing.  It detaches
one of the cooling gills, then another, and another.  They blow
away in the slipstream.


 PILOT 
                 Gremlins!
                 (rubbing his eyes)
                 Jesus, I must be getting tired.


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He looks in to the kid's reargun compartment.  All that is left
of him is a tattered skeleton.

TRAVIS turns, horror frozen on his face.  Quick as a flash,
from seemingly nowhere, something flies at him and grabs his
throat.  The mask on his face falls off, and we get a split
second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Travis, what's goin' on back there?


 CUT TO 

TRAVIS 
His eyes are open but he is obviously dead.  Through his helmet
headphone, we hear his name.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Holden, how far to base?


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Skip, with everything screwed up here, I'd,
                 I'd guess about two hundred miles.


All the time the engine pops and bangs wildly.


 PILOT 
                 For Christ's sake, find us a place I
                 can put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 It's all ocean down there, skip!


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Mack, can you get us a radio fix?


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 

 RADIO OPERATOR 
                 Negative skip, too much interference.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.


 PILOT 
                 Shit!  I've gotta put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Hey Holden ... ya old stuff shirt ...
                 ya wanna snort?


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For God sakes Stepek, shut up!


STEPEK takes another swig from his bottle.  He is lying on
his back partly propped up by the curving nose of the aircraft.
He is about to make another smart ass reply, when he hears a
strange scratching and chirping noise above his head.  He
looks up in time to see sharp teeth and claws start to appear
through the lining above his head.  He blinks in disbelief and
throws his bottle away as if the image came from the whiskey.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Oh my God, there's ... there's ...
                 ahh ... keep away ... keep away ...
                 (struggles)
                 ... hey no ... hey somebody ...
                 (screams)


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Stepek, you stupid sonovabitch, will
                 you lay off the booze, you've got the
                 D.T.'s ...


STEPEK is wide-eyed and scared silly as the sound now begins
under his feet and pincers begin to snip through the floor.
He suddenly realizes that the whole floor is giving way beneath
him, and he grabs for a handful of cables as the floor collapses.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
The lower half of STEPEK is hanging in the slipstream, kicking
madly.  We see that his legs are covered in wriggling creatures.


 CUT BACK TO 

STEPEK 
He is losing his grip with one hand, but still desperately
clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other.  Suddenly
an ugly pincer cuts the cables and STEPEK is gone ... out
into the night.


 CUT TO 

THE PLANE 
Suddenly the No. 2 engine begins to backfire, blasting back
large gobs of orange flame.  The oil, heat and manifold gauges
are off the dial and red lights frantically flash.  Desperately
the PILOT looks out of the window.

Pieces begin flying off the engine.  The cowling disintegrates
revealing the bare engine beneath.  Small figures are frantically
busy ripping the engine to pieces.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is scared.


 PILOT 
                 Holden, for God's sake get up
                 here on the double.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 What's the problem, skip?


 PILOT 
                 Just get up here!


The NAVIGATOR grimaces as he pushes past the dead co-pilot.


 NAVIGATOR 
                 What is it, skip?
                 (looking out windows)

 JESUS H. CHRIST! 

 PILOT 
                 Hold 'em off.  I'm taking her down.


He peers out at the incredible sight of the creatures ripping
off the wing skin and tearing huge plates from the cowlings.
The camera pans down to his feet as the hatch door handle twists
and then bursts open.  A dozen bat-like creatures swarm in.
The NAVIGATOR panics and reaches up, grabbing the flare gun
from its rack.  He screams as the creatures attack and shoots
right through the creatures, bathing the aircraft with a bright
ruby glow.


 NAVIGATOR                     (struggling)

                 Okay you little bastards ... shit ...
                 (screams)


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 
The flare shoots down the fuselage and smashes into him.
Wreathed in flames, he falls back into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
Creatures swarm all over the plane.  The ball turret falls
off.  A wheel suddenly lowers, then falls off.  A flap flutters
free and blows away.  Oil streams back into the slipstream and
sections of the skin of the plane come away, revealing the
skeleton framework of the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.  Creatures are now in the cockpit,
plucking out the instruments.  The PILOT reaches to the throttle
only to grab a creature that locks on to his gloved hand.
Flying the plane with his good hand, he strikes and pummels
at the attacking creatures with the other.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
It is now almost a flying skeleton.  For the first time, we
see that it is heading for an island.  A figure detaches itself
from the machine and plummets away.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He falls, terror-stricken, through space.  Finally his chute
opens.  A slimy creature still clings to his gloved hand.  He rips
off the glove and throws it and the creature away.


 PILOT 
                 (struggling)
                 Jesus H. Christ!


 CUT TO 

THE ISLAND 
The approaching smoking plane bellies onto the sea, bounces,
then skims along the wave tops, careening up onto the beach,
where it twists around crazily before coming to a lopsided
stop.  The machine faces us head-on and we see a glow coming
from what's left of No. 3 engine. The camera zooms in rapidly
to a green ball stuck in engine No. 3.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He has landed, and is undoing his parachute harness.  He looks
around incredulously.  The island is a junkyard - a veritable
graveyard of aircrafts.  There are many aircrafts, both old
wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere.  Skeletal
corpses are still left in some of the wrecks.  The camera pans
to the remains of one machine.  It is an old American Lockheed
Electra.  It glints dull in the half light of dawn.  Painted
on its side are two names; "Amelia Earhart" and "Fred Noonan".

The camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic
junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of
a pile of scrap.

Tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan
metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile.  The
metal arms reach the chrome rod, grip it tightly, and begin to
lift it up.

WWe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher, finally
coming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball.  The camera pulls
back to reveal that the eyeball belongs to AUSTIN GRIMALDI,
who carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his
needlenose pliers.


 AUSTIN 
                 Got it.


Satisfied that this is the piece he had lost in the machine,
he begins to re-solder it in place.  Behind him, a LITTLE
GIRL with red hair comes into the room and walks up to him.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 It's broken again, isn't it Daddy?


 AUSTIN                     (concentrating)

                 Yes dear.  But Daddy's fixing
                 it.  (hums)


 LITTLE GIRL                     (watching)

                 How come it's always breaking?


 AUSTIN 
                 I don't know, sweetheart.  Mmmmhmm.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 When it's fixed, will you make more
                 funny pictures for me?


 AUSTIN 
                 Honey, why don't you go play with
                 your toys and let Daddy finish his
                 work, okay?  Mmmm ...


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 Okay.


The LITTLE GIRL wanders around to the other side of the machine,
as AUSTIN flips a switch.  Once again the glass sphere sparkles
and the holographic screen lights up.  AUSTIN uses a tool to
fine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize;
the glass gates of Kraan.

As the image becomes clearer, the camera pulls closer and closer
to the holograph screen.


 CUT TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
The Council's voices still ringing in her head, TAARNA flies
in over the demolished gates.  Below her, the once-beautiful
city lies in ruins.

Gliding overtop the deserted streets, she sees a column of
smoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the
town's center.  As she watches the smoke rise, she pulls hard
on the reins, and heads her bird up.

The camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome
down to the Council Chambers below.

Corpses of the Councilmen are strewn everywhere.  In the
center of the room, a large pile of ancient books and
manuscripts lie smouldering.  Reaching the floor, TAARNA
dismounts and starts to look around.  At the head of
the marble table sits the ELDER - dead.  In front of him,
a roll of parchment lies on the table.  TAARNA opens it.

Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains,
their tops glowing green.

TAARNA looks at it, and puts it in her sack.  Then she notices
that the ELDER is clutching something in his hand.  Prying
his stiff fingers apart, she finds a blood-stained medallion
just like the one her attacker wore on his chain.

Looking at the dead ELDER, TAARNA grips the medallion tightly
in her hand.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL BUILDING 
TAARNA flies back out through the shattered dome and surveys
the city below.  All is quiet and dark, except for a green glow
coming from a second-floor window.  Curious, she flies over,
pulls up beside the window, and climbs in.


 CUT TO 

GIRL'S BEDROOM 
Entering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed.
The basket of fruit still sits on the floor.  From
within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.

TAARNA looks at the parchment in her sack, then at the glow
coming from the cocoon.  Cautiously, she approaches the cocoon,
sword drawn.

Suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and
shoots forward, ripping through the webbing and holding the
ball up to TAARNA's face.  The hand belongs to a hideously
ugly witch, who emerges from the cocoon, cackling through
snake-like fangs.


 WITCH 
                 Behold!  The Sphere of Uluhtec!
                 Look upon it, Taarna.  Look upon
                 it with fear.  For in its glow lies
                 the end of heaven - the beginning of
                 hell.  Take it Taarna.  Feel death
                 in your hands.  For death is upon
                 you.  And as you perish ... so dies
                 your race!


The witch's eyes go green.


 WITCH                     (screaming)

                 Take it !!


She hurls tha ball at TAARNA, who dodges it.  The ball sails
past her, out the window.  Then TAARNA, sword raised, leaps
at the WITCH, slicing through her in rapid strokes.

The WITCH cackles and crumbles into dust, but her green eyes
stay suspended in the air, and her cackle echoes through
the room.

TAARNA backs away, climbing out the window, onto her bird.  As
she flies off, she sees the WITCH'S green ball high above her,
rising into the clouds and disappearing.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
The WITCH'S green ball zooms through space, as Earth appears
in the distance.  Then another object comes into sight.  Getting
closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no
determinable nationality, soaring high above Earth.  The green
meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.

The rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes.  Slowly the
hatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of
an automobile suspended in the open hatch.

Hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from
the belly of the cruising rocketplane.  We can see now
that the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible.

With a "thunk", the metal arms release the car, and
as the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins its
free-fall to Earth.

As the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays
with the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one
way, then the other.

Once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car
radio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles
on one.

With the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to
Earth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the
atmosphere.  In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts
burning up.

As he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his
approach.  Touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking
Corvette bounces violently, every part straining at the
repeated impact.

The driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into
high gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt
to translate downward momentum into forward motion.  Then
he pops his drag chute to help slow down.

TThis accomplished, the expressionless driver releases the
chute, and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust.


 CUT TO 

EXT. THE PENTAGON - AERIAL SHOT 
From high above the building we see a crowd of reporters
and T.V. newsmen waiting on the front steps.

The '59 Corvette pulls up at the curb below, and seeing
it, the reporters all start to run over.

The camera zooms down and into the car.  Inside, the driver
reaches over, unplugs a rubber hose, and loosens the two
large hex-nuts which connect him to the car.  As he gets out,
the reporters come running up.


 FEMALE REPORTER                     (to driver)

                 Doctor Anrak, six more mutants were
                 sighted in Arizona this morning.  Do
                 you still say this has nothing to do
                 with the green radiation from space.


The driver walks on without speaking.


 T.V. NEWSMAN                     (walking alongside)

                 Doctor, is it true that the President
                 himself pulled you off the Jupiter Six
                 Project so that you could investigate
                 those mutations? Doctor, answer me that.


He ignores the question, and walks past the guard into the
Pentagon.


 CUT TO 

INT. PENTAGON - MEETING ROOM 
Around a large table sit the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of
the Cabinet, and a pretty secretary wearing a tight skirt.
An argument is in progress as the expressionless DOCTOR ANRAK
enters.  The camera follows him as he sits down next to one
of the Generals.


 FAT POLITICIAN 
                 ... well what I wanna know is,
                 what's the Army doing about this?
                 Hell!  My constiuents are turning
                 green!  They're growing arms on
                 their backs.  There's something or
                 someone up there in space and the
                 voters have a right to know about it!


 GENERAL 
                 Senator, we have no proof that these
                 mutations are the result of interference
                 from outer space.  In fact, Doctor Anrak
                 has just come in, so let's hear what he
                 has to say ... Doctor?


The room goes silent as the DOCTOR stands up.


 DOCTOR 
                 First of all, there is no cause for
                 alarm.  As for the theories of interference
                 by alien beings, it is my firm opinion that
                 we on Earth are the only intelligent,
                 technically advanced civilization present
                 in the universe.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
An enormous round spaceship the size of Pittsburg hovers
overhead.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 

 DOCTOR 
                 ... and whatever is causing these
                 mutations is not from outer space.
                 it's more likely just an isolated
                 biological pheno ... pheno ... ph ...
                 ph ... ph ...


Suddenly the DOCTOR'S head starts to jerk from side to side.
Everyone looks on, not knowing how to react.  As the DOCTOR
begins to move in short bursts, like a broken robot, he
fixes his gaze upon the pretty secretary across the table.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
From the bottom of the huge spacecraft, a metal tube emerges and
starts to drill through the roof of the Pentagon.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 
The DOCTOR starts to shake violently as he stares at the pretty
secretary.


 DOCTOR 
                 Pretty ... pretty ... p ... p ...


Suddenly he lunges at her, sliding across the table.


As the DOCTOR struggles with the terrified girl, the camera
pans up to the ceiling, where the metal tube from the spaceship
drills through.  Descending upon them, it sucks them up instantly.


 DOCTOR 
                 Aaarrgghh!


 SECRETARY 
                 Eeeeeek!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - CONTROL ROOM 
A metallic robot holding a clipboard, is standing in front of
a large glass receiving jar, as DOCTOR ANRAK comes through
the tube and lands in the jar.  As soon as the DOCTOR'S feet
hit the bottom of the jar, the DOCTOR breaks into a lot of
small metallic parts.


 ROBOT                     (Mechanical voice)

                 Oh, nice job.  How am I supposed
                 to fix this guy?  He's fucked.


ZEKE and EDSEL, two alien space-pilots, are standing nearby,
at the control console.  They look like big furry orange heads
on stilts, with arms coming out of the sider.


 ZEKE                     (to Edsel)

                 I guess we turned it up a
                 little too high.


 EDSEL                     (to Robot)

                 Sorry, man.


 ROBOT 
                 You're sorry?  What about me?
                 I've gotta put this asshole
                 back together.


Suddenly the pretty secretary comes through the tube and lands
in the jar.  She's a little mussed up, but okay.


 GLORIA 
                 (gasp)  Where am I?


 ROBOT                     (staring)

                 Hey, who's the chick?


 GLORIA 
                 Well look at my clothes!
                 Who's gonna pay for the dry
                 cleaning?  And where am I?
                 I demand that you return me
                 to my office immediately.


 ROBOT 
                 Too late - molecular instability
                 zone around spacecraft. You cannot
                 leave.


 GLORIA                     (to Zeke)

                 What?!  Is he kidding?


 ZEKE 
                 Uh ...


He looks at the ROBOT, who winks at him.


 ZEKE 
                 ... oh yeah.  Instability zone.
                 You're stuck here.


ZEKE and EDSEL try to keep straight faces.


 GLORIA                     (stunned)

                 But I have to be at my parents
                 for dinner tonight.  And my
                 gynecologist appointment is on
                 Wednesday.


 ROBOT 
                 Not anymore.  Would you, ah, like
                 a drink?
                 (leading her away)
                 You'll feel better after a glass of
                 fresh blo-aak.


They disappear down a corridor.


 GLORIA (V.O.) 
                 Do you have any diet soda?


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 

 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 Ah, typical robot.  The first
                 Earth-chick we see in ten years,
                 and he's gotta make a play for her.


EDSEL jams the gearshift into 'D' for Drive, and the ship
lifts away from Earth.


 ZEKE 
                 Hey, do we have any of that
                 Plutonian Nyborg left?


 EDSEL 
                 Uh, yeah.  Just one bag.  Uh, it's
                 in the transmitter compartment.


 ZEKE 
                 Uh, thanks man.


ZEKE opens a hatch and pulls out a double-spouted plastic
bag on wheels the size of a steamer-trunk.  It is full of
white powder.


He pours two fifteen-foot lines of powder onto the floor.
Then, he pauses.


 ZEKE                     (surveying the lines)

                 Oh great.  Think this is enough?


 EDSEL                     (thinking)

                 Uhh ... nah.  Go for broke.


 ZEKE 
                 Good thinking, man.


As he resumes pouring, ZEKE begins singing to himself in an
alien tongue.  When the lines are poured, they both stand at
the start of the trail of white powder, and part their hair
to reveal nostrils hidden in their foreheads.


 ZEKE & EDSEL 
                 Nose dive!


They both start to criss-cross the room, inhaling the white
powder like vaccuum cleaners.  As they happily snort the
Nyborg, the camera pans back to the glass receiving jar, and
moves down through the broken pieces of DOCTOR ANRAK.  Reaching
his lifeless face, the camera moves around to the back of the
head.  Through the shattered metal we can see a green ball,
glowing inside ANRAK'S skullpiece.


 DISSOLVE TO 

SPACE - ZEKE AND EDSEL'S P.O.V. 
As the round spaceship moves through space, a group of
asteroids approach and whip past.  Up ahead, a red sun
turns white and goes super-nova.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow ... good Nyborg!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - ROBOT'S BEDROOM 
GLORIA PEARLMAN and the ROBOT are lying in bed, naked.
They have just finished making love.  She is smoking a cigarette.


 GLORIA                     (glazed)

                 That was incredible.  I've never felt
                 anything like it.


 ROBOT 
                 Oh great.  I have been programmed to
                 be fully proficient in sexual activities.
                 Do you want to go steady?


 GLORIA 
                 Gee, I don't know.  I already have
                 a boyfriend.


 ROBOT 
                 Ah, what he does not know will not
                 hurt him.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, staring wide-eyed
out into space.  They are obviously stoned.  Suddenly a bell
rings and the communicator screen lights up.  A serious officer's
face appears on it.


 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...


ZEKE looks over at the screen and then shouts into it.


 ZEKE 
                 Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling Starcruiser Alpha ...


 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 You gotta use the microphone.


 ZEKE 
                 Oh yeah.
                 (shouts into microphone)
                 Whaddyawant man?


 OFFICER 
                 Now listen, idiot.  Do I have to
                 tell you eight hundred times?  You
                 don't call me "man"!  You call me
                 "Com-Op Officer Blix". Now is that
                 perfectly clear?


 ZEKE                     (into mike)

                 Yeah, sure.  Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER                     (disgruntled)

                 You are to return immediately to
                 the Mother Ship and pick up a
                 humanoid civilian.  Your orders
                 are to escort him to the Interplanetary
                 Tribunal Courtroom so that he can testify
                 at the trial of Lincoln Sternn.  And make
                 it snappy!


The screen goes blank.


 EDSEL 
                 Wow!  They finally got Sternn.


 ZEKE 
                 It's about time.  Hang on, man.
                 Here we go.


ZEKE jams the gearshift into hyper-drive.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
The round spaceship blasts forward at ten times the speed
of light.


 DISSOLVE TO 

SPACE - LATER 
ZEKE and EDSEL'S round spacecraft looks like an apple
heading toward a freight train as it approaches the
enormous mother-ship.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE SPACECRAFT - CONTROL CONSOLE 
An ashtray full of roaches sits on the console.  ZEKE is
at the controls with a joint in his mouth.  He is swaying
back and forth, eyes glazed.  Beside him, EDSEL watches
the mothership getting closer.


 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 You okay to land this thing?


 ZEKE 
                 No problem, man.


 CUT TO 

MOTHERSHIP'S LANDING AREA 
Huge red arrows point the way through the ten-mile wide
landing area as the round spaceship glides in.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 I think you're goin' a little high,
                 man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 It's okay, man.  If there's one
                 thing I know, it's how to drive
                 when I'm stoned.  It's like, you
                 know your perspective's fucked,
                 so you just gotta let your hands
                 work the controls as if you're
                 straight.


The round ship rams directly into a wall, and crashes down,
skidding to a stop in front of the loading bay.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow, good landing, man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 Thanks.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE SPACECRAFT - ENTRANCE HATCH 
ZEKE and EDSEL press a button to open the hatch doors.
As the door opens we see two metallic Regolian guards
waiting on the other side.  Between them stands a small,
shabbily-dressed humanoid with a crooked jaw and
cauliflower ears.  This is HANOVER FISTE.


 REGOLIAN GUARD                     (to Zeke and Edsel)

                 This man is to be delivered to the,
                 clik, Interplanetary Tribunal, Courtroom
                 #3, clik, Galaxy versus Lincoln Sternn.
                 Thenk yew.  Clik.


The guards wheel away.


 FISTE                     (meekly)

                 Ah, hello.


 CUT TO 

CORRIDOR IN SPACESHIP 
ZEKE and EDSEL escort FISTE down the corridor.


 EDSEL                     (to Fiste)

                 Umm, you're gonna testify at
                 Sternn's trial?


FISTE nods.


 ZEKE 
                 They gotta give him at least, like,
                 life.


 FISTE 
                 Lincoln Sternn is a kind and honourable
                 man.
                 (camera pulls close to Fiste's face)
                 He will be freed.


 CUT TO 

SPACE - LATER 
As the round spaceship journeys through space it passes through
a fantastic space-scape of disembodied rock statues, and past
a magnificent graffiti-covered robot chained to an asteroid.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Y'know, I wish they'd clean this place
                 up, man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 Yeah.  It's like pig city out here.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Yeah.


 CUT TO 

ROBOT'S BEDROOM 
GLORIA is getting dressed as the ROBOT re-charges his energy-
paks.


 ROBOT 
                 ... but I don't understand.  We
                 laugh together.  We care for each
                 other.  We have highly proficient
                 sex.  Why can't we get married?


 GLORIA 
                 Look, we're different, okay?  Let's
                 leave it at that.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL ROOM 
The hatch opens, and GLORIA and the ROBOT walk through,
still talking.


 GLORIA 
                 ... but mixed marriages just don't
                 work.  What if you get tired of me
                 and run off with a vibrator or
                 something?


As they move through the room, and out the other side, they
pass FISTE, who is sitting quietly near the receiving jar,
hands folded.  Looking around, FISTE notices a green glow
coming from the bottom of the jar.  He gets up, quietly opens
the jar, and pokes through the scrap robot parts.

Finding the small green ball in ANRAK'S head, he pulls it
out and looks at it.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, driving carefully.
FISTE, carrying the green ball, comes up and sits down beside
them.


 ZEKE 
                 There it is, man.  I'm gonna hang
                 a louie here.


 EDSEL                     (to Fiste)

                 Yeah, well it won't be long now.  Are
                 you sure you're gonna testify for Sternn.


FISTE says nothing.  He just clutches the green ball and stares
into space.

ZEKE and EDSEL look at each other and shrug.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE SPACESHIP 
An enormous, brightly-lit, multi-level space station/courthouse
floats into view, completely filling the screen.  ZEKE and
EDSEL'S round spaceship is just a speck as it enters the frame,
approaching the mammoth structure.


 CUT TO 

SPACE-STATION LANDING DOCK 
The ship locks into the dock, and the exit hatch opens.
GLORIA and the ROBOT come through first, ahead of ZEKE, EDSEL,
and FISTE.


 GLORIA 
                 ... alright, alright.  I'll marry
                 you - but on one condition ... I
                 want a Jewish wedding.


 ROBOT 
                 A Jewish wedding!?!!!  But this is
                 space.  95% of the population are
                 robots.


 GLORIA 
                 Well, find me a robot-rabbi!


 ROBOT 
                 Okay, okay!


 EDSEL 
                 I give them six months, man.


 ZEKE 
                 He doesn't even look Jewish!


GLORIA and the ROBOT disappear around a corner as ZEKE and EDSEL
escort FISTE through the hatch.  FISTE is carrying the small
green ball.

As they lead FISTE away, the camera pulls back, out through
a space-port, and moves along the outside of the slowly
rotating space-station.  At the top, the camera zooms down
through a massive glass-domed ceiling and into a huge
inter-galactic courtroom.

Voices echo below us.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?


 STERNN 
                 I am.


As we move down, we see square-jawed CAPTAIN STERNN, his
shifty-eyed lawyer, and the cold Prosecutor all standing
before the Judge.

STERNN is smirking confidently as the Prosecutor reads from
a long page of charges.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Lincoln Sternn - you stand here
                 accused of twelve counts of murder
                 in the first degree  ... fourteen
                 counts of armed theft of Federation
                 property ...


 CUT TO 

THE GALLERY 
The hostile humanoid and alien faces all stare at STERNN with
hateful, accusing eyes.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... twenty-two counts of piracy
                 in high space ... eighteen counts of
                 fraud ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN'S LAWYER 
Mopping his brow, he looks nervously over to STERNN.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... thirty-seven counts of rape, and
                 one moving violation.  How do you plead?


 CUT TO 

CAPTAIN STERNN 
Smiling to himself, he nods, then gets serious.


 STERNN 
                 Not guilty!


 LAWYER                     (whispers to Sternn)

                 Not guilty?!?  Are you nuts?!?


 STERNN                     (whispers to lawyer)

                 It's okay, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


 JUDGE                     (to Prosecutor)

                 Call the first witness!


STERNN and his lawyer move to their seats.


 LAWYER                     (to Sternn)

                 But the Prosecutor's gotcha cold!
                 Yer as guilty as a cat in a goldfish
                 bowl.


 CUT TO 

THE COURTROOM DOORS 
ZEKE and EDSEL enter with FISTE, and push their way to the
front.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 The Prosecution calls Hanover Fiste.


 GUARD #1 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #2 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #3 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #4 
                 Hanover Fiste!


ZEKE and EDSEL sit down, while HANOVER FISTE, small and
shabby, walks up to the witness stand, nervously clutching
the small green ball in his hand.  As he passes, STERNN and
his lawyer continue to argue.


 LAWYER                     (pleading)

                 Lissen Sternn ... change the plea
                 to guilty.  Throw yerself on the
                 mercy of the court.


 STERNN 
                 I told you, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


HANOVER FISTE is sworn in, as Sternn's lawyer begs.


 LAWYER 
                 But the most we can hope for is to
                 get ya buried in secrecy so yer grave
                 don't get violated!  Plead guilty!


 STERNN 
                 Shut up, Charlie.  I got an angle.


 LAWYER 
                 What angle?


 STERNN                     (pointing to Fiste)

                 Him!

                 he's never done anything immoral ...
                 (thinking)
                 unless maybe the Pre-Schooler's
                 Prostitute ring ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 
They look at each other, shocked.


 STERNN & LAWYER 
                 Huh?!?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE                     (speaking gently)

                 ... and he's ah, never done anything
                 illegal ...
                 (turning sharply)
                 ... unless you count all the times
                 he sold dope disguised as a nun!!
                 (reverting to meekness)
                 He's always been a good, law-abiding
                 citizen ...
                 (shouting at himself)
                 Awww, gimme a break!!
                 (gentle again)
                 ... of the Federation, and, and ...
                 (going schizo)
                 Shut Up!  Shut Up!  Shut Up!
                 (gentle, but starting to sweat)
                 ... a community-concious individual, ah, ah ...
                 (rising in crazed anger)
 STERNN!!!                  (pointing as he screams)
                 He's nothin' but a low-down, double-dealin',
                 back-stabbin', larcenous, perverted worm!!


STERNN and his lawyer look on, horrified, as FISTE'S body
starts to grow.


 FISTE 
                 Hangin's too good for him!!


New muscles tear through FISTE'S shabby clothes.


 FISTE 
                 Burnin's too good for him!!


Growing larger, he starts foaming at the mouth.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 He should be torn into little bitsy
                 pieces and buried alive!!!


FISTE rams his hands down onto the Witness Stand, shattering
it completely.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll kill him!


He hurls the Prosecutor aside, and moves towards STERNN with
thundering footsteps.


 FISTE 
 KII - ILLL!!! 

Still growing, he rips apart the Judge's bench as he passes
it.  Finally  he stands towering in rage over the terrified
STERNN. 

 STERNN                     (to Fiste)

                 H-h-hey, Hanover ...
                 n-now take it easy, Hanover,
                 I'm sure we can talk this ov ...


Instinctively, STERNN leaps back as FISTE'S giant hands come
smashing down in the spot where STERNN stood.  The gallery
scatters screaming as STERNN runs for the door.  Slavering,
FISTE thunders after him.  STERNN runs through the exit,
bolting the door behind him.  FISTE follows, tearing the
door apart, and bringing the entire courtroom wall down in
the process.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
Running down a hallway, STERNN passes a group of Regolian
cops, who raise their weapons in an attempt to block the
rampaging FISTE.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 Halt, clik, in the name of the
                 Federation, clik.  Where is your
                 corridor pass?
                 (to other Regolians)
                 Unco-operative humanoid, clik,
                 blast him.


They open fire, but FISTE is unstoppable.  Still growing,
he grabs the Regolians's weapons, crunches them up and eats
them.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 You are now in violation of Code
                 103-N-17, clik, paragraph A-64 ...
                 unauthorized consumption of Federation
                 property.  Please come quietly, clik,
                 ... thenk yew.


With a single clap of his enormous hands, FISTE crushes the
Regolian's metal skulls together into an accordian the thickness
of a dime.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
He races through a metallic hallway, and ducks into a boiler
room, then down a long dark tunnel.  At the end of the tunnel,
STERNN comes to a dead-end, and stops to rest.


 STERNN 
                 Oh, this looks good.


 FISTE 
                 (growls)


 STERNN 
                 Oh, duck under here ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll get you!!


 STERNN 
                 I think I'll turn here!
                 (runs, gasping)
                 Come on feet, don't fail me now!


 FISTE 
                 Sternn!!!


 STERNN 
                 Uh oh ...
                 (runs)
                 Ah, gasp, ah whew, lost him!


 FISTE 
 STERNN!! 

 STERNN 
                 Okay, Hanover, you've had this
                 coming!


Taking a deep breath, STERNN reaches into his pocket, pulls
out a wad of bills, and counts them out as he hands them to
FISTE. 

 STERNN 
                 Let's see, thirty-three, thirty-
                 four, thirty-five thousand zuleks.
                 Thanks Hanover.


 FISTE                     (taking money)

                 S'nothin, boss.


Counting his money, FISTE starts shrinking back to his
normal size.


 STERNN 
                 And Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 Yes?


 STERNN 
                 Goodbye.


STERNN pulls a lever, which opens up the floor below FISTE,
who screams, falling out into space.  As FISTE slides out,
STERNN grabs the money from FISTE'S hand and smiles.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
All is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and
barren desert.  The silence is broken by a whistling sound which
gets louder and louder.  Then, thud!

A green ball lands in the dirt in front of us.  Fluttering down
around it are HANOVER FISTE'S tattered clothes.  Then the
burnt ashes of Hanover's body land in a small pile beside his
clothes.  Panning up we see TAARNA flying on her bird in the
distance.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA 
She swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and
cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station.
Then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting
floor, and enters a magnificent  secret hideaway cut deep into
the rock.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE TAARNA'S HIDEAWAY 
Landing her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble, TAARNA
dismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool.  Here she disrobes,
and picking up a small gold pitcher, she pours an ancient oil
over herself.  It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin.
Then she steps into the water, where her body seems to sparkle
even brighter.

Finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone
wall.  When she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveal
a gold chest.  TAARNA opens it.

Inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments,
so bright that TAARNA must shield her eyes for a moment.  Then,
as she looks down at the armour, the voice of TAARAK THE
DEFENDER comes into her head.


 TAARAK (V.O.) 
                 To defend - this is the Pact.
                 but when life loses its value,
                 and it taken for nought, then
                 the Pact is ... to avenge!!


Through a series of dissolves we see TAARNA'S hands sensuously
fitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body.  Finally
we pull back to see her fully.

Standing before us, glistening in the torch-light, she looks
magnificent.  Reaching once more into the chest, TAARNA pulls
out a golden sword.  As she holds it, it seems to vibrate,
almost buzzing in her hands.  Suddenly she swings it, slicing
cleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall.  As
the burning torch falls to the ground, TAARNA leaves.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
From over our heads, TAARNA comes soaring past, her armour
gleaming in the rays of the setting sun.  Below her, she
sees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers.
Drunken blue men fight in the streets, strange animals run
around loose, and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters.

Looking down, amidst the melee, she sees three winged creatures
tied up in front of a bar.  The camera zooms in on one of the
creature's saddlebags.  It has a silver medallion set into the
leather, identical to the one which TAARNA pried from the
Elder's fingers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE BARROOM 
Barbarian honky-tonk music fills the crowded room, as
various barbarian soldiers sit drinking and fondling the
bar-girls who are dressed in cheap, flashy metal outfits.

Three of the blue barbarians are particularly drunk and
rowdy as they push a non-barbarian down, dump a drink on his
head, laugh and kick him.


 CUT TO 

THE BARROOM DOOR 
TAARNA walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass
doors, past the three soldiers kicking their victim.  She sits
down at the bar.

The three brutish blue soldiers finish stomping the man and
walk over to the bar, crowding close around TAARNA.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 Hey, look.  A new one.
                 (to Taarna)
                 Where you from, baby?


TAARNA ignores him.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Doesn't talk much, does she ?


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 She doesn't have to talk for what
                 I want to do with her.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S HAND 
It slowly moves down to her sword, and unclips the safety strap.

 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARBARIANS 

 BARBARIAN #3 
                 (running his hand across her breastplate)
                 C'mon baby, let's see what's under there.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 (starting to undo her breastplate)
                 Yeah, let's have a look.


Taarna slowly stands up, pushing their hands away, and takes
a step back.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Heey, she's tough.


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 Maybe she wants to fight?


They all laugh.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 ... or maybe she wants to take
                 us all on?


Still laughing, they move towards her.

In a blinding flash, TAARNA draws her golden sword, and wielding
it like a Samurai master, slices off all three of their heads.
In an instant, the sword is back in its sheath.

The barbarian's heads stop laughing as they fall to the ground.
The music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at TAARNA.

Stepping over the bodies, TAARNA walks up to the bartender,
pulls out the parchment picture of the glowing mountains, and
shows it to him.  The bartender looks at it carefully, then
points out the window.


 BARTENDER 
                 Beyond the oasis.


TAARNA nods and leaves.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARTENDER 
His eyes start to turn green.  The camera gets closer and
closer to his glowing eyes, until the green glow turns into
the image of a ball, lying in the ground, in AUSTIN'S holograph.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN 
AUSTIN is crouched over the machine turning several knobs,
trying to make the ball move.  Nothing happens.


 AUSTIN                     (to himself)

                 Hmmm ... must be jammed.


Frustrated, AUSTIN picks up a flashlight, opens up a compartment
underneath the control knobs, and takes a look inside.  While
AUSTIN fiddles inside the machine, we see two hands appear on
the holograph screen and pick up the green ball.  AUSTIN looks
over to the holograph and notices.


 AUSTIN 
                 Where'd it go?


 CUT TO 

THE HANDS

As the hands cradle the green ball, the camera pulls back
to reveal a skinny, unco-ordinated boy wearing thick eyeglasses,
carrying the sphere across his backyard.  This is DAN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It all started when I found the green
                 meteorite.  I read in Farraday's "Life
                 of the Planets" that smaller ones like
                 this are supposed to burn up when they
                 enter the atmosphere, but for some reason
                 this one didn't ...


DAN carries the ball into a typical small-town house.


 DISSOLVE TO 

T.V. ANTENNA ON ROOF - STORMY NIGHT

As the narration continues, we follow two red wires down
from the T.V. antenna, along the roof, and into DAN'S attic
window.  The wires run through a bucket of water and are hooked
up to some electronic parts on DAN'S desk.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... so I brought it up to my room,
                 stuck it in my rock collection and
                 forgot about it.  I was experimenting
                 with natural electricity ...


The camera pans around the room to show various displays of
DAN'S scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects,
transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal
organs, and many books.

In the corner, the green ball sits in DAN'S rock collection.

At his desk, DAN impatiently shuffles through the dusty pages
of an old scientific journal.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... and with the storm warnings up,
                 I figured maybe tonight I'd hit the
                 jackpot.  All I needed was a little
                 juice.


He looks out the window at the gathering storm.


 CUT TO 

THE STORM 
Crackling from the sky, a bolt of lightning strikes the
television antenna and surges along the wires into the attic.


 CUT TO 

DAN'S ATTIC ROOM 
The lightning flashes into DAN'S apparatus, lighting it up
brightly.


 DAN 
                 It works!


Suddenly, an electric arc jumps from the bucket of water
and crosses the room to join with thw ball on his shelf.
Caught in the middle, DAN begins to glow green.


 DAN                     (looking at his
                     green arms)

                 Oh Jesus!


The electrical field opens up a shimmering gateway into another
universe and DAN de-materializes.


 CUT TO 

THE TRANSFORMATION 
We float in darkness for a moment as black shapeless images
zoom past.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I felt like I was nothing
                 - just atoms floating in the
                 darkness ...


Then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner
of the screen. The glow gets brighter and starts moving slowly
around the screen.  Now, we can make out some of the images
whipping past - a half-formed hand, pages of a book, a crumbling
pyramid, a green ball.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Then, a body started to re-form
                 around me.  Only it wasn't my
                 body - this one had muscles.


Sturdy muscular parts begin to materialize around the moving
light.  They join up with each other to form a powerfully built
human figure.

Finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything
gets brighter and clearer.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It was a great body, but I
                 wasn't too crazy about the
                 face.


The powerful figure, DEN, turns slowly as he floats and begins
to look at his hands and arms.  Moving his mouth, he speaks in
a new voice - deep and powerful.


 DEN                     (feeling head)

                 Hmmm ... no hair.


Suddenly, the background explodes into fields of radiant colours
as the body accelerates away from us and passes through a second
shimmering gateway.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
DEN, strong, masculine and hairless, materializes cradled in
the hand of a huge stone idol.  He is naked and unconscious
Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the idol's other
hand.

The camera pulls back to show that the idol is standing on the
deck, stop a huge, truncated pyramid.  The deck forms a walkway
around a swirling pool of green water.

Kneeling all around the seething pool, are lizard-men, wearing
priest's robes.  Two of them stand beside a glass coffin.  Inside
the coffin, lies a naked girl, bound and gagged.


 PRIESTS                     (chanting softly)

                 Uluhtec, Ulutec ...


Directly in fron of the idol, a regal-looking QUEEN, wearing
a revealing velvet cloak, is praying to the raging water.


 QUEEN 
                 By the powers of the glowing
                 Loc-Nar placed in your idol's
                 hand, I demand you come forth,
                 Uluhtec!


The waters of the sacrifical pool rage more violently and
a low rumble is heard far below.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S HANDS

The green ball, (Loc-Nar), glows brightly as DEN opens his eyes,
looks down and notices his enormous genitals.


 DEN 
                 Hmmm ... big!


Seeing an animal-skin hanging from the idol, he rips off a
piece and wraps it around himself.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was no way I was gonna
                 walk around this place with
                 my dork hangin' out!


Suitably covered, he surveys the ritual taking place below him.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This looked like something
                 right out of the Ten Commandments.


 CUT TO 

EDGE OF RAGING POOL

The QUEEN is kneeling before the seething water.


 QUEEN 
                 Grant me your strength in return
                 for a living mortal sacrifice!  It
                 has been ordained.  Come forth Uluhtec!
                 I demand it!


Two lizard priests remove the terrified girl from the glass
case and hold her out over the swirling water.  The QUEEN
nods and the two priests drop her in.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S WATER 
Seeing the girl struggle in the water, DEN'S eyes grow wide.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 What'd they do that for?


He stands and dives into the raging pool, swimming powerfully
towards the drowning girl.

 CUT TO 
UNDER WATER 
Reaching her, DEN grabs the girl's  bound ankles, hooks them
over his head and drags her through a decayed hole in the
underwater wall.  Inside a stone tunnel, they are swept along
by the current.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Normally, I'd be dead by now.  I
                 kept thinking I was going to run
                 out of air, but my new body worked
                 great.  I just hoped her body was
                 working as good as mine.


 CUT TO 

EXT. FIELD OF LILIES - DAY 
DEN and the girl are washed out into a pond at the center of
a beautiful field of lilies.  He pulls her out of the water,
unconscious.  As he unties her, she begins to stir.


 GIRL 
                 Thank you.


She takes DEN'S hand and lies back in the flower, her
beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 She had the most beautiful eyes.
                 I wanted to make some conversation
                 but I found my new self asking the
                 same old stupid questions.


 DEN 
                 Are you from around here?


 GIRL 
                 Well, you may not believe this, but
                 I'm from another world - from a place
                 called Earth.


 DEN 
                 Earth?  I too am from Earth.
                 How did you get here?


 GIRL 
                 My name is Katherine Wells, and
                 I'm from the British colony of
                 Gibraltar.  Time makes no diff-
                 erence here, but there it was
                 the summer of 1892.  It was
                 evening - I'd gone for a walk on
                 the cliffs when suddenly a sphere
                 fell from the sky.  Following its
                 glow, I came to a shining gate made
                 out of light.  Unable to resist, I
                 stepped through it and awoke in
                 this world.  There I was thin and
                 weakly, fit only to stay indoors.
                 (she stands up)
                 But here, somehow I am stronger,
                 more alive,
                 (she stretches seductively)
                 ... more fully a woman.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 You're not kidding.


 DEN                     (standing)

                 I, too seem better equipped on
                 this world.
                 (he holds out his arm)
                 My arms are more powerful.
                 (strecthes his fingers)
                 Even my fingers seem to hold
                 great strength.


KATHERINE walks up close to DEN, takes his hand and touches
the fingers to her breast.


 KATHERINE 
                 You saved my life.  I have no
                 reward to give you, but if any
                 part of me pleases your senses
                 - I would give it willingly.


She circles her nipple with his baby finger.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This was great!  There was
                 no way I'd get a chick like this
                 back on Earth.  I mean, look at
                 her!!


Taking KATHERINE in his arms, DEN lays her down on a bed of
flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was only one problem ...


A spiked boot appears in the frame.  The camera pans up to
show a large, ugly hairy beast-man standing over DEN and
KATHERINE. 
The camera then pulls back to reveal the entwined couple,
completely surrounded by a horde of grim, bestial warriors.


 DAN (V.O. 
                 I don't know who these jerks
                 were, but they sure picked a
                 bad time to show up ...


The ugly beast-men grab DEN and KATHERINE as we;


 DISSOLVE TO 

ARD'S THRONE ROOM 
The beast-Captain keeps his machine gun trained on DEN as
the soldiers lead him into the cavernous room.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They split us up and took me to
                 this weird castle-type place.
                 I wanted to find out where they'd
                 taken Katherine, but none of these
                 guys seemed to speak English.


In the middle of the room there is a round stone pedestal
with a throne carved into it.  On the throne sits ARD, a
child-like ruler with a sadistic glint in his eye.


 ARD 
                 They tell me you are Den of Earth,
                 the one who dared to steal the
                 female sacrifice from the Queen.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy was a shrimp so I figured
                 I'd play it tough.


 DEN 
                 Where is the girl?


 ARD 
                 I am Ard - supreme leader of
                 the revolution and the next
                 ruler of the world.


 DEN                     (tougher)

                 The girl!!


 ARD 
                 Well, aren't we fierce?
                 If you are truly as tough as
                 you seem, then you will serve
                 me well.  But first, a test.
                 Guards!  Castrate him!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


Two bestial guards approach from behind, brandishing curved
short-swords.  DEN turns instinctively, dodges the first thrust
and delivers a bone-shattering elbow to the beast's head,
crushing his skull.

Spinning with his own momentum, DEN throws a rock-hard fist
into the second guard's chest, snapping his rib-cage and
sending him flying across the room.

Without pausing, the bald muscleman grabs the nearby beast-
Captain and lifts him into the air by his machine-gun.  The
Captain hangs on as DEN twists the gun, butts it into the
creature's groin and then drives the weapon through the
Captain's jaw.

The creature crumples, leaving DEN with the gun.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy!  I was pretty good at this
                 stuff.


 ARD 
                 Excellent.  You are worthy to
                 serve me.


 DEN                     (aiming machine-gun at him)

                 Give me the girl or die.


 ARD                     (taking it lightly)

                 Well, if I have a choice, I'll
                 take death.


 DEN 
                 So be it.


DEN fires, spraying a row of bullets across ARD'S body.  The
bullets blast big yellow holes in ARD'S chest, but there is
no blood.  ARD looks up and laughs.


 ARD 
                 Ha ha ha!  You'll have to
                 do better than that.


As DEN looks on, ARD'S wounds miraculously close up and heal
themselves over.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I could see why they made this
                 guy their leader.


 ARD                     (standing up)

                 ... but if you're really interested
                 in the girl; I've had her encased in
                 glass.


ARD pulls the velvet covering off of a glass box to reveal
KATHERINE, unconscious, sealed inside.


 DEN 
                 She's dead.


 ARD 
                 Actually no.  She's sleeping,
                 but only I can awaken her.


 DEN 
                 What do you want of me?


 ARD 
                 I want you to steal the sacred
                 Loc-Nar.


 DEN 
                 What is this Loc-Nar?


 ARD 
                 The Queen's glowing sphere, you
                 fool.  The sacrifice to Uluhtec
                 can only be performed by the
                 possessor of the sacret Loc-Nar.
                 (calling out)
                 Norl!


NORL, a huge gorilla-man, in a purple cloak, steps forward.


 ARD                     (to Den)

                 This is Norl, my bravest warrior.
                 You will go with him to the Queen's
                 castle and steal the Loc-Nar.  Then
                 I will give you the girl.


 DEN 
                 And if I refuse?


 ARD 
                 If you refuse, you die, she dies,
                 everybody dies.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Sounded reasonable to me.


DEN looks down at KATHERINE'S motionless body.


 DISSOLVE TO 

RIVER BANKS NEAR THE QUEEN'S CASTLE 
In the moonlight, DEN and NORL lead a squad of beast-warriors,
armed with automatic weapons, along the river towards the Queen's
castle.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Ssh.  Guard post ahead.  We
                 must go underground.


NORL lifts a rock to reveal an underground passageway.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy Norl seemed to know what
                 he was doing.  And, for a gorilla,
                 his English wasn't half bad.


DEN and the warriors enter the underground passage.


 CUT TO 

UNDERGROUND TUNNEL 
The group, carrying torches, moves along the dark tunnel.  They
pass a bubble-window with shark-faced eels swimming on the other
side.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 We're underneath the castle moat.


DEN nods.  An ugly growl echoes through the tunnel up ahead.
the warriors freeze and murmur to each other in their own
languages.


 DEN                     (to Norl)

                 What are they saying?


 NORL 
                 They talk of the savage beast who
                 prowls these catacombs with a fierce
                 hunger and sharp teeth ...
                 (gestures)
                 six inches long.


A dog-faced warrior shakes his head and says something to NORL.


 NORL 
                 Sorry ...
                 (indicating)
                 ... sixteen inches long.


Suddenly, a savage beast appears and chomps his long, razor-sharp
teeth into one of the warriors at the end of the line.  DEN, NORL,
and the remaining warriors run on through the tunnel as, behind
them, the monster pulls his victim apart.


 CUT TO 

DOORWAY IN CATACOMBS 
DEN, NORL, and the remaining warriors arrive at a door in the
rock wall.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Now we separate.  You and Korg
                 take this door into the Queen's
                 quarters.    The rest of us will
                 move through the walls and enter
                 her chamber from the other side.
                 Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first will
                 return it to Ard.  Good luck, Den.


DEN nods, puts out his torch and carefully opens the door as
NORL moves off.


 CUT TO 

DARK ROOM 
DEN and KORG silently enter.  Across the dark room, the
glow of the green ball casts a pale light.


 KORG                     (whispers and points)

                 Loc-Nar.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  It was just like the
                 ball I dug up in my back yard.


They tip-toe towards it.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow I
                 had this real funny feeling.  All
                 by themselves, my hands reached
                 forward to touch it.  But the
                 Loc-Nar moved out of the way.
                 Instead, my hands felt something
                 else - warm flesh.  Then the lights
                 came on.


In the brightly lit room, DEN is standing before the beautiful
semi-clad QUEEN, and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands.
Looking around, he sees that he and KONG are surrounded by a
brigade of the Queen's ugly guards, swords raised.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Talk about embarassing!


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Kill them.


The Queen's guards attack with battle-axes, clubs and swords.
As DEN knees one in the groin and swings his gun into another's
face, four of the guards surround KORG and club his brains out.

But DEN, still going strong, throws two guards into the wall
and heaves a third out the window.  As the QUEEN watches with
glee, more guards rush into the room and DEN is finally over-
powered and held down.  The Captain of the guards places a long
knife against Den's throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Can I slit his throat, your
                 Majesty?


The QUEEN, eyeing Den's magnificent body, sighs.


 QUEEN 
                 Yes, slit his throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Thank you, your Majesty.


As the Captain presses his knife against Den's flesh, the
QUEEN suddenly raises her hand.


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Stop!  I have, ah, something better
                 in mind.


She takes Den's hand and leads him into an adjoining room, as
the guards grumble to one another.


 GUARD #1 
                 Jeez, not again.


 GUARD #2 
                 This always happens.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Look, she's the Queen.  She
                 can do whatever she wants.


 GUARD #2 
                 Yeah, sure.


 GUARD #1 
                 Sure.


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN'S BOUDOIR 
The QUEEN stands before DEN, hands on her hips and a funny look
in her eye.


 QUEEN 
                 If you please me, I may let
                 you live.


She smiles, and approaches DEN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


 DEN 
                 What must I do?


 QUEEN 
                 Satisfy my appetites.


The QUEEN lets her cloak drop to the floor as she gets closer.
She is naked underneath.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  Eighteen years of nuthin'
                 and now, twice in one day.  What
                 a place!


 QUEEN 
                 Come with me.


 DEN 
                 Mmmm.


She steps forward and takes his hand, leading him towards the
bed.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE QUEEN'S BED 
DEN and the QUEEN are lying undressed on the enormous bed.
The QUEEN has a very contented look on her face.  DEN looks
exhausted.  As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber
window, the QUEEN slowly runs her hand over DEN'S bulging
muscles.


 QUEEN                     (softly)

                 The rising moon climaxes our
                 love, Den.  Is is a sign, a
                 new beginning.


 DEN 
                 Yes, a sign.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I had no idea what she was
                 talking about.


 QUEEN                     (stroking him)

                 Neverwhere is a troubled land,
                 but together we could calm it.
                 We could rule side by side.
                 Your strength has brought great
                 peace to my restless body.  It
                 could bring great peace to all
                 the troubled people of this land.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I knew I was good, but I didn't know
                 I was that good.


Suddenly the Captain and his guards burst through the door.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Your Majesty!  The Loc-Nar is missing
                 - stolen!


The QUEEN jumps to her feet in a rage and points to DEN.


 QUEEN                     (screaming)

                 Fiend!  You make love to me while
                 your accomplices steal the magic
                 sphere!  Guards!  Take him!


The guards grab DEN as the  QUEEN snatches one of their big
spiked clubs.


 QUEEN                     (to guards)

                 Hold him still!  I will kill
                 him myself!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy, was she pissed off!


Heaving the guards aside, DEN breaks free and jumps out the
chamber window.


 CUT TO 

THE CASTLE WALL 
DEN falls down, down into the swirling waters of the castle
moat.


 (CUT TO) 

THE QUEEN 
She is livid.


 QUEEN 
                 Prepare the flying lizards.
                 I want his head!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE CASTLE 
Pulling himself out of the moat, DEN knocks a guard off his
leopard/horse and rides off.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is kneeling at the edge of the sacrificial pool.  Beside
him sits a long glass case wrapped in chains.  Through the
chains we see KATHERINE trapped inside - fully conscious and
terrified.  Ard's bestial warriors stand all around carrying
torches and spears.

Above them, the Loc-Nar sits glowing in the stone idol's hand.


 ARD 
                 By the power of the magic Loc-Nar
                 placed in your idol's hands, I
                 command you - come forth Uluhtec!


The green water in the pool immediately begins to churn
violently and leap into the air.  A bolt of lightning
crackles in the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
DEN is racing across the barren desert on his leopard/horse.
Visible in the distance is the outline of the huge, truncated
pyramid where he first saved KATHERINE.

As he rides, he sees the green glow of the Loc-Nar, sparkling
in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it.


 DEN                     (to himself)

                 Katherine!


He spurs his leopard/horse on into the night.


 CUT TO 

ANOTHER PART OF THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
The QUEEN, riding a flying lizard, leads her army in pursuit
of DEN.


 SOLDIER                     (pointing)

                 There he is, your Majesty!


 CUT TO 

QUEEN'S P.O.V. 
Up ahead, silhouetted in the moonlight, she sees DEN, riding up
the steps of the pyramid.  The camera pans to the green glow
atop the torch-lit pyramid.


 QUEEN (V.O.) 
                 The Loc-Nar!


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN 

 QUEEN                     (shouting to her men)

                 Faster!  To the pyramid!


She whips her lizard harder.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is incanting to the raging water while two hooded monks
stand beside him, holding the struggling KATHERINE out over
the pool.


 ARD 
                 Here is your sacrifice, Uluhtec.
                 Now, give me your power!
                 (to monks)
                 Throw her in.


Chanting the name "Uluhtec", the two monks start to throw
the girl in when suddenly a third monk leaps forward and
grabs her, kicking the other two monks into the water.

The intruder's hood falls away and his bald head gleams in the
moonlight.


 DEN 
                 Katherine!


 KATHERINE 
                 Den!


 ARD 
                 No!  You'll ruin everything!


ARD jumps up and runs toward the Loc-Nar, perched in the stone
idol's hand.  Grabbing it, ARD holds the glowing ball above him.


 ARD                     (to his guards)

                 Kill them!  Kill them both!


Suddenly, a hand leaps out of the darkness, gripping the
Loc-Nar just above Ard's hand - it is the QUEEN.


 QUEEN 
                 The Loc-Nar is mine!


 ARD                     (struggling)

                 Stupid bitch!  Get away from me!


As ARD and the QUEEN fight over the Loc-Nar, the Queen's troops
pour in and battle with Ard's soldiers.  Thunder roars overhead.


 CUT TO 

DEN 
Holding KATHERINE in one arm, DEN smashes a nearby soldier and
grabs the beast's spear.  With the battle raging all around
him, DEN looks up at the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
Lightning crackles, illuminating the night with electricity.


 CUT BACK TO 

DEN 
DEN reaches down, picks up the long chain that was wrapped around
the glass case and attaches one end to his spear.  He kicks the
other end into the raging water, then heaves the spear
with all his might into the head of the stone idol.

In the same instant, a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky,
striking the idol full force.  The lightning bolt travels through
the spear and down the chain, into the water.  Suddenly, the
electrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar.

Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green,
then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp.  The
troops stop fighting and look on in amazement, until all
that remains is the glowing Loc-Nar, hanging in mid-air.


 KATHERINE                     (to Den)

                 Where did they go?


 DEN 
                 They are gone.  That is all
                 that matters.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They probably went back to Earth.
                 Boy, will Mom be surprised.


Suddenly, the Loc-Nar falls to the ground at Den's feet.


 KATHERINE                     (looking down)

                 The Loc-Nar ... you could have the
                 power of Uluhtec.  You could be
                 ruler over all these people.


 DEN                     (looking over the throng)

                 Forget it.


In a single powerful leap, DEN, carrying KATHERINE, bounds up
onto the Queen's flying lizard and they fly off.  The amazed troops
watch for a moment, then shrug and resume fighting.


 CUT TO 

DEN'S FLYING LIZARD 
KATHERINE clings to DEN as they fly.


 KATHERINE 
                 Oh, but Den, with the Loc-Nar
                 you could have returned to Earth.


 DEN 
                 I like it better here.


The lizard banks sharply away from us and carries them into the
distance.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 On Earth, I'm nobody.  But here,
                 I am DEN.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
The camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere,
which lies abandoned on the ground.  The soldiers are gone.  As
we watch, time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramid
ages and crumbles all around the green ball.  The earth heaves
and shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in
the ground.

A prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern.
Fascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of a
Tyrannosaurus Rex comes down, crushing him.

Time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, and
a Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball.  In the
fire-light, the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals,
when one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowing
ball.  Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes.
Out of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen.

Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple,
placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol.  Then the
Romans grow fat and debauched, while slave-girls feed them grapes.
As the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauched
Romans, covering them and the green ball in rubble.

Over the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud and
clay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medieval
village.

A Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in with
his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village.
Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself
a drink.  Behind him, an  ox-cart comes roaring around a corner.
The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking
the stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well.

Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and
transforms into a Victorian-style town.  It is evening, and
the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas-
lit village green.

A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and
circles the green.

Moving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive-
looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace.  This
is intercut with the carriage circling the green, until the
woman, who looks like a high-class harlot, finishes dressing and
leaves her room.  Crossing the street, she walks up to the gazebo
and leans provocatively up against the well.

The gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the woman
and propositions her.  She smiles, touches, and teases him. We
pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall.
Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's
body falls to the ground.  The camera pans up to the well-bucket,
where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands.

As time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles
away, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row-
housing grows up, covering the green ball.  The town becomes
dirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morning
sky.  Almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grim
coal-miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets on
their way to work.

The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter.  A rat appears.
Panning back up, the street is now empty.  A bell is heard
ringing, and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a corner
and into view.  Masked workers follow the cart.  One rings
the bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways and
load them into the cart.  The gutters and windowsills are now
full of rats.  Time advances again and the buildings become
deserted derelicts.  Their decaying timbers groan under the
weight.

A support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse.
Falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the
glowing green ball.  As the ball hits the ground, it is covered
over by rubble.

The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape
grows drier.  Sand blows all around, covering over everything.
As the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing but
desert.  In the distance we can see a group of people walking.


 CUT TO 

PEOPLE 
The people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen, carrying
futuristic laser-shovels over their shoulders.  They are led by
a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector.  As
he walks, his detector starts bleeping.  He points to a spot
on the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser-
shovels.

One of the workers finds something.


 WORKER 
                 Kuma!  Kuma!  Kuma!


The archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread-
driven shovel-sifter up to the spot.  The shovel-sifter digs
in and pulls up a large chunk of desert.  When the sand has
sifted out, we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machine's grip.
It is not glowing.  The machine swivels, and a native foreman
plucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifter's teeth.

As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly.
The foreman's hands turn green.  He looks at his green hands,
then he looks over to the archaeologist.  Suddenly the foreman's
entire body glows green, and crumbles into dust.

The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the
glowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust.


 DISSOLVE TO 

NEW YORK - AERIAL SHOT - DAY 
The camera comes down from high above the city.  The general
shape and outline of New York looks familiar, but as we get
closer we sense that something is different.  Fires are
burning in various locations below us, and intermittent
gunshots become audible as the narration begins.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Yeah, New York, big deal.  Scum-centre
                 of the world.


Moving down through the skyscrapers, the city gets dirtier and
slummier.  We pass a dead man hanging from a tenement clothesline.
Below us, scruffy children dodge traffic as they play gyro-ball
in the garbage-filled street.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 ... and now they're talking about
                 letting in low-lifes from other planets,
                 too.


Under the narration, the camera turns a corner and zooms down
through the roof of a parked taxicab.  It stops full frame on
the newspaper held in the cabdriver's hands.  A slow pan across
the front page reveals that the paper is the New York Times,
July 6, 2031

One headline reads: "400,000 Traffic Deaths Over Holiday Weekend".
Another reads: "Venus Declared 73rd State".
The camera stops on a headline reading: "Professor Discovers
Ancient Relic --- to be shown in N.Y. Museum".

There is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and
his beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case
containing the Loc-Nar.

A knocking is heard on the cab's window, and the driver throws
down the newspaper.


 YOUNG MAN                     (from outside)

                 You free?


 HARRY 
                 Yeah.  Get in.
 (V.O.)                  My name's Harry Canyon.  I drive
                 a cab.

He flips a switch which unlocks the rear door.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE CAB 
The young man climbs into the back seat and closes the door.
Harry's yellow Checker cab pulls out into traffic.  The
vehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic
chrome panels cut into the sides, and thicker, deeper bumpers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE CAB 
Harry slides open the plexiglass shields separating him from
his passenger.


 HARRY 
                 Where to, pal?


 YOUNG MAN 
                 The U.N. Building.


 HARRY 
                 The U.N. Building.  What a joke.
                 Used to be a nice place until they
                 turned it into low rent housing.
                 Now it's a dump.  I wouldn't live
                 there if you paid me.


He switches on the car radio.  The music plays as Harry's
cab passes various time-altered New York landmarks; a graffiti
-covered Empire State Building - windows all boarded up, a
decrepit Lincoln Centre, the marquis reading "Continuous Live
Sex Show, Also Inter-Planetary Mud-Wrestling", new ultra-tech
buildings crammed between half-destroyed Wall Street office
buildings, garbage everywhere.

Inside the cab, the YOUNG MAN pulls a gun out of his jacket,
sticks his arm through the opening in the plexi-glass shield,
and holds the gun to Harry's head.


 YOUNG MAN 
                 Okay sucker, hand over your cash,
                 now!


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 This city is really going to the
                 dogs.


Harry's foot stretches forward and pushes a footswitch.
A buzzing is heard, and the young man's body suddenly
dematerializes.  The gun which he held at Harry's head
falls to the seat beside HARRY, who picks it up and tosses it
into the glove compartment, beside all sorts of other futuristic
guns and weapons.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Stupid asshole.  Nobody touches
                 me unless I want 'em to.


CUT TO 

EXT. METROPOLITIAN MUSEUM - NIGHT 
The camera is close-up on the illustrated banner over the main
entrance.  The banner reads; "Treasures of the Loc-Nar - Coming
July 8th".

We pan down to the museum doors, as a man's body comes crashing
through the plate glass and sprawls forward, cut and bleeding.
It is the goateed professor from the desert.  His daughter
runs out behind him, ripping her clothes on the broken glass.


GIRL 
Father!


PROFESSOR 
Run!


The girl takes off down the museum stairs as men with laser
guns come out and start firing.  A fat, evil-looking man (RUDNICK)
bends down and grabs the professor's head, jerking it up.


RUDNICK (to henchmen)

He's dead.  Get the girl!


The girl, clothes torn, runs out into the street, just as
Harry's cab comes cruising by.  She runs alongside, pounding
on the window.


GIRL (to Harry)

Help me, please!!


A laser shot narrowly misses her and blasts Harry's side-mirror.
HARRY flips the switch, unlocking the passenger door, and waves
her in.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Normally my rule is "Don't
get involved", but something
about this dame got to me.


She dives in the back and HARRY floors it.  The cab screams
away as Laser-shots land all around.


GIRL (in shock, breathless)

The Loc-Nar ... they wanted
it ... but my father wouldn't
tell them ... now I'm the only
one ...


CUT TO 

HARRY 
HARRY (interupting)

Relax sister.  There's a cop
station up here.  You can ...


HARRY looks at her in the rear-view mirror.  The girl has fainted.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Just what I needed ... guess
I'm a sucker for a pretty face.


CUT TO 

POLICE STATION 
The police station is an all-metal building with no windows.
A plaque on thr front reads "N.Y. POLICE - 52nd DIVISION".

Harry's cab pulls up.  He gets out, carries the unconscious
GIRL up to the front door, and pushes a buzzer.


VOICE (over intercom)

Police.  Whaddya want?


HARRY 
I wanna report a murder.


VOICE (over intercom)

So what else is new?


HARRY 
You gonna let me in or what?


A buzzer sounds and the door slides open.  HARRY carries the
GIRL in and heads across the room toward the main desk.  As
he walks he passes cops using a strange metal detector/vaccuum
cleaner to suck dangerous weapons from a pair of suspects.  Piles
of weapons can be seen in the machine's transparent belly.


COP #1 
Okay, this guy's clean - next.


HARRY comes up to the front desk and starts to lay the girl
down in a chair.


DESK SERGEANT (to Harry)

Before you go any further pal, I
gotta tell you, it's cash up front.  A
thousand bucks a day for a full investigation.
Another thousand if the assailant is caught.
Got it?


HARRY 
Yeah thanks ...


He picks up the girl and turns to leave.


HARRY ... for nuthin'!


DESK SERGEANT (shouting after Harry)

You think you can do better?
Join one of the vigilante groups.
There's a list of 'em outside.


CUT TO 

EXT. POLICE STATION 
HARRY, carrying the GIRL, comes out of the police station, as
a patrol car screeches to a halt in front of him.  Two cops
emerge, dragging a green alien with four arms.


GREEN ALIEN 
I tell you I'm an American citizen.
I just lost my papers.


COP (to himself)

Goddamn illegal aliens.


HARRY heads toward his cab.


HARRY (V.O.) 
So here I was, stuck with this beautiful
girl.  I knew she was gonna be nuthin'
but trouble ...


He looks around at the sleazy neighbourhood.  Every doorway
and alley seems to have a rapist or thug lurking.


HARRY (V.O.) 
... but I didn't feel right just
leaving her for the sickos.  I
dunno, maybe I'm gettin' sentimental
or something ...


DISSOLVE TO 

INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT 
This futuristic bachelor pad is constructed entirely of brightly
coloured molden plastic.  Bowling trophies sit on a shelf
underneath a neon "Buweiser" clock.  The place is a mess.

HARRY carries the GIRL in, pushes the light button to "On",
and lays her down on the sofa.  As he takes off his jacket
he looks down at the unconscious figure - her clothes torn
in all the right places.  She moans and starts to come to.


GIRL 
Where am I?


HARRY 
My place ...


Walking over to a hi-tech plastic bar, HARRY pushes a button
and a machine pours and mixes a drink.  He hands the GIRL the
glass.  She sits up and drinks.


GIRL (looking at Harry)

They'd have killed me if it
wasn't for you.


HARRY 
What'd they want to snuff you
for?

								July 18, 1980


 
FADE UP ON 
A WHEATFIELD 
A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun.
As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll.  Ahead
of us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering
along a dirt road.  Getting closer, we can see the driver, a
thin, bookish man with a neat mustache.  This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI.

The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle
of the wheatfield.  The house has several futuristic radar
devices on the roof that rotate constantly.

AUSTIN gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out
two large metal boxes.


 CUT TO 

THE ATTIC WINDOW 
The curtains part ever so slightly, and a pair of eyes peer
down.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE VAN 
AUSTIN shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metal
boxes into the house.  The titles stop rolling as we;


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE HOUSE 
AUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of
the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic
contraption, twice his size.  There are strange tools all
over the floor.

Putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and
takes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic
receptacles mounted in the sides.

He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption,
clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles.
Then he opens the second box.  Inside is a glowing green ball.
Using a pair of special tongs, AUSTIN carefully lifts the ball
out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine,
in the back.

As soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life.  The
glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green
planet in space appears inside it.


 AUSTIN                     (looking at the holograph)

                 Hmmmm ....


He takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make an
adjustment underneath the machine.  Suddenly a wire comes
loose from the sphere and begins to spark.


 AUSTIN                     (seeing sparks)

                 Uh - oh ....


As the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen, the
green planet begins to silently shake.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
With an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk rips
out of the green planet and shoots off into space, leaving
thousands of glowing particles in its wake.


 CUT BACK TO 

AUSTIN 
Not noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quickly
repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other
adjustments.


 CUT TO 

A FOREST 
From the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead,
dropping balls.  We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond
a far-off mountain range.  The forest rumbles as the planetoid
crashes in the distance.

The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful
girl approaches, picking mushrooms.


 CUT TO 

A GREEN BALL NEAR HER FEET 
An ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing
ball, and is drawn to it.  Picking the sphere up, she looks
at it.  Something inside her warns her of its danger, but,
unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful
girl passes through the glass gates and heads home.


 CUT TO 

THE GIRL'S BEDROOM 
The girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to
her basket in the corner.  Through its side, the green ball
begins to glow brightly.

Getting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of
the ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the green
ball behind it.

The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to
surround the girl, like a cocoon.  Slowly the camera pans
up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond
the city gates, rising higher and higher.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera
heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors,
where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of
a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.

The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant
mountains where the huge planetoid fell.  Finally, from high
above the foothills, we begin to come down.

In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are
moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in
the mountaintops.  Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
At the front of the line, the largest barbarian - obviously
their leader - stops and points.


 CUT TO 

THE MOUNTAINS 
A strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains
toward the barbarians.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
The barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps
on going.  One by one, their eyes turn green and they start to
change, becoming hairier, uglier, and stronger.

As their transformations are complete, the barbarians gather
behind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderous
looking sub-humans.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
A frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through
the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound
of ten thousand approaching footsteps.

The camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan.  In the glow
of sunset, the outline of the BARBARIAN LEADER, riding a black
war-horse, appears at the hillside and stops.  Then with a
thundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarians
comes into view behind him, filling the horizon.


 CUT TO 

THE BARBARIAN LEADER 
He is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild-
eyed, he screams to signal the attack.  The bloodthirsty horde
charges down the hill behind him.

The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the
gates of the city, destroying everything in their path.  Smoke
and flames are everywhere.  Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians
run from the onslaught.

As we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the BARBARIAN
LEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below.  Shouting
a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive
doomed building in the middle of the city.


 CUT TO 

THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS 
At the far end of this huge glass hall, the Kraanian Council
sits around a marble table.  From outside, we hear the battle
raging.

Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council
members.


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 They're killing everyone.  We
                 must escape!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 The city is burning!


 COUNCILMAN #4                     (throwing a parchment
                     before the Elder)

                 Even the mountains glow green and an
                 evil slime oozes down!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Elder, we must arm ourselves!  We
                 must fight!


 ELDER 
                 Silence!


Everyone gets quiet.  Looking at the parchment thrown before
him, the ancient, withered ELDER rises to his feet.


 ELDER 
                 We are not a race of warriors.
                 We are statesmen, and scientists.
                 From our very beginning it was ordained
                 that the warrior-race of Taarak the
                 Defender would aid us in times of need.
                 This was the Pact!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Taarak the Defender?  His race is
                 dead!  They cannot defend anyone!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 Some say that the race is not dead
                 - that one still lives.


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 One?  What good is one?


 ELDER 
                 One of Taarak's blood can do much.


Outside, the sounds of battle grow louder.  A boy appears at
the doorway.


 BOY 
                 Elder!  They are at the walls!


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 Well who is this last Defender?
                 How can he be summoned?


 ELDER 
                 It is Taarna, of the blood of
                 Taarak the Defender - the last of
                 the race.  And must be summoned as
                 my forefathers summoned Taarak
                 himself - from within!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 But will this Defender answer?


 ELDER 
                 A Taarakian has no choice.  They
                 must answer.  It is in their blood.


The clattering of armour becomes audible.


 BOY 
                 They are in the halls!  They are coming!!


 ELDER                     (calmly to the boy)

                 Bar the door.
                 (to the Councilmen)
                 We will summon the
                 Defender together.


The Councilmen nod.


 ELDER                     (shutting eyes)

                 Taarna ... Taarna ...


As the Councilmen take up the chant;


 CUT TO 

THE DOOR 
As the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging him
aside.  Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, is
the BARBARIAN LEADER.

With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow
and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed
troops rush in around him.

The chanting continues as we;


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
We look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only
decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure
breaking the barren uniformity of the land.  As the Council's
distant chanting fades out, all is quiet.

Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings
and a huge rush of air.  Just above our heads, TAARNA THE
DEFENDER comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of
a giant crimson bird.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S FACE 
She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing
behind her in the wind.

Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror,
chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.

Spurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly
beast and lassoes it.  She then hoists the creature up into
the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged
rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly.

Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.  As
she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion
on a chain around his neck.


 HUMANOID 
                 I owe you my life.  Let me
                 repay you ...


He takes off his medallion and places it around her neck.
Suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her
towards him.  His eyes change to a bright green as he forces
her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes.  As he
molests her, TAARNA is distracted.  She hears something - voices
inside her, chanting her name.

Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart.  Then she
powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's
ears.  As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him
above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground.

Still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out
a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet.  She then
lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock,
next to the growling creature.

As TAARNA flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian
hungrily.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN GRIMALDI 
He is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine.
As the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN is reaching
deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange
diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron.  The connection
breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the
machine and start smoking and sputtering.  As the smoke grows
thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.


 AUSTIN 
                 Dammit!


AUSTIN pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair
of needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part.

The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke
surrounds it and clouds over everything.  The buzzing sound
grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing
engines.  Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice
crackling over a radiophone.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Where the hell are we?


Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bombers
come tearing out into the moonlit night.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND BELOW 
The sound of jungle night creatures fills the air.  We see
palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky.  The
scene is almost serene.  The camera pans and suddenly the
nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as the
camera continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun on
the bomber's fuselage.  The pan stops at the tail of the
aircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard.

There is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill the
air.  The soldier almost dozes ... suddenly the cacophony of
sound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence
... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters
the silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.

Instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet.
Silhouetted figures rush by.


 CUT TO 

A GUN EMPLACEMENT 
Japanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gun
skyward.  We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines.


 CUT TO 

CLOSEUP OF A SHELL 
It is thrust into a breech.


 CUT TO 

THE B-17 FORMATION 
As the bombers press on, the camera moves in to the lead
aircraft.  In the moonlight we see her name, "Pacific Pearl".


 CUT TO 

INT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 We're there Stepek, right on
                 target ... Rabual dead ahead!


Suddenly a cacophony of explosions split the air as anti-aircraft
shells explode ahead of the aircraft, lighting the inside with
electric blue flashes.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Gee!  Thanks for telling me,
                 Holden.  I thought it was Cleveland.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
Ackack guns blast shells skyward.  The gun blasts light up
the palm tree background, causing momentary silhouettes.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 For Christ sake, hold her steady!


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He can be seen from outside the plane as the shell flashes
light up his turret.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Quit yer bitching Stepek, just drop
                 'em and let's get outta here!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Keep your shirts on guys, tonight I'm
                 gonna hit something.
                 (he settles over the bomb sight)
                 Left two degrees ... steady ...
                 steady ...


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
The flak is severe, with electric blue flashes lighting up
the fuselage interior.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Hey kid, how ya doing back there?


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 
Tailgunner momentarily lit with a shell burst, he's scared
shitless.  He looks nervously back behind the aircraft at
the flak puffs behind the tail.


 TAILGUNNER 
                 Gulp, ah ... I'm ah ... okay
                 ... I think.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up, we're almost there.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He is crouched over his bomb-sights, concentrating.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 C'mon Stepek, there's the
                 whole island of Rabaul down
                 there, you can't miss!


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Screw you ...


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT'S COMPARTMENT 
Suddenly a shell explodes almost on the windshield and the
pilot rears back with the blast.  The right windshield is
shattered.


 PILOT 
                 We took a hit ...


The co-pilot sags forward, held back only by his shoulder
straps.  His eyes stare.  Blood runs from under his helmet.
We know he is dead.


 PILOT 
                 Shit.  Elkhorn just bought it.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 We took one back here too.
                 C'mon Stepek, blast 'em!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER                     (hand on the release button)

                 Steady ... steady ... bombs away!
                 Let's get the hell outta here!


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
We hear the shriek of descending bombs.  The explosions walk
across the airfield, and in the light of the explosions we
see devastation.  The last bomb hits a fuel dump, causing an
enormous ball of fire.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Yahoo!  Bullseye!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE PACIFIC PEARL 

 PILOT                     (exhilarated)

                 Nice shooting Stepek, how are the
                 rest of you guys?


 FLIGHT ENGINEER (V.O.) 
                 Flight Engineer okay.


 RADIO OPERATOR (V.O.) 
                 Radio okay.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Navigator check.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Belly okay.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Ah ... tail okay ...


There is abrupt silence.


 PILOT 
                 Bellson ... Lewis?


Still silence, no reply from either name.


 PILOT 
                 Kid, check the waist positions, see if
                 they're okay.


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 

 TAILGUNNER 
                 Yeah ... will do, skipper.


TAILGUNNER crosses himself, then exits back into the body of
the machine.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT                     (wearily)

                 Let's go home.


We hear jumbled comments from all positions.  Everyone is
happy.


 CREW (V.O.) 
                 Cheers and whoops.


The mood of high spirits is stopped abruptly as the tailgunner
reports back.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Skipper, Bellson and Lewis are both
                 dead.


This is the first time the kid's voice is not scared, just
puzzled.


 PILOT 
                 Dammit!


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Well kid, now you got a real
                 bombing mission under your belt.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He removes his oxygen mask and takes a long swig from a
bottle.


 CUT TO 

EXT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
She rejoins the rest of the group.  The formation is not
quite as tight as before.  As the formation flies along,
puffs of cloud pass by, occasionally obscuring a machine.


 CUT TO 

LOW VIEW OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
Under the "Pacific Pearl's" belly, we see the bellygunner
suspended in his small glass pod.  A red glow brightens up
as he drags on a cigar.  The rest of the formation are
visible stretched to the side and behind as puffs of cloud
waft past.  We begin to feel as if the weather might be
changing.


 CUT TO 

THE NOSE OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
The BOMBARDIER is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle
and sings raucously.  From the front we look in on the pilot
with the dead co-pilot sagging in his seat next to him.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Sorry about Elkhorn, skip.
                 What happened?

 PILOT 
                 I dunno.  The shell exploded and he
                 collapsed.  I think he took it in
                 the head.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Are ya sure he's dead, Skipper?


 PILOT 
                 He's dead.


 BOMBARDIER                     (sings drunkenly)

                 Oh I put my finger in a woodpecker's
                 hole and the woodpecker said God
                 bless my soul; take it out, take it
                 out, take it out, remove it ...


 TAILGUNNER                     (bolder)

                 Hey Stepek, just shut up, okay?


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Up yours kid, wassa matter, you don't
                 like my voice?


While all this banter has been going on the cloud has been
thickening.  Suddenly a serious voice cuts in on the small
talk. It's the NAVIGATOR.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Something's wrong!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 
He is frantically tapping the compass.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 You got a problem, Holden?


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Naw, the kid's the one with the
                 problem.  He don't like my voice!


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up Stepek.  What's the
                 problem, Holden?


 NAVIGATOR 
                 I must have a malfunction, my compass
                 says we're heading north!


 CUT TO 

PILOT 
He looks at his compass.


 PILOT 
                 Mine says east.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Hey, can you guys see the rest of the
                 squadron?


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Negative, there's too much cloud.


A sudden flash of lightning illuminates the whole inside of
the plane.


 CUT TO 

THE COCKPIT 
The dead co-pilot's pale face is momentarily electric blue,
lit by the lightning flash.  We pan past him to the compass in
the instrument panel.  It is spinning madly.


 PILOT 
                 What the hell ...


He reaches forward to tap the compass.


 PILOT 
                 Hey Holden, now my compass has gone
                 crazy.  It's spinning like a son of
                 a bitch!


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Mine too, we must have hit a magnetic
                 field or something !!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
We see a dull glow coming from all crew positions from the
on-board lights.  Suddenly a curtain of rain lashes the machine.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Christ, now they're all doing it!!


 CUT TO 

THE INSTRUMENT PANEL 
All the dials are going haywire.  Above the instrument panel
we see the windshield is spattered with rain.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 You guys quit talking business?
                 I'm trying to sing here!  Oh I
                 put my finger in a woodpecker's ...


 PILOT                     (irritably)

                 Can it Stepek, we got real problems.


Just then through the rain, a strange green glow is seen
in the distance.  It begins to curve toward the aircraft.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE - NEAR BELLY TURRET 
The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Jesus!  Look at that!!


From under the starboard wing, we see the object approaching.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Look at what ... look at what!!?


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's out there, just look at it ...


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For Christ sake, give us a position!


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's about four o'clock, just below
                 ... Holy Shit, it's coming right at us!


The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits
the starboard inner engine.


 CUT TO 

PILOT'S POV 
He has to push the dead co-pilot back to peer out the
broken starboard window ... the number three prop is bent
and windmilling wildly.  It has a strange green luminescence
about it ... the whole machine shakes.


 PILOT 
                 Damn.


The PILOT tries to fly the plane and do the co-pilot's job of
feathering the bad engine.  Suddenly it's too late as the prop
wobbles loose and cartwheels over the wing.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
The prop flies back and slices a great gash in the aircraft's
skin, near the TAILGUNNER'S position.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 We lost the goddamned prop ...
                 Did it do any damage?  Kid, check
                 the tail.


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Come in kid ... kid are you okay?


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Travis; go check the back.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Will do, skipper.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE HATCH 
TRAVIS' turret opens and TRAVIS pulls himself up into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
The gauges are now settled except for the oil pressure to
No. 2 engine.  The pressure drops.  The engine heat gauge
climbs rapidly.  A red warning light begins to flash.


 PILOT                     (to himself)

                 Goddamn it, now what?


He glances out of his window just in time to see a strange,
claw-like feeler coming out of the engine casing.  It detaches
one of the cooling gills, then another, and another.  They blow
away in the slipstream.


 PILOT 
                 Gremlins!
                 (rubbing his eyes)
                 Jesus, I must be getting tired.


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He looks in to the kid's reargun compartment.  All that is left
of him is a tattered skeleton.

TRAVIS turns, horror frozen on his face.  Quick as a flash,
from seemingly nowhere, something flies at him and grabs his
throat.  The mask on his face falls off, and we get a split
second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Travis, what's goin' on back there?


 CUT TO 

TRAVIS 
His eyes are open but he is obviously dead.  Through his helmet
headphone, we hear his name.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Holden, how far to base?


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Skip, with everything screwed up here, I'd,
                 I'd guess about two hundred miles.


All the time the engine pops and bangs wildly.


 PILOT 
                 For Christ's sake, find us a place I
                 can put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 It's all ocean down there, skip!


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Mack, can you get us a radio fix?


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 

 RADIO OPERATOR 
                 Negative skip, too much interference.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.


 PILOT 
                 Shit!  I've gotta put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Hey Holden ... ya old stuff shirt ...
                 ya wanna snort?


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For God sakes Stepek, shut up!


STEPEK takes another swig from his bottle.  He is lying on
his back partly propped up by the curving nose of the aircraft.
He is about to make another smart ass reply, when he hears a
strange scratching and chirping noise above his head.  He
looks up in time to see sharp teeth and claws start to appear
through the lining above his head.  He blinks in disbelief and
throws his bottle away as if the image came from the whiskey.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Oh my God, there's ... there's ...
                 ahh ... keep away ... keep away ...
                 (struggles)
                 ... hey no ... hey somebody ...
                 (screams)


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Stepek, you stupid sonovabitch, will
                 you lay off the booze, you've got the
                 D.T.'s ...


STEPEK is wide-eyed and scared silly as the sound now begins
under his feet and pincers begin to snip through the floor.
He suddenly realizes that the whole floor is giving way beneath
him, and he grabs for a handful of cables as the floor collapses.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
The lower half of STEPEK is hanging in the slipstream, kicking
madly.  We see that his legs are covered in wriggling creatures.


 CUT BACK TO 

STEPEK 
He is losing his grip with one hand, but still desperately
clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other.  Suddenly
an ugly pincer cuts the cables and STEPEK is gone ... out
into the night.


 CUT TO 

THE PLANE 
Suddenly the No. 2 engine begins to backfire, blasting back
large gobs of orange flame.  The oil, heat and manifold gauges
are off the dial and red lights frantically flash.  Desperately
the PILOT looks out of the window.

Pieces begin flying off the engine.  The cowling disintegrates
revealing the bare engine beneath.  Small figures are frantically
busy ripping the engine to pieces.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is scared.


 PILOT 
                 Holden, for God's sake get up
                 here on the double.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 What's the problem, skip?


 PILOT 
                 Just get up here!


The NAVIGATOR grimaces as he pushes past the dead co-pilot.


 NAVIGATOR 
                 What is it, skip?
                 (looking out windows)

 JESUS H. CHRIST! 

 PILOT 
                 Hold 'em off.  I'm taking her down.


He peers out at the incredible sight of the creatures ripping
off the wing skin and tearing huge plates from the cowlings.
The camera pans down to his feet as the hatch door handle twists
and then bursts open.  A dozen bat-like creatures swarm in.
The NAVIGATOR panics and reaches up, grabbing the flare gun
from its rack.  He screams as the creatures attack and shoots
right through the creatures, bathing the aircraft with a bright
ruby glow.


 NAVIGATOR                     (struggling)

                 Okay you little bastards ... shit ...
                 (screams)


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 
The flare shoots down the fuselage and smashes into him.
Wreathed in flames, he falls back into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
Creatures swarm all over the plane.  The ball turret falls
off.  A wheel suddenly lowers, then falls off.  A flap flutters
free and blows away.  Oil streams back into the slipstream and
sections of the skin of the plane come away, revealing the
skeleton framework of the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.  Creatures are now in the cockpit,
plucking out the instruments.  The PILOT reaches to the throttle
only to grab a creature that locks on to his gloved hand.
Flying the plane with his good hand, he strikes and pummels
at the attacking creatures with the other.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
It is now almost a flying skeleton.  For the first time, we
see that it is heading for an island.  A figure detaches itself
from the machine and plummets away.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He falls, terror-stricken, through space.  Finally his chute
opens.  A slimy creature still clings to his gloved hand.  He rips
off the glove and throws it and the creature away.


 PILOT 
                 (struggling)
                 Jesus H. Christ!


 CUT TO 

THE ISLAND 
The approaching smoking plane bellies onto the sea, bounces,
then skims along the wave tops, careening up onto the beach,
where it twists around crazily before coming to a lopsided
stop.  The machine faces us head-on and we see a glow coming
from what's left of No. 3 engine. The camera zooms in rapidly
to a green ball stuck in engine No. 3.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He has landed, and is undoing his parachute harness.  He looks
around incredulously.  The island is a junkyard - a veritable
graveyard of aircrafts.  There are many aircrafts, both old
wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere.  Skeletal
corpses are still left in some of the wrecks.  The camera pans
to the remains of one machine.  It is an old American Lockheed
Electra.  It glints dull in the half light of dawn.  Painted
on its side are two names; "Amelia Earhart" and "Fred Noonan".

The camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic
junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of
a pile of scrap.

Tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan
metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile.  The
metal arms reach the chrome rod, grip it tightly, and begin to
lift it up.

WWe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher, finally
coming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball.  The camera pulls
back to reveal that the eyeball belongs to AUSTIN GRIMALDI,
who carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his
needlenose pliers.


 AUSTIN 
                 Got it.


Satisfied that this is the piece he had lost in the machine,
he begins to re-solder it in place.  Behind him, a LITTLE
GIRL with red hair comes into the room and walks up to him.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 It's broken again, isn't it Daddy?


 AUSTIN                     (concentrating)

                 Yes dear.  But Daddy's fixing
                 it.  (hums)


 LITTLE GIRL                     (watching)

                 How come it's always breaking?


 AUSTIN 
                 I don't know, sweetheart.  Mmmmhmm.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 When it's fixed, will you make more
                 funny pictures for me?


 AUSTIN 
                 Honey, why don't you go play with
                 your toys and let Daddy finish his
                 work, okay?  Mmmm ...


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 Okay.


The LITTLE GIRL wanders around to the other side of the machine,
as AUSTIN flips a switch.  Once again the glass sphere sparkles
and the holographic screen lights up.  AUSTIN uses a tool to
fine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize;
the glass gates of Kraan.

As the image becomes clearer, the camera pulls closer and closer
to the holograph screen.


 CUT TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
The Council's voices still ringing in her head, TAARNA flies
in over the demolished gates.  Below her, the once-beautiful
city lies in ruins.

Gliding overtop the deserted streets, she sees a column of
smoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the
town's center.  As she watches the smoke rise, she pulls hard
on the reins, and heads her bird up.

The camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome
down to the Council Chambers below.

Corpses of the Councilmen are strewn everywhere.  In the
center of the room, a large pile of ancient books and
manuscripts lie smouldering.  Reaching the floor, TAARNA
dismounts and starts to look around.  At the head of
the marble table sits the ELDER - dead.  In front of him,
a roll of parchment lies on the table.  TAARNA opens it.

Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains,
their tops glowing green.

TAARNA looks at it, and puts it in her sack.  Then she notices
that the ELDER is clutching something in his hand.  Prying
his stiff fingers apart, she finds a blood-stained medallion
just like the one her attacker wore on his chain.

Looking at the dead ELDER, TAARNA grips the medallion tightly
in her hand.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL BUILDING 
TAARNA flies back out through the shattered dome and surveys
the city below.  All is quiet and dark, except for a green glow
coming from a second-floor window.  Curious, she flies over,
pulls up beside the window, and climbs in.


 CUT TO 

GIRL'S BEDROOM 
Entering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed.
The basket of fruit still sits on the floor.  From
within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.

TAARNA looks at the parchment in her sack, then at the glow
coming from the cocoon.  Cautiously, she approaches the cocoon,
sword drawn.

Suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and
shoots forward, ripping through the webbing and holding the
ball up to TAARNA's face.  The hand belongs to a hideously
ugly witch, who emerges from the cocoon, cackling through
snake-like fangs.


 WITCH 
                 Behold!  The Sphere of Uluhtec!
                 Look upon it, Taarna.  Look upon
                 it with fear.  For in its glow lies
                 the end of heaven - the beginning of
                 hell.  Take it Taarna.  Feel death
                 in your hands.  For death is upon
                 you.  And as you perish ... so dies
                 your race!


The witch's eyes go green.


 WITCH                     (screaming)

                 Take it !!


She hurls tha ball at TAARNA, who dodges it.  The ball sails
past her, out the window.  Then TAARNA, sword raised, leaps
at the WITCH, slicing through her in rapid strokes.

The WITCH cackles and crumbles into dust, but her green eyes
stay suspended in the air, and her cackle echoes through
the room.

TAARNA backs away, climbing out the window, onto her bird.  As
she flies off, she sees the WITCH'S green ball high above her,
rising into the clouds and disappearing.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
The WITCH'S green ball zooms through space, as Earth appears
in the distance.  Then another object comes into sight.  Getting
closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no
determinable nationality, soaring high above Earth.  The green
meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.

The rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes.  Slowly the
hatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of
an automobile suspended in the open hatch.

Hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from
the belly of the cruising rocketplane.  We can see now
that the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible.

With a "thunk", the metal arms release the car, and
as the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins its
free-fall to Earth.

As the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays
with the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one
way, then the other.

Once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car
radio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles
on one.

With the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to
Earth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the
atmosphere.  In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts
burning up.

As he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his
approach.  Touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking
Corvette bounces violently, every part straining at the
repeated impact.

The driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into
high gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt
to translate downward momentum into forward motion.  Then
he pops his drag chute to help slow down.

TThis accomplished, the expressionless driver releases the
chute, and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust.


 CUT TO 

EXT. THE PENTAGON - AERIAL SHOT 
From high above the building we see a crowd of reporters
and T.V. newsmen waiting on the front steps.

The '59 Corvette pulls up at the curb below, and seeing
it, the reporters all start to run over.

The camera zooms down and into the car.  Inside, the driver
reaches over, unplugs a rubber hose, and loosens the two
large hex-nuts which connect him to the car.  As he gets out,
the reporters come running up.


 FEMALE REPORTER                     (to driver)

                 Doctor Anrak, six more mutants were
                 sighted in Arizona this morning.  Do
                 you still say this has nothing to do
                 with the green radiation from space.


The driver walks on without speaking.


 T.V. NEWSMAN                     (walking alongside)

                 Doctor, is it true that the President
                 himself pulled you off the Jupiter Six
                 Project so that you could investigate
                 those mutations? Doctor, answer me that.


He ignores the question, and walks past the guard into the
Pentagon.


 CUT TO 

INT. PENTAGON - MEETING ROOM 
Around a large table sit the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of
the Cabinet, and a pretty secretary wearing a tight skirt.
An argument is in progress as the expressionless DOCTOR ANRAK
enters.  The camera follows him as he sits down next to one
of the Generals.


 FAT POLITICIAN 
                 ... well what I wanna know is,
                 what's the Army doing about this?
                 Hell!  My constiuents are turning
                 green!  They're growing arms on
                 their backs.  There's something or
                 someone up there in space and the
                 voters have a right to know about it!


 GENERAL 
                 Senator, we have no proof that these
                 mutations are the result of interference
                 from outer space.  In fact, Doctor Anrak
                 has just come in, so let's hear what he
                 has to say ... Doctor?


The room goes silent as the DOCTOR stands up.


 DOCTOR 
                 First of all, there is no cause for
                 alarm.  As for the theories of interference
                 by alien beings, it is my firm opinion that
                 we on Earth are the only intelligent,
                 technically advanced civilization present
                 in the universe.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
An enormous round spaceship the size of Pittsburg hovers
overhead.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 

 DOCTOR 
                 ... and whatever is causing these
                 mutations is not from outer space.
                 it's more likely just an isolated
                 biological pheno ... pheno ... ph ...
                 ph ... ph ...


Suddenly the DOCTOR'S head starts to jerk from side to side.
Everyone looks on, not knowing how to react.  As the DOCTOR
begins to move in short bursts, like a broken robot, he
fixes his gaze upon the pretty secretary across the table.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
From the bottom of the huge spacecraft, a metal tube emerges and
starts to drill through the roof of the Pentagon.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 
The DOCTOR starts to shake violently as he stares at the pretty
secretary.


 DOCTOR 
                 Pretty ... pretty ... p ... p ...


Suddenly he lunges at her, sliding across the table.


As the DOCTOR struggles with the terrified girl, the camera
pans up to the ceiling, where the metal tube from the spaceship
drills through.  Descending upon them, it sucks them up instantly.


 DOCTOR 
                 Aaarrgghh!


 SECRETARY 
                 Eeeeeek!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - CONTROL ROOM 
A metallic robot holding a clipboard, is standing in front of
a large glass receiving jar, as DOCTOR ANRAK comes through
the tube and lands in the jar.  As soon as the DOCTOR'S feet
hit the bottom of the jar, the DOCTOR breaks into a lot of
small metallic parts.


 ROBOT                     (Mechanical voice)

                 Oh, nice job.  How am I supposed
                 to fix this guy?  He's fucked.


ZEKE and EDSEL, two alien space-pilots, are standing nearby,
at the control console.  They look like big furry orange heads
on stilts, with arms coming out of the sider.


 ZEKE                     (to Edsel)

                 I guess we turned it up a
                 little too high.


 EDSEL                     (to Robot)

                 Sorry, man.


 ROBOT 
                 You're sorry?  What about me?
                 I've gotta put this asshole
                 back together.


Suddenly the pretty secretary comes through the tube and lands
in the jar.  She's a little mussed up, but okay.


 GLORIA 
                 (gasp)  Where am I?


 ROBOT                     (staring)

                 Hey, who's the chick?


 GLORIA 
                 Well look at my clothes!
                 Who's gonna pay for the dry
                 cleaning?  And where am I?
                 I demand that you return me
                 to my office immediately.


 ROBOT 
                 Too late - molecular instability
                 zone around spacecraft. You cannot
                 leave.


 GLORIA                     (to Zeke)

                 What?!  Is he kidding?


 ZEKE 
                 Uh ...


He looks at the ROBOT, who winks at him.


 ZEKE 
                 ... oh yeah.  Instability zone.
                 You're stuck here.


ZEKE and EDSEL try to keep straight faces.


 GLORIA                     (stunned)

                 But I have to be at my parents
                 for dinner tonight.  And my
                 gynecologist appointment is on
                 Wednesday.


 ROBOT 
                 Not anymore.  Would you, ah, like
                 a drink?
                 (leading her away)
                 You'll feel better after a glass of
                 fresh blo-aak.


They disappear down a corridor.


 GLORIA (V.O.) 
                 Do you have any diet soda?


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 

 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 Ah, typical robot.  The first
                 Earth-chick we see in ten years,
                 and he's gotta make a play for her.


EDSEL jams the gearshift into 'D' for Drive, and the ship
lifts away from Earth.


 ZEKE 
                 Hey, do we have any of that
                 Plutonian Nyborg left?


 EDSEL 
                 Uh, yeah.  Just one bag.  Uh, it's
                 in the transmitter compartment.


 ZEKE 
                 Uh, thanks man.


ZEKE opens a hatch and pulls out a double-spouted plastic
bag on wheels the size of a steamer-trunk.  It is full of
white powder.


He pours two fifteen-foot lines of powder onto the floor.
Then, he pauses.


 ZEKE                     (surveying the lines)

                 Oh great.  Think this is enough?


 EDSEL                     (thinking)

                 Uhh ... nah.  Go for broke.


 ZEKE 
                 Good thinking, man.


As he resumes pouring, ZEKE begins singing to himself in an
alien tongue.  When the lines are poured, they both stand at
the start of the trail of white powder, and part their hair
to reveal nostrils hidden in their foreheads.


 ZEKE & EDSEL 
                 Nose dive!


They both start to criss-cross the room, inhaling the white
powder like vaccuum cleaners.  As they happily snort the
Nyborg, the camera pans back to the glass receiving jar, and
moves down through the broken pieces of DOCTOR ANRAK.  Reaching
his lifeless face, the camera moves around to the back of the
head.  Through the shattered metal we can see a green ball,
glowing inside ANRAK'S skullpiece.


 DISSOLVE TO 

SPACE - ZEKE AND EDSEL'S P.O.V. 
As the round spaceship moves through space, a group of
asteroids approach and whip past.  Up ahead, a red sun
turns white and goes super-nova.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow ... good Nyborg!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - ROBOT'S BEDROOM 
GLORIA PEARLMAN and the ROBOT are lying in bed, naked.
They have just finished making love.  She is smoking a cigarette.


 GLORIA                     (glazed)

                 That was incredible.  I've never felt
                 anything like it.


 ROBOT 
                 Oh great.  I have been programmed to
                 be fully proficient in sexual activities.
                 Do you want to go steady?


 GLORIA 
                 Gee, I don't know.  I already have
                 a boyfriend.


 ROBOT 
                 Ah, what he does not know will not
                 hurt him.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, staring wide-eyed
out into space.  They are obviously stoned.  Suddenly a bell
rings and the communicator screen lights up.  A serious officer's
face appears on it.


 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...


ZEKE looks over at the screen and then shouts into it.


 ZEKE 
                 Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling Starcruiser Alpha ...


 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 You gotta use the microphone.


 ZEKE 
                 Oh yeah.
                 (shouts into microphone)
                 Whaddyawant man?


 OFFICER 
                 Now listen, idiot.  Do I have to
                 tell you eight hundred times?  You
                 don't call me "man"!  You call me
                 "Com-Op Officer Blix". Now is that
                 perfectly clear?


 ZEKE                     (into mike)

                 Yeah, sure.  Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER                     (disgruntled)

                 You are to return immediately to
                 the Mother Ship and pick up a
                 humanoid civilian.  Your orders
                 are to escort him to the Interplanetary
                 Tribunal Courtroom so that he can testify
                 at the trial of Lincoln Sternn.  And make
                 it snappy!


The screen goes blank.


 EDSEL 
                 Wow!  They finally got Sternn.


 ZEKE 
                 It's about time.  Hang on, man.
                 Here we go.


ZEKE jams the gearshift into hyper-drive.

enormous mother-ship.


 CUT TO

An ashtray full of roaches sits on the console.  ZEKE is
at the controls with a joint in his mouth.  He is swaying
back and forth, eyes glazed.  Beside him, EDSEL watches
the mothership getting closer.


 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

Huge red arrows point the way through the ten-mile wide

                 man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 It's okay, man.  If there's one
                 thing I know, it's how to drive
                 when I'm stoned.  It's like, you
                 know your perspective's fucked,
                 so you just gotta let your hands
                 work the controls as if you're
                 straight.


The round ship rams directly into a wall, and crashes down,
skidding to a stop in front of the loading bay.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow, good landing, man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 Thanks.


 CUT TO

ZEKE and EDSEL press a button to open the hatch doors.
As the door opens we see two metallic Regolian guards
waiting on the other side.  Between them stands a small,
shabbily-dressed humanoid with a crooked jaw and
cauliflower ears.  This is HANOVER FISTE.


 REGOLIAN GUARD                     (to Zeke and Edsel)

                 Sternn's trial?


FISTE nods.


 ZEKE 
                 They gotta give him at least, like,
                 life.


 FISTE 
                 Lincoln Sternn is a kind and honourable
                 man.
                 (camera pulls close to Fiste's face)
                 He will be freed.

As the round spaceship journeys through space it passes through
a fantastic space-scape of disembodied rock statues, and past
a magnificent graffiti-covered robot chained to an asteroid.

GLORIA is getting dressed as the ROBOT re-charges his energy-
paks.


 ROBOT

                 laugh together.  We care for each
                 other.  We have highly proficient
                 sex.  Why can't we get married?


 GLORIA

CONTROL ROOM 
The hatch opens, and GLORIA and the ROBOT walk through,
still talking.


 GLORIA 
                 ... but mixed marriages just don't
                 work.  What if you get tired of me
                 and run off with a vibrator or
                 something?


As they move through the room, and out the other side, they
pass FISTE, who is sitting quietly near the receiving jar,
hands folded.  Looking around, FISTE notices a green glow
coming from the bottom of the jar.  He gets up, quietly opens
the jar, and pokes through the scrap robot parts.

Finding the small green ball in ANRAK'S head, he pulls it
out and looks at it.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, driving carefully.
FISTE, carrying the green ball, comes up and sits down beside

                 a louie here.


 EDSEL                     (to Fiste)

                 Yeah, well it won't be long now.  Are
                 you sure you're gonna testify for Sternn.


FISTE says nothing.  He just clutches the green ball and stares
into space.

ZEKE and EDSEL look at each other and shrug.

SPACE-STATION LANDING DOCK 
The ship locks into the dock, and the exit hatch opens.
GLORIA and the ROBOT come through first, ahead of ZEKE, EDSEL,

 GLORIA 
                 ... alright, alright.  I'll marry
                 you - but on one condition ... I
                 want a Jewish wedding.


 ROBOT 
                 A Jewish wedding!?!!!  But this is
                 space.  95% of the population are
                 robots.


 GLORIA 
                 Well, find me a robot-rabbi!


 ROBOT 
                 Okay, okay!


 EDSEL 
                 I give them six months, man.


 ZEKE 
                 He doesn't even look Jewish!


GLORIA and the ROBOT disappear around a corner as ZEKE and EDSEL
escort FISTE through the hatch.  FISTE is carrying the small
green ball.

As they lead FISTE away, the camera pulls back, out through
a space-port, and moves along the outside of the slowly
rotating space-station.  At the top, the camera zooms down
through a massive glass-domed ceiling and into a huge
inter-galactic courtroom.

Voices echo below us.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?


 STERNN 
                 I am.


As we move down, we see square-jawed CAPTAIN STERNN, his
shifty-eyed lawyer, and the cold Prosecutor all standing
before the Judge.

STERNN is smirking confidently as the Prosecutor reads from
a long page of charges.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Lincoln Sternn - you stand here
                 accused of twelve counts of murder
                 in the first degree  ... fourteen
                 counts of armed theft of Federation
                 property ...


 CUT TO

The hostile humanoid and alien faces all stare at STERNN with
hateful, accusing eyes.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... twenty-two counts of piracy
                 in high space ... eighteen counts of
                 fraud ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN'S LAWYER 
Mopping his brow, he looks nervously over to STERNN.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... thirty-seven counts of rape, and
                 one moving violation.  How do you plead?


 CUT TO 

CAPTAIN STERNN 
Smiling to himself, he nods, then gets serious.


 STERNN 
                 Not guilty!


 LAWYER                     (whispers to Sternn)

                 Not guilty?!?  Are you nuts?!?


 STERNN                     (whispers to lawyer)

                 It's okay, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


 JUDGE                     (to Prosecutor)

                 Call the first witness!


STERNN and his lawyer move to their seats.


 LAWYER                     (to Sternn)

                 But the Prosecutor's gotcha cold!
                 Yer as guilty as a cat in a goldfish
                 bowl.


 CUT TO 

THE COURTROOM DOORS 
ZEKE and EDSEL enter with FISTE, and push their way to the
front.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 The Prosecution calls Hanover Fiste.


 GUARD #1 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #2 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #3 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #4 
                 Hanover Fiste!


ZEKE and EDSEL sit down, while HANOVER FISTE, small and
shabby, walks up to the witness stand, nervously clutching
the small green ball in his hand.  As he passes, STERNN and
his lawyer continue to argue.


 LAWYER                     (pleading)

                 Lissen Sternn ... change the plea
                 to guilty.  Throw yerself on the
                 mercy of the court.


 STERNN 
                 I told you, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


HANOVER FISTE is sworn in, as Sternn's lawyer begs.


 LAWYER 
                 But the most we can hope for is to
                 get ya buried in secrecy so yer grave
                 don't get violated!  Plead guilty!


 STERNN 
                 Shut up, Charlie.  I got an angle.


 LAWYER 
                 What angle?


 STERNN                     (pointing to Fiste)

                 Him!


 CUT TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 PROSECUTOR 
                 State your name for the record.


 FISTE                     (fidgeting nervously with
                     the green ball)

                 I am Hanover Fiste.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 

 STERNN                     (winking to lawyer)

                 I promised him thirty-five thousand
                 zuleks to testify on my behalf.


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 PROSECUTOR 
                 You know the defendant,
                 (pointing)
                 Captain Sternn?


 FISTE 
                 Yes, I know Captain Sternn.  And
                 never did there live a kinder, more
                 generous man.  He is an overflowing
                 cup, filled with the very cream of
                 human goodness ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 

 STERNN                     (to lawyer)

                 See?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE 
                 ... in all the time I've known him,
                 he's never done anything immoral ...
                 (thinking)
                 unless maybe the Pre-Schooler's
                 Prostitute ring ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 
They look at each other, shocked.


 STERNN & LAWYER 
                 Huh?!?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE                     (speaking gently)

                 ... and he's ah, never done anything
                 illegal ...
                 (turning sharply)
                 ... unless you count all the times
                 he sold dope disguised as a nun!!
                 (reverting to meekness)
                 He's always been a good, law-abiding
                 citizen ...
                 (shouting at himself)
                 Awww, gimme a break!!
                 (gentle again)
                 ... of the Federation, and, and ...
                 (going schizo)
                 Shut Up!  Shut Up!  Shut Up!
                 (gentle, but starting to sweat)
                 ... a community-concious individual, ah, ah ...
                 (rising in crazed anger)
 STERNN!!!                  (pointing as he screams)
                 He's nothin' but a low-down, double-dealin',
                 back-stabbin', larcenous, perverted worm!!


STERNN and his lawyer look on, horrified, as FISTE'S body
starts to grow.


 FISTE 
                 Hangin's too good for him!!


New muscles tear through FISTE'S shabby clothes.


 FISTE 
                 Burnin's too good for him!!


Growing larger, he starts foaming at the mouth.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 He should be torn into little bitsy
                 pieces and buried alive!!!


FISTE rams his hands down onto the Witness Stand, shattering
it completely.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll kill him!


He hurls the Prosecutor aside, and moves towards STERNN with
thundering footsteps.


 FISTE 
 KII - ILLL!!! 

Still growing, he rips apart the Judge's bench as he passes
it.  Finally  he stands towering in rage over the terrified
STERNN. 

 STERNN                     (to Fiste)

                 H-h-hey, Hanover ...
                 n-now take it easy, Hanover,
                 I'm sure we can talk this ov ...


Instinctively, STERNN leaps back as FISTE'S giant hands come
smashing down in the spot where STERNN stood.  The gallery
scatters screaming as STERNN runs for the door.  Slavering,
FISTE thunders after him.  STERNN runs through the exit,
bolting the door behind him.  FISTE follows, tearing the
door apart, and bringing the entire courtroom wall down in
the process.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
Running down a hallway, STERNN passes a group of Regolian
cops, who raise their weapons in an attempt to block the
rampaging FISTE.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 Halt, clik, in the name of the
                 Federation, clik.  Where is your
                 corridor pass?
                 (to other Regolians)
                 Unco-operative humanoid, clik,
                 blast him.


They open fire, but FISTE is unstoppable.  Still growing,
he grabs the Regolians's weapons, crunches them up and eats
them.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 You are now in violation of Code
                 103-N-17, clik, paragraph A-64 ...
                 unauthorized consumption of Federation
                 property.  Please come quietly, clik,
                 ... thenk yew.


With a single clap of his enormous hands, FISTE crushes the
Regolian's metal skulls together into an accordian the thickness
of a dime.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
He races through a metallic hallway, and ducks into a boiler
room, then down a long dark tunnel.  At the end of the tunnel,
STERNN comes to a dead-end, and stops to rest.


 STERNN 
                 Oh, this looks good.


 FISTE 
                 (growls)


 STERNN 
                 Oh, duck under here ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll get you!!


 STERNN 
                 I think I'll turn here!
                 (runs, gasping)
                 Come on feet, don't fail me now!


 FISTE 
                 Sternn!!!


 STERNN 
                 Uh oh ...
                 (runs)
                 Ah, gasp, ah whew, lost him!


 FISTE 
 STERNN!! 

 STERNN 
                 Okay, Hanover, you've had this
                 coming!


Taking a deep breath, STERNN reaches into his pocket, pulls
out a wad of bills, and counts them out as he hands them to
FISTE. 

 STERNN 
                 Let's see, thirty-three, thirty-
                 four, thirty-five thousand zuleks.
                 Thanks Hanover.


 FISTE                     (taking money)

                 S'nothin, boss.


Counting his money, FISTE starts shrinking back to his
normal size.


 STERNN 
                 And Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 Yes?


 STERNN 
                 Goodbye.


STERNN pulls a lever, which opens up the floor below FISTE,
who screams, falling out into space.  As FISTE slides out,
STERNN grabs the money from FISTE'S hand and smiles.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
All is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and
barren desert.  The silence is broken by a whistling sound which
gets louder and louder.  Then, thud!

A green ball lands in the dirt in front of us.  Fluttering down
around it are HANOVER FISTE'S tattered clothes.  Then the
burnt ashes of Hanover's body land in a small pile beside his
clothes.  Panning up we see TAARNA flying on her bird in the
distance.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA 
She swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and
cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station.
Then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting
floor, and enters a magnificent  secret hideaway cut deep into
the rock.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE TAARNA'S HIDEAWAY 
Landing her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble, TAARNA
dismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool.  Here she disrobes,
and picking up a small gold pitcher, she pours an ancient oil
over herself.  It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin.
Then she steps into the water, where her body seems to sparkle
even brighter.

Finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone
wall.  When she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveal
a gold chest.  TAARNA opens it.

Inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments,
so bright that TAARNA must shield her eyes for a moment.  Then,
as she looks down at the armour, the voice of TAARAK THE
DEFENDER comes into her head.


 TAARAK (V.O.) 
                 To defend - this is the Pact.
                 but when life loses its value,
                 and it taken for nought, then
                 the Pact is ... to avenge!!


Through a series of dissolves we see TAARNA'S hands sensuously
fitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body.  Finally
we pull back to see her fully.

Standing before us, glistening in the torch-light, she looks
magnificent.  Reaching once more into the chest, TAARNA pulls
out a golden sword.  As she holds it, it seems to vibrate,
almost buzzing in her hands.  Suddenly she swings it, slicing
cleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall.  As
the burning torch falls to the ground, TAARNA leaves.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
From over our heads, TAARNA comes soaring past, her armour
gleaming in the rays of the setting sun.  Below her, she
sees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers.
Drunken blue men fight in the streets, strange animals run
around loose, and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters.

Looking down, amidst the melee, she sees three winged creatures
tied up in front of a bar.  The camera zooms in on one of the
creature's saddlebags.  It has a silver medallion set into the
leather, identical to the one which TAARNA pried from the
Elder's fingers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE BARROOM 
Barbarian honky-tonk music fills the crowded room, as
various barbarian soldiers sit drinking and fondling the
bar-girls who are dressed in cheap, flashy metal outfits.

Three of the blue barbarians are particularly drunk and
rowdy as they push a non-barbarian down, dump a drink on his
head, laugh and kick him.


 CUT TO 

THE BARROOM DOOR 
TAARNA walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass
doors, past the three soldiers kicking their victim.  She sits
down at the bar.

The three brutish blue soldiers finish stomping the man and
walk over to the bar, crowding close around TAARNA.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 Hey, look.  A new one.
                 (to Taarna)
                 Where you from, baby?


TAARNA ignores him.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Doesn't talk much, does she ?


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 She doesn't have to talk for what
                 I want to do with her.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S HAND 
It slowly moves down to her sword, and unclips the safety strap.

 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARBARIANS 

 BARBARIAN #3 
                 (running his hand across her breastplate)
                 C'mon baby, let's see what's under there.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 (starting to undo her breastplate)
                 Yeah, let's have a look.


Taarna slowly stands up, pushing their hands away, and takes
a step back.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Heey, she's tough.


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 Maybe she wants to fight?


They all laugh.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 ... or maybe she wants to take
                 us all on?


Still laughing, they move towards her.

In a blinding flash, TAARNA draws her golden sword, and wielding
it like a Samurai master, slices off all three of their heads.
In an instant, the sword is back in its sheath.

The barbarian's heads stop laughing as they fall to the ground.
The music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at TAARNA.

Stepping over the bodies, TAARNA walks up to the bartender,
pulls out the parchment picture of the glowing mountains, and
shows it to him.  The bartender looks at it carefully, then
points out the window.


 BARTENDER 
                 Beyond the oasis.


TAARNA nods and leaves.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARTENDER 
His eyes start to turn green.  The camera gets closer and
closer to his glowing eyes, until the green glow turns into
the image of a ball, lying in the ground, in AUSTIN'S holograph.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN 
AUSTIN is crouched over the machine turning several knobs,
trying to make the ball move.  Nothing happens.


 AUSTIN                     (to himself)

                 Hmmm ... must be jammed.


Frustrated, AUSTIN picks up a flashlight, opens up a compartment
underneath the control knobs, and takes a look inside.  While
AUSTIN fiddles inside the machine, we see two hands appear on
the holograph screen and pick up the green ball.  AUSTIN looks
over to the holograph and notices.


 AUSTIN 
                 Where'd it go?


 CUT TO 

THE HANDS

As the hands cradle the green ball, the camera pulls back
to reveal a skinny, unco-ordinated boy wearing thick eyeglasses,
carrying the sphere across his backyard.  This is DAN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It all started when I found the green
                 meteorite.  I read in Farraday's "Life
                 of the Planets" that smaller ones like
                 this are supposed to burn up when they
                 enter the atmosphere, but for some reason
                 this one didn't ...


DAN carries the ball into a typical small-town house.


 DISSOLVE TO 

T.V. ANTENNA ON ROOF - STORMY NIGHT

As the narration continues, we follow two red wires down
from the T.V. antenna, along the roof, and into DAN'S attic
window.  The wires run through a bucket of water and are hooked
up to some electronic parts on DAN'S desk.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... so I brought it up to my room,
                 stuck it in my rock collection and
                 forgot about it.  I was experimenting
                 with natural electricity ...


The camera pans around the room to show various displays of
DAN'S scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects,
transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal
organs, and many books.

In the corner, the green ball sits in DAN'S rock collection.

At his desk, DAN impatiently shuffles through the dusty pages
of an old scientific journal.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... and with the storm warnings up,
                 I figured maybe tonight I'd hit the
                 jackpot.  All I needed was a little
                 juice.


He looks out the window at the gathering storm.


 CUT TO 

THE STORM 
Crackling from the sky, a bolt of lightning strikes the
television antenna and surges along the wires into the attic.


 CUT TO 

DAN'S ATTIC ROOM 
The lightning flashes into DAN'S apparatus, lighting it up
brightly.


 DAN 
                 It works!


Suddenly, an electric arc jumps from the bucket of water
and crosses the room to join with thw ball on his shelf.
Caught in the middle, DAN begins to glow green.


 DAN                     (looking at his
                     green arms)

                 Oh Jesus!


The electrical field opens up a shimmering gateway into another
universe and DAN de-materializes.


 CUT TO 

THE TRANSFORMATION 
We float in darkness for a moment as black shapeless images
zoom past.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I felt like I was nothing
                 - just atoms floating in the
                 darkness ...


Then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner
of the screen. The glow gets brighter and starts moving slowly
around the screen.  Now, we can make out some of the images
whipping past - a half-formed hand, pages of a book, a crumbling
pyramid, a green ball.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Then, a body started to re-form
                 around me.  Only it wasn't my
                 body - this one had muscles.


Sturdy muscular parts begin to materialize around the moving
light.  They join up with each other to form a powerfully built
human figure.

Finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything
gets brighter and clearer.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It was a great body, but I
                 wasn't too crazy about the
                 face.


The powerful figure, DEN, turns slowly as he floats and begins
to look at his hands and arms.  Moving his mouth, he speaks in
a new voice - deep and powerful.


 DEN                     (feeling head)

                 Hmmm ... no hair.


Suddenly, the background explodes into fields of radiant colours
as the body accelerates away from us and passes through a second
shimmering gateway.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
DEN, strong, masculine and hairless, materializes cradled in
the hand of a huge stone idol.  He is naked and unconscious
Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the idol's other
hand.

The camera pulls back to show that the idol is standing on the
deck, stop a huge, truncated pyramid.  The deck forms a walkway
around a swirling pool of green water.

Kneeling all around the seething pool, are lizard-men, wearing
priest's robes.  Two of them stand beside a glass coffin.  Inside
the coffin, lies a naked girl, bound and gagged.


 PRIESTS                     (chanting softly)

                 Uluhtec, Ulutec ...


Directly in fron of the idol, a regal-looking QUEEN, wearing
a revealing velvet cloak, is praying to the raging water.


 QUEEN 
                 By the powers of the glowing
                 Loc-Nar placed in your idol's
                 hand, I demand you come forth,
                 Uluhtec!


The waters of the sacrifical pool rage more violently and
a low rumble is heard far below.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S HANDS

The green ball, (Loc-Nar), glows brightly as DEN opens his eyes,
looks down and notices his enormous genitals.


 DEN 
                 Hmmm ... big!


Seeing an animal-skin hanging from the idol, he rips off a
piece and wraps it around himself.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was no way I was gonna
                 walk around this place with
                 my dork hangin' out!


Suitably covered, he surveys the ritual taking place below him.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This looked like something
                 right out of the Ten Commandments.


 CUT TO 

EDGE OF RAGING POOL

The QUEEN is kneeling before the seething water.


 QUEEN 
                 Grant me your strength in return
                 for a living mortal sacrifice!  It
                 has been ordained.  Come forth Uluhtec!
                 I demand it!


Two lizard priests remove the terrified girl from the glass
case and hold her out over the swirling water.  The QUEEN
nods and the two priests drop her in.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S WATER 
Seeing the girl struggle in the water, DEN'S eyes grow wide.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 What'd they do that for?


He stands and dives into the raging pool, swimming powerfully
towards the drowning girl.

 CUT TO 
UNDER WATER 
Reaching her, DEN grabs the girl's  bound ankles, hooks them
over his head and drags her through a decayed hole in the
underwater wall.  Inside a stone tunnel, they are swept along
by the current.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Normally, I'd be dead by now.  I
                 kept thinking I was going to run
                 out of air, but my new body worked
                 great.  I just hoped her body was
                 working as good as mine.


 CUT TO 

EXT. FIELD OF LILIES - DAY 
DEN and the girl are washed out into a pond at the center of
a beautiful field of lilies.  He pulls her out of the water,
unconscious.  As he unties her, she begins to stir.


 GIRL 
                 Thank you.


She takes DEN'S hand and lies back in the flower, her
beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 She had the most beautiful eyes.
                 I wanted to make some conversation
                 but I found my new self asking the
                 same old stupid questions.


 DEN 
                 Are you from around here?


 GIRL 
                 Well, you may not believe this, but
                 I'm from another world - from a place
                 called Earth.


 DEN 
                 Earth?  I too am from Earth.
                 How did you get here?


 GIRL 
                 My name is Katherine Wells, and
                 I'm from the British colony of
                 Gibraltar.  Time makes no diff-
                 erence here, but there it was
                 the summer of 1892.  It was
                 evening - I'd gone for a walk on
                 the cliffs when suddenly a sphere
                 fell from the sky.  Following its
                 glow, I came to a shining gate made
                 out of light.  Unable to resist, I
                 stepped through it and awoke in
                 this world.  There I was thin and
                 weakly, fit only to stay indoors.
                 (she stands up)
                 But here, somehow I am stronger,
                 more alive,
                 (she stretches seductively)
                 ... more fully a woman.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 You're not kidding.


 DEN                     (standing)

                 I, too seem better equipped on
                 this world.
                 (he holds out his arm)
                 My arms are more powerful.
                 (strecthes his fingers)
                 Even my fingers seem to hold
                 great strength.


KATHERINE walks up close to DEN, takes his hand and touches
the fingers to her breast.


 KATHERINE 
                 You saved my life.  I have no
                 reward to give you, but if any
                 part of me pleases your senses
                 - I would give it willingly.


She circles her nipple with his baby finger.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This was great!  There was
                 no way I'd get a chick like this
                 back on Earth.  I mean, look at
                 her!!


Taking KATHERINE in his arms, DEN lays her down on a bed of
flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was only one problem ...


A spiked boot appears in the frame.  The camera pans up to
show a large, ugly hairy beast-man standing over DEN and
KATHERINE. 
The camera then pulls back to reveal the entwined couple,
completely surrounded by a horde of grim, bestial warriors.


 DAN (V.O. 
                 I don't know who these jerks
                 were, but they sure picked a
                 bad time to show up ...


The ugly beast-men grab DEN and KATHERINE as we;


 DISSOLVE TO 

ARD'S THRONE ROOM 
The beast-Captain keeps his machine gun trained on DEN as
the soldiers lead him into the cavernous room.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They split us up and took me to
                 this weird castle-type place.
                 I wanted to find out where they'd
                 taken Katherine, but none of these
                 guys seemed to speak English.


In the middle of the room there is a round stone pedestal
with a throne carved into it.  On the throne sits ARD, a
child-like ruler with a sadistic glint in his eye.


 ARD 
                 They tell me you are Den of Earth,
                 the one who dared to steal the
                 female sacrifice from the Queen.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy was a shrimp so I figured
                 I'd play it tough.


 DEN 
                 Where is the girl?


 ARD 
                 I am Ard - supreme leader of
                 the revolution and the next
                 ruler of the world.


 DEN                     (tougher)

                 The girl!!


 ARD 
                 Well, aren't we fierce?
                 If you are truly as tough as
                 you seem, then you will serve
                 me well.  But first, a test.
                 Guards!  Castrate him!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


Two bestial guards approach from behind, brandishing curved
short-swords.  DEN turns instinctively, dodges the first thrust
and delivers a bone-shattering elbow to the beast's head,
crushing his skull.

Spinning with his own momentum, DEN throws a rock-hard fist
into the second guard's chest, snapping his rib-cage and
sending him flying across the room.

Without pausing, the bald muscleman grabs the nearby beast-
Captain and lifts him into the air by his machine-gun.  The
Captain hangs on as DEN twists the gun, butts it into the
creature's groin and then drives the weapon through the
Captain's jaw.

The creature crumples, leaving DEN with the gun.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy!  I was pretty good at this
                 stuff.


 ARD 
                 Excellent.  You are worthy to
                 serve me.


 DEN                     (aiming machine-gun at him)

                 Give me the girl or die.


 ARD                     (taking it lightly)

                 Well, if I have a choice, I'll
                 take death.


 DEN 
                 So be it.


DEN fires, spraying a row of bullets across ARD'S body.  The
bullets blast big yellow holes in ARD'S chest, but there is
no blood.  ARD looks up and laughs.


 ARD 
                 Ha ha ha!  You'll have to
                 do better than that.


As DEN looks on, ARD'S wounds miraculously close up and heal
themselves over.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I could see why they made this
                 guy their leader.


 ARD                     (standing up)

                 ... but if you're really interested
                 in the girl; I've had her encased in
                 glass.


ARD pulls the velvet covering off of a glass box to reveal
KATHERINE, unconscious, sealed inside.


 DEN 
                 She's dead.


 ARD 
                 Actually no.  She's sleeping,
                 but only I can awaken her.


 DEN 
                 What do you want of me?


 ARD 
                 I want you to steal the sacred
                 Loc-Nar.


 DEN 
                 What is this Loc-Nar?


 ARD 
                 The Queen's glowing sphere, you
                 fool.  The sacrifice to Uluhtec
                 can only be performed by the
                 possessor of the sacret Loc-Nar.
                 (calling out)
                 Norl!


NORL, a huge gorilla-man, in a purple cloak, steps forward.


 ARD                     (to Den)

                 This is Norl, my bravest warrior.
                 You will go with him to the Queen's
                 castle and steal the Loc-Nar.  Then
                 I will give you the girl.


 DEN 
                 And if I refuse?


 ARD 
                 If you refuse, you die, she dies,
                 everybody dies.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Sounded reasonable to me.


DEN looks down at KATHERINE'S motionless body.


 DISSOLVE TO 

RIVER BANKS NEAR THE QUEEN'S CASTLE 
In the moonlight, DEN and NORL lead a squad of beast-warriors,
armed with automatic weapons, along the river towards the Queen's
castle.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Ssh.  Guard post ahead.  We
                 must go underground.


NORL lifts a rock to reveal an underground passageway.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy Norl seemed to know what
                 he was doing.  And, for a gorilla,
                 his English wasn't half bad.


DEN and the warriors enter the underground passage.


 CUT TO 

UNDERGROUND TUNNEL 
The group, carrying torches, moves along the dark tunnel.  They
pass a bubble-window with shark-faced eels swimming on the other
side.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 We're underneath the castle moat.


DEN nods.  An ugly growl echoes through the tunnel up ahead.
the warriors freeze and murmur to each other in their own
languages.


 DEN                     (to Norl)

                 What are they saying?


 NORL 
                 They talk of the savage beast who
                 prowls these catacombs with a fierce
                 hunger and sharp teeth ...
                 (gestures)
                 six inches long.


A dog-faced warrior shakes his head and says something to NORL.


 NORL 
                 Sorry ...
                 (indicating)
                 ... sixteen inches long.


Suddenly, a savage beast appears and chomps his long, razor-sharp
teeth into one of the warriors at the end of the line.  DEN, NORL,
and the remaining warriors run on through the tunnel as, behind
them, the monster pulls his victim apart.


 CUT TO 

DOORWAY IN CATACOMBS 
DEN, NORL, and the remaining warriors arrive at a door in the
rock wall.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Now we separate.  You and Korg
                 take this door into the Queen's
                 quarters.    The rest of us will
                 move through the walls and enter
                 her chamber from the other side.
                 Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first will
                 return it to Ard.  Good luck, Den.


DEN nods, puts out his torch and carefully opens the door as
NORL moves off.


 CUT TO 

DARK ROOM 
DEN and KORG silently enter.  Across the dark room, the
glow of the green ball casts a pale light.


 KORG                     (whispers and points)

                 Loc-Nar.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  It was just like the
                 ball I dug up in my back yard.


They tip-toe towards it.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow I
                 had this real funny feeling.  All
                 by themselves, my hands reached
                 forward to touch it.  But the
                 Loc-Nar moved out of the way.
                 Instead, my hands felt something
                 else - warm flesh.  Then the lights
                 came on.


In the brightly lit room, DEN is standing before the beautiful
semi-clad QUEEN, and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands.
Looking around, he sees that he and KONG are surrounded by a
brigade of the Queen's ugly guards, swords raised.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Talk about embarassing!


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Kill them.


The Queen's guards attack with battle-axes, clubs and swords.
As DEN knees one in the groin and swings his gun into another's
face, four of the guards surround KORG and club his brains out.

But DEN, still going strong, throws two guards into the wall
and heaves a third out the window.  As the QUEEN watches with
glee, more guards rush into the room and DEN is finally over-
powered and held down.  The Captain of the guards places a long
knife against Den's throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Can I slit his throat, your
                 Majesty?


The QUEEN, eyeing Den's magnificent body, sighs.


 QUEEN 
                 Yes, slit his throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Thank you, your Majesty.


As the Captain presses his knife against Den's flesh, the
QUEEN suddenly raises her hand.


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Stop!  I have, ah, something better
                 in mind.


She takes Den's hand and leads him into an adjoining room, as
the guards grumble to one another.


 GUARD #1 
                 Jeez, not again.


 GUARD #2 
                 This always happens.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Look, she's the Queen.  She
                 can do whatever she wants.


 GUARD #2 
                 Yeah, sure.


 GUARD #1 
                 Sure.


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN'S BOUDOIR 
The QUEEN stands before DEN, hands on her hips and a funny look
in her eye.


 QUEEN 
                 If you please me, I may let
                 you live.


She smiles, and approaches DEN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


 DEN 
                 What must I do?


 QUEEN 
                 Satisfy my appetites.


The QUEEN lets her cloak drop to the floor as she gets closer.
She is naked underneath.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  Eighteen years of nuthin'
                 and now, twice in one day.  What
                 a place!


 QUEEN 
                 Come with me.


 DEN 
                 Mmmm.


She steps forward and takes his hand, leading him towards the
bed.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE QUEEN'S BED 
DEN and the QUEEN are lying undressed on the enormous bed.
The QUEEN has a very contented look on her face.  DEN looks
exhausted.  As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber
window, the QUEEN slowly runs her hand over DEN'S bulging
muscles.


 QUEEN                     (softly)

                 The rising moon climaxes our
                 love, Den.  Is is a sign, a
                 new beginning.


 DEN 
                 Yes, a sign.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I had no idea what she was
                 talking about.


 QUEEN                     (stroking him)

                 Neverwhere is a troubled land,
                 but together we could calm it.
                 We could rule side by side.
                 Your strength has brought great
                 peace to my restless body.  It
                 could bring great peace to all
                 the troubled people of this land.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I knew I was good, but I didn't know
                 I was that good.


Suddenly the Captain and his guards burst through the door.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Your Majesty!  The Loc-Nar is missing
                 - stolen!


The QUEEN jumps to her feet in a rage and points to DEN.


 QUEEN                     (screaming)

                 Fiend!  You make love to me while
                 your accomplices steal the magic
                 sphere!  Guards!  Take him!


The guards grab DEN as the  QUEEN snatches one of their big
spiked clubs.


 QUEEN                     (to guards)

                 Hold him still!  I will kill
                 him myself!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy, was she pissed off!


Heaving the guards aside, DEN breaks free and jumps out the
chamber window.


 CUT TO 

THE CASTLE WALL 
DEN falls down, down into the swirling waters of the castle
moat.


 (CUT TO) 

THE QUEEN 
She is livid.


 QUEEN 
                 Prepare the flying lizards.
                 I want his head!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE CASTLE 
Pulling himself out of the moat, DEN knocks a guard off his
leopard/horse and rides off.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is kneeling at the edge of the sacrificial pool.  Beside
him sits a long glass case wrapped in chains.  Through the
chains we see KATHERINE trapped inside - fully conscious and
terrified.  Ard's bestial warriors stand all around carrying
torches and spears.

Above them, the Loc-Nar sits glowing in the stone idol's hand.


 ARD 
                 By the power of the magic Loc-Nar
                 placed in your idol's hands, I
                 command you - come forth Uluhtec!


The green water in the pool immediately begins to churn
violently and leap into the air.  A bolt of lightning
crackles in the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
DEN is racing across the barren desert on his leopard/horse.
Visible in the distance is the outline of the huge, truncated
pyramid where he first saved KATHERINE.

As he rides, he sees the green glow of the Loc-Nar, sparkling
in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it.


 DEN                     (to himself)

                 Katherine!


He spurs his leopard/horse on into the night.


 CUT TO 

ANOTHER PART OF THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
The QUEEN, riding a flying lizard, leads her army in pursuit
of DEN.


 SOLDIER                     (pointing)

                 There he is, your Majesty!


 CUT TO 

QUEEN'S P.O.V. 
Up ahead, silhouetted in the moonlight, she sees DEN, riding up
the steps of the pyramid.  The camera pans to the green glow
atop the torch-lit pyramid.


 QUEEN (V.O.) 
                 The Loc-Nar!


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN 

 QUEEN                     (shouting to her men)

                 Faster!  To the pyramid!


She whips her lizard harder.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is incanting to the raging water while two hooded monks
stand beside him, holding the struggling KATHERINE out over
the pool.


 ARD 
                 Here is your sacrifice, Uluhtec.
                 Now, give me your power!
                 (to monks)
                 Throw her in.


Chanting the name "Uluhtec", the two monks start to throw
the girl in when suddenly a third monk leaps forward and
grabs her, kicking the other two monks into the water.

The intruder's hood falls away and his bald head gleams in the
moonlight.


 DEN 
                 Katherine!


 KATHERINE 
                 Den!


 ARD 
                 No!  You'll ruin everything!


ARD jumps up and runs toward the Loc-Nar, perched in the stone
idol's hand.  Grabbing it, ARD holds the glowing ball above him.


 ARD                     (to his guards)

                 Kill them!  Kill them both!


Suddenly, a hand leaps out of the darkness, gripping the
Loc-Nar just above Ard's hand - it is the QUEEN.


 QUEEN 
                 The Loc-Nar is mine!


 ARD                     (struggling)

                 Stupid bitch!  Get away from me!


As ARD and the QUEEN fight over the Loc-Nar, the Queen's troops
pour in and battle with Ard's soldiers.  Thunder roars overhead.


 CUT TO 

DEN 
Holding KATHERINE in one arm, DEN smashes a nearby soldier and
grabs the beast's spear.  With the battle raging all around
him, DEN looks up at the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
Lightning crackles, illuminating the night with electricity.


 CUT BACK TO 

DEN 
DEN reaches down, picks up the long chain that was wrapped around
the glass case and attaches one end to his spear.  He kicks the
other end into the raging water, then heaves the spear
with all his might into the head of the stone idol.

In the same instant, a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky,
striking the idol full force.  The lightning bolt travels through
the spear and down the chain, into the water.  Suddenly, the
electrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar.

Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green,
then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp.  The
troops stop fighting and look on in amazement, until all
that remains is the glowing Loc-Nar, hanging in mid-air.


 KATHERINE                     (to Den)

                 Where did they go?


 DEN 
                 They are gone.  That is all
                 that matters.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They probably went back to Earth.
                 Boy, will Mom be surprised.


Suddenly, the Loc-Nar falls to the ground at Den's feet.


 KATHERINE                     (looking down)

                 The Loc-Nar ... you could have the
                 power of Uluhtec.  You could be
                 ruler over all these people.


 DEN                     (looking over the throng)

                 Forget it.


In a single powerful leap, DEN, carrying KATHERINE, bounds up
onto the Queen's flying lizard and they fly off.  The amazed troops
watch for a moment, then shrug and resume fighting.


 CUT TO 

DEN'S FLYING LIZARD 
KATHERINE clings to DEN as they fly.


 KATHERINE 
                 Oh, but Den, with the Loc-Nar
                 you could have returned to Earth.


 DEN 
                 I like it better here.


The lizard banks sharply away from us and carries them into the
distance.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 On Earth, I'm nobody.  But here,
                 I am DEN.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
The camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere,
which lies abandoned on the ground.  The soldiers are gone.  As
we watch, time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramid
ages and crumbles all around the green ball.  The earth heaves
and shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in
the ground.

A prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern.
Fascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of a
Tyrannosaurus Rex comes down, crushing him.

Time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, and
a Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball.  In the
fire-light, the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals,
when one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowing
ball.  Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes.
Out of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen.

Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple,
placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol.  Then the
Romans grow fat and debauched, while slave-girls feed them grapes.
As the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauched
Romans, covering them and the green ball in rubble.

Over the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud and
clay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medieval
village.

A Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in with
his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village.
Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself
a drink.  Behind him, an  ox-cart comes roaring around a corner.
The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking
the stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well.

Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and
transforms into a Victorian-style town.  It is evening, and
the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas-
lit village green.

A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and
circles the green.

Moving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive-
looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace.  This
is intercut with the carriage circling the green, until the
woman, who looks like a high-class harlot, finishes dressing and
leaves her room.  Crossing the street, she walks up to the gazebo
and leans provocatively up against the well.

The gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the woman
and propositions her.  She smiles, touches, and teases him. We
pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall.
Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's
body falls to the ground.  The camera pans up to the well-bucket,
where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands.

As time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles
away, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row-
housing grows up, covering the green ball.  The town becomes
dirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morning
sky.  Almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grim
coal-miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets on
their way to work.

The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter.  A rat appears.
Panning back up, the street is now empty.  A bell is heard
ringing, and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a corner
and into view.  Masked workers follow the cart.  One rings
the bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways and
load them into the cart.  The gutters and windowsills are now
full of rats.  Time advances again and the buildings become
deserted derelicts.  Their decaying timbers groan under the
weight.

A support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse.
Falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the
glowing green ball.  As the ball hits the ground, it is covered
over by rubble.

The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape
grows drier.  Sand blows all around, covering over everything.
As the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing but
desert.  In the distance we can see a group of people walking.


 CUT TO 

PEOPLE 
The people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen, carrying
futuristic laser-shovels over their shoulders.  They are led by
a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector.  As
he walks, his detector starts bleeping.  He points to a spot
on the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser-
shovels.

One of the workers finds something.


 WORKER 
                 Kuma!  Kuma!  Kuma!


The archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread-
driven shovel-sifter up to the spot.  The shovel-sifter digs
in and pulls up a large chunk of desert.  When the sand has
sifted out, we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machine's grip.
It is not glowing.  The machine swivels, and a native foreman
plucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifter's teeth.

As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly.
The foreman's hands turn green.  He looks at his green hands,
then he looks over to the archaeologist.  Suddenly the foreman's
entire body glows green, and crumbles into dust.

The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the
glowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust.


 DISSOLVE TO 

NEW YORK - AERIAL SHOT - DAY 
The camera comes down from high above the city.  The general
shape and outline of New York looks familiar, but as we get
closer we sense that something is different.  Fires are
burning in various locations below us, and intermittent
gunshots become audible as the narration begins.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Yeah, New York, big deal.  Scum-centre
                 of the world.


Moving down through the skyscrapers, the city gets dirtier and
slummier.  We pass a dead man hanging from a tenement clothesline.
Below us, scruffy children dodge traffic as they play gyro-ball
in the garbage-filled street.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 ... and now they're talking about
                 letting in low-lifes from other planets,
                 too.


Under the narration, the camera turns a corner and zooms down
through the roof of a parked taxicab.  It stops full frame on
the newspaper held in the cabdriver's hands.  A slow pan across
the front page reveals that the paper is the New York Times,
July 6, 2031

One headline reads: "400,000 Traffic Deaths Over Holiday Weekend".
Another reads: "Venus Declared 73rd State".
The camera stops on a headline reading: "Professor Discovers
Ancient Relic --- to be shown in N.Y. Museum".

There is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and
his beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case
containing the Loc-Nar.

A knocking is heard on the cab's window, and the driver throws
down the newspaper.


 YOUNG MAN                     (from outside)

                 You free?


 HARRY 
                 Yeah.  Get in.
 (V.O.)                  My name's Harry Canyon.  I drive
                 a cab.

He flips a switch which unlocks the rear door.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE CAB 
The young man climbs into the back seat and closes the door.
Harry's yellow Checker cab pulls out into traffic.  The
vehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic
chrome panels cut into the sides, and thicker, deeper bumpers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE CAB 
Harry slides open the plexiglass shields separating him from
his passenger.


 HARRY 
                 Where to, pal?


 YOUNG MAN 
                 The U.N. Building.


 HARRY 
                 The U.N. Building.  What a joke.
                 Used to be a nice place until they
                 turned it into low rent housing.
                 Now it's a dump.  I wouldn't live
                 there if you paid me.


He switches on the car radio.  The music plays as Harry's
cab passes various time-altered New York landmarks; a graffiti
-covered Empire State Building - windows all boarded up, a
decrepit Lincoln Centre, the marquis reading "Continuous Live
Sex Show, Also Inter-Planetary Mud-Wrestling", new ultra-tech
buildings crammed between half-destroyed Wall Street office
buildings, garbage everywhere.

Inside the cab, the YOUNG MAN pulls a gun out of his jacket,
sticks his arm through the opening in the plexi-glass shield,
and holds the gun to Harry's head.


 YOUNG MAN 
                 Okay sucker, hand over your cash,
                 now!


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 This city is really going to the
                 dogs.


Harry's foot stretches forward and pushes a footswitch.
A buzzing is heard, and the young man's body suddenly
dematerializes.  The gun which he held at Harry's head
falls to the seat beside HARRY, who picks it up and tosses it
into the glove compartment, beside all sorts of other futuristic
guns and weapons.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Stupid asshole.  Nobody touches
                 me unless I want 'em to.


CUT TO 

EXT. METROPOLITIAN MUSEUM - NIGHT 
The camera is close-up on the illustrated banner over the main
entrance.  The banner reads; "Treasures of the Loc-Nar - Coming
July 8th".

We pan down to the museum doors, as a man's body comes crashing
through the plate glass and sprawls forward, cut and bleeding.
It is the goateed professor from the desert.  His daughter
runs out behind him, ripping her clothes on the broken glass.


GIRL 
Father!


PROFESSOR 
Run!


The girl takes off down the museum stairs as men with laser
guns come out and start firing.  A fat, evil-looking man (RUDNICK)
bends down and grabs the professor's head, jerking it up.


RUDNICK (to henchmen)

He's dead.  Get the girl!


The girl, clothes torn, runs out into the street, just as
Harry's cab comes cruising by.  She runs alongside, pounding
on the window.


GIRL (to Harry)

Help me, please!!


A laser shot narrowly misses her and blasts Harry's side-mirror.
HARRY flips the switch, unlocking the passenger door, and waves
her in.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Normally my rule is "Don't
get involved", but something
about this dame got to me.


She dives in the back and HARRY floors it.  The cab screams
away as Laser-shots land all around.


GIRL (in shock, breathless)

The Loc-Nar ... they wanted
it ... but my father wouldn't
tell them ... now I'm the only
one ...


CUT TO 

HARRY 
HARRY (interupting)

Relax sister.  There's a cop
station up here.  You can ...


HARRY looks at her in the rear-view mirror.  The girl has fainted.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Just what I needed ... guess
I'm a sucker for a pretty face.


CUT TO 

POLICE STATION 
The police station is an all-metal building with no windows.
A plaque on thr front reads "N.Y. POLICE - 52nd DIVISION".

Harry's cab pulls up.  He gets out, carries the unconscious
GIRL up to the front door, and pushes a buzzer.


VOICE (over intercom)

Police.  Whaddya want?


HARRY 
I wanna report a murder.


VOICE (over intercom)

So what else is new?


HARRY 
You gonna let me in or what?


A buzzer sounds and the door slides open.  HARRY carries the
GIRL in and heads across the room toward the main desk.  As
he walks he passes cops using a strange metal detector/vaccuum
cleaner to suck dangerous weapons from a pair of suspects.  Piles
of weapons can be seen in the machine's transparent belly.


COP #1 
Okay, this guy's clean - next.


HARRY comes up to the front desk and starts to lay the girl
down in a chair.


DESK SERGEANT (to Harry)

Before you go any further pal, I
gotta tell you, it's cash up front.  A
thousand bucks a day for a full investigation.
Another thousand if the assailant is caught.
Got it?


HARRY 
Yeah thanks ...


He picks up the girl and turns to leave.


HARRY ... for nuthin'!


DESK SERGEANT (shouting after Harry)

You think you can do better?
Join one of the vigilante groups.
There's a list of 'em outside.


CUT TO 

EXT. POLICE STATION 
HARRY, carrying the GIRL, comes out of the police station, as
a patrol car screeches to a halt in front of him.  Two cops
emerge, dragging a green alien with four arms.


GREEN ALIEN 
I tell you I'm an American citizen.
I just lost my papers.


COP (to himself)

Goddamn illegal aliens.


HARRY heads toward his cab.


HARRY (V.O.) 
So here I was, stuck with this beautiful
girl.  I knew she was gonna be nuthin'
but trouble ...


He looks around at the sleazy neighbourhood.  Every doorway
and alley seems to have a rapist or thug lurking.


HARRY (V.O.) 
... but I didn't feel right just
leaving her for the sickos.  I
dunno, maybe I'm gettin' sentimental
or something ...


DISSOLVE TO 

INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT 
This futuristic bachelor pad is constructed entirely of brightly
coloured molden plastic.  Bowling trophies sit on a shelf
underneath a neon "Buweiser" clock.  The place is a mess.

HARRY carries the GIRL in, pushes the light button to "On",
and lays her down on the sofa.  As he takes off his jacket
he looks down at the unconscious figure - her clothes torn
in all the right places.  She moans and starts to come to.


GIRL 
Where am I?


HARRY 
My place ...


Walking over to a hi-tech plastic bar, HARRY pushes a button
and a machine pours and mixes a drink.  He hands the GIRL the
glass.  She sits up and drinks.


GIRL (looking at Harry)

They'd have killed me if it
wasn't for you.


HARRY 
What'd they want to snuff you
for?
